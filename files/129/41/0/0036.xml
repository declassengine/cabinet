CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 ZCP. (50) 18625th July, 1950CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE-GENEVA, JUNE-JULY 1950Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. The Thirty-Third Session of the International Labour Conference was held,in Geneva from 7th June to 1st July, inclusive. The Governing Body met on 2nd-3rd June, but, as it did not complete its work, a number of meetings were heldduring the Conference.Address to the Conference by the Minister of Labour2. I spent several days at the Conference and spoke in the debate on theDirector-General&apos;s report. My speech is reproduced as Appendix I to thismemorandum. The Minister of Labour and National Insurance, Northern Ireland(Major the Right Hon. Ivan Neill, M.P.), was also present for part of the session.President and Vice-Presidents3. On the proposal of the United Kingdom Government, the Hon. JagjivanRam, Minister of Labour, India, was elected President. The Vice-Presidents wereMr. Mohammad Nakhai, Government Delegate, Iran; Mr. Charles P. McCormick,Employers&apos; Delegate, United States; and Mr. Paul C. Finet, Workers&apos; Delegate,Belgium. The memberships of the various committees were distributed broadlyon a geographical basis, Sir Guildhaume Myrddin-Evans being elected Chairmanof the Committee on Equal Remuneration.The Director-General4. The Director-General, Mr. David Morse, was unfortunately unable toattend the Conference owing to illness.Composition of the conference. Delegates from 52 States Members attended the Conference. these included delegations from Indonesia and Viet Nam, which the Conference admitted to membership in the course of the session. As in previous years there were,unfortunately, a number of incomplete Delegations. As a result of the initiativetaken by the United Kingdom last year, the Federal German Republic were, forthe first time, represented at the Conference by a tripartite observer Delegation. Asimilar Delegation from Japan also attended, accompanied by a representative the Supreme Commander, Allied Powers.Chinese Representation6. The presence of a Delegation from Nationalist China was the occasion for the customary demonstration from the &quot; iron curtain&quot; countries. TheConference were engaged in electing their President when the Polish government representative, supported by his Czech and Hungarian colleagues, demanded theimmediate removal of the &quot; Kuomintang representatives,&quot; and announced that theywould take no further part in the proceedings until this was done. On a rulingby the Chairman that the matter was proper for consideration by the Credentials39071 b. 7Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1950
Committee, the Polish, Czech and Hungarian delegates left the conference hall.On the recommendation of the Credentials Committee, the Conference subsequentlytook note of the fact that two Governments continued to contend for authority inChina, and of the fact that the members of the International Labour Organisation. had not adopted a.unanimous attitude on that subject. It further took note that,* under the circumstances, the only solution was to recognise that the Governmentof the Chinese Republic had validly nominated representatives of that country tothe present session of the Conference. The Conference further emphasised theimportance attached by the I.L.O. to the effective participation in its work ofrepresentatives of the Governments, employers and workers of all peoples. ThePolish, Czech and Hungarian Delegations left Geneva before the Report of the credentials Committee on this question was adopted by the Conference. before leaving they sent a letter to the President announcing their intention to leave. Genevabecause of the conclusions reached by the Credentials Committee, and because ofwhat they regarded as undue delay in the consideration of the matter.Venezuelan Workers&apos; Delegate and Advisers7. The Credentials Committee considered a complaint on behalf of the confederation of Workers of Venezuela against the credentials of the VenezuelanWorkers&apos; Delegate and his advisers. In reaching a decision on this complaint, the credentials Committee reviewed the course of events in Venezuela since November1948, when the Venezuelan Government abrogated the National Constitution andsuspended a certain number of constitutional safeguards of importance inconnection with trade union activity. The Committee drew special attention to the dissolution by the Government in February 1949 of the Confederation of workers of Venezuela and of the federations and unions of workers affiliated to it. they considered, therefore, that the Workers&apos; Delegate and his Advisers were notappointed in accordance with Article 3 (5) of the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation, which requires that non-Government Delegates and advisersshall be appointed in agreement with the industrial organisations most representa-tive of employers and workpeople. Accordingly, they recommended that theConference should exclude the Delegate and his advisers. The VenezuelanGovernment Delegates defended their Governments action mainly on the groundthat it had been necessary to suppress the Confederation of Workers of Venezuelabecause (it was alleged) it had been engaging in illegal political activity in connivancewith the agents of international communism.The Conference decided by a vote of 95 against 4 (the Venezuelan Delegation)with 50 abstentions not to admit the Venezuelan Workers&apos; Delegate and his advisers.General8. While much useful work was accomplished during the session, the Con-ference did not arouse quite the same degree of interest or produce quite the samespirit of active co-operation which has been evident in recent years. The absenceof the Director-General and the fact that only one Recommendation was down for final discussion may have contributed to a certain slackening of concentration.It must also be admitted, however,- that a certain spirit of impatience was evidentat some points in the discussion.Work of the 1950 Session9. I shall be communicating to my colleagues in due course the usual white paper containing a detail account of the Conference proceedings. In the mean-time, I append the following brief notes on some of the principal subjects discussed.Finance10. The Conference adopted a net expenditure budget for 1951 of $5,973,789as compared with $5,983,526 for 1950. After making allowance for balancesavailable from previous years, the amount to be provided by Member States in1951 is $5,836,865 16, of which the United Kingdom share is $804,120-23. TheUnited States Congress have not yet removed the existing ceiling on the UnitedStates contribution. A position has, however, been reached which enabled theUnited States Government representatives not to oppose a scale of contributions for 1951 providing for an assessment of the United States at the rate of 25 per cent,as against 22 per cent, in respect of the 1950 budget.   A resolution to assess the
remaining contributions on the basis of the existing United Nations scale, whichwould have raised the United Kingdom assessment to 15-48 per cent., receivedwidespread support. Representations by the United Kingdom Delegation, however,resulted in a compromise, and the scale of contributions for 1951, which was finallyadopted by the Conference, provided for a percentage contribution from the UnitedKingdom at the rate of 13-60, as opposed to 12-58 for 1950 and 13-21 for 1949.The question of a permanent scale of contributions will be further considered nextyear and, with this in mind, it is important that progress should be made with the adjustment of the United Nations scale to secure a reasonable assessment of theUnited Kingdom share.Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value11. This item was on the Agenda for first discussion, and my colleagues willrecall that in CP. (50) 117 I put forward proposals as to the line which the UnitedKingdom Government Delegates should be instructed to pursue. These proposals were accepted by the Cabinet, subject to certain qualifications, on 6th June (CM.(50) 35th Conclusions, Minute 1). We were narrowly defeated in committee onour proposal to take our. own text as a basis for discussion, and thereafter pro-ceeded on the basis of proposing amendments to the text prepared by the Inter-national Labour Office. The resulting text is not wholly satisfactory from our point of view. We did, however, succeed in securing important modifications tothe original Office text, and I am by no means dissatisfied with the progress made.The text will now be used as a basis for further consultation with governments, andwe shall have the opportunity of pressing for further modifications at that stage.I shall, therefore, be reporting more fully to my colleagues in due course and putting forward my suggestions as to our future line of approach.12. A decision as to the form the regulations should take was postponed untilthe next session of the Conference, although it was agreed that the provisions dealing with detailed methods of application (as opposed to the general principle)should, in any case, take the form of a Recommendation and not of a Convention.13. The stress which was laid by the United Kingdom Government on the close bearing of equal pay upon social development generally seems to have taken the United Kingdom workers&apos; representatives by surprise. I gather that we arelikely to hear more of this from the T.U.C.Industrial Relations14. A first discussion took place on two proposed Recommendations on thesubject of collective agreements and conciliation and arbitration. These Recommen-dations are intended to supplement the freedom of association Convention of 1948and the Convention on the application of the principles of the right to organiseand to bargain collectively, which was adopted by the Conference last year. Themain difficulty from the United Kingdom point of view is that a number of ques-tions with which these two new Instruments deal are, in this country, normally theresponsibility of employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations. More particularly, collec-tive agreements in this country, contrary to the practice existing in most othercountries, are not enforceable at law. A broad measure of general agreement was,however, secured and I have no doubt that it will be possible to secure the introduc-tion of further improvements before the Recommendations are finally adoptednext year.Vocational Training15. The Conference had before it the text of a proposed Recommendation onthe Vocational Training of Adults, including the Disabled, which had been pre-pared by a preparatory tripartite technical conference which was held lastJanuary-February under the chairmanship of Sir Harold Wiles, one of the UnitedKingdom Government Delegates to the present session of the Conference. TheRecommendation was adopted unanimously by the Conference. The terms of theRecommendation are generally in accordance with the practice in this country, andI have little doubt that we shall be able to accept it.Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery in Agriculture16.   The Conference held a first discussion on a proposed Convention and recommendation on this subject. Conclusions were adopted as a basis for further39071 B 2
consultation with Governments with a view to the adoption of a Convention and recommendation at the next Session of the Conference. The Delegation was successful in securing the suppression or modification of certain features in theproposals submitted to the Conference by the International Labour Office whichwould have created difficulties for the United Kingdom. The Conclusions as they now stand are generally acceptable.Full Employment17. This subject was not before the Conference as a separate item on itsAgenda. The Conference had, however, before it two reports on the subject: first,the report of the group of experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the united nations, and secondly, a report prepared by the International Labour Office in response to a resolution adopted by the Conference last year. The InternationalLabour Organisation had been asked by the United Nations for their comments onthe report of the group of experts. Much of the debate on the Director-General&apos;sreport was devoted to the subject of full employment, and, in addition, a compre-hensive resolution was presented by the United Kingdom Workers&quot; Delegate, whichwas, in fact, intended to embody the views of the Organisation on the action whichshould be taken against unemployment.18. The Resolution in the form in which it was finally adopted is reproduced in Appendix II. It was perhaps unfortunate that matters of this complexity shouldhave been dealt with in the form of a Resolution which leaves little room for detailed argument or precise clarification. In any case, it proved impossible tosecure unanimous agreement. In a debate which was not always co-operative inspirit, the employers&apos; group proposed the deletion of those parts of the resolution which set out specific measures to be taken against unemployment. They explainedthat they did this because many of these measures Were, in their view, extremelycontroversial, and because they appeared to imply an extreme type of plannedeconomy which would inevitably lead to authoritarianism and to which thereforethey were firmly opposed. A number of Governments, including those of the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom, spoke in favour of the Resolution, which was finally carried by 96 to 30 with 13 abstentions.G.

APPENDIX IAddress to the Conference by the Minister of LabourMy first word this morning must be to join with other speakers in expressing the sympathy and concern of my Government and myself at the absence owing toillness of the Director-General. During the two years since he was appointed,David Morse has not spared himself in his work for the I.L.O. Not only has hedevoted himself unceasingly to the problems of policy and of administration with1 which the Director-General of this great and developing organisation is constantlyI faced a sufficiently heavy burden for any one man to carry, but, in addition, heI has carried the standard of the I.L.O. to over a score of countries and renewedI direct contacts between those countries and the Office. We are glad to know thatI the rest which he has been compelled to take has already resulted in a definiteI improvement. I want to send him our best wishes for his early and completeI recovery, to assure Mr. and Mrs. Morse of our sympathy at this time, and to sayI how greatly we look forward to the day when he will be able to resume his placeI in the Organisation.May I, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, welcome the LinkedI States of Indonesia to this Conference and to say how pleased I am that in future] we shall have with us representatives from that country to take part in our deliberations.The debate in the Conference on the Report of the Director-General is pre-eminently the occasion on which we should pause for a moment to look back uponthe landmarks along the path which we have trodden, and summon our collectiveexperience and wisdom to plan the course which lies ahead. This is no occasion for sectional argument, or for self-congratulation. This is the time when we should,above all things, remember the essential unity of the organisation of which we are members, refresh ourselves at the great traditions of the past, and dedicate ourselvesanew to the grave and growing tasks which lie ahead.An international body is not a machine. It is an organism which, if it is toJ live, must grow, must develop and must adapt itself to changing circumstances.I But this process of living growth is not a natural process; it must be guided by1 all the foresight, all the courage and, above all, by the accumulated wisdom of the] members of the corporate body.The I.L.O. is something more than the International Labour Code, more than   the practical assistance which it can render to its members, more even than theI provisions of its Constitution. Its basic strength rests upon the common socialj consciousness which it creates. But this social consciousness, once created, canI only be effective if it moves as an active spirit throughout the countries of the world;1 if, working through those who attend our meetings, it serves as a leaven to raise! and transmute world standards of thought and action in the social field.One of the most important developments during recent years has been thel extension of the Organisation^ regional activities. I say extension, advisedly, forj the system of regional conferences dates back to before the war, and the activitiesi of the Organisation have, since its inception, been of worldwide scope. The Unitedj Kingdom Government welcomes this development, since it is only upon a closej assessment of the problems and the needs of particular areas that we can basestandards which are, at once, realisable and progressive. It is only thus that theOrganisation can frame its plans for technical advice and assistance which are properly related to the needs of those whom they are designed to serve.I trust, however, that it will never be forgotten that this Organisation is, in essence, a world organisation. Its strength must remain, as it has always been,based upon world standards. Similarly, I trust there will be no tendency to regarding regional conferences as something approximating in practice, if not constitutionally,I to regional sessions of the General Conference. I am quite certain that the develop-ment of any such conception of decentralisation would be disastrous to the futureof the I.L.O. The Conference and the Governing Body, assisted and reinforced by special regional knowledge and experience, must always remain fully responsiblefor planning the scope and balance of the Organisation^ activities within the frame-work of its general policy.The Director-General has rightly stressed in his Report the I.L.O. must beprepared and equipped to meet its growing responsibilities. So far as the UnitedKingdom Government is concerned, it will give to this Organisation its fullest andmost energetic support in the future, as in the past. However, when addressingthe Conference last year, I said that, in my view, an international organisation such
as this can only help individual countries to help themselves. It cannot do thework for them. The I.L.O. can, indeed, lay down standards. It is for us, the states members, to implement them. The Organisation can lay its plans for furnishingadvice and technical assistance. It is for us, the States Members, so to co-operate with the Organisation as to ensure that this advice and assistance is readily avail-able; and that, when rendered, it is made fully effective. The operational pro-gramme of the Organisation carries with it practical responsibilities and practical problems for all countries, whether as contributors or beneficiaries. We mustshoulder these responsibilities, we must grapple with these problems so that,working through us, the Organisation itself may fulfil its mission for the benefitof us all.I would like now to turn to certain of the major practical problems raised inthe reports which are before you. First, however, let me say a few words on thesubject of the development of labour and social policy in British non-metropolitan territories. During the past year my Government, after full consultation with theGovernments of the British non-metropolitan territories, has ratified the five Con-ventions concerning non-metropolitan territories, adopted at the 1947 Session ofthe Conference.In the far-reaching Convention on social policy in non-metropolitan territories,it is laid down that all possible steps shall be taken effectively to interest andassociate the peoples of non-metropolitan territories in the framing and executionof measures of social progress, preferably through their own elected representativeswhere appropriate and possible. Naturally, we are anxious to promote this develop-ment, which entirely accords with our aim to guide colonial territories to responsible government in conditions that ensure to the people a fair standard of living and freedom from aggression from any quarter. Since the war, all but a few territorieshave received new Constitutions giving a much greater measure of responsibility to the unofficial or elected group in the Legislative Council or House of Assembly.Before leaving the subject of non-metropolitan territories I would like tomake a brief reference to the subject of trade unionism in the colonies. The unions,of which there are some one thousand or more in existence in the colonies, do nothave, as did their predecessors in the early days of European trade unionism, tofight for recognition. It is the aim of every colonial Government to facilitate and develop in every possible way the exercise of the rights to organise and to bargaincollectively, by employers and workers alike, in accordance with the principles which are accepted and recognised by all democratic communities.One of the problems which is uppermost in our minds at the present sessionof the Conference is the problem of action against unemployment. It is hardlynecessary for me to remind the Conference of the very high importance which we attach to full employment in the United Kingdom. Full employment is basic tothe kind of society which we are striving to establish for our people a society inwhich all who wish to work and have the necessary skill and aptitude are ableto secure the employment for which they are suited. His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave, in fact, accepted as one of their primary aims and responsibilities the main-tenance of a high and stable level of employment. Since the war we have givenproof of our intentions by the financial and economic policies which we havepursued.I should remind the Conference, however, that full employment, in the UnitedKingdom is dependent on the maintenance of a high level of international trade.At the moment the greatest danger to our full employment policy lies in our balanceof payments difficulties. Even when our immediate difficulties are overcome we,like all other countries heavily dependent on international trade, may find thesuccess of our domestic full employment policies threatened if substantial unemploy-ment should develop elsewhere in the world and spread itself by the familiar routeof falling demand for exports, consequential balance of payments difficulties, and generally shrinking international trade. That is why we are so deeply interestedin the action taken by other nations to maintain full employment and in any proposals for international action designed to maintain world trade at a high leveland to prevent the spread of unemployment from one country to another via its international trading relationships.Our economic interests interlock at every stage with those of other nations who are also pursuing domestic full employment policies or who have a significantinterest in international trade. As one of the world&apos;s greatest trading countries and as one of the largest markets, we realise our own responsibilities for pursuingpolicies that will not hamper the efforts of others to maintain high levels ofemployment and economic well-being.
While the group of experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the united nations have confined their attention to unemployment arising from deficiency of demand, the report on &quot; Action against Unemployment &quot; has surveyed the wider field of unemployment arising from all causes.I am therefore particularly glad to note the emphasis which is laid on the needfor efficient organisation of the employment market, and for a well-developedemployment exchange service. The industrial pattern is not static, nor should itbe static. For instance, changes in demand, or new and improved methods, may call for different numbers or different kinds of workers. Even where technicalchanges are not involved, the activity of one industry or undertaking may declinewhile another expands.The report rightly emphasises the importance of obtaining adequate statisticsabout employment and unemployment. It is equally important, however, that such information should be appropriate not only for general economic planning, butfor day-to-day action. For this, the employment exchange service must always bein possession of accurate up-to-date information, both about vacancies, current and prospective, and about the workers unemployed or likely to be unemployed. Anessential point, however, is the care and sympathy with which each individual case is personally handled. An employment exchange service must never be regardedmerely as a machine. Its ultimate success depends upon the quality of the relation-ship between the staff of the service and the public.I am also pleased to see that the report attaches such importance to statisticsand the development of an adequate economic information service. Reliable, up-to-date information about current economic movements, the employment situation,and the state of the labour market, must clearly form the basis of any effectivenational policy for maintaining full employment. I recognise the importance ofthese factors for action on the international plane. In the United Kingdom, alarge volume of statistical information about every phase of economic activity isregularly collected and applied. My own Department, the Ministry of Labour and national Service, carries out detailed monthly surveys of the general manpowersituation based on statistical returns from employers and reports from the employ-ment exchanges. In this way, we are able to keep the employment situation under constant review, and can detect promptly any adverse change in the trend ofemployment which may call for correction. We are thus able to ensure that the plans drawn up by the Government for investment and production generally are adequate to maintain full employment in future periods and are not beyond thetotal manpower resources likely to be available.Before I leave the question of statistics, I should like to refer briefly to thequestion of the percentage rate of unemployment. Provided it is based on accuratefigures and its coverage is sufficiently wide, such an index provides the most con-venient means of measuring the degree of unemployment in the national economy.The Report of the United Nations experts has suggested that Governments should adopt full employment targets expressed in terms of unemployment percentages.If, however, such figures are to be used as the basis for international action, it isclearly of the first importance that they should as nearly as possible be comparable.Appendix III of the report on &quot; Action against Unemployment &quot; shows that thereis a serious lack of international comparability in the figures at present produced by the different countries. I understand that the Governing Body already has thisquestion under consideration, and I hope that the I.L.O. may be able to make some contribution towards a solution of the problem.Allied to the question of employment is the problem of surplus population andmigration. For many reasons political, economic and social this is one of themore pressing of the practical problems with which the world is faced to-day. many countries have larger populations than they can support in full employment. many other countries can only attain full economic development and the full utilisation of their resources in the interests of their people by substantially increasing theirworking population. It js a task of statesmanship national and international tomarry these complementary needs. The problem is a constant preoccupation tomany international organisations the United Nations, the O.E.E.C., and particu-larly the I.L.O. Only a few weeks ago the Foreign Ministers of France, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom, meeting in London, described the excess of population from which several countries in Western Europe are suffering as one ofthe most important elements in the difficulty of the world. They called for a further review of the activities in this field with a view to determining whether there areadditional approaches which can be undertaken.   Amongst other international
organisations, the I.L.O. has, quite rightly, been accorded the leading role in dealing with this problem, and has already taken certain action. TheConference last year adopted a Convention and other instruments which, in due course, will prove of great value. A Preliminary Migration Conference was heldhere in Geneva last month under the aegis of the I.L.O. which was productive of much useful discussion and many fruitful suggestions. But much more needs tobe done, especially in the field of action and operation, and needs to be donequickly, for the problem does not brook of delay. It is, however, for the Govern-ments first to decide what they want done and whether they will provide thenecessary finance to enable swift, strong and imaginative action to be taken. WhenGovernments have taken these decisions, I am confident that the I.L.O. will beable to carry through this immensely important job as they have carried throughother equally difficult tasks in the past.In a free society, full employment cannot be achieved by the action of Govern-ments alone. The ultimate and lasting success of a full employment policy dependsalso upon the efforts of employers and workers in all sections of the national economy, and the extent to which they, in co-operation with Governments, succeed in raising and maintaining the standard of production. For this reason, it is properthat the Director-General has accorded so much prominence in his Report to thequestion of industrial productivity. He has rightly approached the question of productivity from a broad angle.I would like to devote the few minutes at my disposal to some general remarkson one particular aspect the human factor. A constant devotion to the improve-ment of managerial techniques and industrial methods is, of course, essential toproductivity. Equally essential is a full and a fair day&apos;s work. But individualproductivity cannot be considered in terms of physical effort or technical applicationalone. It is a problem which is psychological as well as material. It can only be tackled on the basis of full co-operation between Governments, employers and workers.When we hear the word &quot; incentives &quot; we generally think of wage incentiveschemes. But the question of &quot; incentives,&quot; incentives to productivity, goes verymuch deeper than &quot; wages.&quot; What, in fact, are the springs which, under full employment, in a free society, release the full measure of our energy and resource?The answer is, I think, two-fold, &quot; knowledge &quot; and &quot; a sense of purpose.&quot; first of all knowledge, knowledge of current economic facts. It is the Government whoknows or should know these facts. It is for Governments, I suggest, to make certain that these facts are readily available in an accurate and intelligible form,not only to Government officials and to the leaders of employers&apos; and workers&apos;organisations, but, with the co-operation of those organisations, to the individualemployer, and to the worker on the shop floor.Then there is a second kind of knowledge technical knowedge. Here again,I suggest that Governments have the responsibility of doing all in their power toensure adequate provision for scientific and industrial research, and for promoting a full interchange of ideas between those engaged in research and those, both employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives, who have the practical job of increasingindustrial productivity. There must also be means whereby the results of technicalresearch and technical inquiries, whether at home or in other countries, are rapidlydisseminated to all those who can profit by them.Economic and technical knowledge is not, however, enough in itself. I spokejust now of a need for &quot; a sense of purpose,&quot; and I would like at this point toconsider more particularly the workers&apos; side of the case. In my own country, thetrade union movement, I am proud to say, has played, and is playing, an active partin studying the problems of productivity. The same is, I know, true of the tradeunion movements in other countries I speak of movements that are free to repre-sent and uphold, independently of Governments, the views and interests of theirconstituent members.I am not sure that it is always realised what a significant and far-reachingdevelopment is this positive attitude to productivity on the part of the trade unions.In many cases it involves a re-orientation of traditional policies, and the abandon-ment of attitudes formed in the unhappy days of heavy unemployment. this development is possible only if the trade unions have the facts on which to judgethat productivity has a &quot;purpose &quot; a purpose from the worker&apos;s own point of view;that a policy of increased productivity sanely and equitably applied is essential tothe maintenance of full employment itself.
When I speak of the trade unions, I am not speaking only of their leaders, but of the rank and file. The movement towards larger industrial units and morecentralised control tends to widen the gap between management and the shop floor.Even with the knowledge which the worker acquires through membership of hisunion, it is often difficult for him to understand the nature of the contribution whichhe himself is making, unless he feels that he is part of a team, and that his own views,his own special knowledge and experience, are taken into account. Many matters which have a direct bearing on increased productivity are already dealt with throughthe normal machinery of collective bargaining.There is, however, the need for joint consultation between management and workers over a wider field of common concern. That is why, in my country, theGovernment have taken active steps to encourage the development of joint con-sultation in industry, particularly at factory level. We believe that, if such con-sultation is to be successful, it should be entered into voluntarily, and the formand scope of such consultation should be settled by agreement between the two sides of the industry concerned. In fact, the majority of the national organisations of employers and workers in our main industries have concluded agreements ofthis kind.I believe that this question of productivity is but one instance of the challengethrown out by the problems of to-day to the intelligence and adaptability of demo-cratic institutions. The ways of freedom may sometimes be more laborious thanthe swift and drastic solutions of authoritarianism. But we believe that ourachievements are more durable, just because they are based upon free choice and personal conviction.I would like to comment on a number of the other important technical subjects on your agenda, but in the time at my disposal, I must confine myself to one only,the question of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. This is a highly complex and controversial subject; the Conference will,I am sure, devote its efforts to reaching conclusions that are both constructive and,at the same time, realistic and workable.Equal remuneration cannot, in my view, be considered as an abstract concept-tiori. It must be viewed first of all against the widest possible background of social policy, as well as economic and financial conditions. The real living standards ofmen and women workers alike depend upon the maintenance of the financial stability of their own and other countries. This is a matter of special concern to countries such as my own which have already established and aim to maintain avery high level of social services.I would also remind the Conference that the relationship between the remunera-tion of men and women is but one constituent element of the wage and salary structure. Governments cannot, I suggest, be expected to take positive measuresto secure the observance of one particular principle of remuneration which theywould not be prepared to adopt in regard to remuneration generally.Finally, there is the crucial question of definition. I trust that the conference will be fully alive to the dangers of any formula which would have the effect of introducing an undue rigidity into national wage and salary structures, and whichwould unduly limit the flexibility of approach which is essential to the operationof collective bargaining.In the course of my opening remarks, I suggested that this debate was, above all, the occasion when we should remember the essential unity of the Organisationof which we are Members. That is a note on which I would like to close. In1944, the 26th Session of the Conference adopted the Declaration of Philadelphiawhich is now embodied in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisa-tion. It is my hope and belief that this Conference, and its many successors, willbe able in all truth to reaffirm, not only as an article of belief, but as a prime motiveof action, that &quot; the principles set forth in this Declaration are fully applicable toall peoples everywhere.&quot; May we never forget that this can only be realised if we,the States Members, all we who know the I.L.O. and participate in its work,consciously frame our policies and direct our efforts to that end. The world isrent by faction, and cleft by division, cultural, political, economic and social.Community of purpose within the framework of the I.L.O. is indeed but one aspect of a wider responsibility to our fellow men. Let us therefore set ourselves within this Organisation and in all our dealings to the task of repairing and shaping anewthe seamless fabric of civilisation and world peace.39071 c
APPENDIX IIResolution on Action Against UnemploymentRecalling the solemn obligation of the International Labour Organisation under   Ithe Declaration of Philadelphia to further among nations of the world programmes which will achieve full employment and rising living standards; andHaving before it the report on Action Against Unemployment prepared by theInternational Labour Office in response to the Resolution concerning unemploy-ment adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 32nd Session held in geneva in 1949; andHaving before it the report on National and International Measures for full employment prepared by a group of experts appointed by the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations and referred by the Economic and Social Council to the interested specialised agencies for their serious consideration and detailed examina-tion, together with a summary of the discussions on this report which took placein the Economic and Employment Commission and in the Economic and social council; and being in agreement with the definition of full employment, given in the united nations experts&apos; report, as &quot; a situation in which unemployment does not exceed the minimum allowances that must be made for the effects of frictional and seasonalfactors ;&quot;The Conference, while noting that in the majority of countries there is lessunemployment today than in most of the inter-war period, recognises that (1)unemployment still involves serious hardship to considerable numbers of workers,and (2) the fear that mass unemployment may develop still results in a feeling ofinsecurity for all workers;The Conference recognises further that in many countries underemployment,with consequent low productivity of labour, is an even more serious obstacle to theimprovement of present low living standards;The Conference believes that mass unemployment and underemployment aresocial evils which can be eradicated without prejudice to the fundamental freedomsof individuals by appropriate policies, to the development of which the united nations, the various specialised agencies, Governments, and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations each have vital contributions to make.The Conference accordingly draws the attention of the United Nations, the specialised agencies, Governments, and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations tothe following types of action which, it considers, should be vigorously pursuedfor the purpose of eliminating these evils:1. All countries which have not already done so should establish, as rapidly as national conditions allow, systems of unemployment benefits and allowancesadequate to enable involuntarily unemployed workers to maintain at least a sociallyacceptable minimum standard of living;2. All Governments should ensure that their economic information servicesand their administrative machinery are adequate and, in particular, sufficientlyflexible, and that adequate statistics of employment, unemployment and under -employment are produced, to enable them to develop and to implement effectivefull employment policies, bearing in mind that the success of such policies will depend greatly on action being taken in the right directions and at an early stage in order to offset adverse movements in particular sectors of the economy before they develop into a depression affecting the economy as a whole; and technical assistance should be made available to Governments in need of it for setting up thenecessary governmental machinery and the statistical services required to meet inso far as possible the I.L.O. standards for statistics of employment, unemployment and underemployment;3. In seeking to achieve or maintain, by domestic measures, economic and social conditions, and especially a level of aggregate demand, conducive to themaintenance of full employment, Governments should pay particular attention to (a) the importance of achieving at the same time such basic social objectivesas continuous economic growth, steady advance in standards of living and social progress, the promotion of which requires in particularefficient and flexible production, freedom of workers to organise, to bargain collectively and to change jobs, an equitable distribution of incomes, and a balance of investment, consumption and leisure adapted to the requirements of the particular community;
(b) the need to adapt the continuing operations and programmes of Govern-ment to contribute to the maintenance of adequate aggregate demand,(for example, by variations in expenditures and revenues), and to correctbasic economic unbalances or maladjustments, (for example, in wage-cost-price relationships); the dangers of inflation as well as of deflation;the need for prompt Government action in case significant declines inemployment occur; the desirability of having in existence arrange-ments which can operate promptly to mitigate the effects of suchdeclines, (for example, unemployment compensation, flexible taxsystems and price or income supports to especially vulnerable groups)and to facilitate needed adjustments in prices and production; measuresto stimulate activity in particular industries or particular districts; andthe advance preparation of further anti-depression measures, (forexample, large public works programmes, possibly designed to be putinto effect automatically under specified economic conditions);(c) the question of how to facilitate economic and social relationships amongemployers, workers and other groups in the economy, so as to achievecontinuing full employment and at the same time to maintain flexibilityand efficiency in production and to avoid inflation;4. An indispensable part of the action which should be taken to produceeconomic and social conditions conducive to full employment is action to ensurethat workers can secure the jobs to which they are best suited, through the develop-ment of employment services, of specific measures to promote mobility of labour,of training and retraining facilities and of improved recruitment policies; consider a-tion should also be given to the possibility of encouraging investment in depressed areas from which it may be economically or socially undesirable to move workers;5. In countries where the major problem of employment and living standardsarises from a shortage of capital, of capital equipment and of other resourcescomplementary to labour, Governments should pay particular attention to the needfor action along the following lines:(a) measures to encourage underemployed agricultural workers to move tosuch additional land as can be economically brought under cultivationand to assist where necessary in providing them with the necessary equipment, housing and social services;(b) the promotion of industrial development by action designed to encouragenew undertakings and to increase the supply of capital equipment andof industrial and managerial skills; in encouraging capital formation,particular attention should be paid to the possibility of increasingdomestic capital formation by stimulating savings and channelling them into productive investment, by mobilising and training existing idle orunderemployed manpower whose services can be used to carry outvarious projects of capital construction, by encouraging the expansion ofthe domestic production of materials which are most likely to constitutebottlenecks hindering the whole programme of capital construction, andby encouraging the immediate introduction in industries and agricultureof those improvements in methods of production and organisation which require little capital expenditure, so that resources may be released for capital formation without undue reduction in output for current consumption; where countries wish to borrow capital from abroad,particular attention should be paid to the creation of conditions whichwill attract such capital while promoting welfare and maintaining fullnational independence;(c) the promotion of the establishment and location of particular industries, andof facilities for power, transport and credit, in such a way as to fit in with prospective developments in the geographical distribution of avail-able labour, the technological unemployment of handicraft workers,and the release of workers from agriculture as more efficient techniquesof production are introduced; .(d) careful consideration of the inter-relationships of population growth,economic development and standards of living;6. Since in any particular country the maintenance of full employment andthe raising of living standards depend not only on such action as can be taken by
the country concerned but also on the policies followed by other countries,Governments should consider taking action individually and through the appro-priate international organisations (a) to ensure that fluctuations in world trade are not such as to cause the spread of depressions from one country to another; to this end each country should maintain the high levels of employment conducive to high and expanding levels of purchasing power; and should, where itis possible, avoid employment or other measures which would havethe effect of creating balance-of-payments difficulties for other countries;and further in this connection consideration should be given to the adequacy of the resources of the specialised agencies concerned to takethe action required to meet difficulties caused by downturns in importexpenditures resulting from declines in employment; measures shouldalso be taken to prevent or moderate pronounced fluctuations in theinternational prices of the world&apos;s leading commodities at levels fairboth to producers and consumers;(b) to encourage the expansion of international trade and the most productiveinternational division of labour by the progressive reduction of trade barriers, always with due consideration for conditions which as a resultof unforeseen developments may cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers, and particularly for manpower problems which may. . arise in periods of transition to less restrictive patterns of world trade;(c) to increase the opportunities for more productive employment and so toraise the living standards in under-developed countries by expanding the flow of capital and technical assistance into these countries, andby encouraging international migration by means of an effective and progressive reduction in the restriction on immigration existing indifferent countries, starting&apos; with restrictions of a non-economiccharacter.The Conference places on record the determination of the International LabourOrganisation to play its full part within its sphere of competence in the planning and carrying out of action along these lines. It expresses the hope that theGovernments will reaffirm their obligations assumed under the Declaration ofPhiladelphia and Article 55 of the United Nations Charter to promote and achievefull employment and conditions of economic and social progress conducive torising living standards. It calls attention to the possibility of considering theadvantages of an international labour Convention covering this subject, butexpresses the belief that the importance of the subject requires that each Govern-ment on its own initiative and at the earliest date practicable implement its obligations to accept full employment as a primary objective of social and economic policy and establish or designate appropriate national machinery responsible forstudying continuously the evolution of the employment situation and for making recommendations concerning the action to be taken to maintain full employment;and that all Governments, where appropriate through the United Nations, theEconomic and Social Council, the specialised agencies and other inter-governmental organisations, co-operate by co-ordination of the activities of all inter-governmental organisations interested in this field and by any other practicable means to promotefull employment measures on an international basis.The Conference requests the Governing Body of the International LabourOffice-(1) to take from time to time such further action as it may consider effective and appropriate to promote the solution of those problems of full employment and rising living standards which fall within the specialprovince of the International Labour Organisation;(2) to communicate this resolution to the United Nations for consideration bythe Economic and Social Council at its 11th Session;(3) to communicate this resolution to all specialised agencies which have responsibility for taking specific action in the fields with which it deals;(4) to co-operate closely with the United Nations, the other specialised agencies and other inter-governmental organisations concerned in furthering international action designed to contribute to the achieve-inent of full employment and rising living standards.
