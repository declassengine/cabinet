IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(50) 156 COPY NO.   Jq^3RD JULY, 1950CABINETFORMOSAMemorandum by the Minister of state the following is a statement on the present position in regard toFormosa.    I should be glad to know whether the Cabinet approve the recom-mendations contained in paragraph 7.Introduction2. In his statement on Korea on 2 7th June President Truman declaredthat &quot;the attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt that Communism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations and will now use armed invasion and war.   It has defied the orders of the security council of the United Nations issued to preserve international peace.    Inthese circumstances the occupation of Formosa by Communist forces wouldbe a direct threat to the security of the Pacific area and to the UnitedStates forces performing their lawful and necessary functions in that area.Accordingly I have ordered the Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Formosa.As a corollary of this action I am calling upon the Chinese Government on Formosato cease all air and sea operations against the mainland.    The Seventh Fleetwill see that this is done.    The determination of the future status of   Formosamust await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations. &quot;Soviet and Chinese reactions to United States policy towards Formosa3. Soviet reactions first appeared in the form of a leader in Pravdaon 28th June and made the following main points.    The action of the UnitedStates constituted &quot;direct acts of aggression&quot; against the Chinese and KoreanRepublics.    There was no United Nations authority for the steps announced by president Truman.   A provocative advance of troops of the puppet government ofSouth Korea had led to the outbreak of military operations on the territory of korea.   No hint was given of Soviet intentions.Chinese reactions were given in a declaration on Formosa by theMinister for Foreign Affairs, Chou En-lai, made in Peking on 28th June.The full text of this declaration is attached as Annex A.   The main points were that the Central People&apos;s Government of China deemed that president truman&apos;s declaration of 27th June and the actions of the United States Governmentconstituted &quot;armed aggression against Chinese territory and complete sabotageof the United Nations Charter&quot;.   The fact that Formosa belonged to Chinacould never be altered.   The Chinese people would definitely be able to driveout the American aggressors and recover Formosa.    The declaration went on to denounce American imperialism in Asia and appealed to the oppressed peoples of the world and particularly of the East to resist American imperialist aggression and to struggle for national independence.    There was no reference in the Chinesedeclaration to British imperialism;   nor was there any reference in it to Malaya,Hong Kong or to British action in support of South Korea.-1-

His Maj&apos;esty1 s&apos;Government1 s attitude on the status of Formosa4. His Majesty&apos;s/Government&apos;s views on the status of Formosa were set out in the reply given by the Foreign Secretary on 15th February, 1950,to an enquiry by the Chief Justice, Hong Kong.    This reply was as follows:&quot;In 1943 Formosa was part of the territory of the JapaneseEmpire and His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that Formosa is still de jurepart of that territory.   On 1st December, 1943, at Cairo, President Roosevelt,Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Prime Minister Churchill declared that allthe territories that Japan had stolen from the Chinese, including Formosa, shouldbe restored to the Republic of China.    On 26th July, 1945, at Potsdam, the heads of the Governments of the United States of America and the UnitedKingdom and the Republic of China reaffirmed that the &quot;terms of the CairoDeclaration should be carried out&quot;.    (The Potsdam Declaration was sub-sequently adhered to by the Soviet Union).    On 25th October, 1945, as a resultof an Order issued on the basis of consultation and agreement between theAllied Powers concerned, the Japanese Forces in Formosa surrendered toChiang Kai-shek.    Thereupon, with the consent of the Allied Powers,administration of Formosa was undertaken by the Government of the republic of China.   At present, the actual administration of the island is by Wu Kuo-cheng,who has not, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, repudiated the superior authority of the Nationalist Government. &quot;Implications of the United States policy towards Formosa5. The far reaching implications of the new United States policy towards Formosa on our whole relations with China and on our own far eastern policy are being studied separately, and it would be premature to try to assess them on the information so far available.    It is, however, necessary toconsider immediately what policy line we should adopt if the question of our attitude towards United States policy in Formosa is raised in the debate onKorea in the House of Commons on Wednesday, 5th July, or subsequently inenquiries from the public or press.i. From the Chinese reactions briefly outlined in paragraph 2 aboveit-will be realised that whatever we say is likely to subject our presentdifficult relations with China to an even greater strain;   particularly would this be the case if we support American action or now restate our view that formosa is not Chinese territory.   Similarly, whatever we say may have repercussions in the United States, where failure on our part to express clearsupport might well leave us open to the charge of &quot;dragging our feet&quot;.    It would therefore seem advisable to make no statement unless the question is raised in the course of the debate.Recommendations(i) No statement should be made unless the question of our attitude to the American action in Formosa, and whether we support it or not,is definitely raised in such a way as to render some answer unavoidable.(ii) If, however, questions are raised (a) criticising American actionin Formosa on legal grounds and (b) asking us whether we support itor not, and what our attitude etc.  is, answers might be given on thefollowing lines:-(a)    Criticism of United States action on legal groundsOne likely line of criticism runs as follows:   &quot;Formosais Chinese territory.    What right has the United States, when not-2-

apparently requested to do so by any Chinese Government, to say/that it is taking military command of affairs in Formosa, and that formosa would be protected against any attack from the People&apos;sGovernment of China by the American Seventh Fleet?&quot;The best answer to this criticism would be:   &quot;Formosa is not atpresent a territory under the sovereignty of China.    When the second world War broke out it was part of the Japanese Empire.    TheGreat Powers decided at Cairo on 1st December, 1943, that it shouldbe taken from Japan and restored to China, but, from the legalpoint of view, the Japanese sovereignty over Formosa must beextinguished by a peace treaty or some similar instrument.It is true that, in anticipation of such a provision in the peace treaty, the Chinese Government were permitted or invited toassume administration of Formosa, and they did so.   At present,however, they are in Formosa as an administering authority merely by the will of the Allies, and in matters relating to Japan, by allied arrangements, the United States Government take the lead.Therefore the United States Government were not wrong when they said that the ultimate status of Formosa had to be determined by a peace treaty or, in times of crisis, indicating that they would exercise a certain supreme control so far as Formosa is concerned. &quot;Another likely line of criticism is the following:      &quot;The UnitedStates purports to recognise the Nationalist Government as thede jure Government of China.    But it has peremptorily ordered theChinese Nationalist Government to cease all operations in the civil war which are conducted in its endeavour to recover Chineseterritory for the benefit of the Government which the United Statessays is the de jure Government, and against authorities which,in the view of the United States are mere usurpers, not recognised by the United States as a government at all. &quot;The answer to this question is difficult, because it is hard to reconcile this particular United States Order with the present UnitedStates recognition policy in China, and because it shows the UnitedStates treating the Chinese Nationalist Government practically as apuppet in their hands.    The best answer might be that, apart fromthe fact that this particular United States order, which the ChineseNationalists have accepted in principle,   is very beneficial to Britishinterests because it should put an end to attacks made on British ships,it can also be said that these Chinese operations were conducted fromFormosa, which the Chinese Nationalists at present only hold asadministrators at the invitation of the Allied Powers.Whether His Majesty&apos;s Government support United States policyAn answer might be given that His Majesty!s Government welcomeUnited States policy in Formosa in as much as it means that allNationalist sea and air operations directed against China from bases in Formosa are to cease.    This decision should bring to an endhostilities which have involved a senseless loss in Chinese lives and property.   It would also bring to an end the illegal Nationalistblockade of the China Coast and the mining of Chinese ports, whichhave caused loss of life and extensive damage to British mercantileand shipping interests.    The early resumption of normal,     -*peaceful trade with China should be facilitated as a result of themeasures taken.   In addition His Majesty&apos;s Government welcomethis policy since what the United States are doing is to ensure that,pending the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the finaldetermination of Formosa will not be prejudged by force.    Pending

the conclusion of such a treaty, it is necessary to take steps toensure that its administration is carried on in peaceful and orderly fashion and to prevent, if at all possible, theextension of hostilities to Formosa.   It is also necessaryto ensure that forces based on Formosa shall not engage in wantonattacks on the mainland.    The American declaration will, it ishoped, serve both objectives.The following further question may arise:(c)      &quot;Whether our support of the United States policy regardingFormosa implies any change in His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy towards China?The answer is &quot;No&quot;.    There has be,n no armed aggression against Formosa and Formosa is not at present part of China.K. G. Y.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,3RD JULY, 1950.

ANNEX ATranslation of declaration issued on 28th June by Minister forForeign Affairs of Chinese People&apos;s RepublicTruman, the President of the United States, after directingSyngman Rhee&apos;s puppet South Korean Government to stir up civil war in Koreaissued a declaration on the 27th June, announcing that the American Govern-&quot;ment had decided to use armed force to prevent the liberation of our Formosa.The United States Seventh fleet has already received Truman&apos;s instructions to begin operation in Formosan waters.I now declare on benalf of the Central People&apos;s Government of thePeople&apos;s Republic of China that the declaration made by Truman on the27th June and the actions of the United States Navy constitute armedaggression against Chinese territory and complete sabotage of the united nations Charter.    This violent and predatory action on the part of the UnitedStates was not unexpected by the Chinese people but has merely increased their anger because the Chinese people have for a long time continuously exposedthe conspiracy and plan of American imperialism to commit aggression againstChina and occupy the whole of Asia by force, and Truman&apos;s declaration has nowmerely made public this predetermined plan and put it into operation.    In fact,the American Governments direction to the puppet forces of Syngman Rhee&apos;sKorea to attack the Korea Democratic People&apos;s Republic was a prearrangedstep on the part of the United States.   Its object was to make a pretext for american aggression against Formosa, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines.It is indeed a further action in interference by American imperialism in Asia.I declare on behalf of the Central People&apos;s Government of theChinese People&apos;s Republic that no matter what impending action may be takenby the American imperialists, the fact that Formosa belongs to China can never be altered, not only is this a historical fact but it has also been determined by the Cairo and Potsdam declarations and the situation after theJapanese surrender.    The whole of the Chinese people will with one accordstruggle to the end for the liberation of Formosa from the hands of theAmerican aggressors,    The Chinese people who were victorious over the japan-nese imperialist   an^    Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of the Americanimperialists, will definitely be able victoriously to drive out the Americanaggressors, recover Formosa and all territory belonging to China.The Central People&apos;s Government of the Chinese People&apos;republic calls upon all peoples of the world who love peace, justice and freedom, particularly the oppressed peoples and nations of the East to riseand struggle to stop this new aggression by American imperialism in the East.Providing we are not cowed, and resolutely mobilise the broad masses of thepeople to take part in the struggle against the warmakers, then this aggressioncan be completely defeated.    The Chinese people express their sympathy and respect for the people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Japanwho similarly suffer American aggression and similarly struggle against it,and are convinced that the oppressed peoples and nations of the East will beable finally to bury the violent and wicked American imperialist war-makersin the great and fierce flames of the struggle for national independence.
