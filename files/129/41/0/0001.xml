(A copyof this document is reproduced at Annex A. )2. A suitable question has therefore been put down for me to answer on Tuesday, 4th July.     I attach at Annex B, for the considera-tion of the Cabinet, a draft of my reply, which has been cleared withthe T.U.C.R.S.C,^Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,30TH JUNE, 1950.1ft&apos;

ANNEX ATRADES UNION CONGRESSWAGES POLICY - STATEMENT TO AFFILIATED UNIONS(Issued on 28th June, 1950)In their last statement on wages policy, circulated for theinformation and guidance of affiliated Unions on 23rd November, 1949,the General Council announced that it was their intention to maintain a constant review of the operation of this policy and to report their con-clusions periodically to Unions.     Since the Conference of Trade union executives on 12th January, 1950, when the statement was approved by amajority of only 657,000 the trend of events has been under constant review.2. It is essential, however, for everyone to appreciate that apolicy of restraint has not been exercised merely for the period of thelast nine months.     Voluntary restraint was exercised by Unions duringthe war and in the early post-war period.     When, in 1947, the economic position of the country so seriously threatened the maintenance of full employment and created a grave danger of inflation the T.U.C. thendirectly sponsored a policy of restraint which was overwhelmingly con-firmed by succeeding Congresses.3. Immediately after Congress last year the government&apos;s decision to devalue sterling was announced.     This decision, in itself,occasioned some surprise but the extent of the devaluation created a profound shock.     The necessity for this drastic action was direct evidence of the extremely serious position in which this country stoodas a result of the serious depletion of our gold and dollar reserves,which affected not only the United Kingdom but all the countries of the sterling Area.4. The position was fraught with such danger that the general council were constrained to talk of rigorous restraint and for the first time to define a formula as to the manner in which restraint should beexercised.     Whilst the question of higher earnings based on increased output was not affected, an unprecedented degree of rigidity in regardto wage rates was introduced for the first time.5. As compared with .the circumstances necessitating devaluationand the chain of events which would probably have taken place if thefront were not held, the picture today seems very different.     In thelight of nine months of rising productivity, increased exports, theimprovement in world economic conditions, the relaxation of nationalcontrols, and the general impression of economic buoyancy, it is easy to overlook the basic difficulties which still beset us and which must continue to cause thr General Council some concern for the future.6. It is widely appreciated that the more rigorous restraintadvised in November of last year has been a considerable contributingfactor to the improvement which has taken place.7. The premises upon which the document approved by the Con-ference of Executives in January was based have not been authoritativelycontradicted and in actual fact the policy has in large measure operated,notwithstanding that certain basic conditions for its general acceptancedid not materialise.     Within a matter of weeks it became clear that

Unions with sliding scale arrangements were unable to depart eventemporarily from those agreements in the manner suggested, and   whilstspecial reference was made in the statement regarding low paid workers,there has certainly been a growth of discontent felt by skilled and semi-skilled worxers at the steady narrowing of differentials which has takenplace in recent years and which has all along been a real and compli-cating factor in the General Councils consideration of wages policy.8. In their last statement the General Council laid down three points which had to be appreciated and within which the policy would haveto work if it were to be successful.    In the first place they said the rightof free collective bargaining must be maintained;   wages policy was notto be imposed by the Government and the machinery of voluntarynegotiation had to be preserved.     Secondly, it was recognised that theT.U.C. could not impose any wages policy on affiliated Unions.     Thirdly,it was made clear that the proposals made no suggestion of a standstill on wage earnings.9. The rigidity of the policy formulated under the shadow of devaluation was a short-term policy.     It is already clear that in theview of several of our affiliated organisations the freedom of collective bargaining, which was our first condition, has been affected to someextent because certain employers have used the policy enunciated as a reason for refusing to consider the merits of claims submitted throughthe normal processes of collective bargaining.10. There are, moreover, two developments which make impracticable-able a scheme of rigorous control operating generally on wage ratesbetween the cost of living figures of 106 and 118, quite apart from thedifficulties of Unions with sliding scale agreements.     In the firstplace, although the cost of living figure has risen much more slowly thanmany people anticipated, there arises quite naturally a desire to preserveliving standards.     In addition, the relaxation of rationing and controlsof various commodities has given an impression that we are rapidlyclimbing out of our difficulties and that the need for restraint no longerexists.11. On the first point it is not yet sufficiently realised that - great as has been the contribution of Government planning for fair shares and full employment - the living standards which we have maintained through-out the war and post-war years would not have been possible without theassistance which we have received from the United States, Canada andother parts of the Commonwealth.     During the war lease-lend operated.Then we had the American and Canadian loans and gifts from members ofthe Commonwealth.     And the third phase was the operation of marshall aid which is providing us with certain essentials.     If we had to pay forthese essentials in dollars we should have to cut our imports of them withthe probability of substantial unemployment.12. On the second point, it is true that the gold and dollar reserves in the whole Sterling Area, which fell to a low level last year, have been going up and last year&apos;s losses have been recovered.     The improvement is still going on.     On the other hand, it is not so widely appreciated that the United Kingdom&apos;s own dollar deficit has not yet been substantially reduced.     If, therefore, the special factors now making for a high levelof dollar exports from the rest of the Sterling Area do not continue to operate we........shall still be a long way from being able to pay for the necessities which we can only obtain from the dollar countries.

The improvement is still going on.     On the other hand, it is not so widely appreciated that the United Kingdom&apos;s own dollar deficit has not yet been substantially reduced.     If, therefore, the special factors now making for a high levelof dollar exports from the rest of the Sterling Area do not continue to operate we shall still be a long way from being able to pay for the necessities which we can only obtain from the dollar countries.

13. There has been a recovery in the volume of our exports tothe dollar countries since last September - satisfactory in the case ofCanada, but still less than we needed and hoped for in the case of theUnited States.     At the same time, prices of our imports are stillrising and some further price increases are likely as the increased cost of raw materials is fully reflected in the prices of goods in courseof manufacture.14. Thus, while the improvement in productivity, as well as therise in industrial production, indicate that the economic position of thecountry is improving, our position is far from stable and we still havea long way to go before we can pay our way.     We are still verydependent upon the maintenance of demand in the United States both forour own exports and those of the Sterling Area.15. Devaluation pulled us out of a rapidly worsening situation and gave us a breathing space in which to improve our industrial and commercial efficiency.     It made our exports immediately cheaperabroad and helped us to sell them, but we can only retain this advantage in the face of growing world competition if we off-set the increased costin our imported raw materials by economies in costs at home.     Anysubstantial rise in our costs of production could soon bring us back tothe downward spiral we approached before devaluation - with fallingdollar exports, falling dollar reserves and with the prospect of not being able, even with the diminishing amount of American aid which will beavailable, to obtain the dollar raw materials without which industrial activity and full employment cannot be maintained.16. This means that, whilst the improving situation lessens the strain on our economy at the moment, the future is still insecure.Increased efficiency and lower costs in industry are as necessarytoday as a year ago, and these must be accompanied by, and are indeedconsiderably dependent on, reasonable restraint in all personal claims on production.1 ; . It is the duty of the General Council, together with Trade union executives, to look ahead.     The Council must again point out that, withthe deep responsibilities of the Trade Union Movement for the welfare of eight million members, it would be folly to assume that the economicbarometer is set fair for the pursuance of wage claims, on the basis ofthe standard of life we would like to assure to our people.18. At the same time, we must reiterate that the General Councilcannot impose a wages policy.     The Trade Union Movement is a democratic movement and there is a growing opposition to the continuedoperation of rigorous restraint while the cost of living figure, relativelysteady though it is, has gradually risen.     This opposition is fostered inthe minds of many people who desire to do the right thing but cannot beexpected to do other than take at something like their face value thesigns of improvement conveyed by a removal of controls, the maintenanceof a high profit level, and what generally appears on the surface to be anemergence from our serious post-war difficulties.19. The General Council, in the circumstances, must adopt thepractical course of recognising that there must be greater flexibilityof wage movements in the future than was envisaged in the policy approved by the Conference of Executives in January.     They arefirmly convinced that there is no formula which can be devised as to

how this flexibility can operate.     Its operation must be left to the goodsense and reasonableness which has been displayed by Unions, particu-larly in the post-war period, and with full account being taken of thecontinued warning of the General Council that our basic difficultiesstill remain, even if temporarily lessened in their intensity.20. Affiliated organisations will appreciate the inter-dependence of various sections of the Trade Union Movement in the struggle tosecure economic stability, and also the difficulties created by the lackof any practicable formula as to how the necessary flexibility should operate.     Consequently the General Council offer facilities for such consultation as affiliated unions may desire to assist them in the con-sideration of their problems.ANNEX BPARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND DRAFT REPLYQ. To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he has con-sidered the T.U.C.&apos;s statement on wages, a copy of which was sent tohim, and whether he has any statement to make upon it?A. Yes, Sir.     I have read this important document with care andI welcome the realistic account which it gives of our present economicsituation.In a passage of my Budget Speech at Cols.  64-66 of the official report for 18th April I pointed out that it was not possible to continue indefinitely the rigidity of the policy in regard to personal incomes whichwas initiated immediately after the devaluation of sterling last autumn and that some degree of relaxation would be called for.     At the same time remarked that it was necessary that we should try and secure that any relaxation was brought about by some orderly method which paid full regard to the continuing dangers of inflation.The policy of restraint hitherto exercised, which was intensifiedafter devaluation, has had a striking degree of success and thanks to theco-operation of all sections of the community has contributed greatlytowards the improvement in our affairs which has taken place since this time last year.

Although therefore our economic situation appears morefavourable today than it was, there is still a great need for continuedrestraint in the matter of personal incomes, as is pointed out in thestatement issued by the T.U.C.We cannot at present afford anything but a limited degree ofrelaxation of the very rigid standards laid down after devaluation and.I therefore hope that all those concerned with the fixing or negotiation of personal incomes will bear in mind the continued need for a large measure of restraint so that we may not lose the benefits earned by our efforts during and since the war, and particularly since devaluation.If we were now to abandon this policy we should set in motion a wave of inflation which could do the utmost damage to our economy.30th June, 1950.
