7/T/50   (5p&quot;062document is the&apos;property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government)SECRETCP.(50) 166 COPY NO. ^7TH JULY, 1950;abinetRENEWAL OF EMERGENCY powers memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilSome recent developments have brought to a head the questionif and when we should ask both Houses to pass the necessary Addresses fora renewal for a year after 10th December, 1950, of the emergency powerscontinued in force by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act,1945, and the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947.This issue can be considered without prejudice to the unresolved question(which I shall wish to bring before the Cabinet, with the draft of a Bill,before the Summer Recess) whether a permanent Economic Powers Billshould be introduced early next Session, because it is unlikely thatpermanent legislation would have passed through both Houses before10th December, 1950.    In any event the Economic Powers Bill would only cover part of the field and it was always contemplated that a con-siderable number of miscellaneous powers would be continued in force by Addresses on a year-to-year basis.    The question is whether theseAddresses should be moved before the Summer Recess, or in October in the concluding days of the present Session, or in November, early in the new session.2. From the point of view of Departmental administration, the sooner the powers are renewed for a year after 10th December, 1950, the better.    The Ministry of Food have already been embarrassed by the factthat they were advised that they should not purport to fix monthly prices for home-grown grains in respect of periods after 10th December, 1950:   andan Order made on 30th June last, which would in the ordinary way havefixed monthly prices for each month till June, 1951, had to be restricted to the period ending 10th December next.   As the expiry of the powersdraws near, all Departments will find it increasingly difficult to make orders which operate mainly or solely after 10th December next.3. The present international situation might have facilitated thepassing of the necessary Addresses before the Summer Recess:   but I donot see how the necessary time could be found.    For administrativereasons, I should be reluctant to leave Departments in a state of uncertainty until the new Session.    On the whole, therefore, I should favour the moving of the Addresses in October at the end of the present Session.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1. ,7TH JULY, 1950.
