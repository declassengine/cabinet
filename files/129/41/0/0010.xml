(50) 1605th July, 1950CABINETJAPANESE PEACE treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State m Commonwealth Relations andthe Minister of StateOur colleagues will recall that in the report on the Colombo Conference, whichthe Foreign Secretary circulated to the Cabinet with CP. (50) 18 of22nd February, 1950, it was stated that a Working Party of Commonwealth high commissioners and officials would be set up in London with a view to reconcilingany remaining substantial differences of opinion between Commonwealth Govern-ments as to the form and substance of the Japanese Peace Treaty:2. The Working Party met in London between 1st and 17th May and prepared a report which we now circulate herewith for the information of our colleagues.It will be seen that Annex B lists certain problems which the Working Party con-sidered might be the subject of further study by individual commonwealth governments with a view to a later exchange of views through normal channels.As far as the United Kingdom is concerned these problems are at present being studied by officials.3. At their final meeting on 17th May, which was a plenary meeting preside over by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and attended by commonwealth High Commissioners themselves, the Working Party report wasconsidered and, subject to certain minor amendments, approved. It was agreedthat the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the High Com-missioners should, when submitting the Working Party&apos;s report to their governments, invite them to consider whether it should be shown to the UnitedStates Government, and, if so, with what changes.4. Commonwealth Governments have now had time to consider the report.So far, however, no communication has been received from any commonwealth government in regard to either its general content or the specific question of itscommunication to the United States Government.5. From the United Kingdom point of view it is considered that, subjectto certain minor amendments and the omission of paragraphs 28 to 34 inclusive(to which it is understood that the Board of Trade attach importance) and Annex B,there would be no objection to communicating to the United States Governmentthe whole of the section of the report headed &quot; Meetings of Officials.&quot; Thequestion whether those sections of the report in which views are specificallyattributed to individual Commonwealth Governments should be communicatedto the United States is, however, one for decision by the commonwealth governments concerned.6. Subject to the approval of our colleagues it is proposed, therefore, to address a communication to other Commonwealth Governments (a) informing them that subject to certain stated amendments (as set out inparagraph 5 above) the United Kingdom Government have no objec-tion to the communication of the Working Party&apos;s report to the UnitedStates Government;38982 b
(b) inviting the views of other Commonwealth Governments, and adding thatthey may wish to give particular consideration to those sections of thereport in which views are specifically attributed to their ownrepresentatives on the Working Party;(c) proposing to other Commonwealth Governments that, subject to their comments on its form and content, the Working Party report mightbe communicated to the State Department by the United KingdomEmbassy in Washington; and(d) adding that in any communication to the United States Government itwould, of course, be made clear that the deliberations Qf the working party were exploratory, and entirely without any commitment by governments.P.

SECRET[C.M.J. (50) 8llth May, 1950]COMMONWEALTH WORKING PARTY ON JAPANESE PEACE TREATY,1st MAY TO 17th MAY, 1950REPORTIntroductionThe meeting of Commwealth Foreign Ministers at Colombo &quot; agreed that the detailed consideration of the terms of a peace settlement for Japan should beundertaken by a working party of officials under the direction of CommonwealthHigh Commissioners in London.&quot;Ail Commonwealth Governments subsequently confirmed this recommendation and accepted a United Kingdom proposal that the Working Party should hold its first meeting on 1st May.Plenary MeetingsPlenary meetings of the Working Party, attended by Commonwealth high commissioners and presided over by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, were held on 1st, 5th and 17th May. The first plenary meeting discussed the relation between the plenary meetings of the Working Party attended by high commissioners and the meetings of officials to discuss the more detailed aspectsof the settlement. It was agreed that the meetings of officials should functionwithin a framework of guidance to be laid down by the High Commissioners&apos;meetings. The Working Party would, of course, function on the distinct under-standing that its deliberations were exploratory, and entirely without any commit-ment to Governments. In regard to publicity it was agreed that in view of theinterest displayed by the press and the speculative reports which had already-appeared it would be desirable to issue a brief press communique. The meetingapproved the following text:  In pursuance of recommendation made by Commonwealth Ministers at the colombo Conference in January of this year in regard to a Japanese peace treaty, the High Commissioners for Canada, India, Pakistan and Ceylon, the resident Minister of Australia and the Acting High Commissioners for NewZealand and South Africa met to-day under chairmanship of Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations.The purpose of the meeting is to undertake detailed consideration of theterms of a peace settlement for Japan. The discussions will be exploratory.It will be recalled that a meeting of Commonwealth representatives on thissubject was held in Canberra in 1947.The question of the form and nature of any report which the Working Partymight produce was discussed, but deferred for later consideration.2. At the second plenary meeting High Commissioners discussed Part I(Political and Economic Prospects for Japan) of a United Kingdom Paper (C.M.J.(50) 3, circulated to the Colombo Conference as F.M.M. (50) 2) on the japanese peace treaty. There was general agreement with the conclusion that &quot; develop-ments since the end of the war with Japan point towards the conclusion of a peace treaty which will not result in the permanent resentment of the Japanesepeople, and which, in consequence, will offer real prospects that Japan&apos;s own effortswill enable her to reach a reasonable standard of living.&quot; All were agreed on theneed for ensuring security against the resurgence of an aggressive Japan. The dis-cussion, however, revealed differences in emphasis as to the best safeguards, andalso as to the degreee of apprehension felt over the possibility that Japan couldagain become an aggressor. Australia and New Zealand particularly stressed theimportance of adequate long-term guarantees against Japanese military revival.India emphasised that treaty provisions which aroused &apos;the resentment of the38982 b 2
Japanese would be likely to defeat their own ends. The view of Ceylon was thatthe expansionist policy of the Soviet Union represented a graver and more immedi-ate danger than the possibility of a revival of Japanese military power. India,Ceylon and Pakistan all laid emphasis on the importance of ensuring that therestrictions imposed on Japan should be kept down to a minimum. Canada alsostressed the importance of keeping such restrictions to a minimum, to provideincentives for the maintenance and strengthening in Japan of the democratic wayof life and to give her a stake in the non-Communist world, since among theprincipal aims to be achieved are the denial of Japanese resources to Communistcontrol and the voluntary co-operation of Japan in the future with the other demo-cratic powers. As a result of their discussion of the form of the settlement the high commissioners instructed officials to devote special consideration to the problempresented by Soviet and Chinese participation, the possibility that Russia and Chinamight themselves take the initiative in calling a Peace Conference, the implications of a peace treaty concluded in the absence of these two powers, and the implications-tions of the continuation of the status quo. In the course of a discussion on security the Indian High Commissioner stated that India could not agree to any provisionbeing made in the treaty which would allow bases to foreign powers. At theconclusion of the discussion High Commissioners agreed that officials should be free to discuss all the items on the original agenda, and that a further plenary meeting would be held to consider the report prepared by the officials.Meetings of OfficialsA Peace Treaty and the Alternatives *Officials considered three courses which might now be followed in respect of japan.   These were:  (a) The conclusion of a treaty of peace.(b) A continuation of the status quo. . .(e) An intermediate course involving the progressive relaxation of restrictionsat present imposed on the Japanese Government, the increasingassociation of Japan with international life, and the devolution to theJapanese Government of various responsibilities now exercised by theSupreme Commander, but not involving the terminating of military occupation of Japan. Such a process might or might not be accom-panied by a declaration terminating the state of war with Japan.2. The proceedings of the Working Party were, of course, conducted on theassumption that in accordance with the conclusion reached by the meeting of commonwealth Foreign Ministers at Colombo, all Commonwealth Governmentsfavoured the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. But somedelegations, in particular New Zealand, considered that if the only attainable peace treaty should prove to be one entirely without security safeguards, governments might wish to reconsider their attitudes.3. It was in any case realised that the attitude of the United States might make (b) or (c) above inevitable. These two alternatives were not considered tobe mutually exclusive since, under the present occupation regime, many of the processes envisaged under (c) were now taking place, and Japan was, in fact,already drifting into a state of peace. The main difference would be that (c) wouldbe less of a process of drift and more of a deliberate act of policy, initiated by theUnited States as a fairly long-term alternative to a treaty of peace. It was assumed that such a policy would be initiated after consultation with the other Governmensconcerned.4. It was generally agreed that a modified and liberalised occupation regimeon the lines contemplated in paragraph 1 (c) above would be open to the samefundamental objections as a mere continuation of the status quo. In both casesalien forces would remain in Japan under an arrangement in which the japanese would have had no voice, and the psychological reactions could only be such asto play into the hands of Soviet propaganda.5. It was not clear whether the relaxation of the controls now exercised by the Supreme Commander contemplated under 1 (c) would involve the exchangeof diplomatic missions between Japan and third powers. In either case therewould be difficulties. Full diplomatic missions could only be exchanged in advance
of a treaty of peace provided that the powers concerned had declared the termina-tion of the state of war with Japan. But whatever their status, the exchange of diplomatic agents between Japan and third powers at a time when the supreme commander remained in Japan would result in an anomalous position, full of potential sources of friction. Japan might well, for example, consult the supreme commander as to the reply to be returned to representations made by one of theallied powers on whose behalf the Supreme Commander was acting. Japan couldbe expected to utilise the position to play off the Supreme Commander against therepresentatives of other powers.6. On the other hand, a procedure under which the allied powers were invited to treat Japan in all important respects as though a treaty of peace hadalready been concluded, while at the same time they continued to be debarred from direct access to the Japanese Government in Tokyo, would clearly beobjectionable in the extreme.7. A further objection to any intermediate solution short of a peace treaty was that a variety of problems, largely economic, would still require final settle-ment on an international basis.8. The possible declaration, of the termination of the state of war was discussed. It was generally considered that such a step would be an unsatisfactorycompromise, and would be hardly likely, at this stage, to have a very beneficial effect on Japanese morale, particularly in view of active Communist propaganda in favour of a full treaty of peace. If such a course were proposed, its implications-tions would require detailed study.Procedure9. There was general agreement that all the countries at present represented on the Far Eastern Commission, Ceylon and, possibly, Indonesia should be invitedto participate in the drafting of a Japanese peace treaty. It was suggested that,although membership in the Far Eastern Commission should not be regarded asan indispensable qualification for participation in the Japanese Peace Conference,it might, nevertheless, facilitate the acceptance of Ceylon&apos;s claim to a seat at theConference table if she were first to secvire admittance to the Far eastern commission, or, at any rate, if her application were on record. It was pointed outthat neither Ceylon nor Indonesia was a member of the United Nations. It was understood that the legal adviser of the State Department considered that member-ship of the United Nations was not a prerequisite for membership of the far eastern Commission.10. There was some discussion of the position of Indonesia. Most delegatesconsidered that their Governments would regard Indonesia as qualified to partici-pate in the Peace Conference and would probably support any claim whichIndonesia might put forward for a seat at the Conference table. The Australiandelegation suggested that the question of additional participants should be con-sidered carefully, lest their inclusion might lead to an attempt to include othercountries on which there might not be general agreement.11. It was recognised that the question of the participation of Chinapresented difficulties as yet unsolved. These arose from the fact that the UnitedStates, which it was generally agreed could most appropriately be the conveningpower, as well as several members of the Commonwealth, France and the Philip-pines, had not yet recognised the Central People&apos;s Government of China. It was,however, generally felt that representation in the name of China could onlyreasonably be exercised by the Central People&apos;s Government. One solution ofthe difficulty might be the admission of representatives of the Central People&apos;sGovernment into the Far Eastern Commission. A solution need not await the recognition of the Central People&apos;s Government by all the other participants in thePeace Conference.12. The difficulties of securing a peace treaty which would be acceptable tothe Western Allies, and the Soviet Union and China were fully recognised. It was,nevertheless, agreed that it was of the first importance that invitations to theSoviet Union and China should be extended, and that there should be no questionof making peace without these two powers unless and until it was clear that theywere only prepared to participate in a Peace Conference on terms unacceptable
to the democratic powers. It was the general view that the door might be left open for their later participation even if they declined to attend in the first instance,or abandoned the Conference at any stage. The attempt to call a Peace conference by the United States in 1947 had failed primarily because the Soviet Union had insisted that the question must first be considered by the Council of foreign ministers. There was, however, a possibility that the Soviet Union might beprepared to revise her attitude for the purpose of furthering her own interests. Itwas agreed that the possibility that Russia and China might themselves take theinitiative in convening a Peace Conference on ostensibly reasonable terms shouldbe borne in mind. Such a move might cause serious embarrassment to the demo-cratic powers, and the existence of the possibility was an additional argument infavour of the early convening of a Peace Conference by the democracies.13. It was recognised that, as the Soviet Union had no foothold in Japan,she might be prepared to go to considerable lengths (e.g., she might perhaps beprepared to abandon the veto) in order to put an end to the present predominantposition of the United States in Japan.14. On the question of voting procedure all delegates accepted the Canberraconclusion that there should be no veto procedure and that decisions should betaken by a simple majority vote on procedural matters and by a two-thirds majority on substantive issues. It was agreed, however, that any alternativemajority systems which were put forward should be given careful consideration.India considered that some form of weighted voting to take account of the dominantposition of, e.g., the United States, need not be debarred.15. There was some discussion of the question whether the initial invitation to a Peace Conference should include a statement of the proposed voting pro-cedure. It was generally agreed that this would be tactically undesirable sinceRussia and China would be given a pretext for refusing to participate even inpreliminary discussions. Furthermore, they would be able to make useful propa-ganda out of the fact that they had only been invited to participate on stated- conditions. It is assumed that, before entering the conference, the democraticpowers would have reached some general agreement among themselves as to the voting procedure to be followed.Basic Aims with Particular Reference to Security16. There was a discussion of the three basic objectives of the Japanese peace settlement as laid down in paragraph 10 of C.M.J. (50) 3, viz.:  (a) the complete disarmament and demilitarisation of Japan (which might besaid to have been achieved already);ib) the enforcement in concert with the other powers concerned of measuresto obviate the possibility of renewed Japanese aggression;(c) the development of a peace-loving Japan which will have no desire tomenace other nations.It was explained that these basic aims had been originally drafted with the CanberraConference in view. There was general agreement that international developments since that time made it necessary to emphasise as equally fundamental the impor-tance of ensuring (a) that Japan&apos;s industrial capacity and skilled man-power were denied to theSoviet Union;(b) that Japan was enabled to enjoy the conditions necessary for the establish-ment of a viable economy.17. In the discussion on security, two aspects of the problem weredistinguished. There was, first, the security of the democratic powers from possible future Japanese aggression and, secondly, the security of Japan herself. These twoproblems were, of course, closely inter-related, since the security of the democraticpowers would be gravely menaced if Japan&apos;s industrial capacity and man-powerwere to fall under the control of the Soviet Union.18. Since Japan had been completely disarmed and demilitarised, and hadrenounced the use and maintenance of all military forces in her constitution, she
was clearly in no position to undertake her own defence. The following three possible ways of securing the territorial integrity of Japan were discussed:  (i) A multilateral guarantee by all the powers participating in the PeaceConference, which might, of course, include the Soviet Union and china. It was generally considered that in the present stage of the&quot; cold war &quot; this was a proposal which it would scarcely be realistic to pursue. The inclusion of Russia and China would not be reassuring tothe Japanese, and in any case the likelihood was that these two powers would only agree to participate in the pursuance of objectivesirreconcilable with those of the democracies. In particular, since ageneral guarantee would be meaningless without a concerted defenceplan, Russia and China, being geographically close to Japan, might welltry to utilise their participation in a joint defence agreement for thepurpose of securing a dominant military influence over Japan. russian and Chinese participation might thus bring nearer the very dangers which the defence agreement was designed to avert.(ii) A multilateral pact including all the rest of the peace-making powers, but excluding China and the Soviet Union. Such a pact, as in (i) above,would involve the drawing up of a concerted defence plan and wouldbe meaningless unless the countries concerned were prepared to makespecific contributions towards the defence of Japan. There was generalagreement that the degree to which Commonwealth Governments mightbe prepared&apos; to undertake such obligations was a question outside theterms of reference of the Working Party; but that the problem was oneto which Commonwealth Governments might wish to give individualconsideration. The point was, however, made that an attack on Japanmight well be only one aspect of a general war; commonwealth countries might thus be called upon to implement their guarantee ata time when they would be least likely to have forces available for thepurpose. There might be objections in Australia and New Zealand toguaranteeing a former enemy so long as no formal guarantees existed fortheir own security. Commonwealth countries might reach theconclusion that the United States was the only country with the resourcesnecessary to enable her to offer Japan an effective guarantee against aggression.(iii) A bilateral defence pact between Japan and the United States.   In thediscussion of this proposal it was emphasised that there was no questionof the United States wanting to use Japan as a base for aggression against the Soviet Union. The purpose of a defence pact, whetherbilateral or multilateral, would be to deny to Russia the possibility of using Japan&apos;s industrial potential, trained man-power and strategic position. One possible consequence of a purely bilateral arrangement might be that the United States, faced with the prospect of bearing theburden of Japan&apos;s defence alone, would urge that Japan herself should share in the possibility by providing certain defence forces. The raising of Japanese defence forces, whether within the framework of a bilateraldefence pact or not, would be very unwelcome to some commonwealth countries.19. There was general appreciation of the fact that the problem of safe-guarding the territorial integrity of Japan faced the democratic powers with adilemma. The disarmament and demilitarisation measures already taken toprevent Japan herself from becoming an aggressor again had left her vulnerableand in need of protection, particularly against possible Communist attack. Themost practical means of providing this protection was a bilateral defence pactbetween the United States and Japan. This solution might possibly lead to asuggestion that Japan herself should make some minimum contribution towards her own defence. This in turn would be likely to prove a progressive process. If, forexample, Japan were to be permitted to raise certain ground forces for homedefence, this would inevitably lead to pressure for an air force to co-operate withthe ground forces, and so on.20. There was reference to the possibility of finding a solution to the dilemmawithin the framework of some more general regional defence arrangement. It was recognised, however, that this was a problem which did not fall strictly within thescope of the Working Party discussions.
21. There was general agreement that the treaty should not deny Japan the capacity to maintain internal security. One difficulty arose from the fact that theJapanese Police Force had been decentralised. This measure had been carried outwith the laudable aim of preventing the abuses which had been common before thewar. One consequence, however, was that the Japanese police were deprived ofany central intelligence regarding subversive activities. It was generally agreed that japan must have internal security forces capable of dealing with internal disorders,as well as a coast-guard organisation able to prevent Communist infiltration from the mainland. There was agreement that some strengthening and centralisation of japan&apos;s internal security forces was desirable. Some delegations considered,however, that such measures should only be carried out within certain limits andsubject to certain controls. It was considered that there were objections to placingany upper limit on the size of Japan&apos;s internal security forces, since unless the limitprescribed were much higher than Japan&apos;s normal requirements, any specialrecruitment to cope with a sudden emergency would involve a breach of the treaty.Since the aim of any safeguards in regard to internal security forces would be toprevent their developing into the nucleus of military forces, one possible solution might be to specify precisely the type of arms permitted. The danger that the strengthening and centralisation of the police force might result in the revival ofa secret police force on the totalitarian model, which would endanger the newlywon freedoms of the Japanese people, was considered, but it was felt that this wasa danger which the Japanese people themselves must be prevailed upon to guard against.22. The Working Party proceeded to consider the specific security controlsreferred to in paragraph 11 of the United Kingdom memorandum, viz.:  (a) The prohibition of all military and para-military organisations and all forms of military training, the mercantile marine, police force, coast-guard service and possibly civil aviation being permitted within limits to be laid down in the treaty.(b) As far as practicable, the control of all forms of emigration with a viewto the prevention of infiltration for political or warlike purposes, andof espionage.(c) The total prohibition for an indefinite period of the production of all war materials and military equipment, aircraft, alumina and magnesium,synthetic oil and synthetic rubber.(d) Limitation of production for an indefinite period of the followingindustries: shipbuilding, iron and steel, aluminium ingots, industrialexplosives, and all refining and storage capacity for oil.(e) Prohibition of imports of goods under (c) except under licence, andrestriction of imports of goods under (d) to agreed amounts.(/) Prohibition of the construction of merchant ships above a fixed speed and tonnage.The United Kingdom Government now considered that control over Japanese emi-gration was impracticable and they were prepared to reconsider the other securitycontrols referred to in this paragraph. In general the United Kingdom was nowinclined to the view that the possibility of Japanese aggression could be adequatelyguarded against by long-range economic controls, which would be operated under an international agreement negotiated outside the treaty. There was general agree-ment that the question of long-range economic controls was one which individualCommonwealth Governments might wish to study further with a subsequentexchange of views through normal channels. The problem would involve a study of (a) the items necessary for the creation of a war potential under modern conditions; and(b) the degree of Japan&apos;s dependence on imports of these items and the possiblesources of supply.It was assumed that Russia and China would not participate in such an agreement and it was recognised that these two countries might be able and willing to supplycertain items which the democracies were anxious to withhold.23. There was general agreement on the importance of ensuring that the80 million inhabitants of Japan, who would presumably be confined by the peace
treaty to the four main islands, should be left with the means of living at a reason-able standard. Provided that any economic security measures did not conflict with this overriding requirement India was not opposed to security restrictions on,for example, oil storage and oil refining capacity.24. With regard to ship building, most delegations were inclined to doubt the practicability, and in some cases the desirability, of imposing any restriction on the size and speed of ships built in Japan. It was pointed out, however, that japan&apos;s present merchant ship building capacity is much in excess of her normal peace-time needs. Japan&apos;s present inflated ship building capacity was built up forthe purpose of constructing and servicing an inflated wartime fleet. It was suggestedthat, in these circumstances, the &quot; shearing away&quot; of Japan&apos;s present surplus capacity would be a reasonable proposal to advocate.25. The New Zealand delegate listed the following controls as being NewZealand&apos;s minimum security requirements:  (i) Prohibition of military and para-military organisations.(ii) Prohibition of the production of armaments, aircraft, synthetic oil andsynthetic rubber.(iii) Limitation to defined levels of all storage and refining capacity and shipbuilding capacity.(iv) Prohibition of the import of armaments and, subject to exceptions, air-craft, and limitation of oil imports to agreed amounts.The New Zealand Government considered, however, that Japan should be allowedto operate civil aircraft, to engage in fundamental scientific research, and to main-tain police and coastguard forces under prescribed conditions. It was the NewZealand view, formed after careful consideration, that these restrictions would not prevent Japan from becoming economically viable; moreover they were so fewand simple that the supervisory machinery necessary to ensure their enforcementwould be so small as to give minimum offence to Japanese susceptibilities.26. Australia was in favour of writing into the peace treaty the substance of various Far Eastern Commission policy decisions relating to the security ques-tion, for example, those concerning atomic energy industrial war potential and theprohibition of military activity. The Australian delegations also referred to theirclose interest in Japanese fishing and whaling on security grounds.27. It was pointed out that, although no clear indication of United Statesviews on the security provisions of the peace treaty could yet be obtained, one possibility was that the United States might oppose any reference to disarmament and demilitarisation in the treaty itself. They might contend that any such reference was unnecessary since Japan had renounced all military forces in her constitution.The United States view might be that it would be adequate if the treaty merelystated that the Allies had taken note of the relevant provisions in the constitution.This would leave a loophole for the possible re-creation of an armaments industryand of indigenous defence forces at some future date, and the United States might wish to avoid permanently excluding such a possibility in the peace treaty. TheAustralian delegation stated that, whatever the attitude of the United States onthis point might prove to be, their own apprehensions in regard to possibleJapanese military revival would, of course, be considerably allayed by the conclusionof any kind of post-treaty security arrangements under which United States forcesremained in Japan.Economic Provisions28. The Working Party noted that many of the economic security provisionscontemplated at the Canberra Conference in 1947 depended for their implementationon the setting up of some form of control body within Japan. Views on the possi-bility and desirability of establishing control machinery within Japan had evolvedsince Canberra. Some delegations now felt that long-range controls operated out-side Japan would be adequate, while others, although prepared to consider long-range controls, maintained that control machinery within Japan was still highly desirable.29.   The United Kingdom view at Canberra, which had been shared bysome other delegations, had been that Japan should be regarded as serving aperiod of probation in the years immediately following the peace treaty.   Duringthis probationary period Japan would not be permitted to become a full men her38982 c
of any inter-governmental organisation, and her eventual admission would be dependant upon her having established her right to join by a period of good behaviour. During this interim period, however, it was suggested that Japan shouldbe compelled unilaterally to abide by the provisions of such international conven-tions as prescribed a reasonable standard of behaviour in international economic affairs.30. It was considered that, although this had been a reasonable proposal in1947, it was scarcely realistic to continue to contemplate such a probationary period in 1950. In any case the United Kingdom now considered that it was scarcelypracticable to expect Japan to abide faithfully by the obligations inherent in inter-national conventions whilst she was at the same time deprived of their privileges.There would be bound to be increasing pressure, which would be progressivelydifficult to resist, for Japan to enjoy the advantages as well as the obligations.31. The Working Party proceeded to discuss this point with particular reference to the International Trade Organisation and the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade. Japan could hardly be compelled for any long period to abideunilaterally by the provisions of the International Trade Organisation. She wouldbe certain to press for reciprocal privileges, the most important of which would be most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of her exports. The whole question ofaccording most-favoured-nation treatment to Japanese exports was under studyby a number of Commonwealth Governments. The United Kingdom was reluctant to contemplate the granting of most-favoured-nation treatment to Japanese exportsexcept under an arrangement which would provide some definite escape clause.32. The Australian delegation pointed out that the provisions of the charter of the International Trade Organisation, under the terms Article 99 (2) of the charter itself, are overridden by the provisions in a peace treaty. One possible solution of the problem might therefore be to include an article in the peace treaty to the effect that &quot; the terms and conditions of trade between Japan and the signatory powers may be determined by bilateral arrangements.&quot; This was asuggestion tentatively advanced as one which might be given further study. Therewas general agreement that Commonwealth Governments might wish to investi-gate the point further and subsequently to exchange views through the normal channels.33. In regard to the general question of Japanese membership of international organisations, it was pointed out that the United States were already taking theview that Japan should become a full member of as many of these bodies as possiblein order to bring her fully into the community of nations. It was quite certaintherefore that they would be opposed to the inclusion of any restrictive provisions on this subject in a treaty of peace.34. Commonwealth delegations were generally agreed in not wishing to seeundue restrictions placed on the export of cheap Japanese goods, which were particularly necessary in countries where the purchasing power of the. indigenouspopulation was low. Nevertheless, apart from such problems as dumping andunfair trade practices, Japanese competition arising from genuine low costs due tothe low standard of living of the industrial worker in Japan was a source ofanxiety to some Commonwealth countries, and it was agreed that the problems arising from Japan&apos;s re-entry into world trade needed to be carefully studied.There was some discussion of the future pattern of Japanese trade, and it was generally thought that Japanese exports would not be confined to consumer goodsbut might well include an increasing proportion of capital goods.35. The Working Party agreed that there could be no question of obtainingfurther reparations from Japanese internal industrial assets. Since there had previously been general agreement that reparations should not be taken from current production, this meant that, with certain exceptions discussed in paragraph 36below, reparations must now be regarded as largely a dead issue. It was believedthat, although most of the other countries concerned would probably be preparedto adopt a similar attitude, the Philippines would continue to press for reparations,whilst the attitude of Russia and China was very difficult to assess. It was possiblethat both these two latter powers might now be prepared to forgo their claims to reparations for tactical reasons.
36. With regard to external assets, Japanese assets in the United States hadalready been used to pay personal claims of United States citizens against Japan.It therefore now seemed likely that other powers might also regard Japanese assets in their custody as at their full and final disposal, although the use to which fundsacquired by liquidating Japanese assets might be put would be a matter for decision by the individual Governments concerned; in this connection the Canadian view was that such assets should definitely be at the disposal of Governments.The United Kingdom attitude would probably be that the funds should go to theExchequer rather than be used for paying individual claimants. It was generally agreed that Japanese assets in neutral countries should be made available to theex-Allies as reparations rather than be used for meeting occupation costs or put toany of the other uses which the United States had recently suggested in the far eastern Commission. It was felt, however, that there was little likelihood of reaching general international agreement on the question of Japanese externalassets in advance of a peace treaty. The United Kingdom delegation pointed outthat the United Kingdom considered she had a special claim on Japanese assets in Switzerland since they had been built up very largely out of remittances made bythe United Kingdom with a view to their being used by the Red Cross for therelief of British prisoners of war.37. Most delegations agreed that Japanese gold should be made available as reparations, and that any proposals that it be used for the payment of occupation costs, or as a backing for Japanese currency, should be resisted. It was recognisedthat the apportionment of the gold between the claimant countries would presentconsiderable difficulties.38.   The following were among the additional points made in the discussion:  (a) In addition to the security aspect the revival of the Japanese fishing andwhaling industries presented general economic and conservationproblems. There should, however, be a provision in the treaty by which japan undertook to observe existing international conventions and perhaps also practical conservation arrangements. It was agreed that commonwealth Governments might wish in addition to considerwhether these problems could not best be dealt with by a specialisedfisheries conference, which might perhaps agree upon the allocation of fishing areas in the Far East.(b) The Commonwealth countries attached importance to the inclusion inthe peace treaty of appropriate provisions in respect of such matters as patents, copyrights and trade marks.(c) Although it appeared that substantial progress had been made towardsdissolving the Zaibatsu, thus ending the dangerous concentration ofeconomic and financial power in Japan, it was impossible to be certainthat by a concealed regrouping of certain industries the secret re-establishment of something on the lines of the Zaibatsu was not now taking place.(d) A number of rules for good economic behaviour were embodied in far eastern Commission policy decisions and in the Supreme Commander&apos;orders to the Japanese Government. It would be desirable to ensurethat Japan continued to abide by many of these directives and orders,perhaps by writing their provisions into the peace treaty. On the otherhand it might perhaps be preferable to obtain from Japan a voluntarydeclaration that she intended to abide by the spirit of certain of thecodes of conduct with which she had complied under the occupation.39. In considering the economic provisions of the treaty the Working party had in mind the possibility that an actual treaty of peace might continue to proveunattainable and that it would be therefore extremely difficult to reach solutionson&quot; an international basis to many of the economic problems discussed. It was particularly emphasised that the kind of proposal discussed in paragraph 32 abovecould only be implemented in the context of a treaty of peace.Territorial Provisions40.   It was generally agreed that:  (a) Japanese sovereignty should be confined to the four main islands and toa number of adjacent minor islands whose precise definition would bea matter for the Peace Conference.38982
(b) The disposition of the territories to be ceded by Japan need not be dealtwith in the peace treaty itself. In the peace treaty Japan might merelyrenounce all claims to the ceded territories.41. The question of Japanese interests in the Antarctic area was discussed and representatives of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand all stressed theimportance of including in the treaty a clause whereby Japan would renounce all political and territorial claims, whether actual or prospective, in the Antarcticcontinent and the islands adjacent thereto.42. It was recalled that at the Canberra Conference it was generally contem-plated that the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands would remain under United Statescontrol, probably by means of a strategic trusteeship. It was pointed out that theSoviet Union and China might well prevent the setting up of a United Statesstrategic trusteeship for these islands. Strategic trusteeships were, of course, theresponsibility of the Security Council and subject, therefore, to the veto procedure.In view of the possibility that a strategic trusteeship might prove to be unobtainable,consideration was given to the possible setting up of an ordinary trusteeship. Itwas recognised that the United States would wish to establish military bases and installations in these islands, and it was agreed that the position regarding defence arrangements in an area administered under an ordinary trusteeship would need further investigation.43. It subsequently emerged that there were precedents for including inordinary trusteeship agreements an article giving the administering power very widelatitude in defence matters. It was suggested that while it would be easy to makeout a plausible case for the assumption by the United States of the administrationof these islands under a strategic trusteeship (e.g., in order to prevent futureJapanese aggression) it might well prove much more difficult to present to theGeneral Assembly a convincing case in justification of the establishment of an ordinary trusteeship.Political and General Provisions44. The Working Party considered whether it would be desirable to include in the Japanese peace treaty a human rights clause on the lines of those includedin the satellite treaties. It was suggested that it might be possible to use such anarticle for the purpose of securing proper treatment for alien residents in Japan.There was general agreement that the objective should be to ensure that an alienresident in Japan receives not&quot; national treatment,&quot; but treatment no less favourable than that which would be accorded to a Japanese residing in the alien&apos;s own country. It was recognised that it would be extremely difficult to draft suitableprovisions designed to secure this aim for inclusion in the peace treaty. TheCanadian delegation suggested that the safeguarding of the interests of alienresidents in Japan might be dealt with by including in the treaty a human rightsclause on the following terms:  &quot; Japan shall take all measures necessary to secure to all persons underJapanese jurisdiction, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms. For greatercertainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of thisarticle, human rights and fundamental freedoms include: Freedom fromarbitrary arrest and detention, from prosecution for an act or omission&quot; whichwas not an offence at the time committed, from the imposition of a heavierpenalty than the one that was applicable at the time the offence was committed;the right to a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartialtribunal, to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, to be defended; freedomof expression, of press and publication, of religious worship, or political opinion and of public meeting.&quot;It was agreed that individual Commonwealth Governments might wish to give further study to this proposal.45. It was also agreed that a clause of the kind envisaged would lose muchof its usefulness unless it were backed by more effective machinery than had beenprovided in the European treaties (namely, commissions for dealing with breaches of human rights). It was suggested for consideration that provision might be made
to enable one party to a disagreement arising out of the human rights clause to request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to make an appointment tothe commission should the other party refuse.46. It was generally agreed that in addition to the possible inclusion of a clause on the lines of that discussed above, the position of alien residents in Japanmight also be safeguarded by the inclusion of suitable provisions in bilateral treaties of commerce and establishment or in consular conventions.47.   It was generally agreed that id) The Japanese Government should undertake in the treaty to prevent theresurgence of undesirable political societies. It would be necessary to describe the nature of objectionable societies in general terms, and alsoto mention by name by way of illustration certain of the ultra-nationalistic societies which had existed before the war.(b) A reference to the responsibility of the Japanese militarist regime for havingprovoked a state of war, in terms similar to those used in the Italianpeace treaty, should be included in the preamble to the treaty.id) It would probably be desirable to avoid specific reference in the treaty to sponsorship of Japan for membership of the United Nations. Thiswas, however, a matter which Commonwealth Governments might liketo consider further.id) A provision on the lines of Article 40 of the Italian Treaty would be re-quired to ensure that all Japanese rights in respect of the mandate system&quot; and all special rights of the Japanese State in respect of any mandated territory&quot; should be renounced. (South Africa attached particular importance to the inclusion of such a provision because of the positionin regard to the former mandated territory in South-West Africa.)(e) Japan should renounce all rights in various international agreements (to benamed in the treaty) including the Congo Basin Treaties, the Treaty ofLausanne and the Straits Convention of Montreux.if) Provision should be made for notification of revival of pre-war bilateraltreaties between Japan and any signature to the peace treaty.ig) Japan should be required to conform with international agreements forthe control of narcotic drugs.ih) Provision should be made for dealing with the sentences of war criminalsafter the conclusion of a peace treaty.48. Consideration was given to the desirability of including in the treaty a clause designed to protect Japanese citizens who had sympathised or co-operated with the Allies between the outbreak of war and the signing of the treaty. It was generally agreed that this was a point which most directly concerned the UnitedStates, and that there would probably be no objection to the inclusion of such aprovision if the United States so desired.49. The New Zealand delegate suggested for consideration that the peace settlement might be divided into two parts. One part would include those pro-visions which the Allies were determined to enforce, while the other would include all provisions which could only be made effective through the goodwill of Japan.The latter part might be more in the form of a declaration of intention on thepart of Japan. It might be that Japan would be more likely to develop on the lineswe desired if she herself were voluntarily to declare her intention to abide by certaincodes of conduct, than if she were to be formally obligated in the treaty of peace.There would thus be certain provisions which would definitely be imposed on japan, and certain others which would be in the form of a voluntary statement of intention on Japan&apos;s part; these latter should include a number of Far eastern commission basic policy decisions. Such a procedure might well commend itselfto the United States. It was generally agreed that this was a suggestion whichmerited further study.50. It was generally agreed that the treaty should not impose on the Japanesethe obligation to maintain in perpetuity their present constitution. It was suggested,however, that if it were decided to divide the peace settlement into two parts onthe lines suggested above, Japan might be prepared to give some general declara-tion of her intention to act in accordance with the fundamental principles set outin the constitution.
51. There was a general discussion on the future of the Far Eastern Commis-sion and the Allied Council. The Far Eastern Commission could only come to anend as the result of an agreement reached in accordance with its own voting pro-cedure, i.e., including the concurring votes of the four veto powers. If a peace treaty were to be concluded without the participation of the Soviet Union and china, the question of the disposition of the Far Eastern Commission and theAllied Council would come up for consideration. It was agreed that Common-wealth countries might wish to give further study to this question. The working party was inclined to the view that the problem of the termination of the far eastern Commission and the Allied Council need not be regarded as an insuperableobstacle to the conclusion of a peace treaty without Russia and China.Enforcement Provisions52. The discussion revealed the existence of differences of view on thenecessity and desirability of setting up post-peace treaty control machinery in japan.New Zealand doubted whether remote controls would by themselves be ade-quate, and considered that some machinery of control should be established in japan, although recognising that the agreement and co-operation of the UnitedStates would be an indispensible requisite. New Zealand also felt that the Japan-ese must be bound by the treaty to admit the validity of any enforcement actionwhich might subsequently be taken in pursuance of it.United Kingdom opinion was becoming more and more averse to physicalcontrols within Japan. The United Kingdom view was that in considering how far the provisions of the treaty could be enforced, it would be necessary to take intoaccount the extent to which the countries concerned would be prepared to go either in the use of force or in the imposition of economic sanctions. In the Canadianview it would be difficult to devise any machinery that would be effective without being cumbersome but it would be useful to consider the possible value of long-range controls.Australia felt that the dangers of a Japanese military revival might be guarded against if the United States were to enter into a defence agreement with Japan, but nevertheless that there should be some enforcement machinery within Japan as wellas long-range economic controls.South Africa considered that enforcement was the crux of the problem; but didnot think that much could usefully be said on the subject without some knowledgeof the views of the United States, which bore so large a share of responsibility forthe security of the Pacific area.The Indian view, with which Ceylon and Pakistan were in general agreement,was that some broad multilateral framework of security would provide the most desirable solution; the political disadvantages of interference in Japanese domestic affairs would be greater than the possible advantages to be derived from enforce-ment machinery in Japan.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th May, 1950.
ANNEX a united States Enquiry Implications of a Peace Treaty without the soviet union and china the Working Party had before them a paper setting out a problem whichthe State Department had put informally to the British Embassy in Washington.The State Department had suggested that the problem might be put before theWorking Party.2. If a treaty of peace with Japan were concluded without the participation of the Soviet Union and China, and if at the same time the United States retainedmilitary bases in Japan, the Americans apparently considered it possible that thetwo Communist powers might indulge in various forms of obstructive activity. both these powers would still be technically at war with Japan and might, therefore,be able to make out a case for seizing Japanese ships, &amp;c. They might also interferewith supplies sent to Japan from the United States. The United States was anxiousto know what support she could count on from other friendly powers in such a situation.3. The Working Party were generally agreed that while it would be possible tomake out a case on paper in justification of certain forms of obstructive action, theSoviet Union and China would hardly be likely to take any steps which might lead to conflict unless they had already decided to do so on other grounds. More-over, action against Japan by the Soviet Union and China of the kind suggested would naturally arouse the resentment of the Japanese, and would render remotethe possibility of turning them against the Western powers.4. It was agreed that the question as posed was one which was clearly outsidethe terms of reference of the Working Party, but it was suggested that individualCommonwealth Governments might wish to discuss the problem with the UnitedStates Government.ANNEX BProblems which the Working Party considered could be the subject ofFurther Study by Individual Commonwealth Governments with a viewto a later Exchange of Views through Normal Channels1.
