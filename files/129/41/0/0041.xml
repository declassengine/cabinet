O 4; JE DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETPOSITION OF THE BRUSSELS TREATY powers memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at their meeting on 11th August (C.Mi.(50) 53rd Conclusions), theCabinet invited me to inform the Foreign Ministers of France, the Nether-lands, Belgium and Luxembourg, in confidence, that the United KingdomGovernment were giving favourable consideration to a proposal for a two-year period of military service, and to enquire whether their governments would proceed with a similar proposal.2. I have received the first provisional reactions of the French,Netherlands  &apos;and Belgian Ministers.     They are not particularly encouraging,but all three Ministers promised that the matter would be urgentlyexamined by their Governments, and we may expect further repliesshortly.3. The French Cabinet will meet on 16th or 17th August.     In themeantime, M.  Pleven gave H.M. Minister the impression that his Govern-ment would find it hard to extend the length of national service, though hesaid the fact that they were proposing to raise 15 divisions obviouslyimplied an eventual and considerable extension of military service.     he felt it essential, however, that there should be a joint plan of action and nota series of individual decisions on separate points, and he referred to theFrench Governments memorandum to the United States Government in whichthey announced their intentions in regard to. increased defence expenditure and pressed for increased United States and British forces to be stationedon the Continent.     It was clear that M.  Pleven was still thinking on thelines that France must know how much help she is to receive before sheundertakes any substantial new effort herself.4. The Netherlands Foreign Minister, Mr.  Stikker, said he personallywas in favour of increasing the period of military service in his country from 12 to 18 months and that he would bring the matter before the DutchCabinet on 14th August.     He thought, however, that it would be verydifficult for them to increase length of service owing to the effect whichit would have on the economic well-being of the country, and he did notthink it possible that even a decision of principle could be taken immediately.C.?.(30) 191COPY NO. O d15TH AUGUST, 1950CABINETSERVICE MAN-POWER:

5. M. van Zeeland, now Belgian Prime Minister, said he saw no possibility of this subject being considered by the Cabinet before 18thAugust.     In the meantime, he promised that the new Government wouldtake its full share of any common measures resulting from His Majesty&apos;governments initiative and said he would recommend to the Cabinet anextension of the term of Belgian military service, though he could make no statement about the amount of the extension.     He also asked forfurther information about our own proposals, which I have given him.6. I am satisfied that we must leave the four Governments tograpple with the internal aspects of this problem, without puttingfurther pressure on them.     They will be fully aware that when HisMajesty&apos;s Government announce an extension of military service from18 months to 2 years, their own 12 months1 service will look to public(and especially American) opinion very inadequate, and I feel fairlycertain that they will pake the opportunity offered them of acting to someextent in concert with us.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,1 5TH AUGUST,&apos; 1950.
