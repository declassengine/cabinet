ECONOMIC ACTION ARISING OUT OF the korean CONFLICTMemorandum by the Minister of state the following is a summary of the proposals for economic actionarising, directly or indirectly, out of the Korean conflict which have sofar been considered, and of the action which has so far been taken,A recommendation for further action is contained in paragraph 3 below.A separate memorandum (C. P. (50) 157) has been circulated on thecontrol of strategic exports to China and North Korea.Economic Sanctions against North KoreaI. The United States authorities are now applying an embargo cn alltrade with North Korea.    They recognise that there has, in fact, been verylittle trade with North Korea.    They have informed H. M. Embassy in washington, however, that they understand that there has been a certainamount of trade passing between Hong Kong and North Korea and they have asked whether we would apply economic sanctions to this trade.   In making this approach a State Department representative emphasised the importance attached by the United States Government to our willingness to do so.    Itis in fact the case that practical ly all the very limited amount of trade between the sterling area and North Korea has been conducted throughHong Kong.   A telegram enquiring whether immediate measures could be imposed to prevent any shipment of goods from Hong Kong to North Korea hasbeen sent to the Officer Administering the Government.   No reply has yetbeen received although the Officer Administering the Government hadalready stated that no vessels had been cleared from Hong Kong for Koreasince the outbreak of hostilities and that no clearances were pending.   he added that all applications for exports to Korea (North and South) andManchuria  were being subjected to careful scrutiny with a view to thecontrol of strategic materials.3. Although there is in fact no direct trade between the UnitedKingdom and North Korea it would be desirable on general political grounds to make the gesture of prohibiting the export of goods from the UnitedKingdom to North Korea.   Such a move would strengthen the hands of the hong Kong Government in regard to any measures they themselves mayintroduce, and would be welcomed by the United States.    The Board of trade have stated that appropriate arrangements can be made on request.I recommend therefore:(a)       that the Board of Trade should be invited to make an order prohibiting exports from the United Kingdom to North Korea;IPCOPY NO.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 1553RD JULY, 1950CABINET

4 0To(b)       that the Colonial Office should be invited to arrange with theGovernment of Hong Kong for the imposition of appropriate measures to prevent any shipment of goods from Hong Kongto North Korea.Proposal to suspend oil deliveries to China4. The State Department have informed us that they have instructed the United States oil companies chiefly concerned to suspend all oildeliveries to Communist China and have asked whether we would be preparedto bring pressure on Shell (the only major British supplier) to suspendtheir deliveries similarly.    This would amount to a reversal of the policy we have hitherto pursued towards China and might well have serious repercussions on the position of Hong Kong.   A reply has, therefore, beensent to Washington to the effect that Shell!s current oil supplies to Chinaare so small as to be of negligible importance (they have for some time been limited to the company&apos;s share of Chinese normal civilian requirements) andthat Shell will be requested not to increase them.Legal and United Nations Aspects5. The legal advisers of the Foreign Office consider that theaction so far taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in support of South Koreais in accordance with Article 39 of the United Nations Charter, which lays down that when the Security Council has found that an act of aggressionexists, it may either make a recommendation, or decide that measuresshall be taken under Articles 41 and 42.    The Security Council resolution was, in effect, in the form of a recommendation that members of the united nations should furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may benecessary to repel the armed attack and to restore internal peace and security.    The Security Council has not taken any decision under Article 41.Any economic action against North Korea should not, therefore, beconsidered as the application of economic sanctions in accordance with article 41 of the Charter, but as voluntary acts of policy taken inaccordance with the recommendation contained in the Security council resolution.    For this reason the United Nations Act, 1946, is not applicable.K. G. Y.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,3RD JULY, 1950.
