[(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 18024TH JULY, 1950COPY NO. 6 (*CABINETSERVICE COURTS-MARTIAL,Memorandum by the Lord chancellor and the Minister of defence at their meeting on 15th December, 1948 (C.M.(48) 81stConclusions, Minute 3), the Cabinet had before them the report (sincepublished as Cmd.    608) of a committee under the Chairmanship ofMr.  Justice Lewis on Army and Air Force Courts-Martial, togetherwith the report of an inter-Departmental committee of officials con-taining Departmental views on the recommendations of the lewis committee.2. In a covering memorandum (CP.(48) 300) submitted by theLord Chancellor, by agreement with the Minister of Defence and theService Ministers, it was recommended that the two principal proposalsof the Lewis Committee should be accepted with certain modificationsand provisos recommended by the official committee.     These proposals were, first, the setting up of an Appeal Court under the presidency of a chief Judge Martial, with the abolition of the present procedure of con-firmation of proceedings and legal review by the Judge Advocate Generaland his staff,   and, secondly, that general courts-martial and districtcourts-martial, when trying serious cases, should have as president a civilian lawyer whose functions would be similar to those of a Judge ina Court of Assize.3. Doubts were felt by some members of the Cabinet as to thevalue of the proposed appeal procedure, in comparison with the existing system, and as to the desirability of adopting in peace a system whichthe official committee considered would be impracticable in war.Moreover, the Lewis Committee had not covered naval courts-martial.4. The Cabinet decided to defer consideration of the major issues raised by the reports, and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor, to set up a corresponding committeeto enquire into the procedure of naval courts-martial.     A committee under the Chairmanship of Mr.  Justice Pilcher was accordingly set up inFebruary, 1949.5. At their meeting on 21st February, 1949 (C.M.(49) 13th Meeting,Minute l), the Cabinet agreed to await the report of the Pilcher committee before taking final decisions on the Lewis Committee^ proposals.6. The Pilcher Committee reported on the naval court-martialsystem in February, 1950, and their report, in conjunction with theprevious reports on the Army and Air Force, has since been under

examination by an official working party.     Copies of the reports of thePilcher Committee and of the working party are attached to thismemorandum.A further report by the Pilcher Committee is awaited, but theChairman has already informed the Admiralty that their recommendations will not affect the present issues.7. It will be seen that the Pilcher Committee agree with the lewis committee in recommending the setting up of a Courts-Martial appeal court, but differ from them as to the constitution and powers of the court and also disagree with the proposal that a civilian lawyer should preside,so far as naval courts-martial are concerned.8. The working party have attempted to produce a compromisescheme which, while making provision for a Court of Appeal, will avoid the serious difficulties previously felt regarding the Lewis Committee&apos;sproposals, retain the very real advantages of the present systems, and be acceptable to all three Services.     Their proposal would, in effect, retain the existing court-martial systems, including automatic legal review bythe Judge Advocate General and his staff and the Judge Advocate of theFleet, coupled with a final right of appeal (with leave) to an Appeal Courtof high standing, linked with the Court of Criminal Appeal.     Normally one member of the Appeal Court would be a King&apos;s Bench Judge, but in special cases there might be as many as three.9. We have considered with the Service Ministers the important issues involved, and we are all strongly in favour of the solution recommendeby the working party, except on two points, viz. leave to appeal (paragraph29), where we agree that it should be open to one member of the appeal court sitting alone to grant leave, but consider that in case of refusal theman should have the right to apply to three members of the Court, as inthe Court of Criminal Appeal, and, secondly, the suggested exclusion fromappeal of questions involving standards of professional conduct, skill orduty (paragraph 40).     We think this must be left to the good sense of theCourt.10. If these proposals are approved in principle, the details can beleft to be settled between the Service Departments, the Lord Chaneellor&apos;office  and the Lord Chief Justice, but, shortly, the procedure will be asfollows:Courts-Martial will remain broadly analogous to a bench of magistrates, with a Service Officer presiding and, when required, aa Judge Advocate as a legal adviser.In the Army and R.A.F., the proceedings will be subject, asat present, to confirmation.     The accused will be able to submit onePetition against finding to the confirming authority before confirma-tion, and one to the Army Council or Air Council, after confirmation.A Petition against finding before confirmation will at home be referredto the Judge Advocate general s Office for legal advice.     Abroad itwill be referred to the Deputy Judge Advocate General in the Commandconcerned, or, if no Deputy Judge Advocate General is available, to the

1 &amp; uJ.A.G.&apos;s Office.     The legal advice in the case of the second (final)Petition will be given by the J.A.G. himself.     If there is no secondPetition, the proceedings (as with all other court-martial pro-ceedings) will be legally reviewed when they reach the J\A.G.&apos;office .     If the accused wishes to appeal (in the event of his secondPetition being refused) he can include with his Petition an applica-tion for leave to appeal.     If the Petition fails, the J.A.G. will thengrant or refuse leave to appeal.     Alternatively, the accused canawait the result of his petition before applying for leave to appeal,which he must do within a specified period.     If leave is refused, hecan apply to the Court-Martial Appeal Court, where the grant ofleave will rest with one member of the Court, and refusal, whichwill be final, with three members.     Appeals may be on grounds oflaw, or mixed law and fact, or, exceptionally, on fact only, as incivil cases under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907.In the Navy the procedure will be similar, except that con-firmation of proceedings will not be required.     In the Navy con-firmation of proceedings is not now required, but action to giveeffect to the finding and sentence is, if necessary, suspended by the convening officer pending review by the Admiralty.11.        The provisions for confirmation, petition and legal review will act as a filter to ensure normally that faulty proceedings are not con-firmed, or, if confirmed, are quashed, and the number of cases proceeding to appeal should thus, it is considered, be within the scope of the proposedCourts-Martial Appeal Court, whether in peace or in war.12,        We consider that this ultimate right of appeal to a Court of highstanding will fully satisfy reasonable public opinion, but that anythingshort of it will not do so,13.        The other two major issues, which may be controversial, arisingout of these reports, are the question of unanimity of finding and thequestion of other rank representation on courts-martial.14.         Unanimity, instead of the present majority verdict of guilt orinnocence,    is recommended by the Lewis Committee and by a minority of the Pilcher Committee.     The majority of the Pilcher Committee areagainst it and the official committee agree with them on practical grounds.We agree with the latter view and consider that, if an Appeal Court is setup as proposed in addition to the existing safeguards, there is no reasonto think that the present system of majority findings (which is of courseapplicable to a bench of magistrates) will involve serious risk ofinjustice.     Unanimity would be quite unworkable in war.15.        Other rank representation on courts-martial is supported only bythe minority report of Mr. A.R. Blackburn, M.P., a member of the lewis committee.     Otherwise both Committees are unanimous in rejecting it.The Secretary of State for Air has personally some sympathy withMr.  Blackburn&apos;s proposal for other rank representation at the option ofthe accused other rank, and points out that a system of this kind has actually been introduced in the United States Forces.     The Serviceview, however, with which the rest of us agree, is strongly against sucha proposal, and the Secretary of State for Air has no wish to press itin the circumstances.     It might be more difficult to resist logically ifthe &quot;Judge and Jury&quot;, instead of the &quot;Bench of Magistrates&quot;, system were adopted for courts-martial.

16.We therefore ask our colleagues to agree that:-(l)        A Courts-Martial Appeal Court should be accepted inprinciple and should be on the lines recommended by theofficial working party with the modifications we havesuggested.(2) The existing system of courts-martial with JudgeAdvocates, confirmation and legal review should continue,subject to detailed improvements which may be agreedDepartmentally.(3) The existing system of majority verdicts should continue.(4) Other rank representation on courts-martial should notbe accepted.(5) An early announcement of these decisions should be madeby the Minister of Defence, and the necessary legislation togive effect to them promised as soon as an opportunity occurs.(6) The drafting of the necessary legislation should be put inhand as soon as the necessary details have been agreed by theDepartments concerned and the Lord Chief Justice.J.e.s.24TH JULY, 1950.

CHAPTER IIntroductoryWe were appointed as a committee toy the First Lord of the admiralty on 17th February, 1949, with the following terms of reference:  To consider whether any changes are desirable in the administrationof justice under the court-martial system based on the Naval discipline act.A preliminary survey of our task satisfied us that before arriving at a conclusion on certain aspects of the court-martial system, we should have toconsider the extensive powers of summary jurisdiction&quot; vested fey the naval discipline Act in officers in command of His Ma&apos;jesty&apos;s ships, and also (fiatcertain of the recommendations we might make might affect the summarysystem. When we drew attention to this, our terms of reference were amended to read;  To consider whether any changes are desirable in the administrationof justice under the Naval Discipline Act.2. The members of the committee were:  The Honourable Sir Gonne St. Clair Piloher, M.C. (Chairman).Captain (S) E. Haslehurst, C.B.E., R.N. (Retired;).Mr, E. A. Hawke.Mr. R. E. Manningham-Buller,K.C..M.P.Admiral Sir Arthur F. E. Palliser, K.C.B., D.S.C. (Retired).Mr. A. L. Ungoed-Thomas, K.C., M.P.The joint secretaries were:  Mr. H. D. Samuel (Admiralty).Lieutenant Commander (S) G, W. D. Spriggs, M.B.E., R.N.3. We arranged for members of the public to be invited, toy press noticesand by a broadcast toy the British Broadcasting Corporation, to put forwardsuggestions on matters falling within our terms of reference. A similarinvitation was addressed to serving members of the Royal Navy and royal marines by Admiralty General Message and Admiralty Fleet Order. the invitations contained an assurance that all evidence and memoranda wouldbe treated as confidential by the committee, and serving officers and menresponding to our invitation were instructed to do so direct and not throughService channels. At the same time we informed a number of legal andother societies that we should welcome their views.We received memoranda from 41 serving officers and 33 men and from35 societies and members of the public ; many of the latter had seen service with the Fleet or the Royal Marines. A list of the societies and membersof the public who submitted memoranda is shown at Appendix A. Inaccordance with an undertaking which we gave when inviting memoranda,Appendix A does not include the names of serving officers and men whosutomitted memoranda in reply to our general invitation to the Fleet.   It3
does, however, include the names of those serving officers who, without having submitted memoranda in reply to our invitation to the Fleet, were at a later stage personally invited to furnish us with their views on specificquestions.We have heard oral evidence from 24 witnesses (including 15 serving officers and 2 men). A list of witnesses, which, like Appendix A, does not include all serving officers and men who gave evidence, will be found at appendix B.4. We desire to express our  hanks to those who submitted memoranda andto those who gave evidence before us for their help.5. We have met on twenty-five occasions, and in addition a DraftingSub-Committee consisting of the Chairman, Captain (S) Haslehurst andMr. Manningham-Buller has met ten times.6. The naval disciplinary system, founded on the Naval Discipline Act,1866, has to operate in circumstances which differ substantially from thosein the other two Services, and while we recognise that so far as possiblethere should be a common system of justice in all three Services, we have borne in mind that it is not desirable that the requirements of the navy should ibe subordinated to the desire to achieve uniformity.We have taken note of the recommendations made in the Report of theArmy and Air Force Courts-Martial Committee 1946 (Cmd. 7608, hereinafter referred to as the Lewis Report) but we have not assumed that the reeom-mendations which have not yet been implemented will necssarily be accepted.We have considered the naval system on its merits and our recommenda-tions are in no way designed to adapt the Lewis Report to the Navy, but rather to improve the naval system in the light of modern conditions in sofar as the administration of justice is concerned.7. While we should have preferred to present one report covering thewhole naval disciplinary system, it was apparent at an early stage that thewofk involved in the preparation of such a report would necessarily beprotracted.As we understand that decisions with regard to the Army and Air Forcesystem await our report on the naval court-martial system, we have con-centrated in the first place on the court-martial aspect of our terms ofreference.8. In this our first report we therefore submit those recommendations onthe naval court-martial system which it appears to us can safely be made without full consideration of the summary system. Our report on that will follow. We have thought it desirable to include in the present report acertain amount of general matter which will, we hope, give the backgroundagainst which the development of the existing system of administration ofjustice in the Navy can conveniently be considered.9. We have decided to defer consideration of questions relating to dis-ciplinary courts (see paragraph 24) until we have examined the summarypunishment system. We have therefore made no reference to such courts in this report, although the procedure used in them is identical with that used in courts-martial. We will indicate in our second report which of therecommendations which we make in this report apply to disciplinary courts.
CHAPTER  IIA SHORT HISTORY OF THENAVAL DISCIPLINARY CODE10. The earliest known example of a code of regulations for thegovernance of a naval force appears to be that laid down by Richard Iwhen he raised a fleet for a crusade. In early times there was, however,A no fixed code of naval law, but for each expedition the Lord High Admiral,or the Commander-in-Chief acting under powers delegated by the LordHigh Admiral or by commission from the Sovereign, issued regulationstor the punishment of offences and the maintenance of discipline. Acharacteristic of these was the considerable summary powers granted toCommanding Officers and the severity of the punishments specified for eachoffence.11. In the 16th century these regulations seem to have made no formalprovisions for courts-martial. Ordinances made by Lords Howard andEssex in 15% support the view that in the more serious cases a &quot;Councilof War &quot; was held which advised the &quot; General! &quot; of the facts and the appro-priate punishments. These Councils of War were probably the bodies outof which the naval courts-martial grew. A record of proceedings brought by Drake against the officers and men of the &quot;Golden Lion&quot; in 1587 showsthat the function of the &quot; general Courte &quot; was advisory and that Drakeregarded himself as having sufficient jurisdiction from Her Majesty to punishat his discretion. The term &quot; court-martial&quot; does not appear to have been applied to these bodies until later, though there is an interesting note in adiary of 1627 of a &quot; Martial Court&quot; which included a jury, and other records of the early 17th century suggest that trial by jury was then a commonpractice in the Navy.12. The growth of a permanent naval organisation dates from Henry VII,who instituted a standing Royal Navy. A change took place in 1628, whenas a result of the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham, then LordHigh Admiral, the office of the Lord High Admiral was for the first timeentrusted to commissioners. It was not until the Long Parliament that anattempt was made to codify the disciplinary system. A measure entitled&quot; An ordinance and articles concerning martial law for the governmentof the navy &quot; was discussed by the Lords and Commons early in 1645,but its fate is uncertain. In 1648, it having been found that &quot;great Incon-conveniences have ensued, for Want of a strict and severe Discipline to havebeen observed in the Navy or Fleet set forth by Authority of Parliament&quot;,ordinances were enacted authorising the Earl of Warwick, as Lord HighAdmiral, and his Council of War to inflict punishment &quot; according to theCivil Laws, Law Martial, and Customs of the Sea, and according to suchLaws and Ordinances&quot; as should be issued by the Lord High Admiraland his Council of War. In 1653 an ordinance constituting Commissionersfor managing the affairs of the Admiralty and the Navy empowered theCommissioners and &quot; one or both of the Generals &quot; at Sea to call &quot; Councelsof War &quot; of Captains or other officers, and to appoint a judge advocate toattend them, and authorised such councils to try members of the Navy and army at sea who had offended against the Articles of War. An interestingfeature of the &quot; Instructions&quot; issued in 1653 by the Commissioners wasthe three-tier system of courts which they instituted.   These were presided68022a2
over by the Chief Commander, subordinate Flag Officers and ships&apos; Captainsrespectively. The lowest court&apos; was thus a ship&apos;s court-martial, and thewhole system bore a resemblance to the system of General, District andRegimental courts-martial which formerly obtained in the Army.13. After the Restoration the organisation and administration of the Navyadvanced during the tenure by the Duke of York of the Office of LordHigh Admiral, with the advice and assistance of Pepys at the Admiralty.In 1661 Articles of War were passed by Parliament laying down a code of laws for the enforcement of discipline &quot; among the crews in actual serviceaboard men-of-war at sea or in the main stream of the great rivers belowthe bridges &quot;. It is safe to conclude that they were based on the ordinances  $!issued during the Commonwealth and on the instructions issued by Admiralsduring that period. This Act of 1661 is the first statute in which the navaltribunal is called a court-martial: &quot;... the Lord High Admiral, for theTime being, shall by virtue of this Act have full Power and Authority togrant Commissions to inferior Vice-Admirals, or Commanders in Chief ofany Squadron of Ships, to call and assemble Court-Martials, consisting ofCommanders and Captains &quot;. This Act, much amended in detail, is thebasis of the present Naval Discipline Act of 1866.14. The naval code, which had been amended on several occasions since1661, was consolidated in 1749. The principal changes introduced the oathof secrecy for members of courts-martial and extended jurisdiction to spiesand to offences committed on shore by crews of ships of war in any placeout of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions. It is to be noticed that of the 36 Articlesof War of this Act, 10 prescribe a mandatory sentence of death and 11specify punishment of &quot; death or such other punishment ... as the court shall deem the offender to deserve &quot;. A striking example of the inflexibleseverity of these laws was the result of the trial of Admiral Byng in 1756.The Admiral was found guilty &quot; of not having done his utmost to take anddestroy the ships of the enemy &quot;. Under the 12th Article of War therewas no alternative punishment to death and sentence was executed on the17th March, 1757, on the quarterdeck of the Monarque in PortsmouthHarbour. This raised a storm of protest amongst naval officers, but itwas not until 22 years afterwards in 1779 that the 12th and 13th Articleswere mitigated by the addition of the words &quot; or such other punishmentas the nature and degree of the offence shall be found to deserve&quot;. Bythe same Act, and shortly after the lengthy trial of Admiral Keppel, theprovision of the 1749 Act &quot; that no member of a court-martial should goashore, or leave the ship in which the court were assembled until sentencewas given &quot; was repealed. It remained necessary, however, for the court to be held in a ship.15. The 19th century saw a gradual modification of the criminal law ofEngland. In 1847 the severities of the old Act were further modified and alternative punishments were introduced for all but two of the remainingcapital crimes. In 1860 an Act which may be considered as the first editionof the present Naval Discipline Act was passed. It was followed by latereditions in 1861 and 1864, the last-named Act being repealed in 1866 bythe Act which, with minor amendments, is in force to-day. This legislationretained the principal features of the 1749 Act but modified the severity of some of the punishments to conform to the civil law. The list of punish-ments given in Section 52 of the Act includes at the bottom of the scale&quot; such minor punishments as are now inflicted according to the custom ofthe Navy &quot;.
16. Apart from amendments designed to adapt the naval code to changesin the civil criminal code, the Act of 1866 has been amended in 1884, 1909,1915, 1917, 1922, 1938 and 1941. The most important of the changesintroduced by these enactments were as follows:  (a) The limit of 42 days to summary sentences of imprisonment for offences other than desertion was extended to three months, except thatthe already existing limit of 10 weeks for absence without leave (whetherawarded summarily or by court-martial) was retained.   (1884.)(b) The execution of sentences of imprisonment (and later of detention)might be held over until the prisoner could be received into a properprison, but if kept in confinement while awaiting removal to prison thatime so spent was to be counted as part of his sentence.   (1884.)(c) The punishment of detention, already authorised for the Army,was created to prevent sailors convicted of offences against naval disciplinebeing subjected to the stigma of imprisonment.   (1909.)[(d) The striking of a superior officer was reduced from being a capitaloffence, and imprisonment or detention for absence without leave ceased,in time of war, to be limited to 10 weeks.   (1915.)ie) Provision was made for officers charged in time of war with dis-ciplinary offences to be tried by disciplinary courts with power of imposingpunishments inferior in the scale to detention.   (1915.)(/) Power was granted for courts-martial to be held on shore, but thereason for doing so had to be recorded in the proceedings.   (1915.)(g) Provision was made for the suspension of sentences of penal servi-tude, imprisonment and detention in certain cases.   (1917.)(h) Officers and men of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines who, byorder of the Admiralty (or Commander-in-Chief or Senior Naval Officerabroad) were serving in ships or establishments belonging to the naval forces of a self-governing Dominion were made subject to the laws and customs applicable to the ships and naval forces of that Dominion.   (1922.)CHAPTER  iii the PRESENT SYSTEM OF ADMINISTERINGJUSTICE   IN   THE   NAVYOffences by Ratings and Royal Marine Other Ranks17. A rating or marine alleged to have committed an offence is brought before the Officer of the Watch. If this officer considers the offence proved,he may award one day&apos;s extra work or drill under powers delegated to himby the Captain. If however such a punishment is inadequate, he will order the alleged offender to be brought before the Executive Officer (normallythe Commander who is second-in-command of the ship), who holds a dailyparade of defaulters. The Commander may also have delegated to him bythe Captain power to award certain minor punishments. If he does not use these powers or dismiss the charge as unproved, the accused is brought beforethe&quot; Captain. At this investigation the Master-at-Arms or other member of the
regulating staff (formerly known as the ship&apos;s police) reads the charge; the.Executive Officer states the case against the accused ; the Captain hears theevidence of witnesses in support of the charge and of such witnesses as the accused calls. The accusecTs Divisional Officer is present to assist him if required. The evidence is not given on oath, the accused is not required toplead, and he may either give his version of the case or ask his DivisionalOfficer to do so for him..18. The Captain may dismiss the case, or if he decides that the case isproved, he may either award one of the minor summary punishments whichdoes not require higher approval or propose one of the major summary punish-ments which, although awarded by the Captain, requires approval by a senior officer, usually a Flag Officer. Alternatively he may remand the accused witha view to applying for trial by court-martial.If the Captain decides to deal with the matter under his powers of sum-mary punishment, he is guided by regulations which prescribe maximumpunishments for various offences, scales of mulcts for leave breaking anddrunkenness and certain penalties consequential upon the offence or the punishment awarded.19. The same procedure is followed where the accused is a Chief PettyOfficer, Petty Officer or Non-Commissioned Officer, but if the Captain con-siders that the offence, if proved, would justify summary disrating or reduc-tion in rank, the accused has the option of electing trial by court-martial.Apart from this provision there is no right of electing trial by court-martial.Offences by Officers20. If an officer is alleged to have committed an offence the facts are reported to the Captain, who interviews the accused and hears any statement the wishes to make.If the accused is a subordinate officer (i.e., Acting Sub-Lieutenant, Mid-shipman or Naval Cadet) he can be punished summarily by the Captain orthe Commander-in-Chief abroad.Other officers cannot be so punished although the Captain may decide that the matter can appropriately be dealt with by recording a caution tothe officer in the ship&apos;s log. He may also decide to forward a copy ofthis entry in the log through his superior authorities to the Admiralty fornotation in the officers record. &quot; Logging &quot; is not, however, a punishmentunder the Naval Discipline Act and is no bar to subsequent trial, by court-martial.If the Captain considers the alleged offence too serious to be disposedof in this way, he remands the accused with a view to applying for trial by court-martial.Application for Court-Martial21. If the Captain decides to remand the accused officer or rating for trialhe is required to submit a report, known as the &quot; circumstantial letter&quot;,to the Flag Officer of his squadron setting out the circumstances on whichthe charge or charges are founded in sufficient detail to show the real nature and the extent of the alleged offences. This letter must not refer to theprevious character or conduct of the accused or to facts prejudicial to him,other than those which bear directly on the charge or charges, and is sentwith the charge sheet, a list of witnesses for the prosecution, a summary
of the evidence which it is expected these witnesses will give, and, if the accused is not an officer, an extract from his conduct sheet showing previousoffences in his present ship only and a copy of his service certificate.Convening of Court-Martial22. The Flag Officer, if empowered to convene courts-martial, examinesthe circumstantial letter and the accompanying documents to ensure that theyare consistent with one another and that the facts alleged, if uncontradictedor unexplained, will probably suffice to secure a conviction. If not satisfiedthat the alleged offence warrants trial by court-martial he sends the caseback for summary trial.If the Flag Officer is not himself able to convene a court, he forwardsthe documents to a senior officer, probably the Commander-in-Chief, whois so empowered and who then becomes responsible for the scrutiny and forthe further action described below. If the convening authority, whether theFlag Officer who first received the circumstantial letter or the senior officer to whom he forwarded it, decides upon a court-martial, he issues a warrantto an officer, not below the rank of Captain, instructing him to assembleand preside at the court-martial on a particular day. A copy of the cir-cumstantial letter and the charge sheet, as passed by the convening authority,but not of the summary of evidence, is sent with the warrant to the officerso selected.23. The president is the only member of the court nominated by the con-vening authority. The remainder of the court is composed of the officersimmediately following in seniority on the president present at the place oftrial. A court must have not less than five nor more than nine members ;usually it consists of five officers.The members of the court must be of the rank of Lieutenant or above and of at least 21 years of age. Most courts consists of Captains andCommanders.Only officers of the Executive Branch of the Royal Navy are eligible to sit. Those next in seniority to the president may for good reason be excusedfrom sitting, in which case the duty falls on the next senior officers.Disciplinary Courts24. In time of war the convening authority may, for disciplinary offencesby officers, order a disciplinary court instead of a court-martial. Adisciplinary court consists of from three to five officers (usually three) ofwhom one must be a Commander or of higher rank, all being nominated by the convening authority. Such a court may impose punishment in thescale in Section 52 of the Naval Discipline Act up to and including dismissalfrom His Majesty&apos;s service. Procedure at a disciplinary court is identical inall material respects with that at a court-martial.Except as explained in paragraph 20 above there is no power, as thereis in the Army and Air Force, to dispose summarily of a charge against anofficer.The Judge Advocate25. The Judge Advocate of the Fleet or his deputy or an officer especiallyappointed for the nurmse is required by the Naval Discipline Act to attendevery court-martial. In practice the Judge Advocate of the Fleet neverofficiates at a trial.   The Deputy Judge Advocate, who is an officer of the
Supply and Secretariat Branch of the Navy and nowadays usually a barrister,acts at important trials in the United Kingdom. At all other trials the coh-vening authority nominates an officer of the Supply and Secretariat Branchto act as deputy judge advocate. A note on the legal training of these officersis contained in Appendix C.26. It is the duty of the officiating deputy judge advocate (hereinafter referred to as the judge advocate) to forward to the accused copies of thecharges, circumstantial letter, summary of evidence and list of prosecutionwitnesses, to notify him of the time and place of the trial, to summon the witnesses and to make all necessary preparations for the trial. It is also his duty to give the prosecutor and the accused, if they ask for it, his opinionon any question of law relating to the charge or trial, and to inform the convening authority and the court of any informality or defect in the charges or in the constitution of the court. He has to advise the court to the utmostof his knowledge and ability, not only on questions relating to naval lawand court-martial procedure, but also on every question of doubt or difficultyv/ith reference to common and statute law, to the law and rules of evidence,and to the rules and regulations of the Service generally. Any advice hegives to the court has to be entered in the proceedings if he or the courtdesire it, and under recent Admiralty instructions he is strictly recommended to record all advice given to the court, whether in open or closed court.It is also his duty to take care that the accused does not suffer any disadvantage in consequence of his position or of his ignorance, or of his incapacity toexamine or cross-examine witnesses, or of any other reason.The Prosecutor27. The Captain of the accuseds ship is under a duty in ordinary cases to act as prosecutor. The Executive Officer sometimes does so, and the convening authority may appoint another &quot; competent person &quot; if for any reason it is undesirable or impossible for the Captain or Executive Officer to conduct the case. In recent years, particularly in cases involving compli-cated questions of accounts, it has become the practice to appoint an officerof the Supply and Secretariat Branch to act as prosecutor, and during the late war a small number of legally qualified Reserve Officers were also speciallyemployed as prosecutors in difficult cases or at busy ports.Representation of the Accused28. The accused can employ civilian lawyers to defend him and may incertain circumstances be able to obtain assistance from public funds to securelegal representation (see Appendix D). Alternatively, he may ask for anofficer or other person to defend him. If he has no specific wishes in thematter, it is the duty of his Divisional Officer to assist him.Procedure at a Court-Martial29. After the warrant convening the court, the names of the members ofthe court and of those excused have been read, the prosecutor or accusedmay object to the constitution of the court. If there is no such objectionor if it is overruled, the court, the judge advocate and the shorthand writerare then sworn.The judge advocate then reads the charge sheet and circumstantial letter.Before reading the circumstantial letter he warns the court that it is an exparte statement of the facts as the prosecution believes them to exist, thatsome of the facts may be in dispute, that some of the evidence on which the
prosecution relies may be inadmissible, that some of the witnesses may nottestify to some of the matters to which the prosecution expected they woulddepose; and that the facts set out in the letter consequently should only beregarded by the court as a statement of what the prosecution expects.to prove.It is the duty of the judge advocate to inform the court that the accusedhad been furnished with a copy of the charges, of the circumstantial letter,of the list of witnesses and of the summary of evidence not less than 24hours before the trial. The accused usually receives these documents con-siderably more than twenty-four hours before the trial.From this stage onwards the proceedings are very similar to those in thecivil courts, with the exception that the accused is not called upon to pleadto any charge but may do so, and the judge advocate does not sum up asdoes a judge in a criminal trial.If the accused pleads guilty and then makes a statement in mitigation, the judge advocate must advise the court whether his statement is compatible with his plea of guilty. If it is not, the trial proceeds as if he had not pleadedguilty.30. After the closing statements by the prosecution and the defence thecourt is cleared for the finding. The judge advocate remains with the court and advises it on points of law. The advice he gives must be recorded andforwarded with the proceedings to the Admiralty.31. The finding is determined by the majority, except for judgment of death (for which four votes out of five, or where the court consists of morethan five officers a majority of not less than two-thirds of the officers present,are required). The junior member votes first and then all the other membersvote orally in inverse order of seniority.The court&apos;s decision on any other question which may arise in the courseof the proceedings is similarly determined. If there is disagreement andif the division of votes is equal, the construction most favourable to the accused prevails. The finding is signed by every member of the court andthen read in open court.32. If the charge is found to be proved the judge advocate reads the accused&apos;s certificates and the accused or his friend can make a statement inmitigation of punishment and call witnesses as to character When the certifi-cates are read, the judge advocate reads to the court any entry relating tothe accused in the list of persons tried by court-martial or disciplinary court.The prosecutor is also invited to produce any entry against the accused inthe ship&apos;s log or any other official document containing a definite censurefor an offence committed before the offence which is being tried. Civilianconvictions are not proved save in so far as periods of imprisonment duringnaval service have been recorded on the service certificate of a rating.33. The court is then cleared for considering the sentence, which is deter-mined by a majority vote. The sentence, which is a single sentence coveringall charges, is signed by all members and by the judge advocate. It is then read in open court and usually takes effect immediately. The court is then dissolved and the president waits on the Commander-in-Chief or senior officer with a letter reporting the finding and sentence. If there has been a sentence of imprisonment or detention, this letter includes a definite recom-mendation whether or not the circumstances are considered to justify sus-pension of the sentence.
Procedure after the Trial34. After trial, the judge advocate supervises the preparation of theminutes of proceedings and transmits them as soon as possible to the con-vening authority. The latter has to satisfy himself of the general legality of the trial. If not so satisfied he may refrain from putting the sentenceinto effect until Admiralty directions are received. If satisfied that the trialis in order and if the sentence is one of imprisonment or detention, he eitherissues a committal warrant or suspends the sentence under the powers vested in him by the Naval Discipline Act. The convening authority then forwardsthe proceedings to the Admiralty with his comments. The sentence does not require confirmation and it is not within the convening authority^ powers to $alter either findings or sentence.35. When received at the Admiralty the proceedings are examined in thefirst place in the Naval Law Branch of the Secretary&apos;s Department. this branch is manned by civil servants without legal qualifications. It is thecustodian of all rulings and precedents on naval law. Proceedings of acontested trial are immediately referred by the Naval Law Branch to the judge Advocate of the Fleet. Proceedings where the accused has pleadedguilty are only referred to him when the Naval Law Branch considers thata point arises on which his opinion is required.36. The Judge Advocate of the Fleet is usually a King&apos;s Counsel in civilpractice. He advises the Board of Admiralty generally and in detail on theproceedings of courts-martial, calls attention to any irregularities or illegalitiesthat may have occurred in the course of the proceedings, but has no respon-sibility for advising on the sentence. He proposes such action as the legalrequirements of the case may necessitate, and advises on all legal questionswhich may subsequently arise out of it. He also advises when required on important legal questions concerning the general administration of justiceunder the Naval Discipline Act.* He has no department under him and he isin no way concerned, except at the review stage, with those aspects of eachcase which arise before and during the trial. The Deputy Judge Advocate(see paragraph 25) is his deputy in name only and does not share his duties.37. When the Judge Advocate of the Fleet returns the proceedings theNaval Law Branch submits them to the Board of Admiralty with a recom-mendation as to the appropriateness or otherwise of the sentence. This Branchalso advises the Board as necessary, after consulting any technical or otherAdmiralty departments concerned, on any points affecting the convictionwhich may fall outside the scope of the Judge Advocate of the Fleet.Action by the Board of Admiralty38. The powers of the Board of Admiralty, except as regards sentence of death, which can only be remitted by His Majesty, include the suspension,annulment or modification of the sentence, the substitution of a punishmentinferior in degree for the punishment imposed by and consequent upon the sentence, and the remission of the whole or any portion of that punishment.The Board cannot increase either the degree or the duration of any punishmentand, even if it is satisfied that the accused, while technically not guilty of thecharge brought against him, is clearly guilty of another offence of the sameclass involving a less degree of punishment, it cannot substitute a findingof guilty of the lesser offence.* This includes advising on the articles, explanatory memoranda and notes in the admiralty memorandum on Naval Court-Martial Procedure (B.R.11).
The gist of the advice given by the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, togetherwith any important comments by the Board of Admiralty, is forwarded byletter to the convening authority for the information of the court and inparticular of the judge advocate.Petitions39. Although the review by the Board of Admiralty is held in all caseswithout action by the accused, all persons convicted by court-martial canas often as they wish submit petitions to the Board. The first petition oftenarrives in time to accompany the submission of the proceedings to the Board.Such petitions may take one of two forms. Persons who have been com-mitted to a civil prison submit a petition under the prison regulations. all others do so under the provisions of Article 10 of the King&apos;s regulations and Admiralty Instructions (hereinafter referred to as K.R. and A.I.) forrepresenting complaints to higher authority. Such complaints are madeorally in the first place to the Captain of the ship, but if the complainant isnot satisfied with the treatment of his complaint, it is resubmitted in writingand passed to the next senior officer and so on to the Commander-in-chief and finally to the Board of Admiralty. Usually, however, it would be beyondthe powers of an intermediate authority to remedy the grievance of a personconvicted by court-martial, and such complaints would be forwarded withoutdelay through the appropriate channels to the Board of Admiralty.Infrequency of Naval Courts-Martial40. By reason of the wide powers of summary punishment held by Com-manding Officers, most offences committed in the Navy never reach the stage of trial by court-martial. This fact is reflected in the following tablesshowing the numbers of courts-martial and disciplinary courts held in theyears 1938-1948 and the numbers in the Royal Navy and Royal Marinessubject to the Naval Discipline Act during that period.table iCourts-martial and disciplinary courts held from 1st January, 1938 to list December, 1948	Ratings and	Officers			Royal			Year	Marine			Total	other	Courts-	Disciplinary		ranks	Martial	Courts (a)	1938   ...	20	16	_	361939   ...	23	14	3	401940   ...	42	37	70	1491941    ...	162	90	214	4661942   ...	274	92	205	! 5711943    ...	416	104	237	7571944   ...	566	119	290	9751945    ...	776	144	214	1,1341946   ...	443	80	87	6101947   ...	145	68	6(a)	2191948   ...	59	60		119Note:(a) Disciplinary courts arc held in &quot; time of war &quot; alone (Section 57A of the naval discipline Act).

In the preceding chapter we have outlined the existing procedure apply -ing to naval courts-martial. Before setting out our conclusions and recom-mendations we think it desirable to make a few general observations in orderto indicate the scope and character of the problems we have had to consider.42. The members of naval courts-martial have in the past been drawnexclusively from senior officers of the permanent Executive Branch. If therecommendations which we make later are accepted naval courts-martial will still consist in peace time of permanent officers of the Royal Navy of someseniority with a small admixture of reserve officers in time of war.43. A comparison of the figures of Army and Royal Air Force courts-martial given in Chapter II of the Lewis report with the figures of navalcourts-martial in Chapter III of this report for the years since 1938 showsthat the difficulties which face the Navy in administering the court-martialsystem, whilst similar in character to those which face the two other Services,are incomparably less in extent. In 1938 there were 36 courts-martial inthe Navy. Between 1st September, 1938, and 31st August, 1939, there were,123 in the Army and 219 in the Royal Air Force. In the year 1945, whenthe number of courts-martial reached their peak in all the three Services,there were 1,134 courts-martial and disciplinary courts in the Navy, and between 1st September, 1944, and 31st August, 1945, there were 49,113 courts-martial in the Army and 3,868 in the Royal Air Force. In the year 1948the courts-martial in the Navy had dropped to 119. Whilst we are not concerned
in this first report with summary procedure and whilst we do not desire to rule out the possibility that recommendations which we may make on thissubject in a future report may result in some increase of naval courts-martial,we have thought it right to draw attention to the practical scope of theproblem with which we have to deal.44. In peace time a high proportion of naval courts-martial deal withdisciplinary offences unlikely to involve any very difficult question of law.In war-time the proportion of such offences tends to increase.45. A naval court-martial is attended by considerable ceremonial andenjoys a high degree of prestige amongst officers and ratings in the royal navy. It is regarded toy the Navy as essentially a naval court and it is right that we should say that we have heard little evidence of any dissatisfaction-tion in the Royal Navy with the present system of administration of justiceby court-martial.46. We are satisfied that under modern conditions discipline can only be satisfactorily maintained if it is and is known to be firmly based upon justice.All the evidence before us goes to show that members of naval courts-martialtake a serious view of their responsibilities.CHAPTER  VCONSTITUTION   OF  THE   COURTMembership47. Once the president has been appointed (see paragraph 22) the member-ship of a naval court-martial is decided by seniority. All officers of theExecutive Branch present at the place of trial and next in seniority to thepresident, to the number required to form the court and to provide sparemembers, have to attend at the place where the trial is held unless excusedby the convening authority on grounds of sickness or urgent duty.48. Witnesses of considerable experience have told us that the strict appli-cation of this rule sometimes results in grave inconvenience to the Service.In time of war Captains of ships spending long periods at sea are often called to sit on courts-martial during their short spells in harbour, when they havemany other important duties to discharge. At some ports it tends to confinemembership to retired officers recalled for duty and serving ashore, who may not be best qualified to try offences committed at sea.In both peace and war the seniority rule often results in court-martialduty falling repeatedly on a small group of junior Captains and senior Com-,manders. It also makes it difficult to find well-balanced courts for a seriesof related trials, because it is likely that officers who have sat on one trialin the series will be objected to as members of subsequent courts. This make sit necessary to nominate Captains of successively greater seniority as presidentsof the second and subsequent courts, while the remaining members have to befound by summoning officers lower and lower in the list.49. This system, which dates from the eighteenth century, was undoubtedly&apos;intended to prevent the packing of courts, and some witnesses before usclaimed that it is to be preferred to the nomination of all the members of thecourt by the convening authority on the ground that it has a greater appear-ance of impartiality.15
We do not think there is any substance in this contention. Where thepower of excusal is widely exercised the court may be indirectly nominated by the convening authority.In the other two Services all the members of courts-martial are nominated,and we have no reason to suppose that this system, wh:ch has been in force for years, has led to absence of impartiality or to allegations of partiality.Having regard to the experience in the other Services, the desirability ofuniformity between the three Services where it can be secured without dis-advantage, and to the fact that the present system gives rise to grave incon-venience, we recommend that in future all members of the court shall be nominated by the convening authority. iIn our view the interests of the accused are adequately protected by his right of objection to any member of the court.Captain of the Accused&apos;s Ship50. It. is clearly undesirable that the Captain of the accused&apos;s ship shouldbe nominated as a member of the court. Even if he has not conductedthe preliminary investigation, it is inevitable that he will be aware of the general outlines of the case, and usually of the accused&apos;s previousrecord ; and with his concern for the discipline and good rame of his ownship&apos;s company he may not appear to be as disinterested as every memberof a court-martial should be. We therefore recommend that the captain of the aceused&apos;s ship should never be nominated as president or member ofthe court.51. There are occasions on foreign stations when the Captain is the onlyofficer of Captain&apos;s rank present, so that under the existing provisions ofthe Naval Discipline Act, Section 58 (7), a court-martial could not be constituted unless he were available as president. The regulations at presentprescribe that in such a case the preliminary investigation is to be undertaken by the Executive Officer, who is to sign the circumstantial letter. these regulations and others which might be devised cannot in our opinion over-come the objections mentioned in the preceding paragraph. We therefore recommend that special provision should be made that where the onlyavailable Captain is excluded by the rule which we have recommended, aCommander should be nominated president, and that the powers of a court-martial so constituted should be limited to trying persons below the rank of Commander.The Convening Authority52. It may on very rare occasions happen that the officer who is the properconvening authority on the station is himself concerned in an alleged offenceby another officer (e.g. a navigational offence) in which case it is obviouslyundesirable that he should nominate the court. Such a situation could,we think, foe met by a special regulation authorising the convening authorityto assign his power to convene the court to another Flag Officer, or if nonebe available to request the Admiralty to nominate the court.Extension of Membership of Courts-Martial to Others than Executive BranchOfficers53. Section 58 of the Naval Discipline Act is interpreted to mean that only officers of the Executive Branch of the Royal Navy of Lieutenanfs rank and above are competent to sit on naval courts-martial,
At first sight it may appear somewhat curious that the membership of acourt-martial should foe so restricted, and a number of witnesses have advocates-cated the abolition of this differentiation between officers of the Royal Navy.54. In justification of the present system it has been explained that theofficers of the Executive Branch are, with minor exceptions, responsiblefor the discipline of ratings of all branches and are alone entitled to assumecommand of seagoing ships. In discharging these responsibilities, executive officers acquire great experience of investigating offences and of administeringsummary punishments ; in the competition for promotion to the migher ranks particular stress is laid on their capacity in handling men. It is claimed that this system fits them for membership of a court-martial to a degree that is not attainable by officers of other branches.55. Whilst we recognise the great importance of these qualities in thefield of summary punishment, and in spite of the fact that a considerablenumber of the naval witnesses who appeared before us were opposed toany change, in our opinion it cannot be said that officers of other branchesof the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines and the Reserves are less competent to arrive at a proper conclusion upon the evidence as to the guilt or innocenceof the accused.56. It has been suggested that it might be desirable to limit the extensionof qualification to sit on courts-martial to the larger non-executive brancheswhose officers are accustomed to command an appreciable number of ratingsand may rise to command certain shore establishments. We have carefully considered this suggestion, but we do not think it is possible to make a validdistinction between those branches whose officers should be regarded asqualified and those whose officers should not.57. Officers of the Royal Marines are normally eligible to sit on Armycourts-martial when serving ashore. We regard it as an anomaly that theyare not eligible to sit on naval courts-martial when serving afloat and wehave no doubt of their competence to do so.58. The position of Reserve officers calls for some comment. In war timemany of them rise to command ships, while others have behind them usefulcivil experience which would make them valuable members of a court.59. Some witnesses expressed the view that at least one member of eachcourt should be nominated from the Branch or Reserve to which the accusedbelongs, because of his knowledge of the&apos; accused&apos;s conditions of service or technical duties. We are opposed to this suggestion. It would give thecourt a representative character, which is undesirable in itself, and would introduce the risk that the court might tend to rely on its own members forexpert advice, instead of obtaining it from witnesses whose evidence can be properly tested by cross-examination.Ratings as Members of Courts-Martial60. For this reason, among others, we are also opposed to the suggestionthat when a rating or other rank is being tried, he should have the right toask that the court should include one or more ratings or other ranks. Wedo not think that the inclusion of ratings would result in an improvementin the administration of justice. It is moreover probable that such a change would have an adverse effect upon discipline and in particular we considerthat a rating who had sat on a court might sometimes be in a most difficult position on the lower deck after the trial, whether it resulted in a convictionor in an acquittal.17
61 .* The fundamental principle -Which we recommend is that the conveningauthority should nominate the most suitable officers irrespective of the branchor.unit (Of the Service to which they belong.6.2.* We therefore recommend that Section 58 of the Naval Discipline Actshould he amended to provide that all officers of the Royal Navy, royal marines and the Reserves (except, for obvious reasons, Chaplains) who are21 years of age and of or above the rank of Lieutenant, Royal Navy, or equivalent rank, shall be eligible to sit as members of naval courts-martial.463.* While making this recommendation, we recognise the particular quali- &quot;fications possessed by officers of the Executive Branch (to which we have referred in paragraph 54) and the valuable and important part whidh, byreason of their training and experience, they can play in determining the correct sentence, and we are firmly of the opinion, and accordingly recom-mend, that the majority of the court, including the president, should beexecutive officers of the Royal Navy.64.* In order that the administration of justice in the Navy may appearto be and in fact be widely based, we think it desirable, where suitableofficers are available, that a minority of each court should be nominatedfrom officers of the non-executive branches, Royal Marines and Reserves,except in those pases, such as trials for the stranding and hazarding ofHis Majesty&apos;s ships, where the inclusion of non-executive officers would bemanifestly inappropriate. We recommend that when the court consists offive officers such a minority should consist of two, but we wish to emphasizethat the convening authority should in all cases be guided by the fundamentalprinciple to which we have referred in paragraph 61.65. It has been brought to our notice that much inconvenience can be caused by the requirement of Section 58 (3) of the Naval Discipline Actthat a court-martial shall not be held unless two of His Majesty&apos;s ships,not being tenders, are present. Under modern conditions it often happensthat there are large numbers of officers and men at a place (perhaps somedistance from a base port) where this condition is not attainable.If a serious offence is committed, it becomes necessary to transfer all the witnesses, the prosecutor, the accused and his friend to the nearest port wherethere are sufficient ships.We recommend that this clause should be replaced by a provision thatno court-martial shall be duly constituted if more than two members belong to the same ship as the accused. This will secure the safeguard which wepresume the present clause was designed to provide.Venue of Court-Martial66. We recommend on grounds of administrative convenience that Section 59of the Act should be amended to provide that a court-martial may be heldat such convenient place afloat or ashore as the convening authority orsenior officer present may appoint and that no special record of reasons for holding it ashore should be required.* Admiral PalHser does not agree with the recommendations in these paragraphs. his views are stated on page 52.
CHAPTER  vi the  JUDGE  ADVOCATEDuties of the Judge Advocate67. Although little criticism has been addressed by any witness to thepresent system of administration of justice by naval courts-martial, we donot lose sight of the fact that a naval court-martial is a court of lawconcerned primarily with the administration of justice and only incidentallywith the enforcement of discipline. Consisting as it does of naval officersuntrained in the law it is imperative that it should have available to itcompetent legal advice on any point of law which arises in the courseof a trial. At present it is the duty of the judge advocate inter alia toadvise on all questions respecting the admissibility of evidence, on the rules of law by which the evidence, when admitted, is to be weighed, on whether there is a case to answer, and also to explain and expound those general principles of law which are applicable to the point at issue.68. Not only may a naval court-martial try offences under Sections 2-44of the Naval Discipline Act (many of which are punishable by death) but alsoany offence under the criminal law of England. Consequently the task tobe performed by the judge advocate varies greatly. In a simple case his duties may be scarcely more than nominal. On the other hand in somecases of murder or mutiny and in complicated cases he may require to possess the knowledge and experience of a High Court Judge.Qualifications required by Judge Advocates69. The Naval Discipline Act does not prescribe that a judge advocateshould possess any particular qualifications. As we have pointed out (para-graph 25), in practice the Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet or other officers of the Supply and Secretariat Branch act as judge advocates. Instruc-tion in naval law is given to all Supply Officers (see Appendix C) and wedo not doubt that suitable officers can be found from amongst those soinstructed to perform the duties of judge advocate in the ordinary andcomparatively straight-forward cases which form the majority of those comingbefore naval courts-martial.70. We do not think however that such officers could generally be expectedto possess the necessary knowledge and experience desirable in the minority of cases of a very grave or complicated character. Supply Officers havemany other duties to perform, and, with the small number of naval courts-martial that are held, little opportunity of gaining much practical experienceof such cases.That the Admiralty should recently have instituted schemes whereby asmall number of Supply Officers can spend some time in a barristers chambersand be called to the Bar, is itself a recognition of this fact. While we welcome these schemes and hope that the day may come when it is not necessary to appoint as judge advocate anyone without legal qualifications,and while we recommend that the number of officers taking advantage of these schemes should be increased, it must be borne in mind that the Supply officer who is called to the Bar under them is not likely to possess more legalknowledge and experience than a barrister of one year&apos;s call and that theappointment of such a barrister to discharge judicial duties at a murder trialis inconceivable.
71. In every case the object must be to appoint as judge advocate a personwith the knowledge and experience necessary for the particular case, andto secure judge advocates sufficiently competent for very grave and com-plicated cases it is in our view necessary that the services of experiencedcriminal lawyers should be obtained. The number of cases in any year inwhich such assistance is desirable is likely to be small.Where the trial takes place in the United Kingdom, there should not beany difficulty in securing the services of such a barrister. Where the trial takes place outside the United Kingdom (and before the war themajority did so) we appreciate that on occasions there may be some difficultyin obtaining the services of a suitable man. In some cases there may beavailable locally a suitably qualified and experienced civilian lawyer either in civil practice ashore, or a member of the local judiciary, and in othersit should be possible to draw on the services of lawyers from the lord chancellor&apos;s department serving with the Army or the Royal Air Force.Provision of Judge Advocates72. We recommend that a panel should be drawn up and approved bythe Lord Chancellor of King&apos;s Counsel or other barristers experienced in theEnglish criminal law fit and willing to act as judge advocates at such trials.We envisage that the members of such a panel would toe suitably remuneratedon a day to day basis during their periods of employment. At the sametime we consider that the holder of the office of Deputy Judge Advocate ofthe Fleet, who is selected for that office on account of his knowledge and experience of courts-martial, and former holders of that office, should notbe ineligible for appointment as judge advocate in these cases.Classification of Cases73. It would no doubt be administratively convenient if we were to defineprecisely the class of case which in our opinion comes within the categoryin which the court should have the assistance of a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer. It has been suggested to us that where the offence ispunishable by death or by the civilian courts with six months&apos; imprisonmentor more, the duties of judge advocate should be performed by one of HisMajesty&apos;s Counsel.- We do not think that such a line can properly bedrawn. If His Majesty&apos;s Counsel were imported to act in all cases punish-able toy the civil courts with six months&apos; or more imprisonment, it wouldmean that often they would attend a trial unnecessarily.74. We have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to draw anyhard and fast line. All cases of a very grave character including of courseall offences punishable by death, all cases in which very difficult questionsof law or of admissibility of evidence may arise, and all cases of a very complicated character clearly come within this category. We think thatit must be left to the convening authority to decide with this guidance,whether or not the case falls within this description.At such trials we do not think that distance should in these days, save in very exceptional circumstances, warrant the appointment as judge advocateof a person with less than the requisite experience and knowledge.75. With regard to the other cases, which constitute the large majority,the appointment as judge advocate of a person with sufficient experience and knowledge for the particular case is equally important, and we recom-mend that officers of the Supply Branch who show particular aptitude for(his work should be &quot; starred &quot; and that steps be taken to see that at least
one such officer is available to undertake the duties of judge advocate ineach command, and that only such starred officers are appointed to act inthe more difficult cases which do not require the services of a civilianlawyer. ......Attendance of junior Supply Officers76. We understand that it is the practice for junior officers of the SupplyBranch to attend trials at which the Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleetor other experienced officer is officiating and to be sworn as assistants tothe judge advocate. We cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of practical experience in fitting Supply Officers to undertake the duties ofjudge advocate and we recommend that whenever possible the practice towhich we have referred should be extended, and that such officers shoulddn future be sworn as &quot; Supply Officers under instruction&quot; and should remain in court on all occasions when the judge advocate is present.Recommendations77. To sum up we recommend that:  (a) In all cases of a very grave character including offences punishableby death, in all cases in which very difficult questions of law or of admissi-bility of evidence seem likely to arise, and in all cases of a very com-plicated character, judge advocates should be chosen from King&apos;s Counseland other barristers experienced in the English criminal law, the DeputyJudge Advocate of the Fleet or former holders of that office.(b) In cases of less difficulty and gravity, &quot; starred&quot; Supply Branchofficers should act, and(c) In other cases &quot; unstarred&quot; Supply Branch officers should beemployed.Status and Title of the Judge Advocate78. In view of the recommendations of the Lewis Committee and in thelight of the evidence we have heard and read, we have carefully considered whether any change is desirable in the status or title of the judge advocate.79. The Lewis Committee recommended that a General Court-Martial inthe Army and Air Force should be presided1 over by a civilian judge martialor deputy judge martial who would act in all respects as a judge at anassize court, and that a district court-martial trying one of the more serious and difficult cases should be presided over by an assistant judge martial&apos;.The judge martial would rule on questions of law and as to the admissi-bility of evidence and on whether there was a case for the defence to answer.He would direct the court and not advise it.80. If it were the case that the advice given by judge advocates at navalcourts-martial was not followed by and accepted by such courts, then- thiswould be a cogent argument for making a similar change to that recommendedby the Lewis Committee. All the evidence we have received oh the point is to the contrary effect, and we accordingly do not recommend any suchchange on this ground.At the same time it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the advicegiven by judge advocates should be followed, and we recommend that asuitably worded instruction be issued by the Admiralty to this effect.
We further recommend that if in any case the court does not follow the. judge advocate&apos;s advice, the president should be required to record that-fact in the minutes, of the proceedings, together with the reasons for thefailure to do so.81. In addition to advising upon points of law and procedure the judge advocate is at present responsible for advising the court on every questionof doubt or difficulty with reference to &quot; the rules and regulations of theService generally &quot;.Whilst in some cases it may be that the person appointed as judge advocate!is very competent to give such advice, in others, including trials where a  civilian lawyer is the judge advocate, it would clearly be inappropriate that Whe should be obliged to do so in the circumstances which we contemplate,i.e. when it is binding upon the court either to accept the judge advocatedadvice or to record its reasons for failing to do so. We therefore recommendthat the words we have quoted should be deleted from the statement of the judge advocate&apos;s duites.*82. One argument in favour of a lawyer as president is that he couldhear arguments on the admissibility of evidence and evidence on that issue,e.g. whether a confession was obtained by threats, in the absence of those onKvhom responsibility rests for determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.A Judge of Assize can and usually does hear such arguments and evidence in the absence of the jury. Under the existing practice at naval courts-martial both the arguments and the evidence are heard bv all the membersof the court.,&apos;WheD the prosecution rely upon an alleged confession the accused mayallege that it was improperly obtained, and may give evidence in supportof his allegation. In cross-examination he may be asked questions withregard to the statement, such as whether he in fact said what the prosecutionallege he did, and whether the alleged confession was true. It follows that under the existing practice the naval court-martial in the process of determination-ing the admissibility of the alleged confession will in the majority of cases be(bound to learn its contents. It may be that the confession is held to beinadmissible. If it is and the accused is convicted, the impression may wellbe created that the evidence which led to his conviction was evidence which,if he had been tried before a jury, would not have been heard by them.While we are sure that members of a naval court-martial do their best to dismiss from their minds any evidence which they are advised is inad-missible in law, we feel that the hearing of such evidence necessarily placesthem in a very difficult and embarrassing position.83. Believing as we do that this difficulty can be overcome by an alterationof procedure, we do not recommend the appointment of a lawyer as president.Such a radical change would detract considerably from the naval characterof the court and it is one which upon the evidence we have heard would be most strongly objected to in the Navy.84. The alteration of procedure which we envisage and recommend is that power should be given to the president of the court, where the judge advocateadvises that it is desirable, to authorise the judge advocate to hear thearguments and evidence as to admissibility in the absence of the court insome convenient place to be decided by the president. After hearing thearguments and evidence, it would then be for the judge advocate to advise thecourt as to the admissibility of the evidence.  It is clearly desirable that a* K.R. and A.i. Article 444 (4).22
similar procedure should be adopted where there are several accused and application is made for separate trials.85. It is of very great importance that the judge advocate should be andshould appear to be entirely independent, and in our view the les&amp; he is orappears to be identified with the court the better. It is; for these reasons-thiat we do not recommend that he should be a member of the court ordescribed as the &quot; Legal Member &quot;, which at least would give that impression.We have heard no evidence which leads us to suppose- that the long-existingtitle of judge advocate causes the accused at naval courts-martial to think thatthe judge advocate is not only a legal adviser to the court but an advocatefor the prosecution as well.86. For these reasons we do not recommend any change in the title or status of the judge advocate.87. Where a civilian is appointed as judge advocate he should, if possible,sit in his legal robes.88. The Supply Officer acting as judge advocate may be and usually isinferior in rank to the president of the court. It is important that it shouldbe appreciated that in the performance of his duties as judge advocate, he isnot under the command of the president.Advice given by the Judge Advocate89. We recommend that all advice given by the judge advocate prior tothe closing of the court for the consideration of sentence should be givenin open court. The practice of the judge advocate remaining; with the courtduring consideration of the finding has in respect of the Army and Air Forcebeen condemned both by the Oliver Committee* and the Lewis Committee.It has now ceased in these Services. In our opinion it should also cease- inthe Navy.90. Before the court considers its verdict the judge advocate, should sumup the case. He should advise the court upon any legal point;. deal withthe burden of proof upon particular issues and indicate clearly the ingredientsof the offences with which the accused is charged. Where any question ofcorroboration is involved, he should explain the nature of the corroborationrequired and indicate whether in his view there is any evidence which,if accepted by the &quot;court, would amount to corroboration. Whilst we donot desire to preclude the judge advocate from summing up the evidence on aquestion of fact, we do not feel tbatas a-general rule this should be necessary.In complicated cases and cases where there is an acute conflict of evidenceit may however foe of assistance to the court to have a short review of theevidence relating to each issue or each charge.This will involve some departure from the present practice and throwa heavier burden on judge advocates. We note that&apos; a naval: eourt-martia1!frequently adjourns to enable a defending officer to prepare his speech. Ashort adjournment would no doubt be granted, if the judge advocate desiredit, to enable him to prepare his summing up.If after the judge advocate has summed up and the court has been closedf for consideration of its finding, any further advice is required from- the judge advocate, the court should be re-opened and the advice be given by the judge advocate in the presence of all parties.91. When the court closes to consider sentence, in our opinion the judge advocate should remain with the court, for his advice will no doubt be ofgreat assistance to its members.* Cmd. 6200.23
Duties of the Judge Advocate before the Trial92. The judge advocate is also at present charged with the following dutiesbefore the trial:  . (a) To provide the accused with copies of the charge sheet, circumstantialletter and summary of evidence, to inform him of the time and place ofthe trial, and that it is competent for him to give evidence on his ownbehalf.(Jb) To inform the prosecutor of the time and place of trial, and to obtain from him copies of any entries in the ship&apos;s log, etc., relating to the accused.(c) To summon the witnesses for the prosecution and the defence.id) To give advice on any question of law, if asked, to the prosecutor orthe accused.(e) To inform the convening authority of any informality or defect inthe charge or charges.We think that it is undesirable that the judge advocate should be con-cerned in any way with the preparations for trial, and we recommend thatthe convening authority should appoint another suitable officer of the SupplyBranch, who, we suggest, should be called the clerk of the court, to perform the duties described in (a), (b) and (c) above ; this officer should also besworn and be present in court to assist the judge advocate during the pro-ceedings.We also consider that it is undesirable that the judge advocate should give advice on questions of law before the trial commences and it should be clearly established that the judge advocate should take no part in assistingor advising upon the case for the prosecution or upon the charges to be preferred. We think that neither the prosecution nor the defence should have any difficulty in obtaining competent advice from some other experiencedofficer of ,the Supply Branch. We think it desirable, however, that the judge advocate should remain under the duty of informing the convening authorityof any defect in the constitution of the court. Action by him before the trialcommences may lead to the defect being remedied, in which case considerablewaste of time may be avoided.CHAPTER  vii the  PROSECUTIONThe Captain as Prosecutor93. Article 439 (3) of K.R. and A.I. is in the following terms:-&quot; It is the duty of the Captain of the ship to which the accused belongsin ordinary cases to act as prosecutor, but if for any reason it is undesirable for the Captain or Executive Officer of that ship to conduct the prosecutionthe convening authority shall appoint a competent person to undertake this duty.&quot;94. That this duty of acting as prosecutor should be laid upon the captain of the accused&apos;s ship appeared to some of us to be surprising, as there seemto be weighty reasons against it. From the earliest times it has been regarded in the Navy as the Captain&apos;s duty to prosecute because he is responsible forthe maintenance of discipline in his ship.  It was claimed by some witnesses
that the rating regards it as quite normal that the officer who has investigatedhis alleged offence and might have dealt with it summarily should himself actas prosecutor if a court-martial is ordered. Whilst this may be so we are completely satisfied that the practice is, at any rate in modern times, bothinconvenient and undesirable.95. The following are the principal reasons which have led us to this conclusion:  (i) It is just as essential to the adminstration of justice that the case forthe prosecution should be competently presented as that the accused shouldbe competently defended.If the case for the prosecution is not properly presented the defence maybe prejudiced or a guilty man may escape the punishment he deserves.Whilst we do not envisage that the case for the prosecution will always be conducted by an officer with some legal training, we feel that it shouldbe conducted by some officer who is free from the many responsibilities which necessarily fall on the Captain of a ship and which may preventhim from giving to this duty all the attention which he would desire.(ii) The Captain has in most cases investigated the incident which forms the subject matter of the charge and applied for trial by court-martial.While we have heard no suggestion that Captains do not prosecute fairlyto the best of their ability, we do not think that any Captain should be exposed to the accusation of pressing the prosecution in order to vindicatehis judgment.(iii) If, as is usually the case, the accused is defended by an officer ofhis own ship, the latter may be influenced, albeit subconsciously, in the efficient and vigorous conduct of the defence by the fact that his Captainis the prosecutor. Similarly witnesses from the accused&apos;s ship may testifyless freely than they would if the prosecutor was not a person with whom they stood in a disciplinary relation.We accordingly recommended that the practice that the Captain of the accused&apos;s ship should act as prosecutor should cease.The Prosecutor in Future96. The regulation which we have quoted above provides that when neitherthe Captain nor the Executive Officer can act as prosecutor the conveningauthority shall appoint &quot;a competent person&quot; to undertake the duty.We recommend that the prosecutor should in future always be appointedby the convening authority and that in making his choice the conveningauthority should be governed solely by consideration of the competence ofthe selected officer to undertake the particular prosecution. Thus in casesinvolving complicated questions of accounts it will, no doubt, be desirableas a rule to follow the practice which at present prevails of appointing anofficer of the Supply Branch who will not only be well qualified to deal withaccounts but will have some legal training. In more serious cases or casesrequiring very careful handling the convening authority should be entitledto engage the services of a competent civilian lawyer. There appears to be nothing in the existing regulations to prevent him from doing so, provided the expenditure is authorised.97. Our attention has been drawn to a curious provision in the regulations(K.R. and A.I. Article 443 (7)) that &quot; ... in the event of there being noprosecutor, the court and the judge advocate shall ask such questions of the witnesses as may be necessary to bring the whole case fully before the court.&quot;
We understand that this regulation is a survival from remote times whencourts-martial were often held without a prosecutor, but that for many years.it has been the practice always to appoint a prosecutor.We recommend that this regulation should be cancelled so as to remove any possibility of doubt that a prosecutor is necessary.The Charge Sheet98. It should be made quite clear that the prosecutor is responsible for the correct drafting of the charges, subject to the approval of the conveningauthority when he issues his warrant for the trial. We recommend that the convening authority should countersign the charge sheet when he has passed it.99. It has been brought to our notice that it is often a matter of some difficulty for the defence to trace the section of the act under which eachcharge is brought. We recommend that each charge should contain a state-ment such as &quot; contrary to Section 17 of the Naval Discipline Act&quot; or-incases brought under S.45 of the Naval Discipline Act &quot; contrary to Section&quot;20 (1) (iv) (a) of the Larceny Act, 1916 &quot;.100. We have recommended in paragraph 92 that the judge advocate should no- longer be responsible for the correctness of the charges.CHAPTER viii the  DEFENCERepresentation of the Accused101. The accused has an unrestricted choice in selecting a person to conducthis defence at a court-martial.102. If he wishes to obtain civilian professional assistance he may incertain circumstances be eligible for a grant from public funds towardsits cost; this scheme is in force in all three Services and is outlined inAppendix D. In the Navy it only applies at present to trials held in theUnited Kingdom.103. Should the accused prefer or be obliged to obtain assistance from within the Service, he may request any officer or man of his choice to defendhim; if he is unable to obtain the help of anyone it is the duty of the officerof his division to act as the &quot; accused&apos;s friend &quot;. He can also ask for hisCaptain&apos;s advice in the choice of a suitable defending officer.104. Some witnesses have expressed doubts as to the competence of manyof those who have appeared as &quot; accused&apos;s friends &quot; at courts-martial.It is important that the accused should have the assistance of a personthoroughly competent to conduct bis defence, having regard to the charges and the nature of the case.Whether or not the accused asks for advice in the choice of a defendingofficer, it is, we think, clear that a responsibility rests on the Captain to seethat a competent defending officer is available. In this connection full use should be made of Supply Officers who have undergone the more advancedlegal training.
The title &quot;Accuseds Friend&quot;105. We recommend that the title &quot; accused&apos;s friend&quot; should be abandonedin favour of &quot; defending officer&quot;, which we think is a more appropriatedescription and could be applied to any person carrying out these duties.Conduct of the Defence106. The regulations for procedure at courts-martial contain a clause which provides that &quot;... a person assisting an accused person may ... bypermission of the president, but not otherwise, examine him if he desires togive evidence and cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and examinethose for the defence &quot;.We have been told that for many years the grant of the presidents per-mission for the defending officer to perform this duty has been regardedas a formality and is never withheld. Nevertheless we think that there shouldbe no possibility of restricting the defence in this way, and we recommendthat this archaic regulation should be amended to make it clear that the accused or his defending officer examines and cross-examines witnesses byright and not by permission of the president.107. We think it is important that an accused person should be in nodoubt about his rights at all stages of the proceedings. At present he canask for information from his Divisional Officer at any time, but we recommendthat when the charge sheet and accompanying documents are given to the accused, he should also be given a leaflet setting out in simple terms hisrights before, during, and after trial. This leaflet should in particular dealwith: -The choice of a defending officer.The use of the scheme for civilian professional defence.Objection to the constitution or jurisdiction of the court.Pleas in bar.Giving evidence himself.Calling witnesses.Statement in mitigation of punishment.Petition, review and appeal.CHAPTER IXPROCEDUREProving Jurisdiction108. The present procedure for proving jurisdiction at naval courts-martialappears to us to be somewhat cumbersome. A witness who is personallyacquainted with and able to identify the accused and who can testify tohaving examined the books of the accused&apos;s ship and to having found thatthe accused, on the material dates, was borne on the books of that ship,has to be called by the prosecution. If the accuseds ship is not present, acopy of the relevant ledger extract has to be obtained.We recommend that the charge sheet should be headed by the name anddescription of the accused and the statement that he is subject to the naval discipline Act.  Before the charges are read, the accused should be asked
whether he is the person named and whether the description, including thestatement that he is subject to the Naval Discipline Act, is correct. Admissionof these matters by the accused should be adequate proof of jurisdictionIt should seldom be necessary to adjourn the court to enable the prosecutionto bring witnesses to prove the courfs jurisdiction. Incidentally, the adoptionof this recommendation will bring the naval procedure into line with thatof the Army and Air Force.The Circumstantial Letter109. The circumstantial letter (see paragraphs 21 and 29) is read outby the judge advocate at the commencement of the court-martial and takes the place of an opening speech by the prosecutor. It is sent by the conveningauthority to the president with the charge sheet and warrant ordering theassembly of the court. At many trials, we are told, copies of the circumstan-tial letter and charge sheet are handed to the other members of the courtat the commencement of the proceedings.Where the circumstantial letter contains detailed navigational information,we think that that part of it should be sent to the president with the chargesheet and that there is no objection to the other members of the court being supplied with copies of that part immediately before the letter is read.A great deal of the detailed navigational information is not likely to bein dispute and if the members of the court have such information before them,they will no doubt find it easier to follow the navigational matter and thearguments based thereon.- In other cases it is in our view undesirable that the president and membersof the court should have copies of this statement of the case for the prosecu-tion to which they can refer during the trial, when they do not have beforethem a similar statement of the case for the defence.We therefore recommend that in all other cases the circumstantial letter should not be sent ito the president before the trial commences and thatcopies should not be given to the president and members of the court atthe trial.The Charge Sheet110. On the other hand we think that it would be an advantage if a copyof the charge sheet were sent to each member of the court before trial sothat (he would have an opportunity of refreshing his knowledge on anyrelevant legal points. Failure to comply with this requirement should notbe a ground for postponement of the trial.Pleas111. The present practice is that the accused is informed that he is notrequired to plead either guilty or not guilty. If he pleads guilty to one or some of the charges and does not plead or pleads not guilty to others, thenbefore the court proceeds to try him on the latter charges, he is requiredto lay before it any statement he may wish to make in mitigation of punish-ment in relation to the charge or charges, to Which he has pleaded guilty.Should his statement appear to the court to be inconsistent with his pleaof guilty or should it be such as to make it evident that the charge requiresinvestigation before justice can be done, the plea of guilty is not accepted and the trial proceeds as if the accused had pleaded not guilty. In orderthat the accused may not have to reveal in his statement in mitigation matters which might prejudice his defence to the other charges, he may if he desiresmake a further statement in mitigation after the finding at the close of the hearing and before the sentence is considered.
112. In our view this procedure is not entirely satisfactory for the defermentof a statement in mitigation clearly implies that the statement may pre-judicially affect his defence on the charges which are to be tried. We there-fore recommend that:  (i) the accused should be required to plead guilty or not guilty. If herefuses to plead, the trial should proceed as if he had pleaded not guilty ;(ii) before a plea of guilty is recorded, the judge advocate should ensure that the accused understands the charge to which he has pleadedguilty and the difference of procedure which will result from the plea ofguilty. If it appears from the accused&apos;s replies or from the summary ofevidence that he should not plead guilty, the judge advocate should advisehim to withdraw the plea ;(iii) if the accused pleads guilty, he should not in future foe deemed tohave admitted the accuracy of all the material statements contained in the circumstantial letter fout only be deemed to admit the charge to whichhe has so pleaded ;(iv) all statements in mitigation of punishment should be heard afterthe findings on all charges.Statutory Declarations113. To save time and the expense of calling witnesses to prove matters which are purely formal and seldom disputed (e.g. the absence of the accusedfrom his ship on sailing or, in a smuggling case, the discovery by a Customs&apos;officer of duty-free articles in the accused&apos;s luggage), we recommend that provision should be made for the proof of such matters by statutorydeclaration.At present written evidence of the arrest or surrender of the accused is-admissible and affidavits or statutory declarations may be put in evidenceby the defence at trials on charges arising out of navigation.We think that statutory declarations could foe more widely used withoutprejudice to the accused.It will then foe necessary to prescribe that an adequate period of noticebe given by the party proposing to use such a declaration as evidence anda period within which the party upon whom a copy of the declaration is served by way of notice should have the right to object to the admisssionof the statutory declaration and to insist upon the personal attendance ofthe witness.CHAPTER  XTHE  FINDING^Findings by the Majority114. Regulations made under Section 65 of the Naval Discipline Actprovide that, except for judgment of death (for which under Section 53 (2)of the Act four votes out of five and in other cases a majority of not lessthan two-thirds are required) the votes of the majority of the court decideall questions the court has to determine. If on a division the votes areequal, the construction most favourable to the accused prevails.   In taking* Mr. Manningham-Buller and Mr. Ungoed-Thomas do not agree that findings should beby a majority. Their views are stated on pages 47-51. They agree with the recommendation as to. the form of finding.
the opinion of the court, the vote of the junior member is taken first andthen the other members vote orally in order of seniority. The finding ofguilt or innocence is signed by every member notwithstanding a&quot;y difference of opinion there may have been.115. In view of the recommendation of the Lewis Committee (paragraph125). that all findings of guilt or innocence by Army and Air Force courts-martial, which are at present determined by a majority verdict, should infuture by unanimous, we have carefully considered whether a similar recommended-mendation should be made with regard to naval courts-martial.116. We think it right to say that no criticism of the existing system dwhereby the guilt or innocence of the accused is arrived at by a majority &quot;verdict was advanced by any Service witness called before us. In so faras it has been possible to test Service opinion upon this point we have noreason to think that members of the Royal Navy would welcome a system under which they could not be convicted except by a unanimous court, if at the same time they had to accept that unanimity would be required before they could be acquitted. All the responsible naval witnesses called beforeus favoured the retention of the existing system because of the very seriouspractical and administrative difficulties (see paragraphs 125-128) which mightbe caused by the introduction of the requirement of unanimity.117. We should not have allowed the apparent absence of dissatisfaction with the existing system or the practical difficulties attendant upon theintroduction of a requirement of unanimity to weigh unduly with us ifwe had reached the conclusion that the interests of justice required thatthe finding of a Service court on the guilt or innocence of the accused shouldbe unanimous.118. The arguments in favour of the introduction of a requirement ofunanimity can be summarised as follows:  The functions of the members of a naval court-martial are similar tothose of a jury. Whilst courts-martial have to deal for the most part with disciplinary offences, they are frequently called upon to try offenceswhich if committed by a civilian would necessarily be tried upon indict-ment before a jury whose verdict must be unanimous. Since the civiliancharged upon indictment is entitled to have his guilt or innocence estab-lished by the unanimous verdict of a jury it is only right that the guiltor innocence of the sailor tried by court-martial for a similar offenceshould be similarly ascertained. It is wrong that the accused should beleft with the feeling that he may have been convicted of a serious offenceby a bare majority and unsatisfactory that any member of the court should feel that due consideration has not been given to his opinion.119. It is clear that whether the present system of a majority verdictis retained or the requirement of unanimity introduced the same systemmust obtain for disciplinary offences as for offences which, if committed by a civilian, would be tried before a jury.120. Whilst we agree that the functions of the members of a naval court-martial, until after finding, are similar to those of a jury we are of opinionthat to base a reasoned argument upon this similarity is unsound. Jurymenempanelled to try indictable offences are drawn at random from all classesof the community. They necessarily vary widely in education, knowledgeof the world, judgment and strength of character. It is accordingly notunnatural that in such a body the more alert and forceful members willsway the opinion of their fellows.   The members of a naval court-martial
on the other hand are experienced senior officers who by their education and training are all of them well fitted to form a reasoned and independentview as to the guilt or innocence of the accused and may be expected to adhere to any view which they conscientiously hold. Whilst they fulfilall the functions of a jury the members of a naval court-martial also con-stitute the court itself, and, if (analogies are to be drawn from the civil law,it would seem that such members are more nearly in the position of Justicesat Petty Sessions or members of an Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions.The findings of both of these tribunals are determined by a majority. Itis also to be noted that in Scotland the guilt or innocence of an accusedperson is ascertained by a majority verdict of the jury. The retention of majority verdicts at naval courts-martial does not therefore appear to. be inconsistent with the practice in the civil courts.121. It is reasonably clear, moreover, that the introduction of a require-ment of unanimity would not by any means always operate to the benefitof the accused. Our experience was the same as that of the Lewis Com-mittee in that the evidence which we heard as to the frequency with whichnaval courts-martial reach their findings without disagreement was veryconflicting, but there can, we think, be little doubt that many an accusedperson is, under the existing system, acquitted by a majority vote.122. In a disciplined service some importance must be attached to thesalutary rule designed to safeguard the independence of the junior membersof the court which requires that the vote of the junior member should betaken first followed by that of the other members in order of seniority.Whilst this safeguard must not be unduly stressed owing to the fact thatthe views of the senior members will in many cases have been disclosedduring preliminary discussion, yet if the requirement of unanimity is intro-duced the firm views of the senior members will necessarily be disclosedand should the first vote result in disagreement, subsequent discussion will almost necessarily take place and will be followed by a second vote, sothat such safeguard as is provided by the existing provision that membersvote in the inverse order of their seniority will be nullified.123. To summarise the matter it appears to us that the arguments forand against unanimity of findings, in so far as these are based upon theprinciples of justice, are very evenly balanced.124. This being so we have had to give careful consideration to the undoubted practical difficulties which must attend the introduction of the requirement of unanimity.125. It is axiomatic that every accused person is entitled to a reasonablyprompt verdict of guilt or acquittal. Not only does justice require this butit is also essential in the interests of discipline especially when the accusedis an officer or petty officer. If it be the fact, as some witnesses- maintain,that accused persons are at present frequently convicted or acquitted by amajority verdict, it follows that if the requirement of unanimity is intro-duced there is a grave danger that, in a proportion of cases which it isquite impossible to estimate, disagreements may result and re-trials mayconsequently become necessary. Re-trials in any sphere of justice are at best a regrettable necessity. In the Navy they might give rise to verygreat difficulties. To keep the accused and all the witnesses until anothercourt had been convened and held might, at any time, seriously interferewith the movement of ships and the conduct of operations. Nor can it beassumed that a second court would reach a unanimous conclusion wherethe first had failed to do so. In time of war, particularly in an operationaltheatre, re-trials may be impossible.
126. There is in our opinion a further strong objection to re-trials in adisciplined Service like the Navy. Quite different considerations apply when a jury in a civil court disagrees. In all except those rare cases in whichbail had been refused the recognisances are enlarged and the accused person is released to go about his own affairs until the next session of the court,in the Navy, on the other hand, unless the offence was of such gravity asto necessitate the accused being held in close custody, he would have toremain amongst his shipmates with the charge still hanging over him foran indefinite period until a fresh court could be convened to try him. Besidesputting the accused himself in a difficult position this would be for obvious reasons highly undesirable in a disciplined Service, particularly when the accused person is an officer or senior rating.127. The argument that, in practice, re-trials would seldom be necessarydoes not impress us. It proceeds from the assumption that, where disagree-ment arises on the first vote, difference of opinion would be levelled outin the course of discussion. It is by no means certain that this would beso. Naval officers take their duties as members of courts-martial as seriouslyas the many other duties which devolve upon them and they are for this very reason unlikely-in our opinion much less likely than jurors in a civiltrial to surrender firmly held opinions for the sake of an appearance ofagreement. Nevertheless it would in our view be wrong to subject themto the pressure which they would certainly feel if they knew that movements of ships would be held up if they failed to reach a unanimous verdict.The requirement of unanimity could not be introduced without the risk that in at least some trials unanimity would exist in appearance only.128. Finally, in a disciplined Service speed and certainty of decision areof paramount importance. If disagreement were to result in the dropping of proceedings without re-trial, the interests both of justice and disciplinewould be prejudiced. The practical effect would be that the accused would return to duty, it being common knowledge that at least a minority of thecourt had been in favour of his conviction. In the majority of cases thiswould in any event be highly unsatisfactory and, where an officer or seniorrating is concerned, gravely prejudicial to discipline.129. The legal arguments for and against unanimity being in our opinioninconclusive, the serious practical difficulties which would, we think, neces-sarily be involved by the introduction of a requirement that all findingsby a naval court-martial should be unanimous lead us to recommendagainst it.130. We do not think that a requirement of unanimity with regard tosentence is desirable, and we recommend no change in the present procedure for determining sentence.Form of Finding131. The finding is expressed in one of the following forms: (a) The court finds the charge against the accused is proved.(b) The court finds the charge against the accused is not proved, andtherefore acquits him of the same.(c) The court finds the charge against the accused is not proved, andhonourably acquits him of the same.We think it undesirable that the forms of acquittal should use wordingwhich is liable to be confused, by anyone who does not have regard to
1the meaning of the phrase as a whole, with the verdict of &quot; not proven &quot;used in Scotland, which has a different meaning.We recommend that the finding should be given in the following form:  The court finds the accused guilty, or not guilty, of the charge or (ifit is desired to retain a form rarely used) . . . not guilty of the charge andhonourably acquits him of the same.CHAPTER  XITHE   SENTENCEOutstanding Offences132. We have given consideration to the question whether persons accusedbefore naval courts-martial should, after conviction, be given an opportunityof having outstanding offences taken into consideration, as is the practice in the civil courts, and to the recommendation of the Lewis Committee onthis point. In the Navy it is unusual to present a multiplicity of charges. Ifpowers were given to naval courts-martial to take outstanding offences intoconsideration, we have no reason to believe that any material reductionin the number of charges would result. Moreover, it would not normally be possible in the Navy for the authorities concerned to follow the practiceadopted by the police in civil cases of presenting the accused, either beforetrial or after&apos; conviction, with a list of outstanding offences which he maybe prepared to admit. It follows that the question of taking other offencesinto consideration would only arise, as it does at present, on very rareoccasions when the accused of his own motion informs the court of other offences which he has committed and which he wishes to have taken intoconsideration. At present a naval court-martial has no power to accede tothis request and the practice is to inform the accused accordingly and thathis request will be brought to the notice of the Board of Admiralty. Insuch circumstances the Admiralty usually informs the accused that, as an act of grace, it has been decided to take no proceedings against him inrespect of the outstanding offence or offences. In our view very little use would be made of any powers which it might be decided to confer on navalcourts-martial in this connection, and we therefore do not recommend anychange in the present practice.Accuseds Civil Record133. Apart from the recording of a civil conviction during naval service on a rating&apos;s service certificate, the only information about the accused&apos;spast available to the court before sentence is his naval record. Some witnesseshave urged on us that this restriction should be continued in order that every man entering the Navy may start with a clean sheet. We agree thaton entering the Service every man should have the opportunity of making afresh start, but we consider it undesirable to press this policy so far as to extend to a man with several previous convictions the benefit of being treated asa &quot; first offender &quot; merely because the offence being tried is the first he hascommitted in the Navy. We recommend that, wherever practicable, courts-martial should be given details of the accused&apos;s civil police record, if any,before awarding sentence.
CHAPTER  XIIPUNISHMENTSScale of Punishments134. The punishments which may be inflicted in the Navy under Section 52of the Naval Discipline Act are:  (I) Death. () ;(2) Imprisonment exceeding 2 years.(3) Dismissal with disgrace from His Majesty&apos;s service.(4) Imprisonment not exceeding 2 years.(4a) Detention.,(5) Dismissal from His Majesty&apos;s service.(6) Forfeiture of seniority as an officer for a specified time, or otherwise.(7) Dismissal from the ship to which the offender belongs.(8) Severe reprimand, or reprimand.(9) Disrating a subordinate or petty officer.(10) Forfeiture of pay, head money, bounty, salvage, prize money, and allowances earned by, and of all annuities, pensions, gratuities, medals anddecorations granted to, the offender, or of any one or more of the aboveparticulars ; also, in the case of desertion, of all clothes and effects^ leftby the deserter on board the ship to which he belongs.(II) Such minor punishments as are now inflicted according to the customof the Navy, or may from time to time be allowed by the Admiralty&apos;.Of these No. 6 may only be inflicted on officers, and in practice No; 7is never awarded except to officers. No. 4a may not be awarded to officers.It should also be noted that forfeiture of pay, allowances, annuities or pension under No. 10 does not apply to moneys which should have been paid onthe last regular pay day before conviction. The minor punishments under no. 11 are more often inflicted summarily than by court-martial and we propose to deal with them in our second report.Adequacy of Punishments for Temporary Officers135. The only serious criticism of this scale of punishments which wehave received is with regard to the adequacy of the punishments which maybe imposed on temporary officers.The immediate effect on an officer of a sentence in the lower part of thescale is not always apparent. Forfeiture of seniority normally has a delayedfinancial effect in that the officer achieves promotion later than he would otherwise have done. On most temporary officers in time of war it has nofinancial effect at all. Dismissal from his ship may mean for the permanentofficer a severe financial loss, since he remains on half-pay until he is re-appointed. Half-pay is not applicable at any time to temporary officers.The only remaining punishments in the lower part of the scale which canbe inflicted upon an officer are a severe reprimand or reprimand, and theseof course have no direct financial consequence.
The real punishment inflicted by such sentences on the officer whosecareer is in the Service lies in their indirect effect upon his prospects of promotion.136. This sanction does not operate on the temporary officer. A sentencelower in the scale than dismissal from His Majesty&apos;s service may not meanmuch to him.There is moreover a serious discrepancy between the punishment whichmay be awarded for identical offences to temporary officers and to ratings.Those which may be inflicted on the latter are both severe and immediatein their effect. We were told that during the war some resentment was felt at this discrepancy and that many senior officers regretted their inability to punish temporary officers adequately.Fena! Rates of Pay and Reduction in Rank137. With these matters in mind we have carefully considered the possibleintroduction in the Navy, as punishment for officers, of reduction in rank and reduction to a penal rate of pay, both of which were recommended by the lewis Committee.138. A number of the senior officers who gave evidence took serious objec-tion to reduction in rank as a punishment for officers because its awardcannot fail to become widely known and is likely to lower the respect withwhich the officer is regarded by junior officers and ratings. This could not fail to be bad for discipline.We attach such importance to these criticisms that we do not recommend the introduction of reduction in rank as a punishment for officers.139. The introduction of a penal rate of pay as a punishment for officersis not open to the same objections. We found among witnesses a con-siderable measure of agreement that a punishment having an immediatefinancial effect should be introduced. It is clear that any such financialpunishment will need to be carefully thought out with a view to diminishing,in so far as possible, its effect on the offender^ dependants and on his ownstatus.We are however impressed by the need for making such a punishmentavailable primarily for temporary officers, and for providing that the amountshould be recoverable from the offender^ pay (without, of course, the restric-tions which attach to punishment No. 10). To obtain the maximum deterrent effect we think it desirable that the punishment should be expressed as a fine of a fixed amount rather than as a penal rate of pay. It shouldnot be difficult to devise a scheme under which the maximum amount ofthe fine would be limited to such a sum as could be reasonably recoveredby instalments over a given period of time having regard to the offender^rate of pay.Applicability to Ratings140. It may be that such fines should also be made applicable to ratingsbut we do not propose to consider this until we have examined the summarypunishment system, and in particular the punishment known as reduction to second class for conduct, which includes a provision amounting to apenal rate of pay.
CHAPTER   XIIIAPPEALExisting Procedure141. We have already outlined in paragraph 39 the existing procedure underwhich all persons convicted of an offence by a naval court-martial are en-titled to present to the Board of Admiralty a complaint or petition against their conviction or sentence.We have also considered in paragraphs 35-38 the nature of the review which is carried out at the Admiralty of the proceedings in all na v al courts- mmartial.142. We note that a large proportion of cases tried by naval courts-martialconcern charges of neglect of duty (including charges of stranding or hazard-ing HJVl. ships) and charges of conduct to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline. In our view naval officers are the persons best qualified toadjudicate upon matters of this kind, which relate for the most part to navaltradition and practice. Under the existing system there is moreover theadditional safeguard that the finding and sentence are in every case reviewed by the Board of Admiralty..143. In so far as questions of law are concerned, under the existing system the proceedings of every contested court-martial are scrutinised by the judge advocate of the Fleet. After reading a verbatim transcript of the wholeproceedings he advises the Board of Admiraky on all questions of law. Inthe light or this advice the Board may annul the finding or reduce the sentence.The Board has, however, no power to increase a sentence.Desirablisiy c2 an Appeal Tribunalil44. Many of those who forwarded memoranda to us suggested that some system of appeal against the findings of naval courts-martial should beset up. We have also given the most careful consideration to the views expressed upon this topic iby the Lewis Committee in their report (paragraphs134-164). In substance the Lewis Committee recommended for the Army and royal Air Force the abolition of the existing system of confirmation and review (except as to sentence) and the granting of a right of appeal againstfinding on questions of law, with appropriate safeguards to prevent frivolousappeals.145. We are satisfied that the existing system of review conducted by the judge Advocate of the Fleet and the Board of Admiralty has on the wholeworked well and that it affords a valuable safeguard to every officer andman convicted by a naval court-martial in that it ensures without any action by or on behalf of the convicted person that contested proceedings are care-fully considered by an experienced lawyer so that attention may be drawn to any flaws in the proceedings. The system of review is simple and reason-ably expeditious and we unhesitatingly recommend its retention.146. The present system of review is however open to one valid criticism,namely that it operates in private and that the convicted person who isaggrieved by the finding of a court-martial is denied the advantage of havinghis appeal argued orally in open court.147. It is in our view just as important in a disciplined service as in a civil community that justice, as well as being done, should seem to be done.We think it would be undesirable and in many cases impracticable to allow an appeal by way of re-hearing. We are satisfied that the existing systemof review affords an ample safeguard against the imposition of unduly severe
sentences and we accordingly conclude mat there should be no right of appeal against sentence. On the other hand we are of opinion that, with proper safeguards against frivolous appeals, there should be a right of appeal to anindependent appeal tribunal on questions of law in every case in which the accused has pleaded not guilty. We should like in this connection to adoptthe words of the Lewis Committee at paragraph 141 of their report and torecommend that an appeal should be allowed &quot; directed simply to the questionwhether some error of law had occurred in the proceedings sufficiently seriousto justify quashing of the conviction &quot;.To separate questions of law from questions of fact is not always possible and while we do not recommend that there should be any right of appeal tothis tribunal on questions of fact, we do not think that the jurisdiction of thetribunal should be excluded if the luestion it is sought to raise is one ofmixed law and fact, provided that it is borne in mind that the tribunalis intended to determine legal questions.148. We agree with the conclusions reached by the Lewis Committee(paragraph 144) that the tribunal hearing the appeal should have power toaffirm a conviction even if an error of lav/ has occurred provided that it is satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has thereby been occasioned.149. It sometimes happens that, fresh evidence not available to the court-martial is submitted by or on behalf of the accused to the Admiralty, either before or after the review of the proceedings. At present the Board takessuch evidence into account during the review and, if it seems doubtful whetherthe court-nnartial would have convicted on any particular charge had the fresh evidence been available, the Board quashes the conviction on that charge.Where, however, the fresh evidence does not appear to throw any doubt uponthe correctness of the finding the Board at present takes no action.We have considered whether such matters should be brought before the appeal tribunal rather than be dealt with as described above.. We havereached the conclusion that the present practice should continue. The Courtof Criminal Appeal has power under the Criminal Anneal Act. 1907, toallow fresh evidence to be called, but it is a power exercised very sparingly,and if an appeal tribunal were to be given a similar power it would in manycases refuse to allow fresh evidence to foe called where the Board of Admiraltvwould at present take such evidence into consideration. The Board might therefore foe hampered in considering fresh evidence on review by doubt whether the appeal tribunal would admit such evidence. Moreover if thetribunal were empowered to allow fresh evidence to be called it would of necessity have to consider Questions of fact which would foe contrary to therecommendation we have made in paragraph 147.150. We have given considerable thought to &quot;the ouestion of the court towhich appeals on law from naval courts-martial should lie. The most desir-afole appeal tribunal would no doufot foe the Court of Criminal Anneal. Whilstthis court might foe able to deal with the comoarativelv small numfoer of appeals from naval courts-martial we recognise that it could not foe^ expectedto undertake the hearing of the much larser numfoer of anneals which rriishthe expected in the other two Services if the recommendations of the lewis committee are adopted. We also recognise that it would foe imoracticafoleto ffrant a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Anneal from the findingof a court-martial to the navy and to denv it to the other two Services.151. We do not anticipate that appeals on law from naval courts-martialwill be very freouent a.rd it is clear that naval anneal courts will not becalled unon to sit with anv preat resularitv. The memfoers of the contem-plated appeal courts must clearly foe lawyers of standing and experienceof the criminal law of this country.
152. The Lewis Committee recommended that appeals from the findings of Army and Air Force courts-martial on questions of law should be toa court-martial appeal court under the Lord Chancellor consisting of theChief Judge Martial, the Vice-Chief Judge Martial and the Judges Martial,and that in addition there should be formed a panel approved by the LordChancellor of King&apos;s Counsel willing to serve on such a court. They furtherrecommended that a panel consisting of any three of the foregoing persons should constitute a court.153. If appeals are to lie from courts-martial in all three Services weconsider that in the interests of a uniform administration of justice, as wellas of administrative convenience, all such appeals should lie to the sameappellate tribunal. We do not however feel that it is desirable that appeals from naval courts-martdal should be submitted to a court which might con-sist entirely of those engaged in the day to day performance of judicial&apos;or quasi-judicial duties in the other two Services.154. We see no reason why a single appellate tribunal independent of all three Services should not be constituted to hear appeals from all courts-martiial. Such an independent tribunal would we believe enjoy the con-fidence of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force. We recom-mend that the tribunal should consist of three members drawn from apanel appointed by the Lord Chancellor and consisting of King&apos;s Counselor other experienced Counsel who practise or have practised in the criminalcourts of this country.155. If however the recommendations of the Lewis Committee with regardto the constitution of an appeal court for the Army and Royal Air force are accepted we recommend that a separate tribunal, which might be called the Naval Appeal Court, should be constituted, as recommended in thepreceding paragraph, for the hearing of appeals from naval courts-martial.156. By reason of the reviewing and other duties which we recommend should remain with the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, it is clearly undesirable that he should be included in the panel from which the Naval Appeal Courtis selected. We envisage that this Naval Appeal Court would normallysit in London and recommend that the members of the court should beremunerated on an appropriate day to day basis for each day&apos;s sitting.Procedure on Appeal157. As a safeguard against frivolous appeals, we recommend that it shallbe necessary to obtain leave to appeal either from the Judge Advocateof the Fleet, or if he refuses it, from the appellate tribunal.The convicted person should be entitled to apply within a specified period,say 14 days, for such leave.   In a proper case the period should be extended.The application should be forwarded through the most direct channelto the Admiralty for the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, who would thus in most cases be able to give particular attention to the points raised inthe application when conducting his review of the court-martial proceedings.158. If the Judge Advocate of the Fleet thought that the grounds of appealwere well founded, he would no doubt advise the Board of Admiraltyaccordingly and the conviction would then normally be quashed. Noappeal would then be necessary.159. If the Judge Advocate of the Fleet did not consider that the grounds of appeal warranted a quashing of the conviction but that the applicationdisclosed a reasonable case for an appeal on law or mixed law and fact,he would grant leave to appeal.
160. If he refused leave to appeal, we recommend that the convictedperson should be entitled to apply to the appellate tribunal for leave.161. We envisage that the proceedings before the appellate tribunal bothupon an application for leave to appeal and upon the hearing of an appealwill be similar to those before the Court of Criminal Appeal. On the hearing of the appeal the appellant and the respondent to the appeal will normally be professionally represented, the appellant, it may be, under thescheme for providing legal aid at naval courts-martial.162. As a safeguard against frivolous applications to the appellate tribunal for leave to appeal we recommend that such court have power to orderthat ithe sentence of the appellant shall run from the date upon which hisapplication to the appellate tribunal for leave to appeal was dismissed orfrom any intermediate date between that date and the date of the passingof the sentence.Powers of the Board of Admiralty163. In view of the relationship between the Board of Admiralty andthe Navy, which does not find a parellel in the other Serves, we considerit desirable that the powers of the Board should not only remain unimpaired,but that they should also appear to remain so.We therefore recommend that the appellate tribunal should deliver its opinion in open court in the form of the advice which it intends to convey to the Board of Admiralty. We are satisfied that where such a tribunalhas advised that legal grounds exist which render it desirable that a con-viction should be quashed, the Board of Admiralty will in all cases act inaccordance with such advice.Summary of the Rights of The Accused164. We think it important that officers and men should be aware ofthe safeguard provided by the system of review, and, if our recommenda-tions are adopted, of the method of operation of the appeal system. Wetherefore recommend that a short summary dealing with the review andappeal systems should be included in the informatory document proposedin paragraph 107.CHAPTER    XIVMISCELLANEOUS  MATTERSDelays165. In a highly mobile Service like the Navy it is inevitable, particularlyin war-time, that prolonged delays may sometimes occur during the investi-gation of offences owing to the dispersal of witnesses the convening of boards of inquiry and other factors.Although there must exist cases &apos;of this character, in which it is unusualfor an alleged offender to be put in close or open custody until these pre-liminary inquiries have been completed, our attention has not been drawnlo any instances of serious, delay in bringing to trial persons charged withoffences. While we believe that the importance of ensuring early trial isunderstood by all concerned, the possibility of undue delay is always presentin the circumstances in which the Navy is obliged to opetate, and we wouldimpress on all naval authorities the desirability of doing their utmost toreduce the period between the initial investigation and the trial.
Substitution of Findings166. Under Section 48 of the Naval Discipline Act a person charged withany offence under the Act may, upon failure of proof of the commission ofthe greater offence, be found guilty by the court-martial of another offenceof the same class involving a less degree of punishment, but not of any offenceinvolving a greater degree of punishment.167. It sometimes happens that when a person has been found guilty bya court-martial, the finding is found on review by the Board of admiralty to be invalid or not to be supported by the evidence. In such a case,even though the Admiralty is satisfied that the court-martial could on thecharge properly have found the accused guilty of another offence, or of thesame offence in circumstances involving a less degree of punishment (e.g.offences under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Act), the Board-has no option butto dissent from the finding and, if the accused was not found guilty on other charges, to annul the sentence.168. It is undesirable that in such a case a guilty person should escapeall punishment, and we recommend that in these circumstances the Boardof Admiralty should be empowered to substitute for the finding of thecourt-martial a finding of guilty of that other offence, or of the same offencein circumstances involving a less degree of punishment, and to impose anysentence warranted in law not greater than the sentence awarded by thecourt-martial. Such powers of substitution are already exercised by theArmy Council and the Air Council under the Army and Air Force Acts.Re-trials169. There is no statutory provision whereby the Board of Admiralty orany naval authority may order a retrial, but we assume that such a powerto order a second trial exists where the first trial proves to be a nullity owingto a radical defect in the constitution of the court. We consider that sucha power should not be affected by the recommendations we have made withregard to appeal.Delegation of Admiralty Powers of Remission170. Apart from the remission of the death sentence by His Majesty, theBoard of Admiralty alone can remit sentences awarded under the naval discipline Act, Whether by court-martial or summarily. We understand(bat after a man has been sentenced circumstances sometimes arise which make it desirable to take immediate action to reduce or remit the sentence.In such circumstances a naval authority is at present obliged to refer thematter to the Admiralty. We recommend that Section 53 of the Act shouldbe amended to enable the Board of Admiralty to delegate to appropriatenaval authorities its power to modify or remit punishments.Section 92 Trials171. We have been advised of the origin and history of trials underSection 92 of the Naval Discipline Act, under which, without any specificcharge having been made, it is lawful to try, before one and the samecourt, all the surviving officers and crew of any ship lost, destroyed or captured. The kind of trial which this section authorises appears in theold days to have served the purpose of elucidating the facts about the loss,etc., of a ship and of clearing the survivors of blame. Opinions have variedthroughout the last two centuries on the question whether, if the survivorswere blameworthy, the court could proceed to sentence them. In 1917 it wasdecided that Section 92 would not mention the &quot; trying &quot; of survivors unless it intended to sanction their conviction and punishment.
172. The procedure at such trials is however open to serious objection.Although the list of questions to which the prosecutor draws the attentionof the court Will normally give an indirect indication of possible charges,an officer -or man who is eventually found guilty of an offence does not become fully aware of the charge brought against him until it is read out at the finding. This may seriously prejudice the conduct of his defenceduring the examination of witnesses. The survivors implicated do not receiveprior notice of the evidence as a result of which their conduct is in question,the wholesale nature of the trial severely limits the extent to which each individual survivor can conduct a defence by way of cross-examination,and it has also been represented that a procedure under which the Captainand other senior officers can be cross-examined by their juniors and by ratingsin the presence of others is damaging to discipline.173. There were a very few trials under Section 92 at the beginning of the&quot;late war, tout no use has been made of it since 1942. Now that boards of Inquiry can be charged with the task of elucidating the facts of a loss or capture without prejudice to ensuing courts-martial on specific charges, weconsider that Section 92 has outlived its usefulness and recommend its repeal.Right to demand Trial by Court-Martial174. The view is widely held among naval officers Chat they have a rightto demand trial by court-martial in order to vindicate themselves if their conduct is in question. There is no such right and we cannot recommendthat any such right be created. We understand nevertheless that when thepublic interest permits it is the Admiralty&apos;s practice to consider sympathetic-ally requests for trial by court-martial from officers who believe that their personal or professional honour has been adversely affected, and we recom-mend that this practice should continue.Shorthand Writers175. It is already the practice to provide at all courts-imartial and dis-ciplinary courts a shorthand-writer who is responsible, under the judge advocate, for drawing up verbatim minutes of the proceedings. The standardrequired to produce satisfactory minutes, if there is to be no delay duringthe proceedings, is very high. From the proceedings which we have seen itappears that a very satisfactory standard has hitherto been maintained ; butwe are informed that difficulties are being experienced in obtaining enoughrecruits of this standard and of volunteers from within the Service fortraining. The importance of an accurate transcript of proceedings for pur-poses of review and appeal cannot be overstressed and we recommend that every effort toe made to provide a fully qualified shorthand writer for everycourt, wherever it be held.Definition of Mutiny176. The Admiralty Memorandum on Naval Court-Martial Procedure con-tains no definition of mutiny. We recommend that an attempt be made, in collaboration with the other Services, to define this offence.Prevarication177. Section 66 of the Naval Discipline Act requires to be redrafted andin particular we recommend that the archaic provision giving a court-martialpower to punish a witness if in their opinion he is guilty of prevaricationshould be eliminated.
CHAPTER   XVSUMMARY OF recommendations and CONCLUSION(The numbers in brackets after each recommendation refer to the paragraphs Of the report.)ConsfiiuMJoa of the CourtI. All members of the court should be nominated by the convening Aauthority (49).2. The Captain of the accused&apos;s ship should never be nominated as presi-dent or member (50).3. Where the only available Captain is excluded by RecommendationNo. &apos;2 a Commander should be nominated as president and the powers of acourt-martial so constituted should he limited to trying persons below the rank of Commander (51).4. The convening authority should, where he is himself concerned in the alleged offence, be authorised by regulation to assign his power to convene a court-martial to another Flag Officer or if none be available to request the Admiralty to nominate the court (52).5.* The convening authority should nominate the most suitable officersirrespective of the branch or unit of the Service to which they belong (61).6.* All officers of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and the Reserves (exceptChaplains) who are .21 years of age and of or above the rank of Lieutenant,R.N., or equivalent rank, should be eligible to sit as members of courts-martial (62).7.* The majority of the court, including the president, should &quot;be executive officers of the Royal Navy (63)..8:* Where suitable officers are available, a minority of each court shouldbe nominated from officers of the non-executive branches, Royal Marines,and Reserves. When the court consists of five officers, such a minorityshould normally consist of two (64).9. Section 58 (3) of the Naval Discipline Act should be replaced by a pro-vision that no court-martial shall be duly constituted if more than two rnem-bers belong to the same ship as the accused (65).10. Section 59 of the Naval Discipline Act should be amended to provide that a court-martial may be held afloat or ashore and that no special record of reasons for holding it ashore be required (66).The Judge AdvocateII. The number of Supply Officers who receive special legal training should be increased (70).12. Wherever possible junior Supply Officers should attend trials, be swornas &quot; Supply Officers under instruction &quot; and remain in court on all occasions when the judge advocate is present (76).13. (a) In all cases of a very grave character including offences punishableby death, in all cases in -which very difficult questions of law or of admissi-bility of evidence seem likely to arise, and in all cases of a very complicated* Majority recommendation
character, judge advocates should be chosen from King&apos;s Counsel and otherbarristers experienced in the English criminal law, the Deputy Judge Advocateof the Fleet or former holders of that office.(b) In cases of less difficulty and gravity, &quot; starred &quot; Supply Branch officers should act, and(c) In other cases &quot; unstarred&quot; Supply Branch officers should beemployed (77).14. The advice given by judge advocates should be followed and theAdmiralty should issue instructions designed to ensure this. If in any casethe court does not follow the judge advocate&apos;s advice, the president shouldbe required to record that fact in the minutes together with the reasonsfor the failure to do so (80).15. It should not be part of the judge advocated duty to advise on therules and regulations of the Service generally (81).16. The president should be empowered on the advice of the judge advocateto authorise him to hear arguments as to admissibility of evidence andapplications for separate trials in the absence of the court (84).17. Civilian judge advocates should, if possible, sit in legal robes (87).18. All advice by the judge advocate before the closing of the court forconsideration of sentence should be given in open court and the practiceof the judge advocate remaining with the court during consideration of the finding should cease (89).19. Before the court considers its finding the judge advocate should sumup the case and if further advice is required the court should be reopenedand the advice be given by the judge advocate in the presence of all parties (90).20. The judge advocate should not be concerned in any way with pre-reparations for the trial and should be relieved of these duties by a clerk ofthe court, who would assist the judge advocate during the proceedings.The judge advocate should give no advice on law before the trial to anyof the parties concerned, but should continue to inform the convening autho-rity of any defect in the constitution of the court (92).The Prosecution21. The practice whereby the Captain of the accuseds ship normally actsas prosecutor should cease (95).22. The choice of prosecutor should be governed solely by considerationof the competence of the selected officer to undertake the particular prosecu-tion and the convening authority should be entitled to engage a competentcivilian lawyer for the more serious cases or those requiring very careful handling (96).23. K.R. &amp; A.I. Article 443 (7) (provision in the event of there being noprosecutor) should be cancelled (97).24. The prosecutor should be responsible for correct drafting of the charges,subject to approval of the convening authority, who should countersign thecharge sheet (98).25. The charge sheet should show under which section of the Naval Dis-decipline or other Act each charge is brought (99).
The Defence26. The Captain, in discharging his responsibility of seeing that a com-petent defending officer is available, should ensure that full use is made ofSupply Officers who have undergone the more advanced legal training (104).27. The title &quot; defending officer &quot; should be adopted in place of &quot; accused&apos;sfriend&quot; (105).28. It should be made clear that the accused or his defending officerexamines and cross-examines witnesses by right and not by permission of thepresident (106).29. The accused should be given a leaflet summarising his rights in con-nection with trial by court-martial (107).Procedure30. The charge sheet should contain the description of the accused includ-ing a statement that he is subject to the Naval Discipline Act, and admissionof these matters by the accused should be sufficient proof of jurisdiction(108).31. The circumstantial letter should not be sent to the president beforethe trial, nor handed to members at the trial. Exceptionally, where the cir-cumstantial letter contains detailed navigational information, that part of itshould be sent to the president with the charge sheet and, if desired, givento the other members of the court immediately before it is read (109).32. A copy of the charge sheet should be sent to each member of the courtbefore the trial (110).33. (a) The accused should be required to plead guilty or not guilty andif he refuses to plead, the trial should proceed as if he had pleaded not guilty(U2 (i)).(b) Before a plea of guilty is recorded, the judge advocate should ensirethat the accused understands the charge to which he has pleaded guilty andthe difference of procedure which will result from the plea of guilty (112 (ii)).(c) If it appears that the accused should not plead guilty the judge advocateshould advise him to withdraw the plea (112 (ii)).34. A plea of guilty should no longer be deemed to be an admission ofthe accuracy of all material statements in the circumstantial letter (112 (iii)).35. All statements in mitigation of punishment should be heard after the findings on all charges (112 (iv)).36. Provision should be made for the proof of purely formal and seldomdisputed matters by statutory declaration (113).The Finding37.* The system of deciding the finding of the court by a majority voteshould be retained (129).38. The finding should be given as &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;not guilty&quot; (131).The Sentence39. Where practicable the court should be given details of the accusedscivil police record, if any, before awarding sentence (133).Punishments40. Fines should be introduced as a punishment for officers (139).* Majority recommendation.44
Appeal41. The system of review by the Admiralty of the findings and sentence of courts-martial should be retained (145).42. There should be a right of appeal to an independent appeal tribunalon questions of law and questions of mixed law and fact (147).43. The appeal tribunal should have power to affirm a conviction evenif an error of law has occurred provided that no substantial miscarriage ofjustice has thereby been occasioned (148).) 44. The appeal tribunal should not have power to allow fresh evidence to be called (149).45. If appeals are to lie from courts-martial in all three Services, all suchappeals should lie to the same independent appellate tribunal. It should consist of three members drawn from a panel appointed by the Lord Chan-cellor and consisting of King&apos;s Counsel or other experienced counsel whopractise or have practised in the criminal courts of this country (154).46. If appeals from courts-martial in all three Services are not to lieto the same appellate tribunal, a separate tribunal, which might be called the Naval Appeal Court, should be constituted as proposed in the precedingrecommendation for the hearing of appeals from naval courts-martial (155).47. The Judge Advocate of the Fleet should not be included in the panel (156).48. A convicted person should be entitled to apply within a specified period,say 14 days, of conviction for leave to appeal specifying the grounds uponwhich the application is made (157).49. If the conviction is not quashed by the Board of Admiralty at the review stage the Judge Advocate of the Fleet should decide whether to grantor refuse leave to appeal (159).50. If leave to appeal is refused by the Judge Advocate of the Fleet theconvicted person should be entitled to apply to the appellate tribunal forleave (160).51. The proceedings before the appellate tribunal should be similar to thosebefore the Court of Criminal Appeal (161).52. As a safeguard against frivolous applications for leave to appeal the appellate tribunal should have power to order that the sentence of the appel-lant shall run from the date upon which his application for leave to appealwas dismissed or from any intermediate date between that date and the dateof the passing of the sentence (162).53. The appellate tribunal should deliver its opinion in open court inthe form of the advice which it intends to convey to the Board of Admiralty(163).54. A short summary dealing with the review and appeal systems should beincluded in the leaflet referred to in recommendation No. 29 (164).Miscellaneous55. Substitution of Finding. If on review a finding of guilty is held tobe invalid, but it is evident that on the charge the court-martial could properly have found the accused guilty of another offence, or of the same
offence in circumstances involving a less degree of punishment, the Boardof Admiralty should be empowered to substitute for the finding of the court-martial a finding of guilty of that other offence, or of the same offence in circumstances involving a less degree of punishment (168).56. Re-trials. Any existing power to order a re-trial where the first trialproves to be a nullity owing to a radical defect in the constitution of thecourt should not be affected by the recommendations (Nos. 41-54) made withregard to appeal (169).57. Delegation of powers of remission. The Admiralty should be em-powered to delegate to appropriate naval authorities its power to modify orremit punishments (170).58. Trials under Section 92 of the Naval Discipline Act. This sectionshould be repealed (173).59. Shorthand Writers. Every effort should be made to continue to pro-vide a fully qualified shorthand writer for every court-martial (175).60. Mutiny. An attempt should be made, in collaboration with the other services, to define this offence (176).61. Prevarication. Section 66 of the Naval Discipline Act should be re-drafted and the archaic provision giving a court-martial power to punisha witness for prevarication should be eliminated (177).Minority ReportsFor the reasons stated in their memorandum on pages 47-51 Mr.Manningham-Buller and Mr. Ungoed-Thomas are unable to agree with therecommendation in paragraph 129 that the system of deciding the finding ofthe court by a majority vote should be retained.Admiral Palliser has outlined in his memorandum on page 52 his reasonsfor being unable to agree with the recommendations in paragraphs 61 to 64on the constitution of the court.ConclusionWe cannot conclude this first report without saying how very greatlywe are indebted to our Secretaries, Mr. H.

X eJ) jlMINORITY REPORTby Mr. R. E. Manningham-Buller, K.C., M.P. and &quot;Mr. A. L. Ungoed-Thomas, K.C., M.P.We regret that we are unable to agree with the majority of our colleagues that the finding of guilty or not guilty by a naval court-martial should bedetermined by the votes of the majority. Nor can we accept the summary ofarguments in favour of unanimity given in paragraph 118 of the Report as anadequate statement of our views.For the reasons given below we entirely agree with the recommendation of the lewis Committee that all findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimous.&apos; 2. In our opinion where a person subject to the Naval Discipline Act is charged before a naval court-martial with an indictable offence, a finding ofguilty based on the views of a bare majority and ignoring those of the minority of the senior and responsible naval officers who sit on courts-martial is notconsistent with the requirement of English law that the guilt of the accusedshall be established beyond all reasonable doubt.Also the burden of proof is likely to be less if it is necessary to satisfy onlythe majority of the court of the guilt of the accused than where the offenceis being tried before an English jury.3. It is from these considerations of justice that we recommend unanimity.Tt is from considerations of practical administrative convenience that our colleagues favour the retention of the present system. In our opinion these considerations do not outweigh and should not be allowed to override the interestsof justice.4. A naval court-martial can try any offence under the ordinary criminal law of England. It can try indictable offences, no matter how grave. It is ourconcern with regard to the trial of serious indictable offences by naval courts-martial that has caused us to dissent.Some indictable offences are not triable in Magistrates&apos; Courts ; others canonly be tried in such courts with the consent of the accused. The guilt orinnocence of a person charged with an indictable offence which is not tried inthe Magistrates&apos; Courts is only determined by the unanimous verdict of a jury.In our opinion it is not possible to draw any valid distinction between thefunctions of a naval court-martial in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused on such charges and those of a jury.5. Our colleagues observe in paragraph 120 of the Report that &quot;Whilst theyfulfil all the functions of a jury, the members of a naval court-martial alsoconstitute the court itself&quot;. This statement, though incontestably true, appearsto us hardly relevant to the point under consideration for we are only concernedwith the methods by which a naval court-martial determines guilt or innocence.It does not appear to us to serve any useful purpose to seek to draw an analogybetween the methods by which a naval court-martial and those by whichmagistrates perform that function when we are concerned with cases which the magistrates cannot or, in consequence of the accused&apos;s election, do not try.If wc sought to seek an analogy between the jurisdiction of magistrates and naval officers we should be inclined to find it in the jurisdiction of ship&apos;s Captainsrather than of courts-martial.An Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions can only hear appeals in respectof indictable offences where the accused has consented to trial before the magistrates. Again we do not think that any useful purpose is served by seeking to draw an analogy between the methods of an Appeal Committee and of a naval court-martial in arriving at a decision as to guilt or innocence when thejurisdiction of a naval court-martial entitles it to try far graver cases.If any analogy is to be drawn, then it should be between naval courts-martialand Courts of Assizes or Quarter Sessions, where the guilt or innocence has tobe determined by the unanimous verdict of a jury.
Nor do we think that any valid argument can be founded on the reference inthe Report to the use of a majority verdict in a distinct and separate judicialsystem without careM consideration of all the powers and functions of Scottishjuries, including their power to return a verdict of &quot; not proven &quot;.6. We share the view expressed by our colleagues in paragraph 120 of theReport that the members of a naval court-martial are &quot; experienced senior officers who by their education and training are all of them fitted to form a reasonedand independent view as to the guilt or innocence of the accused and may beexpected to adhere to any view which they conscientiously hold &quot;.This is not in our opinion an argument against unanimity but for it.   It is less justifiable in view of the character of the officers to disregard the opinions of any of them. ^7. Our colleagues&apos; opinion of the character of members of naval courts-martial seems hardly consistent with their conclusion expressed in paragraph 127of the Report that &quot; The requirement of unanimity could not be introducedwithout the risk that in at least some trials unanimity would exist in appearanceonly &quot;. It is also suggested in paragraph 122 that where the first vote results in a disagreement, subsequent discussion will almost necessarily take place andwill be followed by a second vote so that such safeguard as may be providedby the existing provision that members vote in the inverse order of their senioritywill be nullified. The inference would appear to be that if the first vote results in a disagreement, some pressure which ought not to be applied will be successfullyexercised to secure agreement.We do not agree and we heard no evidence to warrant such conclusions.When the members have voted, they must abide by the result. In our opinionthey would have no right to take a second vote.We do not find it easy to reconcile this contention of our colleagues with their statement in paragraph 127 that the argument that retrials would seldom benecessary is unacceptable by them because &quot; naval officers . . . are . . . unlikely... to surrender firmly held opinions for the sake of an appearance ofagreement&quot;.8. We were told by a witness of great experience that when the court considersits finding, there is usually a general discussion before the votes are taken. Itis obviously impossible for anyone taking part in the discussion not to give some indication of his opinion and the possibility that that will affect thedecision of a junior officer cannot be excluded. The practice of voting in inverseorder of seniority is no safeguard against this.9. There is less disparity of rank and seniority between the members of a naval court-martial than between the members of an Army or Air Force court-martial and we refuse to accept the proposition that a senior naval officerthough a junior member of the court would abandon a firmly held convictionand indeed break the oath he took at the commencement of the proceedingsowing to further discussion, knowledge of the opinion of his seniors or theexercise of improper pressure.10. We do not consider that whatever risk there is of this occurring and we regard it as negligible- would be increased by the requirement of unanimity.On the contrary it should be more difficult to apply such pressure successfullyon a minority of two or more to secure unanimity than upon the one memberwhose vote is necessary to secure a majority.11. We would not however be substantially affected in our views even if a real danger of such pressure were clearly shown to arise from the adoption ofunanimity. The effect, where such pressure was successfully applied, would beto convert a unanimous finding into what in reality was a majority finding.But a majority finding is the present rule so that the trial in that particular case would be no worse than trial under the present system.
As however we strongly consider that it is in the interests of justice thatunanimity should be preferred to the present system, then to abandon unanimityon account of the danger of pressure would be to abandon the interests of justice in all cases from fear that in some cases some naval officer might be foundto exert and in the same cases other naval officers might be found to succumb toimproper pressure or influence.12. While we see no justification for ignoring the opinions of a minority of senior and experienced naval officers, we see no reason to assume that themembers of a naval court-martial will disagree more frequently than juriesdrawn from all classes of the community. Where such officers fail to agree, itwill no doubt be due to firm conclusions conscientiously held and reasonablyformed on the merits of the case. In such cases it cannot be maintained thatguilt of a grave indictable offence has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.13. The burden of proof under a requirement of majority finding is less than under a requirement of unanimity. Certainly the burden of satisfying all themembers of a court-martial should not be greater than that of satisfying allthe members of a jury. We see no reason why the burden of proof before a naval court-martial should be less than in a trial before a jury and for thisreason as well, in our opinion a naval court-martial should be required, as ajury are required, to agree upon their verdict.14. We agree that if unanimity is introduced for indictable offences, it must also be required in respect of all other offences tried by naval courts-martial.15. We do not doubt that under the existing system many an accused person is convicted or acquitted by a majority vote. We do not however consider inview of the evidence we heard that in all these cases there would necessarily have been disagreement if unanimity had been required. We do not doubt thatin many of these cases longer deliberation would without the exercise of improperpressure or the abandonment of firmly held convictions have resulted inagreement. Under the present system when once it is clear that there is amajority one way or the other, there is no need to continue consideration of thecase.16. We see no reason to conclude that disagreement would often occur. Whereit does, we agree that it should normally be followed by a retrial and we recognisethat in some, but only in some, cases, there might be difficulty in holding aretrial and that in some of those cases the accused might have to remain withhis shipmates pending retrial.Doubtless these considerations will be present to the minds of the membersof the court and would tend to prevent disagreement except upon strong groundsbut we cannot believe that they would cause naval officers to depart from theirsworn duty to administer justice without partiality favour or affection.17. It is not possible to predict the proportion of cases in which if unanimityis required, there will be a disagreement, nor is it possible to estimate the numberof cases in which difficulty will be experienced in holding a retrial. In manyof the cases in which there is disagreement, it should not in peace time bemore difficult to held a retrial than it was to hold the trial, and we do not thinkthat in peace time the difficulty of holding a retrial will prove except on rareoccasions to be so much greater than that of holding the original trial as to necessitate the abandonment of the retrial. Our recommendations as to theconstitution of the court should facilitate the convening of a court for a retrialand we do not believe that it should often be necessary in peace time for the accused to wait long for his retrial.We hesitate to speculate as to the difficulties that may arise both in holdingtrials and retrials in another war.18. Until the requirement of unanimity is introduced, no one can say whetherthe pessimistic views as to the numbers of disagreements and as to the difficultiesof retrials are well founded. It may be that they are much exaggerated. we found among the naval witnesses we heard a reluctance to accept any change
in the present naval system even when the change would bring it into line withan existing practice in the other two services which has been found to workwell, and we do not accept their views in favour of the retention o  the majorityfinding on the ground of administrative difficulties as conclusive.19. In those cases in which real difficulty in holding a retrial arises, theAdmiralty should have the power to decide having regard both to the nature ofthe case and the nature of the difficulties, that a retrial should not be held.We recognise that this will mean in the cases in which such a power is exercised and we think they will prove to be few in number that the accused willremain under suspicion.20. Our colleagues in paragraphs 126 and 128 make the objection that therfjeffect of disagreement would be to prolong the period during which the accusedwas under suspicion, and, where there was no retrial, to leave the accused undersuspicion and that this would be prejudicial to the interests both of justice and discipline.If our recommendations as to the constitution of the court are accepted, we see no reason to suppose that it will usually be necessary for a long period toelapse between trial and retrial. The consequences of delay should be an incentive to speedy action. The witnesses being present, it should, we think, be possibleto convene the court for the retrial within a few days of the trial. The knowledge that, if there is no retrial, the accused will remain under suspicion should resultin every effort being made to overcome such difficulties as there may be andshould lead to the power to dispense with a retrial being seldom exercised.Against this objection must be offset other considerations. Under the presentsystem it can never be known that a finding was unanimous and there is always the possibility that it was arrived at by a bare majority, that it turned on the vote of one man. There cannot always therefore be the same confidence in afinding of guilty as if the verdict had to be unanimous. If the finding was&quot; not fuilty &quot;, there is always the possibility that all but a bare majority voted for conviction with the result that even a favourable finding does not give thatclearance from suspicion which is obtained with a unanimous verdict.It is to the person who is in reality innocent, to the person for whom weshould be most solicitous, that this system of majority finding most unfairlyattaches suspicion.It is in our view more important that no person should be found guilty ornot guilty save by a unanimous verdict than that a person about whose guiltor innocence responsible and experienced naval officers fail to agree shouldbe relieved of a greater measure of suspicion than would otherwise attach tohim. Such a person would incidentally be in no worse position than under averdict of &quot; not proven &quot; under Scottish law.21. The difficulties which may sometimes arise with regard to retrials, thefact that the accused may sometimes remain for a period and on occasions beleft under suspicion do not in our opinion warrant the retention of a system under which an of; cer or rating may be convicted of a grave crime by a barevote of one by five against four or three against two. The weight of knowledge and experience may be with the minority: it may consist of the more senior officers: in any case the minority is, as our colleagues recognise, &quot; well fitted to form a reasoned and independent view&quot;. The difficulties stressed by our colleagues do not warrant the over-riding of the opinions of such a minorityand a conviction in the face of their opinions cannot in our view be said to bebased upon that degree of certainty of proof which the English criminal lawrecjiiires. How can it be said that guilt is proved beyond all reasonable doubtwhen the result of the evidence is to leave the members of the court holdingopposite opinions on that issue?V/e think it wrong that a system which permits of such convictions shouldcontinue and we do not consider that administrative convenience should beallowed to prevail against such substantial considerations of justice.
22. We have also been impressed in favour of unanimity by the following considerations:  (i) Under the present system, even though the finding is by a majority, allthe members of the court sign the minutes of proceedings as if they were unanimous. We are of opinion that the appearance of unanimity upon theproceedings should in all cases be supported by the reality of agreement.We are satisfied that there are valid reasons why the minority should notrecord their dissent but it follows that when the proceedings are reviewed,it is not known and cannot be known whether the finding was unanimousor by a majority. In borderline cases the decision of the Admiralty on thequestion whether the conviction should be quashed might be affected in favourof the accused if they knew that the finding was only by a majority.Neither this Committee nor the Lewis Committee have recommended anappeal on questions of fact by way of rehearing and the only power contem-piated to over-ride findings of fact by naval courts-martial is this power ofthe Admiralty to quash convictions. If unanimity is required, the possibility that the Admiralty, in reviewing a case, will attach more weight to thedecision of the court on the evidence than is in fact justified will be excluded.(ii) If the recommendation of the Lewis Committee in favour of unanimityat Army courts-martial is adopted, and our recommendation is not, it will mean that Royal Marines when subject to the Army Act will be convictedor acquitted only by a unanimous finding but, when subject to the naval discipline Act, by a majority finding.(iii) Our Committee with one dissentient has recommended that membersof naval courts-martial should no longer be drawn exclusively from officersof the Executive Branch but that the majority of the court should consist ofsuch officers. We are all agreed that sentence should be decided by a majority vote and that the control over the sentence should be secured to the officersof the Executive Branch in view of their training and experience. Thepreservation of the majority vote for finding of guilt or innocence would however preserve their control over the verdict too and runs counter to the considerations which led us to recommend the extension of membership ofnaval courts-martial.23. It is for these reasons that we recommend that the determination by naval courts-martial of the guilt or innocence of the accused should be requiredto be unanimous.Presidents of Courts-Martial24. There is one other matter to which we desire to refer. We consider thatthe substance of the requirement of the Lewis Committee for the proper adminis-tration of justice which led them to propose that a trained lawyer should preside over a court-martial as Judge Martial can be achieved by the proposals containedin Chapter VI of our Report. They do not, however, conform to the pattern of courts-martial recommended for the Army and Air Force and they wouldmake it less easy for the courts-martial of the three services to be administeredas one judicial system with the considerable advantages that such a unificationwould bring. Nor do they achieve such a desirable distinction between thejudicial and other functions of the court as we find in the Lewis Committee&apos;srecommendations and in the Assize Courts. On the other hand they have thepractical advantage of meeting those considerations of naval prestige to whichofficers whom we heard attached great importance ; and we are conscious thatit is the naval officers principally who will have to work the courts-martial.&apos; It is only on account of these objections to the proposals in the Lewis Reportthat we have refrained from recommending the application of the Lewis recom-mendations to the Navy. Despite the strength of the arguments in favour ofthe Lewis proposals it seems to us that the wisest course at this stage, in thecase of the Navy, is to operate the proposals put forward in Chapter VI.(Sgd.)

MINORITY REPORTby Admiral Sir Arthur Palliser, K.C.B., D.S.C. (Retired)I regret having to record my disagreement with one main recommendationof my colleagues on the Committee, namely, that contained in paragraphs 61and 62 of the Report which extends eligibility to sit on courts-martial to officersof the non-executive branches of the Royal Navy and to officers of the royal marines and of the Reserves. This disagreement naturally extends to the consequent recommendations contained in paragraphs 63 and 64.2. Paragraph 54 of the Report contains reasons for retaining the existingfield of selection which to my mind are still cogent and, moreover, supportedby the weight of the evidence heard by the Committee. (3. Otherwise I am in agreement with Chapter V of the report and with paragraph 55 in particular. Paragraph 120 of the Report points out, however,that the duties of members of a naval court-martial are far wider than thoseof a jury. Liability for jury service is not by itself a qualification for a seaton the Bench.4. All witnesses heard by the Committee on this point repudiated any sugges-tion that injustice to an accused person had ever resulted from the presentrestriction on the field of selection of members of the court. The executive officers of the Royal Navy have always been accepted by the Service as awhole as its magistrature, and I see no advantage and considerable disadvantage in changing this state of affairs, even though its continuance will perpetuatethe admittedly anomalous position of officers of the Royal Marines serving afloat.(Sgd.)

APPENDIX CLegal Training of Officers of the Supply and Secretariat BranchAll officers of the Supply and Secretariat Branch are trained in naval lawwith a view to enabling them to perform their duties as judge advocates and assecretaries to Captains and Flag Officers.2. Cadets of this Branch are given an elementary grounding in naval law during their eight months in the training cruiser. This is followed by practical elementarytraining by the ship&apos;s Supply Officer during the two years they spend at seaas Midshipmen; when opportunities occur they attend courts-martial as partof the audience.3. At the age of 20-21 these officers receive more advanced training aspart of an eight months&apos; educational course at the Royal Naval College, Green-wich. In addition to instruction in the Naval Discipline Act, court-martial pro-cedure and summary punishment, lectures are given on criminal law by a barrister,court-martial demonstrations are arranged (with the students taking part) andvisits are made to the civil courts. On passing the examination at the end ofthis course officers are considered to be competent to deal with the legal workwhich forms part of their duties as CaptahVs secretaries. This includes advice on legal points arising in connection with summary punishments, and assistanceto the Captain in the preparation of applications for court-martial and in theconduct of the case for the prosecution. During the ensuing 10-12 years, inaddition to acting as Captain&apos;s secretary, officers may serve in Admirals&apos; officeswhere one of their tasks may be the scrutiny of court-martial papers before andafter the trial. They will probably have opportunities of assisting the judge advocate at courts-martial, and may, if considered competent, officiate as judge advocate in simple cases.4. Finally Lieutenants (S) of six years&apos; seniority and above and Lieutenant-Commanders (S) of four years&apos; seniority and below attend the Supply and Secre-tariat Advanced Course. This includes three months at Greenwich, where more advanced instruction is given on the lines described in paragraph 3 above. Thiscourse is intended to fit officers to officiate as judge advocate, to prosecute ordefend, and to advise a Flag Officer when employed as his secretary.5. Since 1946 two further schemes of legal training have been in force. Theseare designed to ensure that there will in future be at least one Supply officer in each command who is a fully qualified barrister and that there will be alarger number of officers who have received a practical training in criminal law.Two officers are selected each year to be trained at the public expense to qualifyas barristers. After call they will receive further training for six months aspupils in chambers with counsel practising in the criminal courts.6. In addition two junior officers are being selected each year for six months&apos;practical training with the Deputy Judge Advocate and as pupils in thechambers of practising civil counsel.7. In the past a number of Supply Officers have chosen to qualify as barristersat their own expense. Apart from the selection of officers for the special legaltraining already described, the Admiralty encourages this tendency by the grantof contributions towards the expenses of such officers on being called to the Bar.8. These measures should result in a few years in a substantial number of qualified barristers being available within the Royal Navy.
APPENDIX DProfessional Defence at Courts-MartialWhenever a court-martial is ordered the accused may choose to be defendedby a professional lawyer if one is available. In July, 1948, there was introduced a scheme broadly comparable to the scheme for legal aid in civil courts forwhich provision is made in the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, and earlierlegislation. Under this scheme professional assistance is provided for officersand men at the public expense, subject to a contribution by the accused accordingto his means, whenever the provision of such assistance seems desirable in theinterests of justice.2. The responsibility for deciding whether assistance shall be granted froimgfepublic funds to an accused person who desires to be professionally repve-Wsented lies with the convening authority.   In deciding whether to grant such assistance the convening authority is guided by the following considerations:  (a) Is the trial likely to involve points of legal difficulty?(b) Is the case of such a nature that legal aid would be granted to the accused if he were being tried before a civil court?3. The scheme is at present in force in the United Kingdom only, but weunderstand that its extension to commands abroad is under consideration.4. If the accused applies for professional representation at the public expensehis means are investigated by his Commanding Officer upon information pro-vided by the accused himself. The extent of the contribution which the accusedis required to make himself under the scheme varies from  1 when his net income does not exceed  100 to  25 when it exceeds  100 but does not exceed 500. Cases where the net annual income of the accused exceeds  500 are treatedon their merits. Net capital in excess of  50 (for a single man) or  100 (fora married man) is regarded as available to meet the cost of defence. The finaldecision as to the eligibility of the accused to receive aid from public funds and as to the extent of the aid to be provided rests with the convening authority.In assessing means, the object is to arrive at a figure representing the capital and income which the accused (and his wife) have available after meeting thdrcommitments. Thus, in reckoning capital, all clothes, furniture and householdeffects, and the value of the family home are excluded. In reckoning cornmit-ments, no account is taken of household expenses in so far as they are normalin amount, as these are regarded as offset by marriage allowance and othercompensatory allowances which are not taken into account in calculating anapplicants income.5. If the convening authority approves the grant of assistance the followingexpenses of the defence will be met from public funds, less any contribution by the accused assessed as in paragraph 4:  (a) Solicitors costs, on the basis of reasonable professional charges, accord-ing to the complexity of the case and the time involved.(b) Solicitors travelling expenses and subsistence.(c) Counsel&apos;s fees, where the employment of counsel is specifically authorizedby the convening authority.6. Lists are maintained of solicitors within reach of principal ports who areprepared to undertake work under this scheme.london printed and published by his majesty-s stationery officeTo be purchased directly from H.M.

LEWIS   and   PJXCHEE   COMMITTEESREPORT   OF   TJfTER-DEPARntBrCTAL   working party   ON   COMPARISON   of major   PROPOSALS1.     when  the Report of the Lewis Committee on Army and Air Force Courts-Martial(Cmd.7608)/was put to the Cabinet at the end of 19M3, there were four1 major issues calling for decision.   These were:-(l)     An Appeal Courts(2)     Reconstitution of more important Courts-Martial with Judges President,(3)     Unanimity on findings.(if)     Other rank membership of Courts-Martial for the trial of other ranks.2,     The Cabinet decided to defer a decision pending receipt of the Report ofthe- Pilcher Committee on Naval Courts-Martial covering these points.    The first report of the Pilcher Committee,, submitted in February, 1950* containsrcTOmmendations on all four points in relation to Naval Courts-Martial.3.     On (3) the Pilcher Committee (paras. 11L - 129),  with the exception of thetwo M.P. members, disagree with the Lewis Committee and agree with thesub-sequent inter-departmental (Napier) Committee in rejecting on practical groundijjthe proposal that all findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimous.   We. agree with the Pilcher Committee, and see no reason to depart from therecommendation on this point made in para. 27 of the Napier Report, that theexisting practice of majority verdicts should continue.h-*     On (A) both Committees, with the single exception of Mr, A.R. Blackburn,M.P., the minority member of the Lewis Committee, agree (Lewis, paras. 227 -2A0, Piloher, para. 60) in rejoc-ting-the proposal for other rank representation.We agree with the Committees for the reason given by them.5. On (l) and (2) there are fundamental differences between the - recommendations ]of&quot; the,.(l) Appeal Court(a) Lewis   committee*    iThe. Lewis Committee recommond:-(i) That there should be an appeal on questions of law against conviction(but not sentence), whenever the accused has pleaded &quot;Not Guilty&quot;, to a newlyconstituted Court of Appeal which would deal with the case in open Courtdeterminatively on-similar lines to those adopted in the civil Court of criminal Appeal.(ii) The Judge Advocate Gonoral, whoso titlejvould.be changed to &quot;Chief/Judge..
1  7Judge Martial&quot;, would, preside over the new Courts-Martial Appeal Court.   Heshould he given the status of anlrerauneration not less than that of aHigh Court Judge and would be assisted by two members selected from a JudicialStaff of Vice-Chief Judge Martial and Judges Martial, and from a panel ofK.C. &apos;s, all to be approved by the Lord Chancellor,(iii) This Court should have the sole power to quash convictions by court-Martial, thus involving the supersession of the Prerogative Powerof quashing exercised by the Sovereign and the Secretaries of State,(iv) This right of appeal should in cases of conviction take the placeof the present system of legal review of Proceedings by the Judge advocate general and such review would be abolished,(v.)        Confirmation of Proceedings would also be abolished exceptin the case of Field General Courts -Martial (to be called in futureEmergency Courts-Martial),(vi) ;    There would be no appeal on a plea of guilty or on grounds of fact or of mixed law and fact,(vii) The Court would have power in exceptional cases to allowfresh evidence to be called,(viii) On application for leave to appeal the Chief Judge Martial.orJudge Martial in the Command concerned would decide whether to grant or-refuse leave.   If such leave were refused, the convicted person would beentitled to apply to the Courts-Martial; Appeal Court for leave to appeal,(Mote:-      The Napier Committee, while fearing that the new system might work outloss favourably to many men than, the present system, recommended acceptancesubject to:- -    &apos;(a) appeal being allowed even on a plea of guilty incertain cases, at the instance of the Service authorities;(b) Appeal being allowed on questions of law or on such questions of fact or mixed law and fact as are contemplated in the Criminal AppealAct, 1907;(c) power being given to His Majesty in emergency to substitute a systemof review on pe^tion.by-^be.-Chief Judge Martial&apos;s Department&apos; forthe proposed system of oral appeal in.the case of appeals againstconviction, as it was felt that the full system of oral appeal wouldbe impracticable in war,)(b) Pilcher, Committee7,     The Pilcher Committee recommend:-(i) That there should be;a right of appeal against conviction to anindependent appeal tribunal on questions of law and in certain circumstanceson questions of mixed law and fact*(ii) The appellate tribunal should consist of three members drawn from apanel, appointed by the Lord Chancellor, of K.C. &apos;s or other experiencedCounsel who practise exc have pr&amp;ctisod-dx*.

If such leave were refused theconvicted person should be entitled to apply to the-appellate tribunal forleave to appeal. ,&apos;8.     It will foe seen that while both Committees have repci.T.ien&amp;e&amp; ;the institution of an appellate tribunal, the recommendations of the two Committees as to theconstitution and functions of such a tribunal differ fundamentally.9.     The constitution of the appellate tribunal recommended by the LewjLs-^Committee is dependent on the implementation of its recommendations that thereshould be a Chief Judge Martial, Vice Chief Judge Martial and Judges Martialin,place of the Judge Advocate General, his Deputy and existing legal staff. -10.    The Pilcher Committee regard an appellate tribunal so constituted as unacceptable for the Navy and do not agree that the tribunal should havedeterminative, as distinct from advisory, powers, or that the powers of review and of quashing&apos; convictions should be surrendered by the Board of Admiralty.They recommend that appeals from all three Services should lie to the sametribunal, but that, if this is not possible, a separate tribunal should be constituted for the Navy,v 1 Need for an Appeal Court,.11.,: One of the major decisions for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make is whether there should bo an appeal from a Court Martial to an Appeal Court of any kindat all.   There is none now, and the Oliver Committee in 1938 considered the matterand advised against any change in this respect.   But as the Lewis Committee andthe Pilcher Committee have each urnnimously recommended an appeal against convict;to an Appeal Court, we assume in this part of our Report that provision must bemade for &apos;such an appeal to a Court of some kind...Three Possible Courses12.&apos;:&apos; On that assumption, the possible courses are:-       ,&apos; .(i)     To have separate, appeal tribunals for the Army and Air Force on the/one.*
one hand, and for the Navy on the other, conforming in constitution and powers to the respective recommendations of the Lewis and PilcherCommittees,(ii) To.appoint a single appeal tribunal for all three Services,but with varying nKsmbership and powers according to the Service, to which theappellant belongs,(iii) To appoint a single appeal tribunal with the same powers for all three services - either the-&apos; powers recommended by the Lewis Committee or thoserecommended by the Pilchcr Committee or a modification of both.Course (i)13,   Course ,.(i) is the course suggested by the Pilcher Committee as its secondpreference, (para, 155) ,if a common tribunal, with the constitution and powersrecommended by thorn for the Navy, is not accepted for the Army and Air Force.Ik,   This course would present no technical difficulty if Ministers areprepared to defend the establishment of two separate tribunals with differingpowers, but there are other difficulties:&quot; &quot;(a)   . We do not think a naval appeal tribunal composed merely of threenominated K.C.&apos;s or barristers would command public confidence, and naval appeals alone would not justify a permanent whole-time appointmentof a High Court Judge or other person of similar standing as president,which would be the obvious alternative to produce a stronger Court,&apos; (b) &quot; Service-men tried under the code of a Service other.than theirparent Service would, on practical grounds, have to be given a right ofappeal to the tribunal associated with the code under which they weretried.   They would therefore lose the right of appeal.to the tribunal fortheir own Service.   For example, officers and men of the royal marines, when subject to the Naval Discipline Act;. would hive a right of:appeal to the Naval Appeal Court, and when subject tc the Army Act, to theArmy and Air Force Appeal Courts   Officers and men of the Air Force subjeotto the Naval Discipline Act by reason of attachment would have to have recourse to the Naval Appeal Court, and officers   and men of .the Navy whensubject -to the. Air Force Act) to the Army and. Air Force Appeal Court,   this might result in differential treatment between officers and men of thesame Service. /-.-.Course (il)II1 H.M. Government wish, so far as possible, to give effect to thepJcoCT.iendations of both Committees, but at the same time consider. .that any appellate/tribunal
..    - 5 - Appeal Courttribunal set up should be empowered&apos; to consider appeals from all three Services,the difficulty of constitution might be overcome by nominating as permanentpresident a High Court Judge or some other person of siaiiilar status and - calibrenot actively connected with any of the Services,   This solution would enable thepowers and procedure of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and the constitution of    ICourts-Martial recommended by the Lewis Committee.to be adopted for the Army andAir Force,   It would, however, involve a radical departure from the lewis committee&apos;s recommendation that for the purpose of appeals, there should be a chief Judge Martial having status and ^remuneration not less than that of a puisneJudge of the High Court of Justice who would preside over the Courts-Martial appeal court and also be the administrative head of the Judge Martial staff.   If thecervices of. the person designated Chief Judge Martial were not required as Presidentof the Courts-Martial. Appeal Court as recommended by the Lewis Committee, his functions would be confined to being merely the administrative head of the judge martial staff with no appellate duties whatever.   The conception of the appoirrtmeiiiof Vice Chief Judge Martial envisaged by the Lewis Committee would be similarlyaffected, ..16, The composition and functions of. the. Tribunal would; under this scheme be asfollows:- .v     ....... .; . .......(i) Army and Air Force appeals would, be. heard by the President and members drawn either from the Judge Martial staff or from a panel of K.C. Ts, asreconmended by the Lewis Committee^(ii) Navy appeals would be heard by the President and members,drawn from a panel of ICC,&apos;s.(iii) The Navy would retain the review of Courts-Martial proceedings by the judge Advocate of the Fleet and t e Board of Admiralty as recommended in thePilcher Report, while the Army and. Air Force would abandon the confirmationand. review system in accordance with the Lewis Committee recommendations..(iv)     Similarly, to accord with the respective Committee recommendations,-this appellate tribunal would in the case of the Navy appeals be advisory,&quot;but in the case of Army and Air Force appeals be determinative, and it would follow that powers of quashing would rest with the tribunal in the caseof the Army and the Air Force but with the Board of Admiralty in the case ofthe Navy,(v)&apos;      Service-men tried under the Code of a Service other than theirparent Service would be dealt with under the procedure, appropriate to the Code!under which they had been tried, and not under that normally applicable to     !members of their parent Service, but with a Court so constituted there shouldbe a greater measure of uniformity,17,- It may, however, be considered that the amount of differentiation&apos;between thethree Services involved in the acceptance of the divergent rcoommendations of the.&quot; - -  &quot;jrespective Committees for the Navy on the one bai..&apos;\ &quot;&quot;-aid the Army and the R.A.F, yoJ ;.
cAppeal Court- 6 -on the other will be difficult to defend politically or otherwise and that asingle appellate tribunal should be established with the same constitution and powers for all three Services.    This is a.matter which will obviously call for themost careful consideration by Ministers since a uniform system for the threeervices can only be achieved by rejecting the solution recommended by oneCommittee   or the other, although achieving the objective of a common tribunaldesired by the Pilcher Committee.   Such a divergence from the reports may arouseontroversy, but we think it should be possible to provide a solution which will achieve a general measure of support.18.   The adoption of the Lewis system for all three Services, apart from theiPilcher and. Navy objections to a Court of Appeal manned wholly or partly by Judgeilartial. staff who&apos;are primarily concerned in their day to day duties with thejudicial administration of the other two Services, will probably be felt to be out of the question.   It would involve abolishing the review of proceedings by board of Admiralty, to the retention of which the Pilcher Committee and, weImderstand, the Board of admiralty, attach the highest importance, and removingpen the Beard and conferring on the Court of Appeal the sole power of quashingreival $rooeedings.    It would also appear to involve the imposition-on theLtairalty of the Judge President system of Courts-Martial instead of the advisoryludge advocate system, since the former is closely linked with the Lewis Committee*sproposals for abolition of the legal review of proceedings.   This, again, weunderstand, would be strongly opposed by the Board of Admiralty, who could appealto the support of the Pilcher Committee in their objections.    (The Court-Martialrecommendations are discussed separately below).19.   If uniformity is to be secured therefore it would seem that it must besecured broadly on the basis of appointing an independent tribunal^th no administrative connection with any of the three Services, retaining thebower of quashing convictions in the hands of the Sovereign and the SecretariesIf State and Board of Admiralty and continuing in principle the legal review ofIroceedings which under the Lewis proposal would cease, while improving andsimplifying the existing procedure as much as possible.20.       &quot;have accordingly considered the. possibility of&apos; a common solution onthese &quot;liifces. which might be acceptable for all three Services, and might at theiWoq x^fcie- meet the difficulties with regard to the Lewis Committee proposals/which.*
(a)   The Court. .which were felt &quot;by some members of the Cabinet when the Lewis Report wasconsidered by the Cabinet at their 81st (48) Meeting on the .15th December, 11 &quot;3These difficulties wer e&apos; &quot;Briefly: - -(i) That it was douBtful whether the proposed system ;of. appeal on points, of law would &quot;Be of as.much value to the service-man as thepresent   system of automatic review by&apos;the Judge Advocate General andthe Service authorities.(ii) &apos; That the present system would break down in war.   In the view ofthe Official (Napier) Committee it would be impracticable to continuethe system of oral appeal in time of war, having regard to the volumeof Courts-Martial trials in the last war, and that Committee had therefore recommended the substitution of review on written petitionto the Chief Judge Martial in war-time. .21.     The advantages of recourse being had by all three Services to a singleappellate body would be:-(a) to ensure co-ordination and uniformity of legal decisions -   -.affecting the Naval Discipline Act, the Army. Act. andjthe -..AirForce Act, particularly in respect of civil offenpes- tried under those Acts;(b) that members of all three Services (all of which include an element of National Service men) although tried under differentcodes, would share a common right to have their final appealsdetermined by the same tribunal;1    - .       r -(c) if tried under the code of a Service other than their parentService, they would not lose this common right of final appealto the same Court.    This is important having regard to theinter-relationship of personnel of the three Services in modern conditions. &apos; &apos;    :i22.     As regards the constitution of the.common Appeal Court itself we have considered three possibilities:- .;.(a) The Court of Criminal Appeal(b) A specially constituted Appeal Court linked with the Court of criminal Appeal.(c) The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council -
/(b)   A specially.- 8 -&apos;(a)   The Court of Criminal Appeal23.     This Court deals with oases of indictable offences tried with a jury atAssizes, or.Quarter/Sessions, and not with appeals from Courts of. summary jurisdiction. - - :2A.     The Court consists of all the Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division.    Thequorum is three.    The Lord Chief Justice arranges the business, and selectsthe Judges who are to sit on any particular occasion, with due regard to thebusiness of the King&apos;s Bench Division proper.25-     The Lewis Committee rejected this Court as the Appeal Court for Army andAir Force Courts Martial because it thought that these appeals would be.far toonumerous, but that was on the assumption that the review system would be abolished.    On our present assumption, the review system would- continue andwould act as a filter, so that appeals would come to the Court only in caseswhere the conviction had not been quashed on review, and the reviewing authority or the Court had given leave to appeal,26.     We have tried to estimate the number of such appeals.    It is exceedingly difficult and any estimate must bo quite conjectural.    If, as we hope, thelawyers to be appointed to handle the cases both at the trial and on review are-of high quality, the number of appeals in peace time should not be great.    the judge Advocate General puts the figure (including the Naval appeals)conjecturally at 100 to 200 a year in peace time, rising to 1000 to 2000 ayear in war time, depending on the total number and the type of trials.But even 200 appeals might well take 30 days to hear, a serious inroad intothe time of three King&apos;s Bench Judges.27.     After careful examination of this possibility, we cannot recommend theCourt of Criminal Appeal itself for our purpose on the following grounds:-(i) The additional burden would be heavy.(ii) Many of the cases would not be serious enough to merit theattention of three Judges.(iii) For the purely Service offences, even so competent a Courtas this might feel the lack of expert assistance from the Services.
(b)   A specially constituted Appeal Court linked withthe Court of Criminal Appeal28.    The most promising suggestion which we can make for such a Court is oneconstituted on the lines of the Court of Criminal Appeal but with modifications to meet the points above numbered from (i) to (iii). .   .29.    Our suggested constitution is as follows :-(i)     All the members of the Court of. Criminal Appeal (i.e.  all theKing&apos;s Bench Judges) would be ex-officio members of the Court, . but theCourt would include a Panel of persons nominated by the Lord Chancelloras specially qualified for the purpose.(ii)     The Lord Chief Justice would arrange the business of the Court,and how many members should sit, and who they .should be,  so however that at least three members should sit, of whom at least one, should be. a King&apos;s Bench Judge, and should preside.(iii)     For the Panel, there might from time to time be available such persons as a. Judge of another Division, a retired High Court Judge, are tired Judge Advocate General or Judge Advocate of the Fleet, a King&apos;sCounsel, a retired Judge of some important Court outside England, being in each case chosen for his special suitability.    (The Judge advocate general and the Judge Advocate of the Fleet would not be eligible, asthey would have dealt with the case on review).(iv)     The Court could have power to sit. with Service Officers of highrank as Assessors.(v)     The form of the Court&apos;s decision should be determinative., like that of the Court of Criminal Appeal.(vi)     There could be power for one King&apos;s Bench Judge sitting alone to hear applications for leave to appeal. .;. ,(vii)     The Registry might be an extension of the Registry of the-Courtof Criminal Appeal.The reports of the decisions of the Court might be included in the appropriateLaw Reports. -30.    Under this constitution, the most important or difficult cases couldbe heard by three King&apos;s Bench Judges.or more;    rather cases might be suitablefor two King&apos;s Bench Judges and a member of the Panel;    and others&apos;for one. King&apos;s Bench Judge and two members of.the Panel, as the Lord Chief Justicemight arrange.        .(c)   The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.31.    We think it might be practicable for the Judicial Committee to become theCourts Martial Appeal Court for all three Services, for the following reasons:-(i)     The Judicial Committee-already deals with appeals in criminal cases from the colonies.    Appeals from Service personnel might come fromplaces abroad and might concern a colonial soldier.    (See LewisReport para.  13l)./(ii)   The..
Appeal Court- 10 - -(ii)     The Judicial Committee is constitutionally an advisory body,  sothat in form&apos; its judgments are not determinative.(iii)     Power could be taken to appoint as a paid member of the JudicialCommittee a person with special experience of Service law and practice..  (iv)     The commitments of the Judicial -Committee in other directionshave been considerably reduced, and it may be that in a year or two (whenCanadian appeals will have ceased) it could undertake this additionaltask without detriment to its other business or to the judicialbusiness of the House of Lords.32.    On the other hand, there are two possible objections.    In the first place the Law Lords sitting in the.House of Lords have an appellate jurisdictionsuperior.even to the Court of Criminal Appeal.   A Board of the JudicialCommittee hearing Court Martial appeals would have.to include at least semeLaw Lords, and it would hardly be logical to regard (as we do) many court martial appeals as being unworthy to occupy the attention of three Judges ofthe Court of Criminal Appeal, but yet worthy to occupy the attention of atleast .two Law Lords. .--&apos;-&apos;-33&apos;    Secondly, the Judicial Committee have hitherto declined to act as an ordinary Court of Criminal Appeal from Courts overseas;    they do not dealwith such points as misdirection of a jury, but only give leave (broadly speaking) if there appears- to have been something contrary to natural justice in the proceedings below.    The question whether the -proposal would adversely affect their practice in colonial criminal cases would need consideration.34-    Nevertheless, we regard the Judicial Committee as the only practicable alternative to the special Court described above at (b).Grounds of Appeal35.    The Lewis Committee, in paragraph 1A3 of their Report, recommendedthat there should be an appeal on a question of law against convictionwhenever an accused has pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;.36.    The Napier Inter-Departmental Committee, in paragraph 33 of theirReport, stated that in their view the Lewis Committee did not intend to limitappeals strictly to those on questions of law only and, for the reasons givenin that paragraph, recommended that the right of appeal should, Mutatis Mutandis, be similar to that provided by sections 3 and 4(&apos;i) of the criminal appeal Act,  1907,  that is to say,  there should be a right of appeal on aquestion of law alone or, with leave, on a question of fact alone, or a/question. .
question of..mixed law and fact.37-    The Pilcher Committee,   in paragraph 1A7 et seq of their Report,accepted the recommendation of the Lewis Committee that there should&apos; he aright of appeal on questions of law where the accused had pleaded &quot;not \guilty&quot;, but stated that to separate questions of law from questions of fact was not always possible and, while not recommending that there should be any right of appeal on questions of fact alone,  they did not think, that thejurisdiction of the Appeal Tribunal should be excluded if the question wasone of. mixed law and fact, provided that it is borne in mind that the appeal tribunal is intended to determine legal questions.38.   In-making this recommendation the Pilcher Committee (see paragraph 1A2of their Report) called attention to the fact that a number of Naval courts martial, concerned charges of neglect of duty and charges of conduct to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline, and stated that, in their View,Naval Officers are the best persons qualified to adjudicate on matters ofthat kind which relate for the most part to naval tradition and practice.These observations apply equally to the Army and Air Force, and we apprehendthat the Board of Admiralty,  the Army Council and the Air Council would attach great importance to this point aril would hold that the only appropriate authorities to deal with the standards of professional conduct and disciplinerequired of members of the Armed Forces are-the Service authorities con-trolling those forces, and that it is wholly inappropriate that on matters ofthis kind there should be any appeal to a lay Tribunal,  however eminent.    Totake an example, assume that a Naval Officer is accused of negligently, or bydefault, stranding or hazarding his ship, and the admitted facts are thatwhile the vessel was proceeding through narrow waters,  the accused was not onthe bridge.    The question then arises whether, according to naval practice and the professional tradition of the Navy,  the Commanding Officer was justified in the admitted circumstances in leaving the navigation of the vessel to a subordinate officer.    The appropriate judges of this essentiallyservice matter must be the Naval authorities,  that is to say, the Naval./Court..
1 C 9Court Martial, and ultimately the Board of Admiralty, on petition.39-    Similar.examples can readily be imagined in the other two Services.AO&quot;    The Service representatives urge very strongly that while .theright of appeal should follow that given by the Court of Criminal AppealAct, 1907s that right of appeal should not. extend to any questionwhether any conduct, act or omission by a member of the Forces convictedby,Court Martial reaches or falls below the standards of professionalconduct, skill or duty which in the opinion of the appropriate authority within each Service is required of a member of. that service, it being understood that the accused will in these service matters as heretoforehave a right of appeal by petition to the Board of Admiralty,. the ArmyCouncil, or the Air Council, as the case may be.A1-   We agree with these views and to avoid misunderstanding we think,with leave it right to add that while the right of appeal/ should not extend to the purely service matters aftave mentioned, it should be made clear in any legislation giving effect to this recommendation that it will still beopen to the accused to. appeal to the Appeal Court on any question whichis not purely a Service matter.   For example, he will still have a rightOf appeal with leave on any question of misdirection, the wrongfuladmission of evidence, or on the question whether there is any evidence on which the Court Martial might convict.   We do not suggest that the appeal Court should be excluded from adjudicating upon an appeal incases of Mutiny, Sedition or other offences in which the criterionto be applied is not based exclusively on service practice andtraditions. \ &apos;Reference to Court on the motion of the J.A.G. or J.A.F.A2.    Whichever system, of appeal is adopted, we recommend that it should include arrangements whereby a case can be sent to appeal on the motion of the Judge Advocate General or Judge Advocate of the Fleet, as thecase may be, if he considers that there is an important question of law which should be determined.A3-.-
43- If it is decided to appoint a specially constituted appeal court, linked with the Court of Criminal Appeal, we think that there   &apos;should he the same right of appeal to the House of Lords as was      &apos;conferred by the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, in cases before the Courtof Criminal Appeal, viz: where the Attorney-General gives a certificatethat the decision of the couirt involves a point of law of exceptionalpublic importance, and that it is desirable in the public interest thata further appeal should be brought.    The Attorney-General issues acertificate very rarely, but we understand that the number of applicationsmade to him in ordinary criminal appeals is large and it is for consid-eration whether this additional burden could be undertaken.    Subject tothat point, it seems difficult to justify a distinction between the Courtof Criminal Appeal and the proposed new Services appeal court in this regard.      .     :      &apos;        - &apos;;- ,Consequential alterations in the Court Martial system &apos;44&apos;    If it is decided that the appeal in public, which was the main object sought by both the Lewis and Pilcher Committees, should be byappeal to a common tribunal with the same constitution and powers forall three Services on the lines suggested above,  the question remains howfar the recommendations of the two Committees as to the prior stages&apos;in the procedure of the Court Martial system would require alteration.45*    la the case of the Navy the recommendations of the Pilcher committee could be accepted in principle;    these recommendations envisage thatthe review by the Admiralty, on the advice of the Judge Advocate of theFleet, should continue as at present, and the substitution of the specialCourt suggested at (b) above or of the Judicial Committee of the privy council for the appeal tribunal proposed by the Pilcher Committee would present no difficulties.    The number of cases involved, and thefiltering of cases through the review system, should result in there being very few cases to be dealt with on appeal.    Powers of quashing/would..Appeal to House of Lords
1 P&quot;3I u uwould continue to be exercised by the Board of Admiralty, but wouldalso be exercisable by the Special Court of Appeal, if, as we suggest,the.powers of the latter were made determinative.46. In the case of the Army and the&apos;Royal Air Force some alterationfrom the system recommended by the Lewis Committee would be required.That Committee recommended the abolition of the system of confirmation,review and petition; while this might involve, in practice, a consid-erable loss to the individuals concerned it was felt by the Committeethat it would not be possible, on the score of man-power, to continuethe review system as well as that of appeal.47.   We think that, if the Army and Royal Air Force system of conf irma-tion, review *nd petition were to be retained but modified in certainways which ha&apos;ve. been suggested by the Judge Advocate General and whichare set out in detail in the Appendix to this Report,  the combination of this system with that of appeal would be quite practicable, the accused would retain the advantages of an automatic check in every case,and the number of appeals which would eventually reach the Appeal.Tribunal should not be unduly great.    The result would be that thesystems in each of the three Services would be similar in most respects -the differences being virtually only those dictated by the different conditions under, which the Services.operate. &apos;   -. Advantages of new proposals.48.   Whichever alternative - (b) or (c) above - is adopted for the appeal Court we feel that the combination of a body of such authority and status as the final court of appeal, with the retention of theadvantages of the existing system of automatic review in all three Services,improved and simplified,  in the case of the Army and the Air Force, on thelines suggested by the Judge advocate General, should effectively remove any remaining ground for criticism that justice was not done or did notappear to be done, and it would at the same time have the great advantages that it should be able to operate equally in peace.and war, and would.... / ensure. .

The Lewis Committee recommend that:-(i)    Courts-Martial should continue to be of the same generaltypes as at present viz., General, District and Field GeneralCourts-Martial (the last named to be called in future &quot;EmergencyCourts-Martial&quot;).(ii)   A General Court-Martial should retain its present jurisdictionand powers, but instead of,  as hitherto, being a sorvice court,/presided..
court, presided over by a service officer, . and advised by a Judge Advocatewho is not necessarily legally qualified, it would be presided over by a judge Martial or. Deputy Judge Martial, who would be a civilian lawyer ofsuitable experience.   His functions would be similar to those of a judgeat an Assize Court, he &quot;being the sole judge of questions of law andsumming up the case, the other members of the court consisting of five &apos;service officers, who would determine the issue of guilt on the analogy of a jury.(iii)       District Courts-Martial would be of two types, one, to try the .more serious cases, presided over by a civilian lawyer (Assistant judge martial) and the other for less serious cases,&apos; by a serving officer,-.w.howould,whenever practicable, be a &quot;permanent president&quot; employed regularlyfor such duty at Courts-Martial.    The first type would have the jurisdictionand powers at present possessed by a District Court-Martial;    the secondtype would be restricted to a maximum of 12 months imprisonment.   Bothtypes would function on the lines of a bench of magistrates and not pfjudge and jury;    there would be no summing up, and the court would be judge&apos;of : law and fact.(iv)&apos;     An Emergency Court-Martial would have full powers but would haveno legal assistance&apos;.    It would only,be permitted when it was not possibleto convene a General Court-Martial or a District Court-Martial preside over by an Assistant Judge Martial.51.    It will be noticed that the Lewis Committee recommend the abolition ofconfirmation (except in the case of the Emergency Court-Martial) and of automatic review and the substitution of a right, of oral appeal, not only inthe case of Courts presided over by a Judge President but also in the case&apos;of a Court-Martial with a lay president. ....(Note:-   The Napier Committee recommended acceptance of the Court-Martialrecommendations of the Lewis-Committee subject to:-(i)    the District Court-Martial p---;sided, over by an AssistantJudge Martial being assimilated in procedure to the G.C.M. (Judge .and Jury) system:     - . -(ii)    some minor modifications of detail.)- -    ,(b)   Pilcher Committee52.    The Pilcher Committee recommend:-(i)     That the general set up of Naval Courts-Martial should not be&quot;fundamentally changed.    All members of the Court should be nominated by the convening authority.    The majority of the Court, includingthe President, should be executive officers of the Royal Navy.(ii)     The Court should be assisted by a Judge Advocate who shouldcontinue to act in a advisory capacity but not necessarily be a qualified lawyer.    In all cases, however,  of a very grave, difficultor complicated character (see Pilcher Report para. 77(a)), the Judge:  Advocate should be chosen from King&apos;s Counsel or barristers experienced in English Criminal Law, the Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet orformer .holders of the office. -   .
(iii)   The president should be empowered on the advice of the judge advocate to authorise him to hear arguments as to the admissibilityof evidence and applications for separate trials in the absenceof the Court. &apos;.. . . i.. (iv)   The Judge Advocate&apos; should sum up by advising the Court in- open. Court on the legal principles involved before the Courtconsiders its. finding.   He should also be at liberty to include in the summing up a review of the evidence where necessary;;&apos;.-.(v)    The Pilcher Committee refer to the Lewis Committeerecommendation that a trained lawyer should preside over-a Court-Martial as Judge President.    They recommend tho.t no such system beadopted in the Navy.    (See Para. 80 of Pilcher Report).Possibility of -Divergent Systems;53&apos;    while the adoption of divergent systems for the several Services mygive rise to criticism and&apos;controversy, and in particular to a demand thatif the soldier and airman can be given the benefit of a &quot;judge and Jury&quot; systesthe same benefit should be extended to the sailor, we see no Intrinsic, reason why the different systems recommended by the Lewis and Pilcher committees should not be adopted for the Army and R.A.F. on the one. band and the Navyon. the other, if so desired, and if Ministers are prepared to defend thedifferentiation.   The Lewis Committee regarded the position of a judge advocate at a trial held under the Army Act or Air Force Act as anomalousand unsatisfactory, in that he is merely an adviser on law and procedure,with considerable responsibility but no power, and they thought the system could be improved by making the Judge Martial or Deputy Judge Martial presideand be the sole judge on questions of law whose direction on the law wouldbe binding on the Court.    The Pilcher Committee recommend against the judge Advocate presiding under Naval conditions, but they recommend thatthe advice given by the Judge Advocate should be followed and that theAdmiralty should issue instructions designed to ensure this, and that if inany case the Court does not follow the Judge Advocate&apos;s advice the president should be required to record that fact in the minutes together with thereasons for the failure to do so.54-    In our view, while arguments ban be advanced in favour of one systemof the: other, they both provide adequate safeguards&apos;for the accused, andthis is not a matter in which uniformity in the three Services is essential./Nor..
1 R K. 1 b 3-Nor do we think there would be any insuperable technical difficulty in:combining the appeal to the specially appointed Services Appeal Courtwe have suggested or to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council andretention of legal review of all Proceedings with the reconstitution of courts-Martial recommended by the Lewis Committee for the Army and Air&apos;Force if this is thought desirable.55.   In that case wherever a Judge Advocate (under whatever title) ispresent, he would in the case of an Army or Air Force Court-Martial actas&quot; a^Judge-Eresident giving directions on law to the Court instead of -acting,  (as at present and as proposed by the Pilcher Committee for NavalCourts-Martial), as a Judge Advocate with advisory functions;    confirma-tion would be confined to sentence;   and the legal review would be thatin.-&apos;the--JudgewAdvocate General &apos;s&apos; Office, including review on petition.Possibility of Assimilating the two Systems56.   Ifton the. other hand, uniformity&apos;in all three Services in the formof trial is also regarded as important, and if Ministers are prepared todefend the dropping of the Judge President system for major courts-rr^urfcialin the Army and the R.A.F. (a system recommended by the Lewis Committee),uniformity could be achieved to a&apos; great extent if the existing Court-Martial system, i.e. a Service tribunal assisted in appropriate cases by a judge Advocate (in the Army and Air Force invariably with legal qualifi-cations), were modified to remove certain anomalies regarding the -functions of the Judge Advocate.   The recommendations of the pilcher committee in this connection are-explained above (pages-&apos;26uihd-ii? c&amp;t&amp;rjis.^Report),and they could, if accepted, be readily adapted so as to apply to theMilitary and Air Force system.57.   The present position of the Judge Advocate under the latter system is described in para. 195 of the Lewis Report.   Under the existing system a  Court-Martial carries out the functions of both Judge and Jury, andthis has raised questions of considerable difficulty in connection withthe admissibility of evidence.    This position would, we think, be much/ improved..
improved if the Judge Advocate were empowered or permitted to hear^arguments and evidence as to the admissibility of evidence andapplications for separate trials in the absence of the Court.This could be effected by an appropriate amendment of Section &quot;JOof the Army and Air Force Acts and Rule of Procedure 103;    (ofPilcher Report para.  8J+.).58.   Apart from the desirability of uniformity in the three Services,the following arguments could, we think, be adduced in support of adecision to adopt   the existing Judge Advocate system, with modifica-tions, as recommended by the Pilcher Committee,in preference to the judge President system recommended by the Lewis Committee :-(i) The Lewis Committee recommended the Judge President system for certain Courts-Martial only, viz. General Courts-Martial andthe more serious and difficult cases tried by District Courts-Martial.    In other cases, which would have Service officers as-Presidents, including Emergency Courts-Martial,which would of necessity form the vast majority in war-time and would haveto try offences of all kinds, including the most serious offencescarrying the death penalty, there is no provision for legal-  &quot;direction or advice.    It might appear somewhat anomalous to adopta system for the more serious cases in peace which considerations of legal man-power would make impracticable for far greater numbersof equally or more serious cases in war.(ii) Y/hile in peace-time Judge Presidents of the necessarystatus and calibre might be forthcoming for all General Courts-Martial and serious District Courts-Martial which might be held,many of the officers with legal experience who had to be calledupon to act as judge advocates in the last war would have been quite unsuitable to preside at Courts-Martial as Judges, and thiswould probably be true in any future war.    It will be recalled inthis connection that the Lewis Committee recommend that EnergencyCourts-Martial should be permitted only when General and DistrictCourts-Martial are not possible, and it might well be thatunsuitable officers would in many cases find themselves acting as Judge Presidents at General or District Courts-Martial inwar-time.    This would not enhance the dignity or authority of the.-,.t%    . Courts or assist the administration of justice.(iii)   The use of Judge Presidents for all important or difficultCourts-Martial in peace-time would mean that many regular officers would gain no experience of presiding over such-Courtsbefore war came when they would be liable to be called on to preside at emergency Courts-Martial trying very difficult and serious cases.(iv)   It was felt by some members of the Cabinet at the meetingon the 15th December, 1948?&apos; that the reconstitution of Courts-Martial on a Judge and Jury basis might lead to a demand, on thelines of the minority report by Mr. Blackburn;, M.P., for otherrank membership of Courts-Martial./Summary..
Courts-MartialLegislation-20 -Summary as Regards Courts-Martial59.   The possible courses of action which seem to us to be open and between which a decision is required are:-1.     To adopt the reports of the two Committees as they stand:Advantage:    The fact that the recommendations are being adopted- without alteration.Disadvantages:    Divergence between the Services.   Limitedapplication of Lewis Committee proposals in peace and still more, proportionately, in war.   Doubtfulsupply of suitable Judge--Presidents in war-time.Lack of experience in presiding over importantcourts-martial for Regular Officers in peace.Possible demand for other rank membership of&quot;juries&quot;.2.     To adopt the Pilcher Committee proposals for the Navy and.continue the present system of Judge Advocates, modifiedwhere necessary to bring it into line with the Pilcher.  recommendations, for the Army and Air Force.Advantages : A uniform system for the three Services..  Avoidance of disadvantages listed under 1*Disadvantages:       Involves rejection of Lewis Committeeproposals for reconstitution of importantcourts-martial under Judge-Presidents.On balance we recommend course 2.Legislation60.   The form of legislation necessary to give effect to any of theseproposals will depend to seme extent on the precise proposals approved.In any case extensive amendments to the Army and Air Force Acts and theNaval Discipline Act will be entailed.    These could be effected either by a special three-Service Bill or by separate Bills for the Army and AirForce on the one hand and for the Navy on the other.    The difficulty of joint legislation for all three services is that the Admiralty is unlikely to be ready for a considerable time owing to the necessity for awaiting the Second Pilcher Report (which may affect the court-martial system aswell as the summary system) and to the review which is now proceeding in the Admiralty of those portions of the Naval Discipline Act which arenot affected by the Pilcher recommendations.    On all these points the/Admiralty..
the Admiralty is under an obligation to consult the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand, and these processes are likely to delay beyondthe date which would be acceptable for the other Services the preparationof amending legislation by the Admiralty.61.   If it is decided that a special Appellate Tribunal such as we havesuggested should be set up for all three Services, or that the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council should be constituted as the AppellateTribunal, a special Bill for this purpose could be enacted, leaving thethree Services to enact separately the amending legislation for theirrespective codes.   We understand, however, that the Admiralty stronglyfavour dealing at one time with the whole of the legislation affectingthe naval system and would prefer to legislate separately if early legislation by the other two Services is considered necessary.    It wouldbe possible, though perhaps a little awkward, to establish the tribunal for the Army and Air Force first, -and to extend it to the Navy laterwhen the Admiralty were ready to legislate.    A further possibility wouldbe to establish the Tribunal for all three Services in the same Bill butto   have different appointed days for each Service.62.   If separate legislation for the Army and Air Force is decided upon,this might possibly be embodied in the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill,1951, if it is practicable to delay action till then.    The difficultyof this, however, apart from the question of timing, is that the AnnualBill has to go through on a strict time-table and it.may be undesirable to include in it anything so.complicated or controversial as theseproposals are likely to be in certain respects.63.    These considerations seem to point to the desirability of aimingeither at a special Bill for all three Services, or at a special Billfor the Army and Air Force,   to be followed as soon as possible by a naval Discipline Act Amending Bill applying the proposals to the Navywith any necessary adaptations. ACourts-Partial procedure Bill is atpreseh-fc included tentatively in the 1950/51 legislative programme./6A. .
Legislation30th &amp;une, 1950.i64-    In any case we suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government may think itdesirable te announce their decisions on the main questions at issue and perhaps publish them in the form of a White Paper, which could be made thesubject of debate, before actually initiating any legislation.
Proposed procedure on Confirmation, Review and Petitionin Army and Air Force cases1. Confirmation -The present procedure of confirmation has the advantage that it tends to bring to light shortly after the conclusion of the trial any defectstherein, e.g. jurisdiction,  an . inconsistent plea of guilty,  or a seriousirregularity occurring during the trial.    If the Proceedings are notconfirmed for one or other of the above reasons the accused is not committed to undergo punishment and may be tried again before a fresh Court.    Incertain circumstances a reassembly of the Court for the purpose of revisionof the finding and/or sentence may be ordered before confirmation, e.g. ifit appears that the Court have not considered finding the accused guilty ofsome other offence, or of the same offence under circumstances involving aless degree of punishment, under the provision of Section 56 of the Army Actor Air Force Act, or making a special finding under Rule of Procedure AA(d).An original sentence can be revised if it is invalid.In addition to these aspects of confirmation a confirming authority is empowered when confirming the Proceedings of a Court-Martial himself to mitigate or remit the punishment awarded by the Court-Martial, or commutesuch punishment for any less punishment to which the offender might have been sentenced.   Legal advice by the Judge Advocate General or a member of his staff is given on the Proceedings of all General Courts-Martial held at homeand abroad and also on the Proceedings of District Courts-Martial referredto him for that purpose by the confirming authority.2.      If confirmation is retained the question arises whether it is desirablethat the Sovereign should continue personally to confinn the Proceedings of courts-Martial.    It has always been felt that the King could not well be advised to quash his own confirmation (on Petition or otherwise), and thepractice has been to advise instead the grant of a Free Pardon.   Thathowever is not an altogether satisfactory procedure, and it seems hardly in accord with modern constitutional principles that the Sovereign should/personally..
APPEInTDIX- 2 - -should personally exercise judicial functions which are subject to review. . This is likely to be felt even more strongly if there is to bean appeal to an Appellate. Court, which may result in the quashing of.theProceedings after confirmation.. -If the King ceased personally to confirm proceedings, he would ofcourse retain his power of quashing convictions confirmed by others andof commuting, mitigating or remitting sentences&apos;, and of giving or with-holding his approval of sentences of Cashiering or dismissal of officers.It would only be necessary to alter the! form of warrants issued pursuant to Section i22 of the Army and Air Force Acts.    The King&apos;s. approval ofany such change would have to be obtained but no legislation would benecessary. . &apos;.3*    -JLegal review the procedure of legal review has the advantage that every singleconviction by Court-Martial, no matter where it occurs or whether theProceedings have already been the subject of legal advice before confirma-tion,  is automatically reviewed in the Office of the Judge Advocate general by a professional staff of legal experts, for the purpose of ascertaining wether there is any defect in point of law invalidating the Proceedings,or any part thereof.    The discovery of airy such defect results in the prompt quashing of any conviction which, cannot legally be supported,  or,if legally permissible,  the substitution of a new or special finding by theArmy or Air Council under Section 70(1)(ee) of the Army Act or the AirForce Act, as appropriate.   Likewise if a sentence which has been con-firmed, is found for.any reason to be invalid, a valid sentence may be passed by a reviewing authority, provided that it is not higher in thescale of punishment than the punishment awarded by the invalid sentencenor in excess of it.    In our opinion legal review should be limited toa review at the time of confirmation, and to one final review in J.A.G. &apos;office , where J.A.G&apos;s Office has not already advised before confirmation,or on petition after confirmation, thus eliminating the multiplicity of reviewsby different authorities to which the Lewis Committee took exception.A..
&quot;&apos;&quot;, APPENDIX- 5 -4*     PetitionsUnder the existing system, an accused has the right to submit a petition against finding or sentence before confinflation, and thereafter to submit a similar Petition .to each of the numerous successiveauthorities, known as reviewing authorities,  who have power in propercases to mitigate, remit or commute the sentence.    These authoritiesinclude the Army or Air Council, as the case may be, and finally HisMajesty the King.   Any such Petition which raises a question of law mustin the United Kingdom be referred to the Judge Advocate General for advice.   At present there is no limit to the number of such Petitionsor to the time within which a Petition must be submitted.    The OliverCommittee recommended that the present right to continue to petition adlib. should be curtailed.5.     We consider that the accused should be limited to hiving the right .to submit one Petition against finding and/or sentence before confirmation,and one such Petition after confirmation and that the procedure fordealing with these Petitions should be as follows:-(a) Petition before confirmation.    This would lie to the confirmingauthority.   At home, if such Petition were to raise any question oflav/,  or mixed law and fact, it would be referred to the Judge advocate general&apos;s Office.   Abroad, it would be referred to the Deputy judge advocate General in the command concerned.    If no Deputy Judge advocate general was available it would be referred to the Judge advocate general!s Office.   The Judge Advocate General would not normallyadvise on confirmation except in a case where a sentence of deathhad been passed.   At home, advice on confirmation, including a petition, would normally be given by the Deputy Judge Advocate Generalof the Forces,  or by an Assistant Judge Advocate General approved bythe Judge Advocate General for the purpose.(b) Petition after confirmation.     The Petition after confirmationwould lie to the Army Council or Air Council, as the case might be,and would be sent to the War Office or Air Ministry as appropriate./if..
APPENDIXappropriate.   If such. Petition, were to raise any question of law, ormixed.-law and fact, it would be referred to the Judge Advocate general for his advice to the Army Council or Air Council thereon.    The normalroutine review in the J.A.G&apos;s Office would in this case be unnecessary.60     Appeals &quot;The powers of non-confirmation, revision of finding, substitution of finding and quashing, whether as a result of a Petition or otherwise,would together serve as a filter to eliminate faulty convictions whichmight otherwise form the subject of successful applications for leave to appeal to the Appeal Court and for this reason the retention of confirma-tion, legal review and the right to petition before and after confirmationis most important in the case of the Army and the Air Force as the volumeof their Courts-Martial is relatively much greater than that of the Navy.Appeals should follow the procedure envisaged for the Navy in thePilcher Report, but- no appeal could be heard until after the Proceedings \and leave to appeal has been granted,had been confirmed  /Thus, if the petitioner wished to appeal to the .Appeal Co*&amp;rt in the event of his Petition -(after confirmation) to areviewing- authority being rejected, he should be allowed to include a provisional application for leave to appeal with that Petition thusavoiding unnecessary delay in the case of an unsuccessful Petition.In the case of a death sentence only, where the avoidance of unnecessary delay is desirable in the interest of discipline and justice,a provisional application for leave to appeal might be allowed to accompany the Petition (if any) prior to confirmation.   Such Petitionand the application for leave to appeal should in the case of a death sentence be automatically referred to the Judge advocate General.    Inthe event of the finding and sentence of death being confirmed the judge advocate General could forthwith grant leave to appeal on the application.In all other cases the provisional application for leave to appealaccompanying the Petition (after confirmation) would automatically bereferred to the Judge Advocate General.   Throe courses would then beopen to the Judge Advocate &quot;General:-AD..
&apos; &apos;::      -&apos; APPENDIX- 5 -(i)    -he could advise&apos;the appropriate&apos;Secretary, of State (in certain cases for the&quot; information of The. ;King) to quash the conviction;or in appropriate cases to advise the substitution of a new or special finding; &apos;&apos; - .(ii)    &quot;if the application disclosed a reasonable case for appeal onlaw,  or on mixed law and fact, he would grant leave to appeal;(iii)     he could refuse leave to appeal.(See Pilcher Report, paras.  158 - 16o).The notification to a petitioner of the rejection of his Petitionwould also inform him whether his application for leave to appeal was granted or refused.In the event of course (iii) a petitioner would be entitled to applywithin a specified period to the&apos;Appeal -Court to have his application forleave to appeal determined by that Court.    In a proper case the specified period could be extended.   Quite.apart from the right of a.petitioner tomake application for leave to appeal to the Appeal Court, the Judge. .Advocate General should be empowered to./arrange, where a point of., law.-., of.novelty or exceptional difficulty arises in a- case,. whether- the subject ofa Petition or otherwise, that it should be referred to the Appeal court for its opinion.    The Court, unless they otherwise determined,, would consider such point in private.    (of. Oliver Report, para. 25; and sectionifCb) of the Criminal Appeal Act 190?).The petitioner&apos;s right of appeal would have to be subject.to theexception contemplated in para.  221 :of the Lewis Report;    i.e.. where itis essential in emergency in the Interests of discipline and security thata sentence (e.g.  of death) shall be carried out forthwith.after confirmation.(See also Napier Report,&apos; para- 6A.) .
