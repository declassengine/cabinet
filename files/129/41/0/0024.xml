(L^*^J*j j lift (Sty^JS-/       &quot;&quot;&quot;87p DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.?.(50) 174 COPY NC, 32j^STH JULY, 1950CABINETSUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH the fulfilment OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S OBLIGATIONS INPURSUANCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTERMemorandum by the Home secretary i have been considering the possibility of action being taken by persons in this country to hinder His Majesty&apos;s Government acting uponthe recommendation of the United Nations or carrying out their possibleinternational obligations arising from their membership of that organisa-tion.     The question arises now in view of the measures taken under the auspices of the United Nations to assist the people of South Korea.     Theaction to be considered in this memorandum might take the form of(i) sabotage of supplies intended to be used for His Majesty&apos;s forces orother forces co-operating with the United Nations, (ii) obstruction orhindrance of the movement of troops and supplies by the withholding of services, e. g. the refusal by dockers to load supplies in ships, or (iii)incitement to others to commit acts of sabotage or of obstruction orhindrance.2. A certain amount of propaganda, which might have the effect of inducing people to refuse to assist in providing supplies or in moving troops for Korea, has been published, particularly in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;,   but Iam not aware that it has had any effect and. there is no evidence to myknowledge that any body of persons have so far considered withholdingtheir labour.     Nevertheless, it is quite possible that attempts will bemade, as in Australia and in France, to induce bodies of work-people tointerfere with supplies, and I think that we ought to consider whetheraction should not now be taken to close some of the gaps in the existing law relating to this matter.3, During the war Defence Regulations were in force under which itwould have been possible to prevent interference with the war effort of thekind described in paragraph 1 above.     Thus, Defence Regulation 2A made it an offence carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment to do anyast likely to assist the enemy, and, though there is no recorded instance,it would have been possible to prosecute under this Regulation a person who with intent to assist the enemy obstructed or hindered or incitedothers to obstruct or hinder the movement of troops or supplies.    Again,under Defence Regulation 2B sabotage of equipment or premises used forHis Majesty&apos;s service or in the performance of essential services was an offence carrying a penalty not exceeding 14 years&apos;   imprisonment, thoughit should be noted that this Regulation specifically provided that a person should not be guilty of an offence by reason only of taking part in a strike or peacefully persuading another person to do so.     Defence Regulation 1A,

which is subject to the same proviso as to participating, or peacefully-persuading others to participate, in strikes, made it an offence to do any act having reasonable cause to believe that it would be likely to prevent or interfere with the performance of their duties by persons in His3vlajesty&apos;s service or the carrying on of their work by persons engagedin the performance of essential services;   and under Defence&apos;Regulations2C and 2D action could be taken to prevent the systematic publication ofmatter calculated to foment opposition to the successful prosecution ofthe war.     All these Regulations have been revoked,4- I am advised that the circumstances in which fighting is now proceeding in Korea do not amount to a state of war.     Emphasis isbeing laid upon the police character of the action taken under the auspices of the United Nations.5. In peace-time acts of sabotage wOuid ordinarily come within thescope of the Malicious Damage Act, and there are certain special pro-visions relating to Naval Dockyards.     But it is conceivable that certainacts of sabotage might fall outside the scope of the law or be punishableonly by a light penalty.     As regards incitement to sabotage, a person isguilty of a criminal offence who aids, abets, counsels or procures thecommission of an act that is itself a criminal offence, and if two or morepersons combine to induce another to do such an act they are guilty of a criminal conspiracy.     Accordingly, in so far as the existing law is adequate to deal with acts of sabotage it would seem to be adequate alsoto deal with incitement to sabotage.     On the other hand, obstruction orhindrance of the movement of troops or supplies, e. g. a refusal by one person or by a body of persons to load a ship or to run troop trains, wouldnot be a criminal offence, nor would it be an offence to incite persons to obstruct or hinder the movement of troops or supplies, unless it could be shown that a breach of contract was involved and that two or more personshad combined to induce the breach.6. If further provision is to be made it might take the form of a bill which would create offences of interfering with supplies intended for HisMajesty&apos;s Forces when they are engaged in active operations arising outof the international obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government or pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations.     It should be noted that in thepresent emergency His Majesty&apos;s Forces are not giving assistance inpursuance of any legal obligation, since the Security Council has not cometo any formal decision but has merely made a recommendation underArticle 3 9 of the Charter of the United Nations.     The offences might takethe form of (i) sabotage and (ii) obstruction or hindrance of, and (iii)incitement to sabotage or to obstruct or hinder, the movement of suppliesor services, with different penalties according to the class of offence.If any further powers, are to be taken I would suggest that the Bill should provide that its provisions creating offences would not come into force until brought into force by Order-in-Council for the purposes of particularoperations.     It would be necessary, in order to avoid criticism., to define the circumstances in which the Act might be used as narrowly as possible and to make it clear that it would not apply to, for example, routinesupplies to overseas stations.     I would suggest that it should apply,subject to the same restrictions, to supplies for Commonwealth and colonial forces and for foreign forces engaged in the same pursuit.

7. It is for consideration whether, if legislation of this kind wereto be introduced, it should apply to the state of affairs now existing in malaya, where His Majesty&apos;s Forces are engaged in hostilities with persons who are described as &quot;bandits&quot; but who have infiltrated from outside the Federation.     To extend the Bill in this way might add con-siderably to the difficulties of getting it through Parliament.     It mightbe wiser to confine it to the circumstances in which action is taken by&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government pursuant to the Charter of the united nations or arising out of their international obligations.     The actionof the French Communists in hindering the transport of warlike stores and troops to Indo-China should be borne in mind in considering this issue.J.C.E.Home Office, S.W.1,18TH JULY, 1950.
