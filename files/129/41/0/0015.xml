(50) 1651th July, 1950CABINETDESPATCH OF CABINET AND CABINET COMMITTEE business during THE SUMMER HOLIDAYNote by the Prime minister it is my wish that during the six weeks from 3rd August to 12th Septemberthere should be as few Ministerial meetings as possible. -Meetings of the Cabinetmay be required to deal with urgent questions arising from developments in theinternational situation; but I propose that no meetings of Standing ministerial committees should be held during this period and that the Cabinet itself shouldnot be asked to deal with any business on which decisions can be taken before theend of July or deferred until the second half of September.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to consider at once whether there are any matters on which they will have to obtain decisions from the Cabinet or from aCabinet Committee before the middle of September, and to make every effort tobring these matters forward for consideration before the end of July.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, SWA,1th July, 1950.38990
