THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1950SECRET Copy No.    32CP. (50) 1963\st August, 1950CABINETTHE UNITED NATIONS AND THE ABUSE OF THE VETOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe problem in order to enable the General Assembly of the United Nations to deal effec-tively with acts of aggression or breaches of the peace and to make recommendations(including the use of force) on occasions when the Security Council is paralysed bythe Soviet veto, the Americans have proposed putting forward at the Fifth Sessionof the General Assembly a draft resolution containing three proposals (text annexed).Alternatively, the proposals might be adopted in the form of three separate reso-resolutions.  They compromise:  A. a proposal laying down a procedure Whereby a special session Of theGeneral Assembly would be summoned at twenty-four hours&apos; notice toconsider a case of aggression or a breach of the peace and make recommendations (including if necessary recommendations involving the use of force) in the event of the Security Council being prevented bythe veto from exercising its responsibilities;B. a proposal for a standing fact-finding and observation commission of theGeneral Assembly to be set up to enable the General Assembly (or the interim Committee between sessions of the Assembly) to send observersto areas where international tension or conflict develops;C. proposals aimed at increasing the military preparedness of member states to respond to United Nations recommendations.This paper deals only with the proposals at (A) and (B) above. Those at (C) raisesomewhat wider implications which are at present being studied.2. It is generally recognised that it was only the fortunate chance of theabsence of the Soviet member which made it possible for the Security Council toact promptly to deal with aggression in Korea. It seems unlikely that the Russianswill allow this to happen again, and it is therefore important that arrangements should be made for the General Assembly to meet promptly to deal with future acts of aggression when the Security Council is paralysed and it is desirable, nevertheless,that the United Nations should make recommendations.3. The Americans believe that their proposals do not in any Way amend the charter. While proposal B, subject to certain amendments, seems to us unobjection-able, it is undeniable that proposal A, as at present drafted, does underline a shift of emphasis from the Security Council to the General Assembly and does to that extent involve a re-interpretation of certain provisions of the Charter. There are,furthermore, dangers inherent in any relaxation of the power of veto (which we ourselves hold) and in any proposal which automatically relegates questions of peace and security to a body representing fifty-nine nations in which we have only onevote. While we sympathise with the American objective we fear that their proposedmethod of obtaining it is likely to increase rather than diminish these dangers.39275 b
recommendations. It is therefore submitted that we should continue to press the americans to drop their resolution A in its present form and to work for the same objectiveby means of an amendment to the Rules of Procedure, which would be less provo-cative and also less likely to tie us in advance to a procedure which might in somecases have considerable disadvantages. In the event, however, of the Americansinsisting on their resolution, and of the likelihood that such a resolution might beadopted by the Assembly, we should, it is submitted, press them to accept amend-jments which would safeguard more fully our freedom of action.Il5. It is further submitted that we should giVe our support to proposal B,subject to certain modifications outlined in paragraph 13 below.Argument6. Proposal A. This is intended to provide for cases where the security council, because of the use of the veto, fails to exercise its responsibility for themaintenance of peace when faced with an act of aggression or a breach of thepeace. In such cases the General Assembly &quot; shall consider the questionimmediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to the members for collective action, including the use of armed force, to restore international peace and security.&quot; For this purpose provision is made for the summoning of specialemergency sessions of the General Assembly at twenty-four hours&apos; notice.7.   Our approach to this proposed resolution has been governed by two sets of considerations. On the one hand, we agree with the Americans that we cannot allow the Soviet abuse of the veto to reduce the United Nations to impotence in the face of aggression.  Although, in any future case of aggression, we would be entitledto act, if we so desired, under Article 51 of the Charter (which preserves the rightof individual and collective self-defence) if the Security Council were paralysed bya Soviet veto, it would nevertheless be far better from the point of view of world opinion to secure as large an extent of United Nations cover for our action as waspossible.  For this purpose a special emergency session of the General Assemblymight well prove extremely useful.  On the other hand, we should not lose sight of the fact that any weakening of the safeguarding power of the veto might imperilour own vital interests, since in the Assembly our voting power would be onlyone in fifty-nine and we should have no means of preventing the adoption of aresolution to which we were opposed; whereas in the Security Council, as apermanent, member, we can in the last resort block any decision which might seriously threaten our interests.   Moreover, the size of the Assembly makes it aless responsible organ than the Security Council and we could not countenanceany change which would put us automatically at the mercy of Assemblyrecommendations in every possible case where a breach of the peace was thought to exist, especially since this would be likely to involve us in increased and undefinedmilitary commitments.   There is the further point that the proposed Americanresolution as drafted undoubtedly underlines a shift of emphasis from the security council to the General Assembly which is in itself contrary to the spirit of the charter as enshrined in Article 24.  This article designates the Security council as the United Nations organ which bears primary responsibility for the maintenanceof international peace.   It would moreover be unnecessarily provocative to theRussians, who would be bound to regard it as a sinister plot to undermine their position in the United Nations.  Indeed it might precipitate their departure fromthe United Nations, and we clearly should not wish the Russians to walk out for good on an issue in which the right could not be seen to be clearly on our side.8. Briefly the United States draft resolution appears to us undesirable since it ends to ignore the second set of considerations outlined above. It runs the dangerof tying us in advance to the use of machinery which in certain cases might provean embarrassment. Moreover, the resolution, by re-stating the powers of theAssembly, makes it appear as if we were not sure of those powers. Nor does thedraft resolution get round the fact that the Security Council must first of allattempt to deal with the case of aggression and show that it has failed to do so,although with a reasonable President this need not cause too long a delay. Thereis the further danger that in certain cases (e.g., Formosa) many members of theAssembly might be unwilling to support a recommendation and might thereforeabstain with the result that the recommendation, although adopted, would be seen
to have little support.  This result, from our own point of view, might be worse than that of a Soviet veto and consequent deadlock in the Security Council.9. In any case the resolution appears to be unnecessary since its object couldbe achieved by a simple amendment to the Assembly&apos;s Rules of Procedure providingfor special sessions to be summoned urgently in an emergency. In proposingor supporting such an amendment to the Rules it would probably be desirable to define fairly narrowly the occasions on which an emergency session could be called,namely when the Security Council is prevented by the veto from dealing withaggression or a breach of the peace and therefore takes the subject off its Agenda(which can be done by a procedural i.e., non-vetoable vote) so that the Assemblycan deal with it. There is a good deal to be said for amending the Rules in this wayso as to lay down in advance a procedure which can be followed (without making it mandatory in all possible cases), provided that its practical application can be suffiently limited and that it does not take an unnecessary provocative form(which might have the further disadvantages of alienating the support of &quot; neutral &quot;members such as India).10. It is understood that the French have arrived independently at a similarconclusion.   Preliminary Canadian views seem also to correspond with our own.11. The Americans have been informed of our views on their proposedresolution. They have reiterated their view that steps to strengthen the ability ofthe United Nations to meet aggression are as much a part of the basic approach ofbuilding situations of strength as is the strengthening of Western European militarydefences. They consider that the proposals they have outlined represent theminimum steps which should now be taken. They would not wish their proposalto be buried away as an amendment to the Rules of Procedure, since this might mean that its &quot; psychological impact &quot; would be lost. They believe that the FifthSession offers a unique opportunity to capitalise the psychological effect of the korean crisis on member States. Moreover, it seems likely that, for reasons ofinternal public opinion, they are anxious that this proposal should be dressed upto look more significant than it really is. This is, indeed, the fundamental pointof disagreement between us, and we shall have to discuss it further in the nearfuture.12. Proposal B. Another fortunate aspect of the Korean affair was that therewas in Korea at the time of the invasion a United Nations Commission which was thus able to verify the fact that an act of aggression had taken place. The objectof the United States proposed draft resolution B is to set up a standing fact-findingand observation commission in order that the commission or one of its sub-com-mittees could be sent out at short notice by the General Assembly or by the InterimCommittee (when the&quot; Assembly was not in session) for the purpose of observingand reporting from any area in which international tension or international conflictdevelops. It would not, of course, be sent to any country without permission of theGovernment concerned.13. It is considered that this idea is a useful one which might be supported.This proposal does not appear to be open to the same objections as an earlierUnited States proposal for the Security Council to set up some such body whichwould then go into action either at the decision of the Security Council or, whenthe veto prevented this, at its own decision. Certain provisions in the resolution asat present drafted would, however, in our opinion, require amendment. Forexample, it would in our opinion, be a mistake to dispense with the necessity fora two-thirds majority for decisions by the Interim Committee to despatch observersto any area. To provide good United Nations cover for any action which we might wish to take in the future we should want something larger than a simple majority.Moreover, the necessity for a two-thirds majority provides a useful safeguard inthat it would make it easier for us to prevent the despatch of observers to places where we might not wish them to go. In any case, the despatch of observers bythe General Assembly involves a decision which under article 18 (2) of the Charterwould require a two-thirds majority, and it therefore seems unsuitable that the interim Committee, which is a subsidiary of the General Assembly, should not besubject to the same limitation.E B.Foreign Office, SWA,315?
