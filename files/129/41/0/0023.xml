*7li 3 jISDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S C RETC,P.(50) 173 COPY NO. 318TH JULY, 1950CABINETSUPPLIES OF NEWSPRINTMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI should like to draw the attention of my colleagues to theserious position which has arisen on newsprint.     I should point out thatnewsprint is not imported by the Government but by the Newsprint SupplyCompany acting on behalf of the newspaper industry.     The government do, however, settle the allocation of dollars for import from Canada andalso settle the level of exports.HISTORICAL2. At the beginning of this year stocks of newsprint in the hands of newspapers stood at 132,500 tons, and the newspapers were on a six-pagebasis.     We allowed an extra page for the election period, and on 27thMarch, 1950, at the request of the newspapers, who considered their stocks still too high, the Economic Policy Committee (E.P,C.(50) 10thMeeting, Minute 2) agreed to give discretion to the Newsprint RationingCommittee to continue to allow an extra page from time to time on thefollowing conditions:   that stocks of newsprint for newspapers should not beallowed to fall below 100,000 tons:   that all plans should be made on theassumption that no dollars would be available for the purchase of news-print:   and that exports of newsprint should have absolute priority overincreases in home consumption.3. Following this decision, the Newsprint Rationing Committeeannounced that the extra page would be continued until 1st July.   &quot;It was estimated at that time that this would involve running the stocks down to justabout 100,000 tons and that available supplies in the second half year would suffice only for six pages.     This forecast for the first half year worked out very closely, stocks on30th June being just over 92,000 tons, thedifference being accounted for by one shipment of 7,500 tons which had been included in the estimate but came in a few days late.4. Vieanwhile, however, the prospects for the second half year were steadily deteriorating.     We can always predict with fair accuracysome time ahead what the production of the home mills will be, but on theimport side we are largely dependent upon the estimates given to us by theNewsprint Supply Company.     Their original estimate for the second halfof 1950, excluding Canada, was 87,7 50 tons, for which they had madeeither firm contracts or reservations subject to price, but from Mayonwards there were an increasing number of cancellations which finallyreduced this figure by 25,000 tons to the present estimate of 59,750 tons.The French Government imposed a ban on export of French newsprint,and intensive American buying in Scandinavia reduced the supplies available to us from that area.

5. On 8th May, after consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, I authorised the importation of 25,000 tons from Canada   -during the second half of 1950, on the assurance of the newspaper repre-sentatives that the Canadians would be able to supply.     The NewsprintSupply Company, however, found difficulty in getting their ordersaccepted, and on 18th June they reported that they did not expect to get more than 10,000 tons unless they could enter into some commitmentcontinuing into 1951, and that even the 10,000 tons was not firm.     On29th June the Chancellor of the Exchequer authorised dollar expenditure for 37,500 tons in the first half of 1951, this being the maximum amount which could be claimed under the Canadian contracts for that period.Even so the Newsprint Supply Company have not yet succeeded in final-ising a deal with the Canadian mills, and do not know how much of this amount they will succeed in getting.6. Newspapers returned to the six page basis on 1st July and inview of the falling stock position and the uncertainty about futuresupplies, the Newsprint Rationing Committee intend to revert to a tonnagebasis of rationing on 1st August and to reduce consumption by a further10% for the rest of this year.     The effect of this will be to leave it tothe individual newspapers to decide whether to economise by reducingsize or by restricting circulation.     We estimate that on this basis, ifthey get 10,000 tons from Canada this year, they will have a stock ofapproximately 97,000 tons at 31st December.7. I propose, however, to make a similar reduction of 10% in thenewsprint used by periodicals, which will save about 3,000 tons more, sothat by the end of the year stocks should be restored to their properlevel of 100,000 tons.8. It will be clear from the foregoing that the present campaignwhich the newspapers are running is fundamentally dishonest.     the seven-page newspaper was originally introduced for the election period,and was extended for a further period because of the high level of stocks.It is therefore wrong to talk of the reversion to six pages as &quot;cuts&quot;.The serious supply position for the later part of this year, however, andthe re-introduction of tonnage rationing, do involve the papers in seriousreductions, and will limit the freedom of circulation they have had since2nd January, .1949.PROSPECTS FOR 19519. It is difficult to make a firm estimate of the position for 1951,but if we assume that in the first half year the newspapers obtain thefull amount of 37,500 tons authorised from Canada, together with thebalance of the 25,000 tons authorised but not shipped this year;   that alike amount of 37,500 tons is authorised and obtained from Canada in thesecond half year;   that imports from Europe continue at the presentreduced rate and that home production remains constant, they shouldhave in 1951 about 24,000 tons more than will be needed to maintain the six-page paper or sufficient to allow one extra page for 16 weeks.     Wecannot be certain, however, that even if the dollars are provided the full amount will be obtained from Canada, and we may be barely able tomaintain six pages.10. The basic cause of the present&apos;world-wide shortage of newsprintis the enormous increase in consumption in the United States, which has reached an all-time record level, and which, with the attraction of-Z-

dollars to be earned, has put terrific pressure not only upon Canadabut also upon all European sources of newsprint, and has producedfierce competition among all users for the limited supplies left over.HOME PRODUCTION11. Home production of newsprint is limited by machine capacity,a substantial amount of which was destroyed during the war, productionbeing reduced from about 800,000 tons to about 560,000 tons per annum.Several new plants are being put up but no substantial new output will beavailable until 1952,     Supplies of raw material are adequate this yearand, although the outlook for 1951 is more difficult, we shall probably beable to keep the newsprint mills working to full capacity, although itwill be necessary to allow some pulpwood to be imported from Newfound-land for dollars.12. 100,000 tons are being exported in 1950, out of a total productionof 560,000 tons, against ari average for the immediate pre-war years of60,000 tons out of a total of 800,000 tons.     It is this high rate of export,at a time of greatly reduced imports, against which the newspapers areinveighing.COMPARISON WITH OTHER COUNTRIES13. The position for 1951 therefore appears serious.     On the mostoptimistic assumptions about supplies - unless we postulate an Americanrecession - there will be barely enough to average a six-page paper, andif anything goes wrong, even this size may not be possible.14. I feel therefore that my colleagues should consider our long-term approach to this question, and decide what size our newspapersshould be, and - if a figure higher than six pages is considered right -what sacrifices of export, or of dollars for import, we should be preparedto make.15. The Press - and the Opposition - make much of the functions of newspapers in a democracy.     i have, I think, exposed the humbug inthis argument, without laying myself open to fair criticism that we seek to muzzle the Press through restricted newsprint supplies.     But it is-clearly right that we should consider the statistical position in relationto other countries.     As will be clear from Annex A, newspapers in thiscountry are smaller than those in any other &quot;advanced&quot; country, withthe exception of Spain, France, the Netherlands, and the Irish Republic,whose newspapers are about the same size as ours, and Italy, wherethey are smaller.     On the other hand, taking the test of newsprint con-sumption per head of population (Annex B), our figure is exceeded only by the United States, Canada, Sweden and Australia, while in number of copies of newspapers per head (Annex C), we have the highest figure ofall.FACTORS INFLUENCING FUTURE POLICY16. The difficulty of the  present position is the insecurity ofsupplies.     The newsprint trade is one in which it is customary to place orders well in advance and, indeed, often for terms of years, and thereis no doubt that the newspapers are seriously hampered in their dealings with the Canadian mills by our recent practice of authorising dollarsonly for six-monthly periods if at all.     The difficulties of forward

commitments are obvious, and it is most important to our relations with canada that we should not again put ourselves in a position of having along-term commitment on newsprint which we felt compelled to break.But if we were able to make arrangements going beyond June, 1951, itmight help to safeguard the position.     The most that we can hope for from Canada next year is 75,000 tons plus 15,000 tons of arrears from1950.     If consideration could be given now to the balance of 37,500 forthe second half year, the wisest course would probably be to try toobtain some firm indication from the mills of what they could definitelysupply, and on what terms, before actually releasing further dollars.17. There is pressure from the home newspapers for our exportsof newsprint, which now stand at 100,000 tons a year, to be reduced orstopped altogether, but there are grave difficulties about this.     So faras 1950 is concerned, we have entered into commitments with the variousCommonwealth countries to which ail our exports go, and we have issuedexport licences for nearly the full amount already.     (My colleagues willrecall that on 14th November, 194-9, I was invited to pursue the possibilityof increasing exports, particularly to Australia (CM.(49) 66th Conclusions,Minute 4). )    These supplies are normally dollar-savers to the Common-wealth, since the only alternative source of supply would be Canada,but our own experience shows that at present they could probably not bereplaced at all and the result might be the stoppage of individual news-papers which rely upon us for supplies.     Any suggestion of reduction would certainly produce a most violent reaction, particularly from australia, which now takes 7 5,000 tons, and from South Africa, whichgets only 8,000 tons this year, but is pressing us strongly for more.     i must confess I have no sympathy for the Australian newspaper proprietors,whose papers are already three times as big as ours, and who are engagedin a circulation war.     The present rate of export to them can be justified,not on grounds of &quot;fair shares&quot;, but solely on the ground of our balanceof payments position with Australia.     For if we were to reduce exportsto the figure sufficient to guarantee a seven-page paper in 1951 (allowingsmall additional supplies for the Festival of Britain, special Festivalsupplements etc.) the figure would be reduced from 100,000 to 20,000,involving us in a loss of about  3,200,000 on our balance of payments with Commonwealth countries;     Moreover, practically all our exports are on long-term contracts, concluded this year, for terms of three, five,or in most cases eight years, to which the home mills attach greatimportance as an insurance against times of depression, and it is possiblethat if these contracts are lost the long-term result might be short time or even unemployment in the paper trade.     We should certainly lose the co-operation and support of the mills, which have been most helpful to us during and since the war, and we should probably find them devotingtheir marginal production capacity to mechanical printing paper insteadof newsprint.18. We have not yet entered into any Governmental commitments on exports in 1951, but I feel that it would be difficult to reduce thepresent figure.     Indeed, both South Africa and Australia are pressingus to go above it.     South Africa is pressing us very hard, and has suggested that we agree to process for her some 16,000 tons, using raw,material for which she will provide dollars.     This is certainly tech-nically possible, for there is a small amount of new capacity cominginto production.     Ah increase therefore from 100,000 to 11 6,000. wouldnot, on present estimates, lead to a reduction in the size of newspapersin this country :   it would, however, involve a decision in advance that

0 90 othe small increase in capacity which is expected will not be passed onto the home newspapers in increased size.     My own view is that weshould not do this, but should fix an export programme of 100,009 tons,the precise allocation between countries, taking into, account strongAustralian, South African - and Colonial - pressure, to be settled by theCommonwealth Economic Affairs Committee, subject to approval by minister s.19. When a little more newsprint is available, it may be that thefirst step which we should take should be to release local weekly papersfrom all control rather than to increase the size of the national dailies.The local weeklies are probably the hardest hit by the present cuts.They use only 10% of total consumption.     Releasing them completelywould probably not cost more than Z0,OC0 tons a year over and abovethe six-page basis (i. e. an average of an eight-page basis;   50% of themdid not use the seven-page basis when it was open to them).     Thenational dailies are naturally anxious to keep them under control prorata with themselves because thereby the volume of complaint against any cut is immensely widened.     There is also some evidence of publicinterest in the size of local papers but little or none in the size ofnational dailies.ZO. From reports received we do not think that the newspapercampaign for larger papers is attracting much public attention in thiscountry.     It is fortunate that it came after, and not before, the increase to seven pages showed the public what the newspapers would do with morenewsprint.     But it may be doing some damage in the United States, wherethere is considerable criticism of our &quot;censorship&quot;.     In fact it would notbe difficult to show that if the United States newspapers themselvesshowed a little more restraint, and refrained from monopolising all available supplies from Scandinavia and Canada, our problems would be solved.     We propose to brief the British Information Service speciallyon this point.21. I recommend to my colleagues that we should:-(i)      Attempt to secure Canadian supplies by committing ourselvesnow to enough dollars (about 3^ millions) to purchase37,500 tons in the second half of 1951 - making 75,000 tonsin the year;(ii)      fix the export programme at 100,000 tons for .1951, the allocationbetween countries to be the subject of recommendations by theCommonwealth Economic Affairs Committee;(iii)      agree to the purchase of 20,000 fathoms of pulp wood from newfoundland at an approximate cost of rather less than$1 million (Canadian) to keep our home mills in full production;(iv)     make clear to the newspaper industry, and if necessary, in public,that it is the view of the Government that whatever cut may benecessary in the immediate future should not fall on the weeklyprovincial oapers, and that as soon as supplies improve abovethe level necessary to secure the maintenance of the six-pagenational paper, de-control of local weeklies should have prefer-ence over an increase in the size of the dailies to seven pages.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W.1,1. oTH JULY, 1950.-5-
