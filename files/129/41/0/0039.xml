July, 1950cabinetCOUNCIL OF EUROPE-CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS: RIGHTOF INDIVIDUAL PETITIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies recognise the weight of the political arguments for acceptance of the draftCouncil of Europe Convention of Human Rights to which the Minister of Staterefers in CP. (50) 179; and, from the Colonial point of view, the substantive pro-visions of the Convention are acceptable.2. The proposal, however, to establish a right of petition by individuals and groups to the Commission of Human Rights (Article 23) has such serious implications-tions for Colonial Governments (briefly referred to in paragraph 4 (3) of CP. (50)179) that I must ask my colleagues to take them carefully into account in considering this matter.3. The introduction of such a system of appeal to an international authority is likely to cause considerable misunderstanding and political unsettlement in manyColonial territories. The bulk of the peoples in most Colonies are still politicallyimmature and the essence of good government among such people is to establishrespect for one single, undivided authority which they are taught to recognise as responsible for their affairs. The right of petition to an international body wouldobscure this principle and would suggest to Colonial peoples either that the iltimate authority in the affairs of their territory is not the Crown or that there is more thanone ultimate authority. This confusion would undoubtedly be exploited byextremist politicians in the Colonies in order to undermine the authority of theColonial Government concerned. Loyalty would be shaken: administration wouldbe made more difficult and agitation more easy. Indeed individual petitions might become as much a weapon of political warfare as a method of ventilating thegenuine grievances of individuals. Even although it may be assumed that suchpetitions would in most cases be rejected by the Commission of Human Rights asinadmissible, they would nevertheless in the meantime have achieved their primary purpose by serving as local propaganda against the Colonial Government. It isimportant that no such unnecessary handle should be offered to trouble-makerswithin or without Colonial territories in the present delicate stage of constitutional development in some (such as the West African Colonies), or in the incipientdifficulties of race relations in others, or in more serious situations such as thestruggle against terrorists in Malaya.4. It is true that the proposed &quot; Colonial application article &quot; (Article 60)in the Convention would make it optional to extend the Convention to colonial territories. There would, however, be insuperable political objections to a generalexclusion of Colonial territories from the Convention simply because it contained the right of petition. On the other hand, some of the most important colonial governments might well be reluctant to accept the Convention so long as it didcontain the right of petition and, in view of their constitutional position, it would
be contrary to settled practice to compel them to do so. Yet failure to extend theConvention to the whole ^Colonial Empire would undoubtedly be made a subjectof hostile propaganda and criticism.5. Deletion of the provision for individual petition would remove any seriousobstacle to extension of the Convention to all Colonial territories. From theCoIbriiM1 point of view, therefore, it is very desirable that (should it beiifeCiide^to accede to the Convention) efforts to secure omission of this pro vision^ (in ^pord-5ance with the recommendation in paragr aph 12 (2) of CP. (50) 179) &quot;should; be&apos;pressed as far as possible. u&quot;r&apos;i-  *V&apos;&apos; ftmJ.G.Colonial Office, S.W.I.,28th July, 1950
