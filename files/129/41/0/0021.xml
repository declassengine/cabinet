THIS DOCUMENT  IS   THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJES&apos;TY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (50) 171\7th July, 1950CABINETEMPLOYMENT OF NATIVE BORN ADMINISTRATORS IN THE higher grades OF COLONIAL CIVIL services memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies at the Cabinefs meeting on 11th May (Con. (50) 30th Conclusions, Minute6), I was invited to submit a memorandum indicating what steps were being takento introduce an adequate proportion of native-born administrators into the higher grades of the Colonial Civil Service, particularly in African and other colonies whichare progressing towards self-government.general it has long been recognised that self-government in the Colonial territorieswill not be a reality until the administrative and executive machinery of govern-ment is operated by the people of the country. Most of the junior ranks of theColonial civil services are already filled by locally born officers. Progress in increasing local appointments to the higher grades&apos; has inevitably varied in differentterritories. The desirability of such appointments is taken for granted. The limiting factor is the supply of suitably qualified local candidates who can take over thework without undue sacrifice of efficiency. The best way of attacking the problem,therefore, is to increase the sources of supply.2. During the post-war years, particularly in West Africa, Malaya and theWest Indies, there has been great progress in the provision of higher and technical education facilities, and further important developments in those territories aretaking place.3. In all Colonial territories there are scholarship schemes to enable studentsto train for posts of higher responsibility in Government Service. In addition  1 million has been allocated under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945for similar scholarships. For the most part scholarships are tenable in the UnitedKingdom, but when possible scholars are placed at Universities or other institutions of higher education in the Colonial territories. Scholarships are granted to candidates already in Government service as well as to applicants straight fromthe schools. In awarding these scholarships care is taken to use them so as toencourage Colonial people to qualify themselves in branches of knowledge whichwill be of practical value in the economic and cultural progress of their commu-nities. At present there are 1,713 Colonial students at Universities and 2,480 atnon-university institutions in the United Kingdom; of these 1,500 are colonial government or Colonial Development and Welfare Scholars; the rest are privatestudents, many of whom will take up higher grade Government posts. Details ofthose students holding Colonial Scholarships are given in Appendix A.There are also special schemes for Colonial Service training (details are givenin Appendix B) some of which are designed to enable members of the public services to qualify for higher appointments. A separate allocation of  1  million has beenmade for this purpose under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act.4. In the following paragraphs details are given of the steps being taken tointroduce native-born officers into the higher ranks of the Colonial Service in allthe African territories and those other Colonial territories which are moving towards self-government. Throughout this memorandum reference to &quot; officers39039 b
in the higher ranks of the Colonial Service &quot; includes both administrative officersin the strict sense and those holding professional and technical posts, such asaccountants and auditors, agricultural and forestry officers, customs officers,education officers, electrical, civil, mechanical, marine and mining enginers, labourofficers, legal and judicial officers, surveyors and medical and veterinary officers.West Africa5. There has been a rapid increase in the last three years in the number ofappointments of Africans to the higher ranks in the West African Colonies, andthis rate of increase is being steadily accelerated. In Nigeria there are at present364 (as against 26 in 1938 and 172 in 1948) Africans in the higher ranks as com-pared with some 1,800 expatriates; in the Gold Coast the corresponding figures are276 (as against 17 in 1928, 31 in 1938 and 98 in 1948) and 1,100; in Sierra Leonethe figures in 1949 were 54 and 417. It will, however, be some time before thereare enough qualified Africans to fill a majority of the higher posts in any of theWest African Colonies.6. Since 1948 the reports of local Committees or Commissions on theAfricanisation of the higher civil service in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and Sierra Leonehave been accepted by the Governments concerned. It is now officially recognisedthat expatriate candidates should only be recruited for Government posts when nosuitable and qualified African is available, and that the policy of Africanisationshould be pursued as rapidly as is consistent with the maintenance of presentstandards of efficiency.7. In Nigeria, Public Service Boards with a majority of unofficial members were set up in 1949 with the object of selecting candidates for higher civil serviceposts and for scholarship and training schemes. Departmental selection boards have also been established to recommend junior officers for training and for pro-motion to the higher ranks. An Assistant Civil Service Commissioner for Nigeriais posted in London; he is specially concerned with the recruitment into the civilservice of Nigerians who are undergoing training in the United Kingdom. Up toFebruary, 1950, 243 scholarships or training awards had been made and provisionof  250,000 for the three year period 1948-1951 has been made to meet the costof scholarships and training for higher posts.8. The progress of Africanisation of the Government Service of the gold coast was reviewed in 1949 by a Select Committee with a majority of african members, and recommendations for further Africanisation were made. these recommendations included the appointment of an African Commissioner forAfricanisation whose duties would include the co-ordination of recruitment andscholarship policy. The further recommendation for the appointment of aCommission of Enquiry into the organisation of the whole Gold Coast service isnow being implemented. In the Gold Coast 626 Government scholarship awardshave been made since 1947.9. In Sierra Leone, the Africanisation Committee recommend, as a short-term policy, the employment of suitable Africans from the junior grades in higher posts.The Committee&apos;s main recommendation was however concerned with measures fortraining suitable candidates by means of scholarship schemes. Ninety Governmentscholarships for overseas higher education courses have already been grantedsince 1947.10. Facilities for higher education at University level have been devolped in Nigeria and the Gold Coast since the end of the war and in 1948 a university college was established in each territory. The University College at Ibadan in nigeria now has Faculties of Arts, Science, Medicine arid Veterinary Science, aridthere are at present 295 students. The University College of the Gold Coast hasdepartments of theology, philosophy, geology and economics and there are over100 students. It is being developed as rapidly as possible, on the recommendationof the Africanisation Committee, to produce the highest possible number of graduates for the Africanisation programme. Faculties of Agriculture will be opened in both Colleges in October 1950 and in the course of the next few yearseach of the Colleges will provide facilities for degree course, training for about600 students. The two Colleges expect eventually; to accommodate .2,000-3,000students each. -        ------      ?ssiK    -.:r as/iv, 000,&apos;:&apos;..     v       ... . ,.
11. Colleges of Arts, Science and Technology for higher technical educationare also to be established shortly in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. They will provide,inter alia, courses in engineering, building and surveying, accountancy, telecommunications-munications, agriculture, forestry, veterinary science, and secretarial and commercialpractice. Within a few years, there will.be about 600 students in the NigerianCollege and 300 (eventually there will be 2,000) in the Gold Coast College. the students will come not only from the schools but also from the public services, andthe colleges will take over much of the training now carried out by. GovernmentDepartments. In Sierra Leone, Fourah Bay College is being reconstituted. It willcontinue to provide certain degree courses and in addition will establish training facilities similar to those proposed for the Nigerian and Gold Coast Colleges.There are at present over 200 students; eventually there will be 1,200.12. It is the University Colleges and the new Colleges of Arts, Science and technology which will in the future supply a large proportion of qualified candi-dates for appointment to the higher ranks in the West African Colonies.Other African Territories13. With one exception in Tanganyika, there are no African officers holdinghigher administrative, professional or technical posts in any of the African terri-tories outside West Africa. There are, however, a number of Africans carryingout important executive functions in all the East African territories, though theydo not occupy posts which would otherwise be filled by Europeans. In Nyasaland,Northern Rhodesia and Somaliland, the policy of the local governments is first toeducate Africans to fill the more responsible clerical posts. In the SomalilandProtectorate a number of Somalis have been appointed to the junior grades andthe policy for the immediate future is to provide training to fit them for appoint-ment to the middle grades, e.g., a few Somalis have recently been appointed asAdministrative Assistants. -14. These East and Central African territories were in an exceedinglyprimitive state when they first came under British rule some fifty years ago, and.the provision of adequate educational facilities has been and remains an enormousproblem. It is, therefore, not surprising that there are no Africans in the higherGovernments posts. More primary schools and some secondary and vocationalschools are however now being built. At Makerere College, courses of University&quot; intermediate &quot; standard, open to students from all East African territories, areavailable in Arts, Science, Education, Medicine, Agriculture and VeterinaryScience; certain courses for London University degrees are also now available.All the Colonial Governments grant scholarships for higher education to qualifiedstudents; these scholarships are for the most part tenable in University institutions in the United Kingdom. Many of the successful students may be expected to qualify for higher posts in Government Service. It will, however, be many years before appreciable numbers of qualified Africans with the necessary standards ofintegrity&quot; and the sense of responsible public service will be ready to hold seniorGovernment appointments.West Indies - ..  ,15. About 50 per cent, of the higher posts in the administrative services inthe West Indies are held by West Indian-born officers (in Barbados, the percentageis as much as 60). A very large number of medical, legal and technical posts arealso held by West Indians. Expatriate officers are only appointed when.WestIndians of suitable quality are not available. .16. The policy of appointing West Indian officers in the higher grades is well established and increasing numbers are being appointed.       : ^.;;   ;h 17.

Singapore and Malaya19. The latest figures available show that, in the highest division in theFederation of Malaya Government Service, there were 181 substantive and actingposts filled by local officers, representing approximately 15 per cent, of the estab-lishment. The corresponding figures in the Singapore Government Service were102 and 23 per cent. In addition, the Malayan Civil Service, which is confined to high-grade administrative officers occupying the more senior appointments in bothterritories, had 30 Malays representing approximately 12 per cent, of the total membership.20. In Singapore a Public Service Commission has now been established toadvise on training, recruitment and promotion of local candidates, and it is the declared ultimate aim of Government policy to fill all senior posts by local appoint-ments. In the Federation a Select Committee of Enquiry has been set up toexamine the structure of the Public Service. The appointment of Malays is being encouraged by the promotion of suitable officers, by direct recruitment and byscholarship schemes although progress has been delayed in part by the reluctance of the Malay Rulers to consider the admission of non-Malays (e.g., Malayan-bornChinese) to senior posts.21. In 1949, the University of Malaya was formally constituted. TheUniversity has faculties in Arts, Science and Medicine (including Dentistry). Thereare at present approximately 650 students, and it is hoped that the University will eventually provide higher education for 1,000 students.22. Facilities for higher technical education in Malaya are provided at theTechnical College, Kuala Lumpur. This College provides three-year courses ofstudy in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering, andin Surveying. At present there are approximately 200 students attending the college, but when new buildings, now in course of erection, are completed, it ishoped to provide courses for up to 700 students.Hong Kong,23, In Hong Kong there are 395 higher civil service posts, of which 51 areat present held by local officers, mostly in the educational, medical, nursing andother professional services. There is one local-born member of the AdministrativeService.24. In correspondence, concerning a Bill to authorise the appointment of aPublic Services Commission the Governor expressed the opinion that for someyears to come the majority of Hong Kong vacancies in the higher posts would have-to be filled from the United Kingdom; he emphasised in particular the difficultyof finding good local material for the Administrative Service and the Police.25. The University of Hong Kong, which was opened in 1912 and which hasfaculties of Medicine, Engineering, Arts and Science, had an enrolment of 638students for the year 1949-50. It is hoped to expand the capacity of the Universityshortly and also to increase the number of subjects provided for. Courses in building and wireless telegraphy and engineering are provided by the TechnicalCollege.Other Territories26. (a) Cyprus. In Cyprus most of the junior posts and a third of the middlegrade posts (e.g., District Judge, District Medical Officer, District Commissioner,&amp;c.) are filled by local-born officers. In the higher posts there are six local-bornofficers (all in legal and judicial posts) and 34 expatriates.27. There has been little recent progress towards increasing the number oflocal-born officers, but the Governor is about to recommend a reduction in thetotal number of expatriates.28. In the ten-year period 1946-1956, 150 scholarships will be granted forcandidates who will fill Government posts on the successful completion of their training. All but fourteen of those so far awarded are tenable in the UnitedKingdom. A number of scholars have already been appointed to posts in theGovernment service, but the majority will not qualify until later in the period.
29. (b) Mauritius and Seychelles. Local officers have already largelyreplaced expatriates, and now occupy 75 per cent, and 40 per cent, respectively ofthe senior appointments in these two territories. No further rapid development is to be looked for in this direction, though there will be a gradual increase in theseproportions as technically qualified officers gain, further administrative experience.Scholarships for higher and technical education overseas are provided from localrevenues and from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.30. (c) Fiji. In Fiji there is one native-born head of a government depart-ment; there are also two Fijian Administrative Officers and seven other native-bornofficers who hold higher rank posts.31. In Fiji and the Western Pacific High Commission territories, approvedC. D. and W. schemes providing scholarships for secondary and university educa-tion will increase the numbers of locally-born persons who will in future be qualified for higher appointments.Conclusion32. From this survey it will be gathered that progress is being made all along the line in encouraging the flow of Colonial people into their own civil services.The key to the problem is education, not merely at the higher level but at all levels.The developments in the Colonial educational services during the last twenty-fiveyears are now beginning to bear fruit, and the supply of suitably qualified Colonialsfor the higher posts will greatly increase as time goes on. But there is also a con-tinuous increase in the demands of the territories for higher staff as the activitiesof government broaden out in proportion to the social and political progress of theColonial communities. In the Colonial field as a whole, therefore, we shall for very many years to come need considerable numbers of qualified men and women from britain and other parts of the Commonwealth.J.

APPENDIX BSchemes for Colonial Service training. Reference is made in paragraph 3 of the paper to the  1 million C.D.W.scholarship scheme (1946-56), open, to candidates from all the Colonial territories,under which scholarships for higher education are being granted to potential officersof the higher grades of the Colonial Service; and to the  1^ million scheme, alsofinanced from C.D.W. funds, for training members of the Colonial Service. Detailsof these are given in paragraphs 2 and 3 respectively, below.2. Scholarships for Potential Colonial Servants. These scholarships are inaddition to those provided by Colonial Governments. They cover subjects suchas Agriculture, Arts, Medicine, Engineering, Law, Science, Veterinary Science,Surveying and Administration. Details are given below of such scholarships inrespect of the territories mentioned in the memorandum:  	1947	1948	1949	TotalGold Coast	1	5	14	20Nigeria      .......	14	11	14	39Sierra Leone       ....	5	2	3	10Tanganyika	5	6	5	16Kenya       .......	3	5	3	11British Somaliland	2	7	...	9Nyasaland	1	7		&apos;   8Northern Rhodesia	2	5	4	11Uganda     .......	3	8	4	35Malaya      .......	7	7	11	- : 25Singapore.......	2   &apos;	4	2	8Hong Kong	6	4	4	34West Indies	10	20	16	463. Training of Officers in the Colonial Service. In the training schemes for members of the Colonial Service financed from C.D.W. funds, special provision is made to enable members of the public services of the Colonial territories to qualify for higher appointments, while the Special Course for Colonial Adrninistra-tive Service Cadets is open to those selected in the Colonies themselves for appoint-ment to this Service. The following table shows the numbers, small as yet, whohave attended the Administrative Cadet Course since its inception in 1946:  1946-47 1947-48 1948-49 1949-50 1950-51Fiji        ............ 2 ...

Special arrangements have been made to modify the courses to suit the needs of men and women from colonial territories so that they can benefit most from them and from their stay in this country.4. Officers of the Colonial Service with between 2\ and 10 years&apos; service are brought to this country for a two- or three-term course (study leave) at Oxford,Cambridge or London University. Locally-appointed officers join in these coursesside by side with their colleagues from this country.Locally-domiciled Officers attending the &quot; Second &quot; Colonial Service Course1948 1949 1950Gold Coast ......... 1 1 2Nigeria      ............ 2 2 5Zanzibar    ............ ... ... 2Malaya      ...      ...      ...      ... 2 2 6West Indies ......... 4 7 9Seychelles............ ... 2
5. In addition to the &quot; Second &quot; Colonial Service Course several other courses of instruction providing professional training for serving officers in various branches of the service have been arranged during the past eighteen months. these courses are also open to locally-domiciled officers, who are being nominated in increasing numbers. The main courses of this kind and the numbers of locally-domiciled officers who have attended and are now attending are shown in thefollowing summary:  1949 1950 (to date)Labour Officers Course............ 16 10Survey       .................. 3 6Police College      ............... 2 9Police Training for Gazetted Rank (started 1950) ... 12Police Attachments and Specialised Courses   ... 11 14Civil Aviation     ............... 3 6Nursing     ..................Income Tax        ............... 1 3Prison Officers Course (started 1950)......... 3Customs    .................. 8 11Trades Union      ............... 2 totals............... 46 796. On these particular courses locally-domiciled officers now represent very nearly one-third of the total number of attendances. The large majority of these officers come from West Africa, the West Indies and the Federation of Malaya.Most of these courses are assisted from the  1^ million Colonial Development and welfare allocation referred to in paragraph 3 of this Appendix.
