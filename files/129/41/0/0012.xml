7r 936D[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 162 COPY NO, \ 111TH JULY, 1950CABINETREPORT OF THE LIDBURY COMMITTEE ONINVOLUNTARY ABSENTEEISMNote by the Minister of Fuel and power in C.P.(49) 122 of 31st May, 1949, my predecessor drew attentionto the increase in involuntary absenteeism in the mines since the introduc-tion of the National Insurance and Colliery Workers Supplementary schemes in the middle of 1948;   and in August, 1949, the Prime Minister appointed the Lidbury Committee to inquire into the causes of this increase and tosubmit recommendations.2. The report of the Committee, which has been circulated with c.P.(50) 161, reaches the conclusion that the increase in involuntary absenteeism is mainly explained by an increase in absence throughindustrial injury, which, from an average level of 1. 8 per cent of possibleshifts in the first half of 1948, rose steeply in the latter part of that yearand reached an average level of 3. 1 per cent in 1949.     Standards of safety in the mines have been improving, and the Committee associate theincrease, at least in part, with the increase in benefits and the changedmethod of certification of incapacity under the National Insurance(Industrial Injuries) Scheme and the Colliery Workers supplementary scheme.     They take the view that, although a small proportion of theabsenteeism now recorded as due to injuries is unjustified, most of it isperfectly genuine.     Some of the increase is in absence wnich, under theold Workmen&apos;s Compensation System, the lower paid workmen (although they were not fully recovered from their injuries) were unable to afford.I agree with this analysis of the situation.3. The Committee submit a number of conclusions and recommenda-tions designed to reduce the present level of involuntary absenteeism.     Ihave considered these in consultation with the National Coal Board andregard them as constituting a useful and constructive approach to theproblem.     My comments on the individual suggestions made are asfollows (the references being to the summary of conclusions in paragraph36 of the reports-Arrangements to reduce lax certification (sub-paragraphs (vii) and (viii))4. In the old days it was the employer who had to pay compensationfor injury due to accident, and the employer, therefore, effectively&quot;policed&quot; the service.     It is now the State that has to pay, and it is primarily for the State to see that the service is not abused.     As thereport shows, the Ministry of National Insurance and tne Ministry ofHealth are now making arrangements to reduce lax certification;   these arrangements appear to me to be both desirable and appropriate.

The National Coal Board will be glad to co-operate in the arrange-merits proposed,and will notify the Ministry of National Insurance of the names of collieries or mining areas where large increases in absenteeismdue to sickness or injury are being recorded.Supply of medical certificates to the collieries and verification of accidents (sub-paragraph (ix))5. The Board have been trying for the last year to get the NationalUnion of Mineworkers to agree to a scheme which provides (inter alia)that, where men are absent from work for three days or longer throughsickness or injury, they shall furnish to the colliery office either theNational Health Medical Certificate (which will then be passed on to theappropriate office) or an ordinary medical certificate.     I am ready to givewhat help I can in getting the National Union of Mineworkers to accept this scheme - although this is not a matter in which I could or shouldformally intervene.6, With regard to the second suggestion in this sub-paragraph thatthe Coal Board should take further steps to verify in each case that analleged accident has actually occurred, the Divisional Insurance managers of the Board have already been instructed to put suitable endorsements onMinistry of National Insurance forms where no accident has been reported.The Board see difficulty in doing more than this, since some accidents areof a kind that cannot readily be corroborated by physical evidence (where,for example, the man says that he slipped and strained his back).     If,however, the number of such accidents is enough to arouse suspicion, theMinistry of National Insurance Offices will be notified.Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Scheme (sub-paragraph (x))7. I agree that it would be entirely premature to consider any changein this scheme.     As the Committee state, most of the absence on accountof injury today is perfectly genuine, and the increase in this kind of absencelargely reflects the harshness of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation system,under which there is no doubt that the men often neglected minor injuriesor returned to work before they were really fit.     To reduce the extrabenefits given under this scheme would, in my view, on the evidenceprovided by the Committee, be quite unjustified.     This is an industrywhere the natural hazards to life and limb are such that there areliterally thousands of accidents every week and the great majority of the reported injuries are unfortunately only too genuine.     Moreover, it mustnot be overlooked that, at a time when wastage of man-power from theindustry is high, any action that would create a sense of grievance mightaccelerate the rate of wastage or lead to industrial disputes, which could have a most serious effect on output.     This is of special importance at thepresent time;   in most parts of the coalfields there is some unrest, as theresult of the recent decision by the Board to reject the Union&apos;s claim for higher wages for the lower paid workers.Morale in the industry (sub-paragraph (xi))S. The Committee say that the morale of the mining community is hardly less important in the field of involuntary than in that of voluntaryabsenteeism, and they recommend tiiat every effort should be made toimprove it, particularly at pits with poor attendance records.

9. I agree, of course, with this;   it is indeed a matter with which theBoard and I are constantly concernedi    My colleagues will be glad to note that during the last eight weeks voluntary absenteeism has averaged 4. 65per cent compared with 4. 88 in the same weess of 1949.     involuntary absenteeism has also shown an improvement during these weeks, thefigures for 1950 being 6. 56 per cent compared with 6. 67 per cent in thesame weexs of 1949.10. Total absenteeism is at present a little over 11 per cent.     Itshould not be assumed that this figure is a sign of low morale.     Of thetotal, about 6j per cent is involuntary and the balance of about 4j isvoluntary, which for a job like coal mining is a low figure.     If each minertook only one day off a month from work, it would account for nearly thewhole of A.\ per cent.     Many of the very best and most devoted miners,the most loyal supporters of the Party and the most public-spiritedpeople, do take one day a month off without feeling they are doing anythingwrong.     And why, on a ;ob like this, should they?    Moreover, a large part of this 4^ per cent can be accounted for by the fact that the minersonly get one week&apos;s holiday with pay, but in fact take an extra week attheir own expense.     Could we really and wholeheartedly condemn this practice ?11. As for the involuntary absenteeism, absence on ground of sicknessis no higher than in other industries;   and the Lidbury Committee showthat, of the absence on account of injury, only about a tenth or 0, 3 per cent of the number of possible shifts is not covered by medical certificates.12. It may still be thought that the present figure of a little over11 per cent compares very unfavourably with the 7 per cent absenteeismrecorded before the war.     (This is the comparable figure after allowing for the change in basis of the statistics in 1943. )    The first answer isthat absence due to injury has doubled since 193 8;   before the war, owingto the harsh system of the old Workmen&apos;s Compensation Scheme with itslow benefit rates and strict control exercised by the colliery doctor, andto low wages and short-time wording through lack of trade and fear ofunemployment, men who had been injured - or, indeed, sick - went back towork before they were really well.     These factors are quite enough toexplain the difference in the absenteeism percentage.13. But the difference in conditions can also be illustrated arithmetic-ally.     In 1938 the average number of shifts worked per week was 4. 96 (or if allowance is made for the change in basis in 1943, 4. 84);   the corres-ponding figure for 1949 was 4. 67.14, From the point of view of the overall utilisation of the man-powerattached to the industry it can be worked out that in 1938 approximately4. 3 shifts per week were worked per ins\required  person attached to theindustry (including the employed and unemployed).     For the comparableclasses of insured persons in 1949 (that is allowing for changes in thescope of the unemployment schemes), it may be estimated that 4. 5 shiftswere worked per week,15. The difference between the situation then and now is that beforethe war, absence was forced upon the men&apos;by unemployment and short-term working due to lack of trade.     When work was available, the economic pressure of low wages, the fear of unemployment and the harsh operationof the injury compensation scheme forced them to accept it if they possibly

could, and kept the absenteeism percentage low.     Today, the number of possible shifts has been reduced by the five-day week agreement.     Asa result of full employment and higher wages, the men attached to theindustry are nearly all employed and any absence from work is eithervoluntary or is accounted for by sickness or injury.     The overallutilisation of the man-power attached to the industry is greater today,and the difference in human happiness between the two methods ofworking is immense.16. This does not mean, of course, that further efforts to improveattendance are not needed.     I feel sure that the measures now in hand for tightening up lax certification and for supplying medical certificatesto the collieries will go a long way in this direction.     The supplying of certificates, in particular, would enable the management to display amuch keener and more constant concern with attendance than is possible at present.Circulation of the report17. Since&apos;the recommendations made in it are essentially of an administrative character, I suggest that it is not necessary to publish the report.     Subject to the concurrence of my colleagues, I would,however, propose to allow copies to be circulated to the DivisionalBoards and also to the-National and Divisional Consultative Councils.P.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,11TH JULY, 1950.
