IHIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTANNEXExtract from &quot; Questions of Procedure for Ministers &quot; annexed to cp. (49) 95Ministerial Speeches&quot; 39. When addressing meetings Ministers must keep within the ambit ofGovernment policy and not anticipate decisions not yet made public. They mustbe careful in dealing with matters within the responsibility of other Ministers notto embarrass them by statements at variance with Ministerial pronouncements. Inall cases of doubt they should consult the Minister concerned.40. The Foreign Office should invariably be consulted before any mentionis made of matters affecting our relations with foreign Powers or foreign affairs;and Ministers wishing to make reference to broad matters of defence policy should in all cases first consult the Minister of Defence. Ministers should-also be speciallycareful in referring to matters affecting our relations with self-governing Common-wealth countries, or to the political aspects of Colonial affairs, e.g., self-governmentin certain Colonies, and should consult the Commonwealth Relations Office orColonial Office respectively, except where the matter falls within their own responsibility.41. In the present international situation care is needed as to what is said by ministers in conversations at social functions at Embassies. If matters of foreignpolicy are discussed at such functions, a note should be made afterwards of the salient points of the conversation and a copy sent to the Foreign Secretary.&quot;
