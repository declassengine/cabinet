I1*1 oDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 18322ND JULY, 1950CABINETOVERSEAS OPERATIONS (SECURITY OF FORCES) bill memorandum by the Home secretary in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision on 20th July(C.M.(50) 48th Conclusions, Minute 2) I have, in consultation with theEnglish and Scottish Law Officers, had prepared the attached draft bill which, inter alia, ma;es it an offence for any person to interfere with supplies destined for use by units of His Majesty&apos;s Forces engaged inactive operations at times when the country was not technically in astate of war.^ copy NO.   O 6*2. The scope of the Bill is narrower than would be required in a situation in which this country was involved in war.3. The Bill proceeds on the assumption that its provisions should remain on the Statute Book for use when required but that its operativepart should come into force only when His Majesty so directs by Orderin Council;   and clause 1 provides that an Order in Council ma^) be madeat any time when it appears to His Majesty that any of His Majest/&apos;forces or any forces of a Power associated with His Majesty are, or may /^shortlvy be, engaged in operations outside the United kingdom which involve the use of force,     The associated Powers will be thosespecified in the Order in Council bringing the Act into operation andthe Order in Council will be conclusive so far as the Courts are concerned,though of course it would be open to Parliament to discuss the conduit ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in advising the King to make such an Order inCouncil or any subsequent Order made under clause 1.4. We have considered that the main mischiefs to be providedagainst are: -(a) interference with military operations conducted overseas byHis Majesty or associated lowers or the rendering ofassistance to persons engaged in resisting by force such operations; (We think it important on political grounds toavoid any criticism on the ground that the Act&apos;might beused, for examole, in the case of military operations inthe United Kingdom and particularly in Northern Ireland.)(b) interference with the movement of troops or the provisionof supplies and services for the Forces;(c) sabotage of vehicles, equipment, etc.  required for theForces;

1 7Q(d) offences which consist of omissions to perform a duty withthe intents specified in clause 2;(e) incitement to corrimit any of these mischiefs.These mischiefs are dealt with in clauses 2 and 5 of the Bill, and wethink that these provisions are necessary to supplement the Acts relatingto malicious damage and to fill in gaps of the existing law.5. We think it is desirable to call the special attention of our colleagues to the following matters which raise questions of policy andprinciple:-(a)     Strikes.    The Bill exempts from the provisions of clause 2persons who merely take part in a lawful strike arising outof a trade dispute between employers and workmen.     Normallya trade dispute would include a dispute between workmen and workmen, but we consider it desirable in view of our past experience of lightning unofficial strikes in the docks and elsewhere so to limit the exemption.No exemption is provided for incitement to strikewhether or not any strike which may ensue is lawful, andincitement to strike will be a punishable offence per se ifdone with an/ of the intents specified in clause 2.(d)     Propaganda.    The Bill includes a clause (clause 3) whichpenalises subversive or misleading pronaganda.     In framingsuch a clause an attempt has been made to distinguish betweenlegitimate criticism of policy and the s/stematic publicationof false and misleading propaganda with a View to influencingpublic opinion in a manner likely to be prejudicial to the carrying out of the military operations overseas.     the proviso to the clause expressly excludes matter which thepublisher has published bona fide in the belief that he was engaged in legitimate criticism on a matter of publicinterest, and did not  now, or had no reasonable ground for believing, that the matter published was false or misleading.In practice it may prove very difficult if not impossibleto bring a successful prosecution under this section but it may prove useful as a in terrorem measure.Certain propaganda if carried out with the intentsspecified in clause 2 will be punishable under that clause,and it is a matter for consideration whether clause 3 shouldbe included in the Bill.(c)      Parliamentary&apos; Control.    No provision has been included foran Order in Council bringing the Act into operation to besub.,ect to an affirmative or negative resolution.     Such aresolution may well be appropriate where power is being

given to create offences by Regulations and the offencesthemselves are- not created by the Act of Parliament,     Inthe present case Parliament will itself be creating the offences and all that the Order in Council will purport todo is to bring the Act into operation.     It may however benecessary when the Bill is debated in Parliament for some concession to be made by way of requiring an affirmative resolution.(d)     Definition of persons resisting His Majesty&apos;s Forces.     Inorder to avoid disputes in legal proceedings as to who are&quot;persons resisting by force&quot; the military operations con-templated by the Bill, clause 2(5) provides that the certificate of a Secretary of State shall be conclusive.   .J.C.E.Home Office, S.W.1,22ND JULY, 1950.
