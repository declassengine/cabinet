IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 1951ST SEPTEMBER, 1950CHINESE REPRESENTATION AT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe ProblemWhen the Cabinet last considered, on the 1st August (C. M. (50) 52ndConclusions, Minute 2), the question of Chinese representation in the security council, the conclusion was reached that provided the question was not raised in such a way as to link it with events in Korea, we should not allow ourselves to be put in a position in which we appeared to be obstructing the admissionof representatives of the People&apos;s Government and that we should seek to avoid the weak position of appearing to wait to see how others would vote before we ourselves expressed any positive view.   Since that date this question has notbeen raised on its merits in the Security Council but it seems certain that it willbe raised at the beginning of the Fifth Session of the Assembly.2. In my last message on this subject to the Secretary of the state department, Mr, Acheson, I informed him that if the question were put to the vote on its merits, divorced entirely from the question of Korea, in either theSecurity Council or the General Assembly, we should feel obliged to vote for the peking Government even if we were to find ourselves in the minority as a result.I have not yet received Mr. Acheson&apos;s reply.3. It would in some ways be unfortunate if this question were pressed tothe vote in the opening session where the fact that I was voting personally withthe Russians against the Americans would receive the fullest publicity.   It isnot, however, suggested that this fact by itself should induce us to change ourvoting policy.recommendations. Unless in the meantime the People&apos;s Government of China have takensome action which materially alters the situation, I submit that it should now bedecided that I should cast my vote in favour of the admission of a representativeof that Government if the question is put to the vote at the beginning of theGeneral Assembly, and that I should inform the American   and French foreign ministers of my intention during our pre-Assembly talks in New York.   If thereshould be in the Assembly a general desire to avoid taking an immediate decision and instead to refer the question to some committee it is submitted that we should accept this course although we should not press for it to be taken.Argument5. The above recommendations are based on the assumption that thePeople&apos;s Government do nothing between now and the opening of the general assembly which would make it difficult or impossible for us to vote in favour oftheir representation (e.g. active Chinese assistance to the North Koreans).COPY NO. *l3c%CABINET

2f) p*Assuming that the time has now come when we should abandon our policy ofabstaining on this question and should cast an affirmative vote in favour of theFeople&apos;s Government,.there seems no reason to be deflected from this purpose by the fact that the vote in the General Assembly is likely to take place in thefull glare of publicity.   It is well known that our views diverge from those of the americans on this point and to vote in this way would merely be a demonstration of that fact.    The good effect of such a vote would be that the position would notarise in which the Asiatic countries by and large were voting on one side andall the Western Powers either voting on the other or abstaining.6, At first sight there appear to be advantages in having the question referred from the Assembly to some committee.   This would mean that the vote in plenary would be postponed probably for some days with a consequentdiminution of the effect on public opinion.   Moreover it might be thought thatthe report of the committee might be couched in such terms that many members who do not recognise the People&apos;s Government might find that it gave them theexcuse for voting in favour of the change over.   On the other hand it is hard tosee what sort of committee could in the event produce a report which would have that effect.    If the question is referred to the Credentials Committee the report could only be to the effect that the credentials held by the Chinese Nationalistdelegate were or were not in good order.   The wider question of whether thegovernment issuing those credentials could itself truly be regarded as thegovernment of China would be beyond the competence of the CredentialsCommittee to decide and it would have, if it studied this aspect at all, to refer it back to the Assembly for decision.   If some more high-powered ad hoc committee was set up to consider not simply the matter of the ChineseNationalist delegated credentials but also the wider question of which government should send representatives to the United Nations it seemsimpossible that such a committee (which would probably be so composed that itformed a microcosm of the General Assembly and which would base its owndecisions on political factors) would adopt a recommendation in favour of thechange-over.   Moreover if the Prussians are determined to push the matter to a vote in the opening session it may well be difficult to prevent them from having their way.    It is therefore felt that there is little point in our making anyparticular effort to have this question sent to a committee though if the sense ofthe Assembly is in favour of this we should welcome it as providing at any ratea breathing space even though it is perhaps unlikely to affect the ultimatedecision.7. There may however be quite definite advantages in setting in train a study of the principles which should in general govern the solution of a problem ofthis sort.    The Cuban item on the Provisional Agenda (Item 62:   &quot;recognition by the United Nations of the representation of a member State&quot;) has this aimin view.   This item will no doubt be discussed in the normal way in the Sixth(Legal) Committee and there may well be some advantage in pressing for thelegal issues involved to be referred to the International Court of Justice for a legal opinion.   Such an opinion would probably be on the lines which Hisivlajesty&apos;s   Government themselves follow when considering at what stage togrant recognition to a new Government.   Such a study might help to clarifyinternational practice on this subject and might therefore help to avoid in thefuture the emergence of problems similar to those presented in the case ofChina.   But it is not suggested that a study of this sort, which is unlikely to becompleted until perhaps the middle of next year (and then possibly referred tothe Sixth Session of the General Assembly for approval)&apos; can have any immediatevalue on the present problem or can help us to solve it.E.
