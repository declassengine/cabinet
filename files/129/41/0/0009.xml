THIS  DOCUMENT  IS   THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJSSTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (50) 1595 th July, 1950CABINETKOREA:  REACTIONS OF OTHER COMMONWEALTH countries memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the texts of public statements which have been made by other Commonwealth countries about Korea(Appendix I). I also append a telegram from our Acting High Commissioner inSouth Africa and two telegrams from our High Commissioner in India giving further details of the reactions in these countries (Appendix II).The Canadian High Commissioner in London has reported orally that theview is held strongly by his Government that the operations in Korea should be conducted under the control and authority of the United Nations Organisation.The Australian Resident Minister has also emphasised to me his Government^hope that the conflict can be localised and their anxiety over the implications ofthe offer of aid from Nationalist China.I think that my colleagues will agree that this prompt response by Common-wealth Governments is a most gratifying demonstration of solidarity, and that the clear Indian statement, in the face of the obvious difficulties presented to pandit nehru, is particularly welcome.P. C. G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,5th July, 1950.APPENDIX ICanadaStatement made by the Prime Minister of Canada on 30th June, 1950As the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Pearson) said yesterday,our responsibility in this matter arises entirely from our membership in the united nations and from our support of the resolution of the Security Council passed on tuesday last, part of which reads as follows: &quot; the Security Council, recommends that the members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area.&quot; Any participation by Canada in carrying out theforegoing resolution and I wish to emphasise this strongly, would not be partici-pation in war against any State. It would be our part in collective police action under the control and authority of the United Nations for the purpose of restoring38981 b
peace to an area where an aggression has occurred, as determined under the charter of the United Nations by the Security Council, which decision has been acceptedby us. It is only in such circumstances that this country would be involved inaction of this kind and the House, I think, has already approved this position.I would add, however, that if we are informed that a Canadian contribution to aidUnited Nations operations under a United Nations Commander would be important to achieve the ends of peace, which is of course our only purpose, then the Government wishes Parliament to know that it would immediately consider making such a contribution. It might, for instance, take the form of destroyersto operate with other naval units of the United Nations, though our destroyerscould not in any event reach Korean waters in less than about three weeks&apos; timebecause, after all, it is more than 6,000 miles from Esquimalt. HonourableMembers will recall that our naval units there were to proceed to European watersfor summer exercises. These arrangements will be suspended and the move will now be made into Western Pacific waters, where the ships would be closer to thearea where they might be of assistance to the United Nations and Korea, if such assistance were required. If the situation in Korea or elsewhere after prorogationshould deteriorate, and action by Canada beyond that which I have indicated shouldbe considered, Parliament will immediately be summoned together to give the new situation consideration. Meanwhile the Government, within the mandate whichthe attitude of the House in the last two days has given it, will do its full dutywithin the measure of its power and ability as a member of the United nations in common with other members to make the collective action of the United Nationseffective and to restore peace in Korea. If this can be done, and it can, then the chances of preserving and strengthening peace over far wider areas of the worldthan Korea will be immensely increased.AustraliaStatement made by the Prime Minister of Australia on 28th June, 1950The Cabinet at to-day^ meeting gave consideration to the position whichhas arisen by reason of the invasion of Southern Korea. It is quite clear that,although the invading forces are those of the North Korean Government, they represent Communist expansion. It therefore seems to the Cabinet that this attackis a Communist-inspired and directed move.If there are any or many Australians who have believed that Communismis a peaceful political movement, the attack upon Korea will have rudely awakenedthem. The Korean incident cannot be looked at in isolation nor can we in Australiaregard it as remote from our own interests and safety. There are other points of possible attack on or off the coast of China. There is also at this very momenta Communist led campaign in Indo-China. Much nearer home, there are theoperations of the Communist guerrillas in Malaya who are making it their business to render British control of Malaya difficult and who, if they succeed, will make itimpossible. These operations may well be stimulated by events in Korea. TheCabinet regards all these matters as not only grave individually but as adding upto evidence of Communist aggression in Asia, an aggression which is full of menacefor us. The immediate problem of Korea must, if it is to be dealt with at all. bedealt with by the great Powers, but so far as Malaya is concerned, we feel that australia has some capacity to help and in its own interests as well as in thoseof the entire British Commonwealth a duty to do whatever it can. I recently announced to Parliament the despatch of a squadron of R.A.A.F. transport aircraft to Singapore. I have now to announce that we are sending to Singapore, pursuant to discussions with the Government of the United Kingdom, a R.A.A.F. squadron of heavy bombers. The preservation of British authority in Malaya is vital toAustralia^ security. We cannot regard the task in that country as solely one for the United Kingdom, nor would the Australian people desire us to. It must bemade clear to the Communist movement everywhere that, if they promote aggressivecampaigns for the acquisition of new territory, they will find no division among theBritish countries of the world, who know that all their vital interests are in commonand will therefore at all times be prepared to help each other by such means aslie within their capacity.
AustraliaStatement made by Prime Minister of Australia on 30th June, 1950The Commonwealth Government, in further response to the resolution of theSecurity Council, has decided to place at the service of the United Nations throughthe American authorities the R.A.A.F. fighter squadron now stationed in Japan.The United Nations, having decided to support the Republic of Korea, the Com-commonwealth Government, as signatory of the Charter, is determined to honour its obligations to do what it can to support the Security CounciFs decision. TheSecretary-General of the United Nations, the Government of United States ofAmerica and the Governments of the United Kingdom and of other British Com-commonwealth countries, are being advised accordingly. Meanwhile, plans for thereturn of the B.C.O.F. to Australia are to be held in abeyance.New ZealandStatement made by the Prime Minister of New Zealand on 29th June, 1950The Government are following events in Korea with the utmost attention andthey are in constant touch with the British and American Governments.The New Zealand Government hold the view that the action taken by theSecurity Council is fully in accord with the United Nations Charter.The Charter provides that the Security Council shall determine the existenceof any breach of the peace or act of aggression, and shall make recommendationsor decide what measures shall be taken to deal with it. If measures not involving the use of armed force would be ineffective, then the Security Council may take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restoreinternational peace and security.Despite the fact that the arrangements contemplated in Article 43 of the charter have not been concluded, because of disagreements between the leading members, and there are no formal agreements with the Security Council underwhich members would make available to the Council armed forces and other assistance which the Council could call upon and use where necessary, the NewZealand Government hold the view that the Security Council has a clear duty tomaintain international peace and security, and they feel that it is incumbent uponmembers of the United Nations to give their full co-operation in all endeavours to achieve that end.The New Zealand Government welcome the measures thus promptly takenby the Security Council and fully approve the terms of the Councils resolution of27th June. They have advised the United Kingdom and the United States Govern-ments of their support for the action taken by these Governments to assist theRepublic of Korea to withstand aggression.The New Zealand Government will do whatever lies within their power to fulfil the obligations they have incurred under the United Nations Charter. Theyare prepared to make available units of the Royal New Zealand Navy should this form of assistance be required and they are at present in consultation withthe United Kingdom Government on this matter.South AfricaStatement issued by the Government of the Union of South Africa on 1st July, 1950The Union Government has closely watched the events of the past few days in Korea. It deplores and condemns what appears to it to be the clearly aggressiveacts and intentions of the Government of North Korea., The Union Government has noted with satisfaction the resolution of theSecurity Council and in support of that resolution the prompt and firm decisionsof President Truman and the United Kingdom Government to do what they canto check the aggressive plans of North Korea.The Union Government has never regarded the Far East as falling within the sphere of its military responsibility in the preservation of world peace.38981 b 2
Moreover, having regard to the remoteness of the present scene of aggressionfrom South Africa there is apparently little assistance of any kind that the Unioncould give which, bearing in mind the time factor and other considerations, would prove helpful.Nevertheless, the Union Government would be prepared in consultation withGreat Britain and the other Dominions to give the most careful and sympathetic consideration to any appeal for assistance in dire need received either from th&amp;^United Nations or those Western countries which associate themselves: with the.Security Council resolution and are most directly concerned.IndiaSummary of a Communique issued by the Government of India on 30th June, 1950Statement opens with explanation of Indian support of cease-fire resolu-tion, in view of information derived (among other sources) from United nations commission that large-scale invasion of South Korea had taken place, and con-tinues with explanation of why Indian representative did not participate in voting on second resolution owing to the impossibility of communicating instructions intime. After quoting operative part of this resolution call to assist Korea to repelarmed attack, statement goes on to say that Government of India have given most careful consideration to this in the context both of events in Korea and of their general foreign policy. &quot;They are opposed to any attempt to settle international disputes by resort to aggression.&apos; Therefore India voted in favour of first resolution.&quot;The halting of aggression and the quick restoration of peaceful conditions are essential preludes to satisfactory settlement. The Government of India, therefore,also accept the second resolution.&quot; But this decision does not involve any modi-fication of Indian foreign policy, which is based on promotion of world peace and friendly relations with all countries and remains &quot; an independent policy whichwill continue to be determined solely by India&apos;s ideals and objectives.&quot; Statementconcludes, &quot; the Government of India earnestly hope that even at this stage it maybe possible to put an end to the fighting and to settle the dispute by mediation.&quot;PakistanStatement issued by the Government of Pakistan on 2nd July, 1950The Government of Pakistan have taken due note of the findings of theSecurity Council that the hostilities now in progress in Korea constitute aggressionon the part of North Korea. As already announced by the Prime Minister of pakistan, they will give their full support to any measures proposed by the security council to deal with the situation.CeylonExtract from Telegram of 30th June, 1950, from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, Colombo.Ceylon Prime Minister has been quoted in press as saying that Ceylon&apos;s role in the Korean situation is that of a spectator. &quot; As we are not yet members ofUnited Nations Organisation and as the latest directive for assistance to united nations Organisation from member nations does not concern us, we are notinvolved at the moment. I have no doubt that United Nations organisation will utilise the machinery available for a satisfactory settlement of this dispute.&quot;Prime Minister added that use of Ceylon bases by either party in the dispute didnot arise (this remark has been qualified by External Affairs, who explained thatPrime Minister had in mind the absence of any request for Ceylon bases by either party). &quot;;
APPENDIX IISouth AfricaCopy of telegram of-1st July, 1950, from the United Kingdom High Commissioner,CapetownI asked Forsyth whether he could give me any background to UnionGovernments statement of policy.2. He said that it was clear from his talk with Dr. Malan yesterday thatin the event of w^in Middle East that Union Government would at once offer all available assistance. They did not, however, regard Far East as within sphere oftheir strategic responsibilities. For example, while they had provided base facilities in Union for war against Japan they had not offered any personnel for service inSouth-East Asia.3. Nevertheless, if Union Government receive a request for some specifictype of assistance which it is felt would have important effect on events in Koreathey would give it sympathetic consideration in the light of the case made out for such specific assistance. General enquiries as to what help Union could givewould, however, have no useful result. I asked Forsyth on this whether if situation was that (A) Americans could hold position in Korea, provided that there was no direct Russian intervention, and (B) it was considered that contributions by as many other Governments as possible would be likely to be effective moral deterrent to Russia Union would make such contribution. He said that he doubted whetherthis would be regarded as &quot; dire need &quot; but at another point in our conversation he suggested that any request for specific assistance should emphasise its moralvalue. Forsyth gave purely as examples of the sort of assistance which might begiven if a sufficiently strong case were made out provision of 40 to 50 pilotsor possibly a frigate. Any request should specify exactly what form assistance should take and explain why it could best take that form. It should emphasise thatin the event of general conflagration occurring any assistance provided by SouthAfrica in Far East could be withdrawn at once in order to help the Union to meet their other commitments which would then arise.4. I think that Union would prefer any request to come from United kingdom or from United Kingdom and United States of America jointly and not from united Nations.IndiaCopy of telegram of 28th June, 1950, from the United Kingdom High Commissioner,New DelhiI asked Bajpai tp-day what was attitude of his Government about the Koreasituation.2. He said he had only had a hurried talk with the Prime Minister last night and again this morning and no clear policy had so far emerged. The Prime Ministerseemed to be inclined to take no action because he stood a good chance to layhimself open to criticism that if he supported one particular side he would be guilty of aligning himself with one particular bloc and seemed disposed, therefore, to instruct their representative on Security Council to abstain from voting.3. I nat^ally pointed out that failure to condemn aggression would strike at the whole basis of Membership of the United Nations Organisation and couldnot conceive how India could possibly attempt adoption of a neutral policy insuch a matter. Bajpai did not argue this rather obvious Truism but said that thePrime Minister was in such a hurry that he had not had time to put to him what he called &quot; the other side of the medal.&quot;4. The Indian Press to-day credits B-N. Rau with having put a proposal fora personal meeting between Stalin and Truman and I asked Bajpai what justificationthere was for this report. He replied that Rau had put such a proposal some days before the Korean dispute occurred.  He had been told from Delhi that such a
proposal was quite impracticable for obvious reasons and was given no encourage-ment. Since the Korean dispute Bajpai had told B.N. Rau that this new circum-stance made this proposal even more unsuitable than before but it seemed as though Rau was still anxious to push his plans. I gathered that he will receiveno assistance from the Government of India.IndiaCopy of telegram of 30th June, 1950, from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, New DelhiI discussed Korean situation with Pandit Nehru to-day. He claimed thatdelay and hesitation on part of Indian Government was due to nature of president truman&apos;s statement. Had he confined himself to Korean issue as stated in thirdproblem before Security Council, India would have had little difficulty in deciding what course she should take. But since he coupled his declaration with references to Formosa and provision of arms to Indo-China this complicated situation very considerably.2. I think there is some substance in the explanation which Nehru has given,for there is little doubt that these references did cause a number of complicationsfrom Indian point of view. Nevertheless, I do not think it is the whole story. Ithas been a comparatively easy thing for India to proclaim that her foreign policyof non-alignment is not a supine and negative one of merely sitting, on the fence,but &quot; dynamic &quot; and designed to bring Indian influence to bear, in the interest of world peace. But when faced with practical appreciation [sic: ? application] ofthis policy to a concrete case there is little doubt that complications of such a policybecome painfully obvious. Nehru&apos;s initial reactions were to stand clear of thewhole business if he could possibly do so, for he was very sensitive to any possiblecriticism, either within India or among other Asian countries, accusing India oflining up with the West. Both my United States colleague and I represented toBajpai the debt which India owed to United Nations Organisation (U.N.O.) andto impossibility of her taking a neutral attitude. Henderson reinforced his argu-ments by quoting from Nehru&apos;s speech before Congress in America where he saidIndia would resist aggression. We both formed the impression, however, that inputting forward these arguments to Bajpai we were knocking at an open doorand we were sure that he would represent all these factors very strongly to Nehru.It is evident that representations of officials ultimately influenced Nehru in takingthe line which he did and it is significant also that they persuaded him to omit incommunique issued by Government of India any compensating critical references to the Presidents pronouncements about Formosa and Indo-China on lines that had been [corrupt group].3. I asked him whether India was going to give any practical assistance toRepublic of Korea (to twist his tail rather than in expectation of favourable reply),he replied that there was no question of an Indian military contribution.4. So far as India is concerned the lesson should be a salutary one and it is perhaps not too much to hope that it may introduce greater atmosphere of realisminto India&apos;s foreign policy though process of educating Nehru and Government ofIndia will clearly be a long and tortuous one.
