(50) 1646th July, 1950CABINETINCREASE IN OVERSEAS POSTAGE RATESMemorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralDevaluation of sterling raises a question relating to the overseas postage ratescharged in this country for letter correspondence other than that sent by the surchange air services; and in this memorandum I set out, for the information ofmy colleagues, certain proposals for increasing these rates which have been agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with officials of the Board of Trade.2. The international letter service is governed by the Universal PostalConvention, the basic instrument of the Universal Postal Union, of which practicallyevery country in the world is a member. One of the fundamental provisions ofthe Convention prescribes, in centimes of a gold franc, the rates of postage to becharged for the various categories of surface letter correspondence (letters, post-cards, printed papers, commercial papers, samples and small packets). As a resultof devaluation the sterling equivalents of the gold centime postage rates specifiedin the Convention have been increased by approximately 44 per cent.3. Since its inception in 1874 the Universal Postal Union has stresseduniformity of overseas postage rates as one of the basic principles of an inter-national postal service. Basic rates are accordingly prescribed in the Convention.Since the First World War, however, it has been recognised that currency fluctua-tions and the varying economic conditions in different countries make necessarysome degree of flexibility, and by an Article in the Final Protocol to the Conventionpostal administrations are given an option of increasing the basic rates by not morethan 40 per cent, or reducing them by not more than 20 per cent., provided thatsuch reduction or increase is applied to all rates proportionately. In convertinggold centimes into national currencies, postal administrations are allowed to roundup or down to suit the characteristics of their monetary systems.4. This option to increase or reduce the basic rates of postage withinprescribed limits, which may be exercised unilaterally, is supplemented bydiscretionary power to conclude special bi-lateral agreements with other adminis-trations for reduced postage rates, provided that conditions less favourable to thepublic than those laid down by the Convention are not introduced. Thus, anyadministration may offer to its public postage rates below (but not above) theConvention limits by agreement with the postal administration of the country concerned. In this way, the British Post Office offers the reduced &quot; Common-wealth &quot; rate of postage (2\d. for the first oz. and Id. for each succeeding oz.instead of the ordinary foreign rate of 3d. for the first oz. and 2d. for eachsucceeding oz.) for letters to countries of the Commonwealth, Egypt, Burma,Israel, Jordan and the United States of America, and the ordinary inland rate(2%d. for the first 2 oz. and \d. for each succeeding 2 oz.) for letters to the irish republic. The prior consent of the country concerned is required in order to safe-guard members of the Universal Postal Union against the embarrassment arisingout of disproportionate reductions in postage rates introduced unilaterally by afellow member which might lead to agitation for similar concessions among theirown public.5.   The Universal Postal Convention gives administrations a further option of granting a reduction up to 50 per cent, of the normal postage rates for certain38988Copy No.    3
classes of printed papers, namely, newspapers, periodicals, books, pamphlets, mapsand sheets of music. This option,, which may also be exercised unilaterally, is designed to allow postal administrations to foster international exchanges in the cultural field, and commercal printed packets are specifically excluded from thescope of the concession.6. The ordinary foreign (as opposed to the &quot; Commonwealth &quot;) postage ratescharged by the British Post Office before devaluation represented the maximum permissible reduction of the basic rates. The schedule attached to this paper sets out the present postage rates, the post-devaluation sterling equivalents of the mini^mum Convention gold centime rates which we are under treaty obligation to adopt,and the actual postage rates which it is proposed to introduce.7. The most important is the first foreign letter rate of Ad. in place of theexisting rate of 3d. Although A\d. would be the proper rounding of A-AM., the exact sterling equivalent of the Convention gold centime rate, I consider that a ratestructure based on Ad. would be tenable so far as the Universal Postal Union is con-cerned. Its adoption will no doubt be regarded by some member countries asstraining the &quot; rounding &quot; provisions of the Convention, but these &quot; rounding &quot;provisions depend on an interpretation of the words used, and it cannot be categori-cally stated that a Ad. rate is out of order. Retention of the 3d. rate, on the otherhand, would be a direct contravention of the Convention and would leave us with no defence before the Universal Postal Union.8. An increase to Ad. rather than to A\d. could be more easily defended athome (1) as necessary to meet our international obligations, and (2) by pointing out that an increase from 2\d. pre-war to Ad. compares not unfavourably with theincrease in the inland letter rate from \\d. pre-war to 2.\d.9. I do not contemplate any alteration in the present letter and postcard rates to Commonwealth countries, the United States, Burma, Egypt, Israel and Jordan,since it is permissible to maintain them under the &quot; special agreements &quot; clause, andI propose to mitigate the effect of the increased postage rates for second class mail(printed papers, commercial papers, &amp;c.) to all overseas destinations by taking advantage of the option provided by the Convention whereby the normal printedpaper postage rates may be reduced by up to 50 per cent, for newspapers,periodicals, books, pamphlets, maps, and sheets of music. The effect will be thatthe existing rates of postage will be maintained for these categories of correspon-dence, which represent some 90 per cent, of all overseas surface second class mail;and the increased rates will, therefore, apply to some 10 per cent, of the postingsonly.10. As regards the service with extra-European countries (other than those towhich the Commonwealth rates apply), it is unlikely that the increased letter postagerates will bear unduly hardly on commercial interests, since 75 per cent, by number and 50 per cent, by weight of all first-class mail (letters and postcards) for thesecountries is now being sent by air mail. In the case of Europe (except Poland andIceland), all first class mail is sent by air without air mail fee. This &quot; all-up &quot;service has been introduced since the present foreign letter postage rates were fixed.There has thus been a very material improvement in facilities, made at some costto the Post Office, and it is not unreasonable that the public should pay a little more for the service.11. There will be no consequential increases in the rates of postage for airmail correspondence except that the proposed minimum charges for commercialpapers (Ad.) and small packets (1\ d.) must necessarily apply to these categories ofcorrespo ndence sent by air.   The number of items affected will be very small.12. I estimate that the proposed increases will produce additional revenue of the order of  400,000 per annum.13. I propose to make a brief statement in the House before it rises for the summer recess-probably at Question Time on Wednesday, 12th July and to intro-duce the new rates at a convenient date thereafter following the observance ofcertain subsidiary requirements of the Convention and the laying of the necessaryWarrant amending the British Commonwealth and Foreign Post Warrant.N.
