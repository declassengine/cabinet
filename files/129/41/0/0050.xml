Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 20030th August, 1950CABINETREVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION  IN ASIA IN THELIGHT OF THE KOREAN  CONFLICTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am circulating separately for consideration by my colleagues memoranda onKorea and Formosa. In addition, I think it necessary to review the whole positionin Asia in the light of the Korean conflict, and to consider the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in relation to that part of the world. This is particularly important in view of the forthcoming Tripartite Ministerial Talks in New Yorkwhich I shall be attending.2. Review of the Policy of His Majesty&apos;s government since the end of the war, the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Southand South-East Asia has been to encourage the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of that area for independence. In accordance with this policy independence wasgiven to India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma and with the exception of the last-named all these countries chose to remain in the Commonwealth. In Indonesiaour efforts were directed towards the attainment of nationalist aspirations bylegitimate means and by non-violence. After some anxious and troubled yearsIndonesia became a sovereign independent State as a result of the ultimate recog-nition by the Netherlands of the wisdom of granting independence. In Indo-China,His Majesty&apos;s Government have recognised Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia asAssociate States of the French Union, and have at the same time done what theycould to persuade the French Government of the necessity of increasing themeasure of independence accorded to these States. In our own dependent terri-tories His Majesty&apos;s Government are pursuing an enlightened policy of progress towards self-government within the Commonwealth, while seeking to improve thesocial and economic welfare of the people.That the policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government has been the right onethere can be no doubt, and our support of nationalism in South and South-east asia provides the best possible counter to communist subversion and penetration.The relations between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and foreign government of the area are cordial, and where matters of disagreement arise itcan be said that it is possible to discuss these matters in an atmosphere conducivetowards their settlement. There is a very strong fund of goodwill towards theUnited Kingdom in South and South-East Asia which should stand us in goodstead.The United Kingdom&apos;s position in the Far East was much weakened as a resultof the war. The United States on the other hand, who played the principal partin the defeat of Japan, found themselves in the predominant position. The policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Far East immediately after the war was to try to re-establish our commercial position in China and Japan and through the far eastern Commission to try to exercise such influence as was possible upon thepost-surrender policies for Japan. In Korea the issue was almost entirely betweenthe United States and the Soviet Union as occupying powers, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment held what was little rhore than a watching brief.39282THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT
This comparatively negative policy of the United Kingdom which was dictated by our post-war weakness and our many commitments elsewhere has meant thatwhile on the one hand we were unable to exercise much influence upon the course ofevents, we were, on the other hand, less immediately involved in the debacle inChina and Korea and are therefore to-day to some extent freer than the UnitedStates to determine our policy for the future in the Far East.3. United States Policy in AsiaThe United States have tended since the war to regard South and South-east asia as primarily a British interest. Indeed, until 1949 they were not disposed togive very serious consideration to the matter apart from the anxiety which theyshared with us to see a settlement of the Kashmir dispute. Within the last year,however, the United States, largely owing to the Communist threat, have been disposed to take a closer interest in developments in South-East Asia to the extentof being prepared to give military and economic aid to certain countries withinthe scope of existing appropriations. It is hoped that they will eventually beprepared to take part in economic development in South and South-East Asia.In general the United States expect the United Kingdom to take the lead, and show a welcome disposition to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government before taking any kind of action.  This is satisfactory and should be encouraged.In the Far East, however, the United States have tended to be a law untothemselves since the end of the war, with results which have been far from happy.In Korea, up to the outbreak of the Korean conflict, United States policy had met with no great degree of success, and there is reason to believe that had SouthKorea fallen a victim to the North by processes similar to those which overthrewthe existing Governments in Eastern Europe, the United States would have acceptedthe fait accompli. In China, the late President Roosevelt&apos;s policy of cultivating the friendship of that country failed dismally for the reason that American support wasgiven to a regime which, through its failure to introduce promised reforms,eventually lost the confidence of the overwhelming majority of. the Chinese people.The United States Government, having denounced this regime in a White Paper,on the same occasion proclaimed its hostility to the Communist regime even before it had been set up. Yet at the same time they continued and still continue to givesupport to Chiang Kai-shek. Thus it is true to say that the United States lack alldirection in their policy towards China. That this state of affairs is dangerousis demonstrated by the Formosan situation, which is discussed in CP. (50) 194.A similar lack of direction is apparent in United States policy towards Japan.Initially the disarmament and demilitarisation of Japan was accomplished byGeneral MacArthur with efficiency and despatch. But now, five years after theend of the war with Japan, the United States appear to have no clear idea as tothe direction in which they are going. The Far Eastern Commission is virtually adead letter, and consultation with other Powers is non-existent, even though theUnited States are not entitled to settle the Japanese problem by themselves. the dangers of such a situation need no emphasis. Japan is a country of more than80 million people which cannot be ignored in the context of Asia. The treatmentof Japan will determine whether in the future she is with us or against us. the lack of direction in United States policy offers no guarantee that the treatmentwill be of the right kind, and clearly this is a matter in which friendly powers should be consulted and consulted soon. Nor is there any need for the Koreanconflict to preclude such consultation.4.   The Effect of the Korean Conflict and Formosan Situation upon AsiaThe immediate reaction of Asian countries (excluding China) to the north korean aggression and to the United States intervention, which was subsequentlyendorsed by the Security Council, was good as has been demonstrated by themeasure of support given to the Security Council resolutions. But second thoughtswere induced not only by successive American defeats in Korea but by the situation created by President Truman&apos;s declaration on Formosa. Nothing in United States&apos;Far Eastern policy since the war has inspired Asian countries with confidence, andthe declaration on Formosa has caused both alarm and despondency because of thepossibility which it has created of a conflict between the United States and China,with all the repercussions upon Asia which would be likely to follow. The doubtsand fears to which the American action over Formosa have given rise have beengiven most expression in India, who has always been suspicious of American
&quot; imperialism &quot; and is specially worried now lest American action should jeopardise the friendly relations which India herself is bent on establishing with China. Butthe feeling is probably more widespread that the United States is intervening in asia and seeking to determine its future in a way unpleasing to the peoples of Asia and likely to be to their detriment. Though countries like Siam and the Philippines paylip service to the United States they are not themselves held in high repute. India,on the other hand, has an undoubted influence upon Asian opinion.There is therefore a distinct possibility that, unless United States policy towardsChina, Japan and Korea takes more account of Asian opinion and Asian susceptibilites-bilities, we shall find that Asia is gradually alienated from the West, which couldonly be of benefit to the Soviet Union.5.   Internal Difficulties of the United States AdministrationUnfortunately United States Far Eastern policy is bedevilled by internalpolitics. The bi-partisan foreign policy does not effectively extend to the Far East.For some time past China has been the subject of increasingly bitter controversy.The Korean conflict has given rise to accusations of unpreparedness and there has developed a tendency to search for scapegoats and to blame the Administration forthe failure of its Far Eastern policy, and to ignore the fact that it is precisely becausethe Far East has become a party political issue that the Administration^ policy hasbeen so negative. The situation is rendered more acute by the fact that elections for the whole of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate are due in November. It may therefore be expected that the temperature on Far Easternquestions will rise rather than fall during the next three months, just at the timewhen both China and Korea will be in the forefront of international debate in theUnited Nations Assembly. The recent clash between President Truman and general macarthur over the latter&apos;s statement on Formosa, which was published in spiteof the Presidents veto, is likely to increase the party political tension. Added to all this is the fact that American public opinion is in a highly emotional state, which is attributable in part to the Korean situation itself and in part to the sense of frustra-tion induced by the feeling that in fighting the North Koreans, Americans are notcoming to grips with the real enemy. In such a state of mind the American publicis likely to be irrational in its outlook, and unreasonable towards the UnitedKingdom where our policy diverges from that of the United States.6. The problem the problem before us is to seek, at a time when the general atmosphere inthe United States is least favourable for such a course, to persuade the UnitedStates Administration not to adopt policies in relation to the Far East which will fail to command general support amongst friendly nations and which will antagoniseAsia. The immediate issues are those of Korea and Formosa and the question of chinese representation in the United Nations. These are discussed in separatepapers before the Cabinet. It is sufficient to say here that, as regards Korea, it isessential to try to maintain intact the solidarity which has already been demons-trated by the 53 members of the United Nations Organisation. On China, includingFormosa, the United States are likely to be more intractable, and it is on Chinesequestions that the greatest difficulties are likely to be experienced in view of the atmosphere in the United States, which I have described. No effort is likely to succeed which, just before elections, has the result that the United States Adminis-tration appears to have given way to United Kingdom pressure. We cannot expect the Administration to do things which will lead to its certain downfall.7. The MethodClearly, therefore, the United Kingdom should not be obtrusive in its efforts to influence United States policy in the right direction, nor must the onus fall onus alone for bringing about a change in American policy, if that can be effected.The position is by no means hopeless. For the first time since the war theUnited States Administration have shown a desire to consult with us on far eastern affairs and to give consideration to the views which we express, and theyare also showing signs of appreciating the importance of Asian (and particularlyIndian) opinion in dealing with these matters. Certain interchanges are already in progress between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington and the State Depart-ment, and I am not without hope that these will pave the way for the further developments which I have in mind.
Though the United States Administration, as I have indicated, will not changeits policies in response to purely British suggestion, it may be willing to modifythose policies in response to a majority view in the United Nations Assembly,provided an agreed view emerges as a result of debate and consultations.I have it in mind, therefore, after the discussions which are going on with theState Department, to try to get them to agree to consult with other Powers, inparticular with Commonwealth countries, with France and possibly with someother European countries. If the support of these can be secured, the next step would be to try to get the broad agreement of other friendly members of the united nations, and thus build up a common front against any manoeuvres of the soviet union, whose main purpose will be to create a split.The task will obviously be a difficult one, but it offers the best hope forreconciling United States and Asian opinion and of enabling the commonwealth to keep in line with the United States. Only by pursuing this course can we hope to avoid open divergence with the United States on China and the related questionof Formosa, and the unfortunate consequences which might ensue in the presenthighly-charged atmosphere in the United States.I invite my colleagues to endorse the course of action which I propose.E B.Foreign Office, SWA,30th August, 1950.
