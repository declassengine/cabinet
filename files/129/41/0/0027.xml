(50) 177215/ July, 1950CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note on the more important statistics relating to the economicsituation which have become available since my last Economic Report(CP. (50) 122).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,2\st July, 1950.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the size of the working population has fluctuated between 23-3 and23 -4 millions since October 1949. The gradual increase in the proportion of women in the labour force, which has been going on for the past two years, seems still tobe continuing.2. During May there was a seasonal rise in employment and the number ofunemployed fell from 314,700 on 15th May to 282,000 at the middle of June (thatis, to 1 -4 per cent, of insured employees). The corresponding figure for the middleof June 1949 was 263,600.3. Unemployment in Development Areas has declined with unemploymentgenerally and on 12th June was 122,400 compared with 130,900 on 15th May.Over the last twelve months unemployment has risen slightly in the North-Eastern,Scottish and South Lancashire Areas and decreased in South Wales and Monmouth.The total is very slightly higher than in June 1949, when it was 119,800. TheDevelopment Areas account for over two-fifths of the unemployment in GreatBritain.II. Production4. The volume of industrial production in the first four months of the year was 9 per cent, higher than in the corresponding period of 1949. Manufacturingalone was 10 per cent, higher, and building and gas, water and electricity were both 6 per cent, higher.5. Production in May was affected by the Whitsun holiday, but if this is takeninto account the preliminary figures suggest that the rate of progress shown in theprevious months was being maintained.

In the first six months of this year the output of deep-mined coal averaged4 - 0 million tons a week and was about 1 - 3 per cent, higher than in the first halfof 1949. Over the same period, the output of opencast coal was 3-2 per cent,higher than last year.7. During the second quarter of the year exports were maintained at about one-quarter above the level in the second quarter of 1949, but they will fall in theremaining months of 1950 as a result of the decision to reduce shipments abroad.There has also been a slight increase in consumption in Great Britain. Distributedstocks at the end of June were 11-42 million tons compared with 12-82 million tons at June 1949.8. Output per man-shift in the second quarter of the year was higher thanin the second quarter of 1949, but slightly below the high level reached in the first quarter of 1950. There was less absenteeism in the second quarter of 1950 than inthe corresponding quarter of 1949. By the middle of the year the number of wage earners on the colliery books had dropped to 698,000 compared with 709,000 attheend of 1949 and 722,000 in June 1949.9. Output of steel ingots and castings in June averaged 312,500 tons a week,bringing production for the half year to 8-31 million tons an increase of A\ percent, over the figure of 7-95 million tons for the first six months of 1949.10. Output of pig-iron in June averaged 182,200 tons against 185,800 tons inJune 1949. The total for the half year is 4-81 million tons against 4-72 million tons in the first half of 1949.11. Stocks of pig-iron and scrap are still at the high levels to which they were built up last year. During May and June they have been rising, following a slightdecline in the early months of the year.12. Textile production has been expanding through the first five months of1950. Output of cotton yarn in May averaged 21-48 million lb. a week anincrease of 6 - 3 per cent, over May 1949 and was the highest monthly figure achievedsince the war.   Even so, it is still 20 per cent, below the average level of 1937.13. The production of rayon yarn and staple fibre (including other syntheticfibres) was 31-6 million lb. in May, a little lower than the record output of 32-million lb. in March. Output of nylon yarn averaged 153,400 lb. a week in Maycompared with 62,820 lb. in May 1949.Motor Vehicles14. Output of passenger cars and commercial vehicles reached record levels in May. The weekly output of passenger cars was 10,699 compared with 7,902 ayear ago, and weekly output of commercial vehicles was 5,547 compared with,367 in May last year. In June output showed a slight fall owing to the Whitsunholidays.15. Less than one-fifth of the cars and about one-third of the commercial vehicles produced in May were for the home market. Supplies for the home market fell during the last quarter of 1949, and have remained at a level of about,000 cars and 1,850 commercial vehicles weekly since the beginning of the year.The whole of the increase in production now taking place is for the export market.SteelTextiles
Merchant Shipbuilding16. The tonnage of merchant shipping under construction in British ship-yards, which fell from 2,000,000 gross tons at the end of January 1949 to 1,803,000gross tons at the end of February 1950, remained steady until April and recoveredslightly to 1,831,000 gross tons at the end of May. About one-third of the tonnageunder construction is for export.17. The tonnage of vessels undergoing repair and conversion in British portsdeclined substantially between 1947 and the end of 1949. There was a slightrecovery in January 1950 and little change has taken place since then.III.-Building18. The number of new permanent houses completed in Great Britain rose from 14,862 in April to 17,030 in May and 18,107 in June. The total for the threemonths is 3 per cent higher than the total for second quarter of 1949.IV.-External Trade19. Both imports and exports rose in May to high levels, reaching  228-7millions and  182-6 millions respectively. In June imports increased still further to  238-6 millions, while exports declined slightly to  175-8 millions. Re-exports in May were unchanged at  5 - 8 millions, but rose to  6 - 2 millions in June.20. Over the second quarter of the year exports have been slightly lower thanin the first, and imports have been at a very high level. Consequently the adverse balance of trade increased to  149-7 millions, a higher figure than for any quarter in 1949. &quot;Visible Balance of Trade (  million)ExportsandImports     re-exports      Balance(c.i.f.)

The greater part of the increase in imports between the first and secondquarters was in the raw materials group, though the figures for the food and manu-factures groups also went up. Much of the rise was due to higher prices, but therewas also a growth in the volume of imports.22. Exports were a little lower in the second quarter than in the first bothin volume and value, but were greater than in any quarter of 1949. Exports of metal goods have shown a fairly persistent upward trend; in May exports of textiles had not quite recovered the ground lost in April, but exports of othermanufactures exceeded the March figures.(Monthly averages)To United States- To Canada 1949 1st quarter 2nd quarter3rd quarter 4th quarter1950 1st quarter 2nd quarter			$ million	$ million		equivalent  million	equivalent	  million	Canadian5-3	21-2	6-6	26-73-3	13-4	6-4	26-53-8	15 1	6-2	25-26-7	18-7	7-2	22-06-7	18-8	8-5	26-37-3	20-3	10-2	31-4
23. Exports to the United States increased from  5-6 millions in April to 8-2 millions &quot;in May, and declined slightly to  8 millions in June. Exports to canada increased from  8-9 millions in April to  12-4 millions in May but in Junefell to  9 - 3 millions, slightly above the March figure and well above the level for any previous months in 1950 or 1949. Exports to Canada in the second quarter, of1950 expressed in Canadian dollars exceeded that for any quarter in 1949 beforedevaluation.24. A substantial market for passenger cars is being built up in Canada.Exports in May were  2,493,000 compared with an average of  1,606,000 a month in the first quarter, and exports of commercial vehicles are increasing.V. Balance oi PaymentsGold and Dollars25. The second quarter of 1950 ended with a net gold and dollar surplus of$180 millions, and an increase in reserves of $438 millions (to $2,422 millions). the weekly figures since the beginning of April are:  Net Gold and Dollar Surplus and Increase in United Kingdom Gold and dollar Holdings(US. $ million)		Increase in Gold	Gold and	and DollarWeek ended 	Dollar Surplus	Holdings8th April	17	2915th April	22	:   4422nd April	3	2129th April	12	436th May	20	3513th May	13	2920th May	11	2327th May	.  ...           4	263rd June	8	3010th June        ..:	17	3517th June	21	5324th June	...         11	241st July	18	4426. The surplus in this quarter was swollen by: (a) seasonally high receipts from wool and cocoa; (b) abnormally high prices, e.g., for rubber; and (c) thecoincidence of several favourable items (e.g., among United Kingdom invisiblesthere were big receipts from insurance and oil company dividends) which might easily have occurred in the first or third quarters.27. Factors (a) and (c) will be reversed in the present quarter, and importsfrom North America will be seasonally higher; so that even if factor (b) persiststhe surplus will probably be very much smaller than in the second quarter, and theremay not, in fact, be a surplus at all.United Kingdom total Balance of Payments28. Exports have been high and imports particularly high in recent months.Payments figures and &quot; invisibles &quot; are not yet available but it is probable that theUnited Kingdom was in small surplus during the first six months of the year.29. The high prices received (both from the dollar area and from Europe)by sterling area countries for their primary produce, and the expectation thatthe Australian pound would be revalued, led to an increase of  176 millions in sterling area sterling balances between the end of December and the end of May.Non-sterling area sterling balances, on the other hand, declined by  52 millions andour holdings of non-dollar currencies rose (to the end of June) by  18 millions.On balance, therefore, there has been an increase of just over  100 millions in ournet external short-term liabilities over the period.The United Kingdom in the European Payments Scheme30. The following table shows the year&apos;s movements of official balances(including movements from third countries and from non-official balances) held by
  million-984 434 754-29non-sterling area participants in the Intra-European Payments Agreement. A&apos; surplus from the point of view of the sterling area is indicated by a plus (4)sign:-1949-Third quarterFourth quarter1950-First quarterSecond quarteri - -Total (1949-50)    ......      ...      ...      +4931. The main &quot;surpluses&quot; over the year were with Holland (4-29),Germany (4-28), Turkey (4-12), Greece (4-12), Norway (4 8) and Austria (4 7).The main &quot;deficits&quot; were with France (-34) and Italy (-14).32. As explained in paragraph 43 below, the Intra-European Payments Agree-ment is to be superseded by the European Payments Union. It seems unlikely thatsurpluses of the magnitude experienced in the first half of 1950 will continue duringthe first year of the new arrangement.VI-prices import and Export Prices33. The index of import prices (1947 = 100) rose from 131 in April to 132 inMay. It has risen ten points since December 1949. The index of export prices(1947= 100) rose from 118 in April to 119 in May; it was 115 in December.Wholesale Prices34. The Board of Trade&apos;s index of wholesale prices (1938 = 100) rose from246 in April to 251 in May and 252 in June. The increase was mainly in pricesof imported raw materials, particularly wool and non-ferrous metals. BetweenMay and June there was a slight fall in Wholesale food prices.35. Since the end of June there have been further increases in commodity prices, particularly in tin and rubber.Retail Prices36. The index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100) rose from 113 in March to114 in April and has remained at that figure in May and June. Between May and june the index for food fell by one point, owing mainly to the reduction in theprice of eggs, and the fuel index fell by two points owing to the introduction of lower summer prices for coal.VII-Retail Sales and Stocks37. Retail sales were low in April, and rose again in May, but even so, takingthe two months together, the increase (for large-scale retailers) over the same periodof 1949 was only 8 per cent., compared with 11 per cent, in the first quarter. Thechange has been most noticeable in footwear and other clothing and furniture andfurnishings. Stocks of these goods have accumulated; in the Board of Trade sampleof large-scale retail stores the stocks of clothing in April were 37 per cent, higher byvalue than a year ago and 27 per cent, higher in May, and the stocks of furnitureand furnishings were 30 per cent, higher in April and. 20 per cent, higher in May.VIII.   Wage Rates38. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)continued unchanged at 110 during June. In June 1949 it was 10939. During May there was a small increase of about  8,000 in the weeklyfull-time wages of 34,000 people, compared with an increase of  40,000 in April, 27,500 in March,  178,000 in February and  106,000 in January. The chief increases in May affected established grades working in H.M. Prisons and Borstal Institutions
in England and Wales, manual workers in the non-trading services of various localauthorities in Scotland, and workers in the flax and hemp industry in GreatBritain.40. The increase in the April figure of the Interim Index of Retail Pricesfrom 113 to 114 points will give rise to increases under cost of living sliding scaleagreements in a number of industries, the most important being the iron and steelgroup, boot and shoe manufacture and carpet manufacture.41. A number of new wage-claims have been presented, the most importantcoming from agricultural workers, County Council roadmen and workers in theroad passenger transport industry. In the distributive trade new claims affect the wholesale grocery trade and the Retail Co-operative Societies, and a revision ofthe wage structure in the flour-milling industry is likely to result in general increases.42. Claims by the engineering and shipbuilding workers, the railwaymen,clothing trade workers and teachers are still being considered. A claim by the mineworkers for increased cost of living payments has been dropped for the timebeing in favour of a claim for new weekly minimum rates representing generalincreases of 155. a week.IX. European Recovery ProgrammeEuropean Payments Union43. On 7th July the Ministerial Council of the Organisation for european economic Co-operation approved the arrangements for a European payments union, providing for a system of multilateral payments among member countries,including complete transferability of Western European currencies earned by thosecountries on current account. The payments scheme has associated with it certainprinciples of commercial policy which are to be followed by members of the Unionas between one another. These principles include provision that all new liberalisa-tion measures must be non-discriminatory and for the removal by stages of existingdiscrimination in quantitative restrictions on imports and in invisible transactions.The agreement will be valid in the first instance for two years (the remaining periodof Marshall Aid) and will be reviewed thereafter. Each member will have a quotain $1 units of account (that for the sterling area, excluding Iceland, will be $1,060million, or 26-9 per cent, of the total) within which such surpluses and deficits asmay arise among them will be settled by credit up to 60 per cent, of each member&apos;squota and by gold payments for the remaining 40 per cent, of each member&apos;s quota.A working capital of $350-$400 millions will be made available by the economic co-operation Administration.44. A Convention embodying the agreement is now being drafted and isexpected to be ready for signature in a few weeks&apos; time. The Council have decidedthat member countries shall, within a fortnight of the signature of the Convention,notify to the Organisation the measures of liberalisation they have taken to imple-ment the Council Decision of 31st January last that countries must liberalise, assoon as a satisfactory payments agreement is in force, at least 60. per cent, of their imports on private account in each of the three categories, food and feedingstuffs,raw materials and manufactures.45. In accordance with the provisions on non-discrimination the UnitedKingdom will on 17th July extend Open General Licences to Belgium for the products which she has already liberalised to other O.E.E.C. countries. Extensionof these measures to the other two participating countries hitherto excluded by thiscountry on balance of payments grounds (Switzerland and Western Germany)depends in the first case on the acceptance of the agreement by the Swiss Govern-ment and in the second on the satisfactory conclusion of the trade negotiations nowin progress between the United Kingdom and Western Germany.
