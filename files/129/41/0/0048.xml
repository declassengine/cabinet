f* 9W C.7 tJhis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (50) 1984TH SEPTEMBER, 1950COPY NOCABINETCLAIMS ON germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRECOMMENDATIONSI recommend that when I discuss the question of the settlementof claims on Germany with the United States Secretary of State and theFrench Foreign Minister in New York:(i)   I should try to obtain their agreement that the limited andinterim settlement plan which can be contemplated nowshould include some provision for the repayment in foreign exchange of the post-war expenditure of the governments on Germany as well as the repayment of pre-war debts.(ii) I should, nevertheless, be authorised to agree that repaymentin foreign exchange should for the present be confined topre-war debts (leaving open the question of repayment of post-war expenditure in Deutschemarks if these are found to be needed), if I find that it is only on this condition that tripartite agreement can be secured on making a start with the settlement of debts at all.(iii)   I shoiild agree with the position taken by the United StatesGovernment that decisions about the payment of compensationfor war damage and loss to United Nations nationals1 property,rights and interests in Germany should await a final settlement in the nature of a peace treaty.2. Among the subjects which the Tripartite IntergovernmentalStudy Group on Germany has been considering is that of financial andother claims on Germany and Germans, and its recommendations on thissubject are among the matters which I shall have to settle with the UnitedStates Secretary of State and the French Foreign Minister in New York.3. There has been general agreement among the three delegationsthat we should proceed to work out a plan for the settlement of these claimswithin the limitations imposed by German capacity to pay.   The claims in question are of three types:-(a)        Foreign claims in respect of pre-war indebtedness of the reich and other public bodies, and of a great many private bodies,   industrial and commercial.   It is not possible to give precise figures for thisindebtedness, but that part of it which is expressed in foreign currency is

estimated to be the equivalent of some  600-700 million, plus halfas much again for accrued interest.   Of this total, some  230 millionrepresents dollar debts and some  80 million sterling debts, plusinterest in each case.(b)       Claims arising out of the war which were not dealt with inthe Paris Agreement on Reparation of December, 1945.   No estimate ofthe amount of the claims is possible, but for the most part they wouldinvolve payment in German currency and not in foreign exchange.(c) Claims by Governments for the repayment of post-war expenditure on Germany.    Of these the most important are in respectof the expenditure on essential imports for Germany:   United Kingdomexpenditure has been rather more than  200 million, United Statesexpenditure to date, including Marshall Aid, the equivalent of about 1,000 million, and French expenditure very small.   In addition, the external costs of the occupation are regarded as recoverable, and toa recent date totalled United Kingdom,  430 million, United States,$4,000 million (about  1,430 million), and France, Francs 85  uTTiiiii   &apos;(nearly  90 million).   These costs are regarded as having a lowerpriority for repayment than expenditure on imports, and we shall probably have to await a peace settlement before they can be regulated.4. The size of the claims to be considered is so large andGerman capacity to pay relatively so small that any settlementthat can be contemplated now is bound to be a severely limited one.The decision on which of the three categories of claim referred toabove can be included in such a settlement is, therefore, of greatimportance.   Discussion in the Intergovernmental Group has revealeddifferences of opinion on this point.    The main difference is on whetherthe settlement should include some repayment in foreign exchange of thepost-war expenditure as well as of pre-war debts.    There is a furtherdifference on whether a start should be made in meeting in german currency some of the claims arising out of the.war.5.     Priority between pre-war and post-war debtsWith regard to the question of the repayment of the pre-warand post-war claims, the United Kingdom Delegation has taken the line that we should try to secure the repayment of both types of indebtednessin parallel.    The policy accepted hitherto and set out both in the PotsdamAgreement and in the Bizonal Fusion Agreements with the United StatesGovernment, has been that the repayment of the post-war expenditureon essential imports, which alone has made German recoverypossible, should come first, but it was considered to be justifiable tomodify this policy to allow the repayment of pre-war indebtednessto start also, primarily on the ground that early arrangements arenecessary to deal with pre-war debts in order to restore German financialcredit and remove a hindrance to new foreign investment in Germanyand to the financing of German trade by foreign financial centres.An additional reason was that some of the most important United Kingdompre-war creditors, the holders of the Dawes and Young loans and the standstill creditors, either put their money into Germany, or left it there,with the encouragement of His Majesty&apos;s Government and deserve some special support from His Majesty1 s Government.    No proposals have beenmade on the proportion in which pre-war and post-war debtsshould be repaid, but it has been maintained that repayment should bein foreign exchange in both cases.

^r6. On the other hand, the United States Delegation, while fullyadmitting that in principle repayment of the post-war expenditure is a first priority and that the German Federal Government should berequired to acknowledge that this is so, has put forward proposalswhich would have the effect of deferring the repayment of this expenditure in foreign exchange for the time being while permittingthe repayment of  pre-war debts to start.   They maintain that anyrepayment of post-war expenditure must be confined at present toDeutschemarks.   Since all our Deutschemark requirements areat present obtained from the German authorities as occupation costs,this latter suggestion does not present any attractions to us forthe moment.   The French Delegation, which has had very littleexpenditure on imports since the war, accepts the American proposal.7. The United States Delegation support their proposal to defer the meeting of the post-war claims in foreign exchange with the followingarguments: -(a)       Looked at purely from the point of view of its economy,Germany, which is being heavily subsidised through Marshall Aid,has at present no significant capacity to pay its debts.   On the other hand,the need to make a constructive step towards the normalisation ofGermany&apos;s economic and financial relations and to encourage bothGerman foreign trade and new foreign investment in Germany, justifiesthe acceptance of some small risks, both to the development of theGerman economy and to the United States taxpayer which is subsidisingthat economy, which would arise from making a start with the repayment of the pre-war debts.    There is no similar economic justification for taking risks in order to repay the post-war Governmental debtsin foreign exchange.(b)       So long as the United States Government is providingMarshall Aid to Germany, the simultaneous repayment by Germany of dollars to the United State s Government would directly increase theamount of dollar aid needed.    Similarly, the repayment of sterlingdebts to the United Kingdom Government for its post-war expenditure would indirectly affect Germany&apos;s dollar position through the workingsof the European Payments Union, and so might increase the amount of dollar aid needed.   Moreover, the United States Government could not contemplate the repayment of the post-war sterling debts in advanceof the repayment of the post-war dollar debts.&apos;J Since any repayment of tfefefc In foreign currency fflnsi nave -some effect on Germany&apos;s foreign exchange position, and since theUnited States Government is meeting the deficit in its balance of payments and will have to continue to do so, we are bound to pay great attentionto American views on this subject.   I may well find, when I discuss this question with Mr. Acheson, that the United States Government isadamant and that no place can be found at present for the repayment of the post-war debts.    It will then be necessary to consider whetherthe main essential is not to get some repayment of indebtedness started,even if only on the basis proposed by the United States Government.     Sucha start is desirable both in the long-term interests of Germany andfrom the point of view of the United Kingdom and other creditor countries.On the other hand, the arguments in favour of treating the two classes of debt in parallel are very strong.    I do not think that repayment of post-war expenditure need necessarily be on the same scale as that of pre-war debts.    Indeed, I have in mind that, of the total amount that on examinationit is found that Germany can afford to pay in foreign exchange, perhaps75% might go to pre-war debts and 25% to post-war debts.   I do, however,attach importance from the political point of view to getting something

*J *) f*6 ?3 0for the latter, which according to the Agreements have an acknowledgedfirst priority.   The beneficiaries of repayment of post-war debtswould be the taxpayers as a whole, and, indeed, they have a strong case in equity since it is their expenditure that has enabled Germanyto recover.    On the other hand, repayment of the pre-war debts would benefit only a section of the community, although it should be notedthat this section includes not only banks and large concerns but alsoa considerable number of small people who hold bonds of German loans.I feel that if nothing was to be included in the settlement plan for the taxpayer then we should be exposed to serious criticism in Parliament.I would like to be sure that I have the support of my colleagues in proposing to take the line in New York that there should be parallelrepayment in foreign exchange of both types of claim, even though in different proportions;   I should, however, like their agreement toaccept in the last resort the United States proposal if I find that I havedo so   so as part of asettlement covering a wider range of subjects andas the only way of getting any repayment of claims started at all.9.   The Settlement of Claims arising out of the WarThe war claims in which we have an interest are those for compensation for war damage and loss to property, rights and interestsof United Nations nationals in Germany.   Claims of this type are norznallydealt with in a peace treaty which lays down the basis on which compensation should he given.   In view of the delay in the conclusionof a peace treaty and of the desirability of trying to get matters ofthis kind settled in advance in order to regularise the position of united nations property in Germany, the United Kingdom Delegation in theIntergovernmental Group has tried to obtain agreement that a beginning should be made now with some compensation scheme.   since there is no prospect of any German war damage scheme from which united Nations nationals could expect to benefit this would involvespecial action as part of the settlement of claims.   The provision of such compensation and its use for repairing war damage and loss is, infact, an element in the normalisation of economic relations which is oneof the aims of our policy.   We have, however, been confronted by the strongest opposition from the United States Delegation to any actionin this field being taken in advance of a peace treaty.   Their economicargument is that if some settlement of claims is to start soon, withinthe limited capacity which Germany has for paying its debts, it isno time to impose additional burdens which.ought not to be dealt withexcept in a peace treaty.    They support their economic argument by reference to the Paris Agreement on Reparation of December, 1945, andto a recommendation of the Intergovernmental Group on the Safeguarding ofForeign Interests in Germany which met in October, 1948, that decisionswith regard to the nature and amount of compensation for war damage to United Nations nationals&apos; interests in Germany must await a definitive settlement in the nature of a peace treaty.   The formerAgreement contained a statement that subject to review at a peace settlement the signatory Governments agreed that the reparationssettlement should be regarded as covering all their claims and thoseof their nationals against the former German Government and itsagencies arising out of the war.   We have argued that the claims to compensation which we have in mind are traditionally a matter ofrestoration of property rather than of reparation and are implicitly not covered by the Reparation Agreement and by this waiver of claims.The recommendation of the Intergovernmental Group of October, 1948, whichwas accepted by the Governments of the three Occupying Powers and bythe Benelux Governments is, however, quite clear and-4-

make s it impossible to resist the conclusion reached by the americans that the settlement of these claims must await a peace treaty.   The French Delegation has accepted that these claimscannot be pursued further in the present context.10. Although it is impossible to estimate the size of the claims in question there is no doubt that the settlement of them is a matterof importance to the United Kingdom interests concerned, whetherthey are British enterprises with interests in Germany or private individuals with houses and other property there.   Because of theimportance of the matter and of the uncertainty as to when a peace treaty might be possible, the United Kingdom Delegation consideredthat it should not accede to the United States view without Ministerialapproval.   In my view, the legal grounds on which the United states delegation has argued this case are incontrovertible and we must accthat this type of claim cannot be dealt with in advance of a definitivesettlement in the nature of a peace treaty.   I shall be glad to knowwhether my colleagues agree.   If they do, I propose to inform mr. Acheson and M. Schuman in New York that I accept this view.E. B.Foreign Office, S.
