Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 176list July, 1950CABINET&apos;ENQUIRY INTO THE TAXATION OF INCOMEMemorandum ey the Chancellor of the exchequer the basic financial problem of industry under present conditions is the effectof the existing system of direct taxation on the ability of industry to renew fixed assets and finance current business at present prices. The matter is obviously oneof vital importance to our economy not only for industry but also for the wageearner. The maintenance of full employment, of improved standards for wage earners and of progressive industrial equipment depends upon an adequate supplyof capital for industry. The changes in the distribution of income which have resulted from the war and from the policy of taxation since the war have made itclear that industry will have to depend more on its own internal resources, and lesson subscription from the public at any rate for some years. Industry is expe-riencing difficulty in generating within itself the resources necessary to provide for working capital, stocks, and the standard of capital equipment which will berequired to sustain a satisfactory level of wages. At the same time the future expenditure which must be financed by revenue will not permit any large or generalremission of taxation in relation to the national income.2. If my colleagues agree I propose to take steps to set up a Royal commission with the following terms of reference:  To enquire into the present system of taxation of profits and income,including its incidence and effects, with particular reference to the taxation ofbusiness, profits and the taxation of salaries and wages: to consider whether for the purposes of the national economy the present system is the best wayof raising the required revenue from the taxation of profits and income, due regard being paid to the points of view of the taxpayer and of the Exchequer:to consider the present system of personal allowances, reliefs and rates of taxas a means of distributing the tax burden among the individual members ofthe community: and to make recommendations consistent with maintaining the same total yield of the existing duties in relation to the national income.3. This enquiry was foreshadowed in my Budget speech last year, when Iannounced the appointment of the Committee which is now sitting under the Chair-manship of Mr. J. Millard Tucker, K.C., to examine various technical issues arisingout of the computation of net trade profits for income tax and profits tax. I thenstated that after the Tucker Committee had cleared the ground I had in mind toset on foot a comprehensive enquiry into the present taxation structure, includingthe incidence of tax and its effects on risk bearing, though I postulated that I must continue to look to industry, broadly speaking, for the same contribution to thenational revenue as at present.4. In the debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill this year I was pressed by Mr. Eden to make an immediate start with the comprehensive enquiry.I replied that we could not really proceed until the Tucker Committee reported(which will not be until about the end of this year), though preparatory arrange-ments were being made so that we should get off to a good start as soon as that report was received.39046THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT
5. Though I would like to keep the enquiry within as small a compass aspossible, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to cover the whole field of income tax (including surtax) and profits tax, and that it would be better toappoint a Royal Commission to undertake the whole job rather than a series of committees each appointed to deal with a particular subject.6. After reviewing the field to be covered, I am satisfied that it is not possible,for technical reasons, to confine the enquiry to taxation of industry. The company is taxed at the standard rate of income tax on the whole of its profits and it passeson to the shareholder the proportion of the tax attributable to the dividend.Consideration of the company&apos;s tax position automatically leads to considerationof the shareholders position. The company, too, is taxed in precisely the same way as the individual trader (save that it receives no personal reliefs and allowances and is liable to profits tax and not to surtax) and it would not be possible to alter the tax treatment of the company without considering the position of theindividual trader. The individual trader in his turn is taxed in precisely the same way as the worker and it would not be possible to alter the taxation treatment ofthe individual trader without considering the position of the individual worker.Moreover, it is just as important from the point of view of the national economythat the taxation of the worker, namely P.A.Y.E., should also be brought underreview. P.A.Y.E. has been the subject of constant and somewhat critical discussionfor years, and if a Committee were appointed to deal only with industry agitationwould soon develop for a parallel examination of P.A.Y.E. Once P.A.Y.E. were brought under examination it would necessarily involve examination of thedifferentiation and graduation of the tax, for P.A.Y.E. is merely the instrument for collecting from the worker the tax due from him under the general income taxlaw applying to him and other taxpayers alike.7. I propose then to confine the enquiry to income tax and profits tax andto direct it primarily to two broad issues of policy, namely, the taxation of businessenterprises and the taxation of the worker. The terms of reference are wide enoughto cover the whole field of income tax and profits tax, but it would be widening their scope too far to include estate duty or to direct the attention of the Commissionto the taxation of capital. Accordingly the enquiry will be more akin to the workof the Royal Commission of 1920, which dealt solely with income tax, than tothat of the Committee on National Debt and Taxation which reported in November1926 and covered the whole field of taxation, including indirect taxation and capitallevy. The primary purpose of the new Commission will be to see whether thepresent system of taxation of income and profits can be remodelled to the advantageof the national economy in general without substantially impairing the presentrevenue.8. I propose a single Royal Commission rather than a series of Committeespartly because of the difficulty of carving up the field proposed. It is also anessential condition that the same revenue should be raised from the taxation of income as at present. If the Royal Commission wished to recommend a reductionin tax in one direction it could make the loss good by recommending a compen-sating increase elsewhere. The Royal Commission of 1920 worked under such an instruction. Committees covering part only of the field might be prevented from making any recommendation if they were subject to such an instruction, becausethe desirable increase might fall outside their terms of reference. Moreover, thetask of co-ordinating the reports of a number of independent Committees wouldgive rise to serious problems, and there would be pressure for their recommenda-tions to be implemented piecemeal.9. While I recommend a single Royal Commission to cover the whole field,I think it would expedite the work if a number of subordinate Committees were appointed to deal with particular specialised parts of the Commission&apos;^ field ofreview and to report to the Commission. Something similar was done in the caseof the Royal Commission on Population. I have in mind that the committee dealing with the income tax law on superannuation which I have recentlyappointed, also under the Chairmanship of Mr. Tucker, might well be converted into one such Committee, and Committees might also be appointed to deal with.A.Y.E.; the proposals which have been made for a corporation tax; and theincome tax personal allowances. The recommendations of the first TuckerCommittee on the computation of net profits may also have to be integrated withthe findings of the Royal Commission, though it will not be possible to decidedefinitely on this until the report of the Tucker Committee is received.
10. I ask the agreement of my colleagues to the principle of appointing a royal Commission, with the terms of reference suggested in paragraph 2.11. The composition of the Commission will need careful consideration. Forthe present I suggest the appointment, as Chairman, of a Judge, preferably withRevenue or commercial experience, and I am consulting the Lord Chancellor about this. The controversial nature of the subject makes it essential to appoint a strongChairman of acknowledged impartiality. I would also propose the appointmentof Mr. Tucker as a member.For the rest, the Commission must be of manageable size, and must includerepresentation of industry, of organised labour, of the profession of accountants,and of economists.12. If my colleagues agree, I should propose to announce, before the Recess,the decision to recommend the appointment of a Royal Commission, under thechairmanship of a Judge, and with terms of reference to the broad effect that itwould enquire into the present system of taxation of profits and income, withparticular reference to the taxation of business profits and the taxation of salaries and wages, keeping in mind the need for maintaining the same total yield of thepresent duties in relation to the national income.I should also make it clear that the Commission will not deal with capitaltaxes like the Estate Duty, or with a capital levy.13.   I ask for authority to proceed accordingly.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,list July, 1950.
