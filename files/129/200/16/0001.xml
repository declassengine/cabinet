CONFIDENTIAL****** rs THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTi CP(78) 41 COPY no. 7 April 1978CABINETCANDIDATES1 DEPOSITS AT PARLIAMENTARYELECTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentINTRODUCTIONI.        A t the meecing of Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS) on22 March 1978, it was agreed that legislation should be introduced this session to increase the expenses limits for candidates at ParliamentarySections and to provide a power for subsequent increases in the limits for both Parliamentary and Local Government elections to be made by Order.The Committee also considered the question of a possible increase in the deposit made by candidates at Parliamentary elections, but the CommitteeWas split on the merits of such an increase.2- The candidates&apos; deposit at Parliamentary elections has remained^changed at  150 since it was first set in 1918.     The equivalent figure todaywould be over  1 250.    There has been considerable pressure for the levelof the deposit to be raised, but we have so far taken the line that this should first be discussed by the Speakers Conference on Electoral Law.CURRENT PROPOSALS3- The Liberals have proposed that the deposit should be increased to l. 500 except in the case of candidates who have secured nominations^Presenting a certain percentage (they suggest 2 per cent or 5 per cent) of*e relevant electorate;   in the latter case the Liberals suggest that the^Posit might remain as at present or that no deposit at all should beSquired.    Greville Janner was given leave under the Ten Minute RuleP*ocedure on 15 March to introduce a Bill to increase the deposit to  500,but with a similar safeguard for independents and minority parties to that8uggested by the Liberals.A*GUMENTS FOR AN IMMEDIATE INCREASE4&apos;        Those in HS who argued in favoui of an immediate increase in the*ePosit pointed to Party pressure, and even expectation, that the deposit wouldDe increased (the National Executive Committee have approved a proposal foran increase to  500).    They also noted that the National Front and otherdemist parties were at present able, without incurring any real financialP^alty through the loss of deposits, to put up a substantial number of candidates and thus to gain access to television and radio time in order toPubUci8e their views. J
ARGUMENTS AGAINST AN IMMEDIATE INCREASE5. Those members of HS who argued against an immediate increase inthe deposit saw objections in principle to the use of a deposit as a means ofdiscouraging frivolous or publicity seeking candidates.    They consideredthat, especially in present circumstances, a proposal by the Government toincrease the deposit would be open to misrepresentation by the media andby minority political parties.    It was also suggested that an increase in the deposit would not deter those minority parties which have access to largefunds.SPEAKERS CONFERENCE6*        The Government have proposed that election expenditure (includingcandidates&apos; deposits) should be on the agenda for the next speakers conference on Electoral Law.    It has not so fai proved possible to obtain agreement of the Opposition to the proposed terms of reference, buttnis disagreement relates only to the Opposition^ proposal that theConference should also consider the question of the Representation at westminster of England, Wales and Scotland.    The Speakers ConferenceQf 1965-1968 d?d consider the level of the candidates&apos; deposit and related matters. but recommended that there should be no change.conclusion- My own view is that there is a strong case for an increase in the deposit;  but it is normal for a matter such as this to be considered by a speaker s Conference.    Although HS did not think that the Liberal proposalfo* a large number of nominations as an alternative to the deposit practicablea Speaker s Conference could consider other possibilities such as a sliding8cale for the forfeiture of deposits.    Nevertheless, I recognise the strengthof deling in favour of an immediate increase and I therefore seek mvCoUeague 8 views on this.M RHome office APril 1978
