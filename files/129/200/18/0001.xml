QCUMENT IS THE PP.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 4310 April 1978CABINETWINDSCALE INQUIRY:  INSPECTOR&apos; S RECOMMENDATIONSNote by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentI was invited (CM(78) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4) to report to Cabineton the recommendations in paragraph 17.8 of the Inspector&apos;s Report beforethe Special Development Order (SDO) is debated in Parliament. Therecommendations do not *hemselves affect the decision to proceed with theoxide reprocessing plant (THORP).     They are, however, regarded, both inParliament and outside, as &quot;necessary safeguards&quot; for me future.2. During the debate on 22 March several Hon. Members, including theofficial Opposition spokesman, whilst not opposed to proceeding with THORP,asked for a detailed response to the recommendations before the SDO debate,provisionally arranged for 24 April.    I am cure that I must meet this generalwish by making a statement, in terms as positive as possible, early next week.3* There are 15 disparate recommendations.    After interdepartmentalconsultation I conclude that 12 (Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 7-15) can be accepted, andthat a positive, albeit partial, response can be made to another (No. 6).The responses to all these are set out in the Annex.    The remaining two(Nee. 1 and 5), which call for changes in the existing system, require futher consideration, and are discussed below.No. 1 Consideration should be given to charging some independentperson or body with the task of (a) vetting security precautions both at wind scale and during transit of plutoniumfrom wind scale, and (b) reviewing the adequacy of suchprecautions from time to time.There are, I understand, good grounds for accepting thespirit of this recommendation, and of the principle of having security measures checked by people not committed to their design or operation.    But it is necessary toconsider the wider implications of this proposal, which relates specifically to wind scale.    It could lead to similar arrangements for independent examination of security arrangements at other nuclear plants, and of the transfers of nuclear material and indeed of security at non-nuclearestablishments.    There is also bound to be a limitation1COPY NO80
to tr.e degree of public reassurance which can be offered,given the inevitable restrictions on divulging information.These wider implications require further close examination.On thc other hand, we need to be as forthcoming as possiblejI therefore hope that the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Energy, who are jointly responsible for thismatter, will be able to agree to my saying that theGovernment accept the principle of independent reviewcontained in the recommendation, and will examine how best it can be given effect.No. 5 Consideration should be given to the inclusion of somewholly independent person or body with environmentalinterests in the system for advising central governmenton the fixing of radiological protection standards. that person or body should probably be changed from time totime.It is vital that the public should have complete confidence in the soundness of the radiological protection standardson which I and my colleagues base our authorisations forthe discharge of radioactivity into the environment. the inspector plainly thought that the addition of an independentperson or body would help in that connection, notwithstanding the fact that this is specifically a statutory function of theNational Radiological Protection 3oard.    I understand thatthe review of the Board which the Secretary of State for social Services has already put in hand, as recommended bythe Flowers Report, is being extended to cover thisrecommendation.     I suggest that our response should be tothat effect.conclusion invite my colleagues to agree that the Governments response tothe recommendations should be as indicated above and in the Annex. iPropose to find a suitable opportunity for publishing the response before theSDO debate.    I shall of course agree the text with those colleaguesconcerned.P SApartment of the Environment10 April 1978
SIJGGESTED REPLIES TO THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSBritish Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) should devoteeffort to the development of plant for the saferemoval and retention of krypton 85 and, ifdevelopment proves successful, should incorporateit in the proposed plant.BNFL have agreed to design the Thermal OxideReprocessing Plant (THORP) so that a kryptonremoval plant can be incorporated if reasonably practicable, and to pursue research and develop-ment on it vigorously.More permanent arrangements for whole body monitoringof local people should be instituted.    Subject tocertain general principles, the details should beagreed by those directly concerned.    Thev would notbe appropriate to planning conditions.    The author-ising departments should however consider whetherprovision of such facilities should be made acondition for authorisations to discharge.BNFL already have two on-site facilities for monitoringemployees.    They have ordered a third, which will beavailable to the general public, and will discuss itslocation with the appropriate authorities.    If it were necessary, its provision could be made a condition ofthe discharge authorisation fox* THGRF.A single Inspectorate, as recommended by the RoyalCommission, should be responsible for determining and controlling all radioactive discharges.The Government have not yet taken a decision on the unified pollution inspectorate recommended for england and Wales in the 5th Report of the RoyalCommission on Environmental Pollution.    Pending thatdecision, the Radiochemical Inspectorate of myDepartment will, in collaboration with the Ministryof&apos; Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), beresponsible to Ministers for:-(a) taking an overall view of the level of dischargesto be authorised to all. sectors of the environment; and(b) ensuring that the advice of the NationalRadiological Protection Board (NRPB) on thetotal dose to the critical group of thepopulation from all sources is taken into account in framing every authorisation.Ho3 &amp; 4
In Scotland, HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate willdischarge a similar responsibility.    Tho two li-&apos;-ates will work closely together.There should be specific discharge limits for eachsignificant radionuclide.    The onus should be placedclearly on the operator to show that a dischargecannot practicably be avoided before the limits are fixed.The Government accept that in the first place operatormust show that a discharge cannot be avoided.   It isalso our policy that unavoidable discharges must bekept as far below international limits as practicable.Quantitative limits for each significant radionuclidewill continue to be set for liquid wastes, and thepractice will be extended to atmospheric dischargesas announced in Cmnd 6820 (Annex A, para 3).The provisions of the Radioactive Substances Act 1960relating to the powers to hold inquiries into proposesauthorisations to discharge should be re-examinee?..The Government accept this recommendation, and myDepartment have already begun this review.The relevant authorities should carry out moremonitoring of atmospheric discharges.An expert group has been set up to review existingnjonitorinjz and to identify where further monitoringis needed!The Fisheries Radiobioloftical Laboratory (FRL) should publish their annual reports more rapidly in future..be one comprehensive annual survey published of aiXdischarges and at intervals, reports by r-HPB onradiation exposure.The Government announced in Cmnd 6820 (para 27) thatsurveys of discharges v/ould be published annually;and that NRPB v/ould continue to&quot; publish periodicreports on radiation exposure.The delay in publishing FRL reports has been causedby the need to give priority to the deployment of qualified staff on regulatory functions. Improvenefltwill necessitate further recruitment.
3 j. 1 1No.i2^.13.14BNFL p-hould do more. In future, to ensure that safetyprecautions and operating procedure at V/indscaleare sufficient for all eventualities, are strictly observed and are continually rehearsed.BNFL accept the need for strict observance and rehearsalof safety precautions and for continuous review and improvement; all the safety arrangements are subject toinspection by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (Nil).The current review of Nil should examine wnetner theyare sufficiently equipped witn scientific expertiseto check the designs for the proposed plant.The Nil already has substantial scientific expertiseon its staff and through consultants.    The Health and safety Executive will, however, make sure in thecourse of the current review of Nil that they areadequately equipped to assess the design of THORP.It is essential that those who would be required totake action under the V/indscale emergency plan are fully aware of the responsibilities the plan placeson them.Regular exercises take place to give practice to all those responsible for implementing the emergency plan.BNFL will assist the authorities concerned in implementing this recommendation.The local liaison Committee should be reorganised andits functions redefined.The arrangements for local liaison committees will be reviewed as recommended.Fuel flasks should, as far as possible, continue tobe delivered to V;indscale by rail, but this is nota matter appropriate to planning conditions.For the foreseeable future the majority of fuel flaskswill continue to travel to and from V/indscale by railfor most of their journey.    The flasks and vehicleshave to comply with strict safety requirements.
