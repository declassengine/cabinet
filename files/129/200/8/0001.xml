MEN?IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 33 COPY no. 7 March 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE MEASURES IN THE 1978 BUDGETNote by the Central Policy Review staff the picture which emerges from the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s,Paper (CP(78) 30) is alarming.If all the proposals for additional expenditure set out in Table 2Q* the Annex to CP(78) 30 were accepted now, Ministers would have:-a. overspent the contingency reserve for 1978-79 by some 100- 170 million before the financial year had started;b. committed virtually the whole of the contingency reserve for 1979-80.But, in addition to the proposals set out in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper, there will be major claims during 1978-79 for assistance for the^ritish Steel Corporation, British Leyland, British Shipbuilders andoils Royce.    These have not yet been fully costed, but could total well over  500 million.    And in the course of the year there will be genuinelyforeseen contingencies to be provided for as well.4.of:Ministers will be considering this situation against the backgrounda. the Government&apos;s objectives, as set out in the January 1978Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 7049), where it was the aim to produce &quot;a greater degree of stability than in recent years, sothat expenditure programmes can be managed with confidence thatthey will not be subjected to the disruption of sudden cuts&quot;;  and to&quot;keep the planned rate of growth of public expenditure within the prospective growth of national income&quot;;b. the forthcoming North Sea Oil White Paper sets it3 faceagainst any &quot;short-term spending spree&quot;;  and says explicitly that&quot;the present public expenditure plans take account of the first fruitsof North Sea oil&quot;.1
&apos; Given these constraints, Ministers need to decide: -a. how much of the contingency reserve for 1978-79, and for1979-80, they can afford to commit now;b. within that total, which bids have the highest priority for inclusion.THE SIZE OF THE commitment for 1978-79 the Chief Secretary proposes to commit up to half the contingency reserve of  750 million now, leaving half (ie  375 million) iny    To commit as much as this now is very risky.    Claims for industrial^assistance known to be coming forward will be a lot more than  375 million.ere are strong arguments for committing less than the Chief SecretaryproPoses.7.1&quot; For 1979-80, on the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals, the spillover ofto measures into 1979-80, together with an uprating of child benefit0  4 in April 1979 will have already committed more than half the reserve1979-80.    Such a commitment, so far ahead, will almost certainly lear?1 e an inadequate margin.PRIORITIES8.Glven the constraints in 1978-79, there are strong arguments forT L1IUn  ^e e*tra expenditure in that year to the first six items listed incon G ^ 0f ^e Chie* Secretary&apos;s paper, plus a limited addition for energyServation, in line with the North Sea Oil White Paper.9%q . .     decisions for 1979-80 will need to be taken in summer, when the^  lnet comes to consider the Public Expenditure Survey.    This suggests1979 W^erever possible, Ministers should defer decisions that will effectu^m&quot;&quot;^ - including, in particular, decisions on the level of child benefit -^ey consider the results of the Survey as a whole.ne^d     For both 1978-79 and 1979-80, the extent of social security upratingSer ? t0 be looked at very carefully.     The Secretary of State for Socialvjp VlCes and the Minister for Social Security argue that benefits should beHee^ *   ky more than the amount required by statute, partly because of theto have something in hand&quot; if the earnings/price forecasts prove too low,WiU^art*y 0n P0**tical grounds.    If Ministers accept these arguments, they^cre re&quot;^mPt *he contingency reserve still further, and build in a rachet^e lnto the social security programmes.     This will make future publictecou totals more difficult to contain, and will have pre-emptedces from other programmes.7 ***** l97g
