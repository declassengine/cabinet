:UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 39 COPY NO 8029 March 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE BUDGETMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. At our discussion on 9 March (CM(78) 9th Conclusions), the .Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited to bring back to the Cabinetspecific proposals for additional expenditure.    This paper sets out proposals prepared jointly by the Chancellor and myself.2. We have already raised the plans for 1978-79 by  1 billion at 1977survey prices ( 1. 15 billion at current prices), including an extra*40C million for construction and  300 million for child benefit. allowing for shortfall, actual expenditure is likely to grow by at least 4 per cent(and possibly significantly more) between 1977-78 and 1978-79.    That is asubstantial rate of growth, which exceeds the likely growth of the gross domestic product.AMOUNT TO BE ALLOCATED IN 1978-793-        As my earlier paper (CP(78) 30) pointed out, we must keep enough inthe contingency reserve for 1978-79 to cover likely requirements later inthe year, bearing in mind the major uncertainties over the requirements for industrial support.    Our judgment needs to be seen as realistic.    And weshould not close prematurely the option for announcing something more.Perhaps in July.4* My conclusion remains that we must keep at least half of the contingency reserve for 1978-79 intact.    But we can afford to commit up to half of it at this stage:  that is, up to  375 million at 1977 survey prices(all figures in this paper are at 1977 survey prices unless otherwisestated).    This would, however, leave us with only  375 million in thereserve at the beginning of tne financial year, compared with  550 million in April 1977.PROPOSALS BY DEPARTMENTAL ministers* Table 2 in my earlier paper, and the accompanying annex,summarised the proposals for additional expenditure which colleagues tabledahead of our earlier discussion.    One or two of these have since been scaledaown to some extent.    But we cannot accommodate all the outstandingproposals within a total of  375 million.
A SUGGESTED ALLOCATION6. Table 1 sets out a way of allocating the  375 million,7. Already charged to the contingency reserve for 1978-79 are amountstotalling  193 million.    This leaves a balance of up to  182 million. Thereare several claims on this balance which I think we are bound to accept,including cancellation of the planned autumn increase in the school mealscharge ( 62 million in 1978-79) and increased expenditure on educationcapital ( 40 million in 1978-79).8* There is no room on these figures for uprating of child benefit inNovember as well:   a 70p uprating would cost  165 million.    We are alreadyincreasing the rate of child benefit from  1/ 1. 50 to  2. 30 for all childrenthis April.    The Chancellor and I propose that we should announce a secondlarge increase to  4 in April 1979, accompanied by a further doubling of the premium for one-parent families.9. We ought to decide now on November&apos;s uprating of pensions and other social security benefits.     This decision should be taken in relation to other decisions on expenditure and taxation;   and on presentational groundsannounced in the Budget, as will be expected.    A decision has to be made within a month of the Budget in any event.    Announcement of the upratingv&apos;ill help the balance in the Budget Statement between tax and expenditure.10. The Chancellor and I propose that we uprate pensions by 11^ per cent**n line with earnings, as provided in the Statute.    The Secretary of State for social Services proposes that we should allow a margin of at least 1 per centQn top of the forecast of our statutory commitments fcr both pensions andother benefits.    But even a small excess over the statutory requirementWould pre-empt most of the balance remaining within the  375 million total,Without noticeably improving the weekly rates of pension.     It would also involve a heavy additional cost in 1979-80 and subsequent years. TheGovernment has given a high priority to pensioners, and the Secretary ofState for Social Services argued in our last discussion that increases in the health programme, should now have a higher priority.CONCLUSION^*       I invite the Cabinet to approve the proposals outlined above and summarised in Table 1.Trea8ury Chambers29 March 1978
