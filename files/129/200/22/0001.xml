CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION&apos;*    The Chairman&apos;s letter of 7 December 1977   to the Prime Ministercontained our views on a request from the medical and dental professionsthat we should carry out an interim review of their remuneration, and^dicated our intention to make known in our next report the levels of^numeration that would bring doctors and dentists in the National Healthervice into an appropriate relationship with other professional groups at April 1978.   As we explained, we take this unusual step on this occasion111 an effort to secure just treatment for the medical and dental professions,lri the light of the continuing deterioration of their position in the pay structure generally, which strict application of the Government&apos;s currentguidelines   will do nothing to halt: it is also necessary, in our view, in0rder to restore confidence in the effectiveness of the present review system.^ reaching this conclusion, we were influenced by three main considerations:first, the need to reverse the serious decline in morale that has accompanied^he decline in pay and standards of living relative to others in comparableValks of life since 1975; second, the existence of anomalies and associatedlnjustices which have been created in the medical and dental pay structuresthe restraint measures - which, from our experience, we judge to beheater than in almost any other single field; and third, the fact, which thepvernment recognises, that the guidelines on pay do not provide enoughScope both to tackle the anomalies and to provide for a general increaseWftich would prevent further ground from being lost vis-a-vis the rest of theComtnunity.   Moreover, one result of the various measures designed to bringNation under control since 1975 has been that, at the level of incomesearned by the majority of doctors and dentists, purchasing power has been6roded steadily.   Our proposals are not designed to provide a means wherebyActors&apos; and dentists&apos; incomes can be exempted from this process, but onlyensure that they do not fare worse than other professions and occupations.Judgment of fully up-to-date levels of remuneration based on presentvidence are indicated in this report in italics beside levels of payOo*sistent with the Government&apos;s guidelines which, in our view, are alBard, Volume 9^1, No. 35 of 9 January 1978, columns 668-671.ne Attack on Inflation after 31 July 1977&quot; - Cmnd 6882, July 1977.
v^unriucn i imlminimum requirement for implementation from 1 April 1978-   Our detailed recommendations are in Appendix A.2.     This is the fifth time since 1971 that we have carried out our mainreview against a background of general pay restraint, and it is now threeyears since we were last able to bring the remuneration of doctors and dentists into the relationship that we judged appropriate with the pay ofother professional groups.   We are in no doubt about the overriding importance in the national interest of bringing inflation under control,and of the need for general economic measures to deal with the situation.But we have been greatly concerned that the form of the measures as they apply to incomes has been designed to fit a shop floor situation in industry, and has failed to come to grips with the very real problems that have been created at higher levels of remuneration and in other fields -including the one for which we are responsible.   The plain fact is that the pay structure for the medical and dental professions has been seriouslydistorted as a result of the impact of the 1975 and 1976 restraint measuresiand their remuneration has fallen progressively further behind that of theirrecognised counterparts in April 1975-   We described the position in some1detail in our Seventh Report   last year, and we drew attention to theconsequences of failure to restore a rational and orderly pay structure.We urged then that sufficient flexibility should be provided in the measuresthen under consideration for introduction from 1 August 1977 to enable us tomake a start on restoration of order to the structure.   The provisions ofthe current guidelines on pay indeed allow a measure of flexibility within an overall rate of increase in earnings of 10 per cent.   Where appropriate?self-financing productivity schemes can be introduced outside the overalllimit at any time after 31 July 1977, without infringing the overall requirement that a 12 months interval must elapse between pay settlements. Thisillustrates the fact that, once again, the measures are directed primarilyat industrial situations: and, to the extent that use is made of this, provision in improving salaries outside the National Health Service at the levels with which we are concerned here, the pay of doctors and dentistswill inevitably again decline relatively.   The concept of a &quot;self-financi^Sproductivity scheme&quot; is not and cannot be appropriate to the basis of remuneration for a profession whose continuing concern is with the prevent^-011and control of disease and with the care and treatment of patients.Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Seventh Report, 1977Cmnd 6800, May 1977-CONF.Diflf/ja.DENT,AL
confidential the passage of time since i960 has not lessened the importance of theRoyal Commissions aims in recommending the present form of review machinery.Theyare as vital today as they were then: the avoidance of disputes between government and the professions over remuneration; the provision of an assurance to the professions that their remuneration would be settled on ajust1 basis; and the provision of a safeguard for the taxpayer againstReasonable demands by the professions.   But the guidelines do not permitmore than a start to be made on dealing with the worst of the anomaliesthat have been created by the 1976 and 1977 restraint measures: in particular,they do not enable any move to be made towards restoring the position ofthose groups who, as a direct result, have experienced a deterioration intheir earnings relative to other groups which previously had been at comparable^come levels.   We drew attention in our Seventh Report last year to theSu&amp;stantial shortfall in doctors&apos;and dentists&apos; remuneration that alreadye*isted in April 1976 by comparison with our April 1975 judgment.   In theVear to April 19771 the shortfall increased significantly and a further deterioration in their relative position will have taken place by April 1978,ln part because self-financing productivity arrangements have been a featureOfmany outside pay settlements since 51 July 1977 in addition to increasesWlthin the overall limit of 10 per cent.   Some of the increasing shortfallCan also be explained by the fact that, in general, earnings drift in the^medical and dental pay structure is confined to the training grades, whereas^e indications are that it is more extensive outside.   It is the failure0 take account of the need to correct these injustices that, in our view,ls the principal cause for the decline in the morale of the medical and^ntal professions over the last three years.   We have said before - and weePeat now, because the position has undoubtedly worsened - that, if thisecline is not reversed, the consequences for the National Health Service^d for the community as a whole will become increasingly serious.We are aware that doctors and dentists are not the only group affected the injustices that we have outlined: all of the public services at0lnParable levels have been affected in much the same way, but not to theextent, because of the differences of pay structure.   But the communityaojg^ afford to prolong indefinitely a situation in which the rewards of0se whose responsibility it is to provide care for the health of the^ity are left to leg substantially behind rewards in other fields, somewhich may not be as essential to the general needs of the community.accept that it may not be possible for the injustices to be corrected inConfidential
confidentialone step and that the economic situation may require their correction tobe staged.   We note that, in a settlement elsewhere within the public services,recognition of the cumulative shortfall position of the group concerned hasbeen given, together with an assurance by Government that it will be rectifiedwithin a period of two years.   We have given careful consideration to theperiod over which the introduction of up-to-date pay levels for the medical and dental professions should be staged and, in our view, no less favourableconclusion can be defensible in relation to the pay of doctors and dentists.We see the introduction of the rates of pay which we indicate in this report,up-dated as appropriate, at the earliest practicable opportunity, and inany case not later than 1 April 1980, as essential to the maintenance of an effective and efficient National Health Service for the benefit of thecommunity as a whole.   This will necessitate a move at least midway towardsthe re-establishment of the appropriate relationship between the medical and dental professions and other occupations no later than our 1979 review.Unless an assurance is given that this will be done and that the pay ratesthat we judge to be right now will be brought fully up-to-date andimplemented by 1 April 1980, we do not believe that it will be possible tore-establish confidence in the effectiveness of the present review system for settling medical and dental remuneration on a just basis or, indeed,to restore the confidence of the professions in their part in the national health Service.    In these circumstances, an independent Review Body cannotfunction in the way recommended by the Royal Commission in i960 and acceptedby Government.conf.dS5M,dent,al
CHAPTER 2 - THE EVIDENCE5- We have considered written and oral evidence from the Health Departments0* behalf of the Government and from the Review Body Evidence Committee of thefritish Medical Association (the Joint Evidence Committee) and from thefrUish Dental Association on behalf of the medical and dental professions .we have again discussed particular problems with the Secretary of State for social Services and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.We have also received written submissions from the Junior Hospital Doctorsdelation, from the Association of Scientific Technical and Managerial Staffs0* behalf of its junior hospital doctors&apos; section, from the General DentalPetitioners&apos; Association and from individual doctors and dentists.6- The Joint Evidence Committee have told us that the morale of doctors and dentists has never been lower since the introduction of the National health service some 30 years ago: the sense of frustration created by the unfair way^ which the professions felt that they had been treated was now heightened bya growing mood of militancy and disillusionment, which would have seriousSequences for the standards of medical care in the National Health Serviceif it were not remedied.   They drew our attention to the problems that have^isen over the last 30 years in relation to questions of medical and dentalRemuneration.   They had hitherto accepted the constraints of Government incomesNicies, but they indicated that they were no longer prepared to acquiesce inthe current measures which, in their view, discriminated unfairly against doctorsdentists.   They asked us to ensure that the anomalies created by the restraint*easures would be corrected, and that their financial position in relation tothose who had been at comparable levels in April 1975 would be restored beforelt was too late.   They estimated that this would require an overall increaseremuneration in excess of 30 per cent, and they told us that the response tothelr proposal would be a major factor in deciding the quality of the professionalt^ee Review Body Evidence Committee of the British Medical Association representsComnr ntral Committee for Hospital Medical Services, the Hospital Junior Staffsp    e* tne General Medical Services Committee and the Central Committeedoct 0mmunity Medicine.

v*ur*rliven i imlconfidentialmedical services in the National Health Service over the next 10 years. they took the view that, if our recommendations for the current year were to be framedin such a way as to provide an immediate increase within the Government&apos;s currentoverall 10 per cent guideline, they would prefer an across the board increase for each group, without correction of anomalies.   In this event, they asked us to indicate the latest date by which fully up-to-date pay rates shouldbe implemented.   They also asked us to recommend that the up-to-date rates should be used as the basis for calculation of pensions.   They repeatedtheir request that we should make provision for offsetting inflation duringthe coming year: they suggested that this could be done either by recommendinglevels of pay appropriate to the mid-point of the review period or by makingretrospective payments to compensate for inflation during the previous six months&apos;7-   The Joint Evidence Committee reported that there was no certainty that agreement would now be reached on a new contract for hospital consultants asthey had hoped, and they put forward a number of proposals for improving the remuneration of the career grades.   They asked if we would be willing to price a new contract for consultants on an April 1978 basis if agreement were reached on its form before the next review.   They also reported that they hoped to discuss with the Health Departments a new contract for medical assistants,along the lines of the proposals for consultants, and they asked us if we wouldbe willing to price it on a 1 April 1978 basis, assuming that agreement wouldbe reached in parallel with agreement on a new consultant contract. they proposed that the number of increments in the medical assistant scale shouldbe reduced from fourteen to six to reflect the 1975 shortening of theconsultant scale.   They asked us to change the basis of our recommendations for junior hospital doctors and dentists to relate the basic salary scales tothe standard working week of 10 UMTs (40 hours), and to recommend that the ClasSUMT rate should be not less than the standard rate.   They reported that theyhad negotiated an additional week of annual leave for senior house officersand registrars with the Health Departments, with effect from 1 April 1978which, under the current restraint measures, had to be counted againstthe pay limits.   They drew attention to what they saw as additionalresponsibilities of general medical practitioners through the provisionof continuing care in the community, and asked us to recognise this inour recommendations on remuneration.   They also asked us to re-assess the level of payments for the out-of-hours responsibilities of general medical practitioners.   They drew our attention to proposals for a new6
i*vjpinucpi i imlCONFIDENTIALContract for community medicine trainees which had been put forward by^e health Departments, and they asked us to price them.   They al60 referreda study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,wkich showed that, in 1974, the ratio of the earnings of doctors to the averageall workers was lower in the UK than for the average of eleven member countrieswhom information was available.The British Dental Association expressed the view that the sacrifices^ade by the medical and dental professions had been disproportionate, and6u8gested that special steps outside the current guidelines were justified to medical and dental pay on course.   They referred to our December 1977 judgmentofQe shortfall since April 1975 in the earnings position of doctors and dentists,^d estimated that an increase of more than 30 per cent would be required totln8 general dental practitioners&apos; remuneration into line with the rewardsother comparable professional groups at April 1978.   They suggested that6 fusions of dentists who had retired since April 1975 should be increased^h retrospective effect, to compensate for the estimated shortfall in their^^ings before retirement by comparison with comparable income groups. They^0Posed that remuneration which had been lost through the application in 1975Of t,he  8,500 earnings ceiling on all pay increases should be restored. Theyked that our recommendations should establish an up-to-date level of target^ erage net income for general dental practitioners.   They also asked usrecommend that the benefit (or loss) from changes in output within the^andarri hours from year to year should accrue to (or be borne by) dentists.ey referred to the impasse that had arisen within the Dental Rates StudyP over the revision of the fee scale for 1977-78 as a result of disagreement07er tucae principle of retrospective correction of expense forecasts, and askedrecommend that the Dental Rates Study Group should abandon the use ofospective correction.   They suggested that the link between the salaryficaleof dental officers in the community health services (and betweenhe R^    cale of salaried health centre dental practitioners) and the scaleassistant dental surgeons should be at least two increments higher, and0posed that in future the pay of area dental officers should be adjustedy ref*Terence to the pay of community medicine specialists instead of, ast0 administrative dental officers.   They also provided us with statistical^ information on the trends in dental care, treatment costs, manpower and^ents in dental earnings and fees in Australia, Canada, New Zealand^ the USA.
9.   The Health Departments did not make specific proposals for thelevel of increase justified now in the remuneration of doctors and dentists.   They expressed reservations about the reliability of comparisonsof movements in pay based on New Earnings Survey data, and suggested thatthe estimates of the shortfall in doctors and dentists&apos; remuneration madein our Seventh Report and in the Chairman&apos;s 7 December 1977 letter to thePrime Minister were too large.   They drew our attention to the Government&apos;sguidelines on pay increases, and referred to the effect of policy measures in the last year to maintain living standards through reductions in incometax and the improvement of child benefits.   They explained that, so far asthe Governments guidelines were concerned, it was open to us to recommenddifferent levels of increase for different parts of the professions, providedthat the overall increase for all doctors and dentists was within the overalllimit, and that it might be necessary to tackle the anomalies that have been created in the last two years on a phased basis, or to leave some of them forconsideration in a future year.    It was their preference that we should leave to the Government the timetable for the implementation of the fully up-to-datepay rates that we had said we would make known to the Prime Minister. they asked us to make a move towards the restoration of a sensible differentialbetween the consultant&apos;s scale and the earnings of junior hospital doctors and dentists, and asked that we should consolidate into the net remuneration of general medical and general dental practitioners the cash supplements thatwe recommended in April 1976 and in April 1977*   They explained that the restraint measures required improvements in conditions of service to be counts ^against the pay limit, but that provision for the reimbursement of expenses coUbe kept in line with the underlying movements in costs, and that expenses whichpreviously been reimbursed through fees and allowances could be made direcreimbursable without having to count against the pay limit.   They asked us tomake known our view both on the principle of making retrospective adjustment ^to correct for over-estimates or under-estimates of general dental practitiOIierexpenses and output made by the Dental Rates Study Group, and on the methods *present used.   They asked us to recommend a &quot;sessional fee&apos; for dentists whoprovide emergency dental services organised by health authorities.   They a^s0asked us to make recommendations related to new contract arrangementsfor community medicine trainees which had been recently agreed with the profession.   They provided us with statistics on manpower, workloadand detailed payments to doctors and dentists in the year to 31 March 1977-8comrfBfflflPBNT,AL
CHAPTER 3 - OUR GENERAL CONCLUSIONS10-   We now describe the general conclusions that we have reached in thelight of the evidence submitted to us-   We have given full weight to theview of the professions that their remuneration ought to be brought fullyup-to-date with effect from 1 April 1978.   Equally, we have had full regardto the importance that the Government attaches to limiting the general level of pay settlements to within 10 per cent overall in the common interest of reducing inflation.   Since we share the view of the RoyalCommission that it would be wrong for doctors and dentists to be singledout and used to give a lead in the community in matters of remuneration ,we have sought information from the Health Departments on the pattern of major settlements at all levels of income since the introduction of thecurrent measures.   This information shows that, in a very small number ofsettlements, groups of workers - mainly manual - have secured increases inexcess of an overall 10 per cent, but that the great majority of settlements -those covering 95 per cent of some 3^ million employees who had settledhy mid-March - have been within the guidelines.   In particular, no settlementthat covers employees in the public sector has been outside the guidelines,^d settlements in the NHS itself so far have been at the overall level of10 per cent.   In all cases where cash supplements have been consolidatedinto basic pay, or where improvements have been made in conditions of servicesuch as holiday entitlement, the cost has been included in the overall cost0f the settlement.    In addition, self-financing productivity schemescovering some 650,000 workers have been introduced, of which just under one-half are in the public sector.   We have already made plain that we seext as essential for a substantial move to be made towards bringing the pay0f the medical and dental professions into an appropriate relationship withthat of other professional groups in 1979-   In the circumstances, we are inno doubt that there is a clear case now for increases in remuneration up tothe limit of the Government&apos;s guidelines on pay, for the following reasons:first, to remove at least some of the anomalies that permeate the medical^d dental structure; second, to minimise the substantial shortfall betweendoctors1 and dentists earnings and the earnings of other professional0 Qups by comparison with our April 1975 judgment; and third, to offset at.Report of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration^7-GO - Cmnd 939, February i960 (paragraph 28).\confirmation -JMNTIAI-
i*ur*riucra i imlCQNPJDKNTJALleast some of the further rise in the cost of living over the last twelvemonths which has added to the decline in the professions1 standards ofliving since April 1975-   We discuss each below.11. We have already made known (in the Chairman&apos;s letter of 7 December 1977to the Prime Minister) our intention to make a start on the restoration of order to the pay structure and the elimination of injustices within thatstructure.    Unlike the 1976 and 1977 measures, the current guidelines donot provide fixed limits on what individuals may receive, but are applicableon an overall basis.   The professions have indicated that, in recommendation5that reflect the guidelines, they would prefer us to treat each main group of doctors and dentists separately as a group, each with its own entitlement to a 10 per cent overall increase.   We have concluded, however, that itwould not be right to do so.   Three of the four main groups - consultants,general medical practitioners and general dental practitioners - havefared much worse than the fourth - junior hospital doctors and dentists -in relation to comparable income groups since April 1975 , and we regard it as important to take account of the individual position of each group,and thus to take a positive step towards fulfilment of the general aim of restoring order to the pay structure as soon as possible.12. Our recommendations provide for the correction of the structural distocreated by the application of the  8,500 earnings ceiling in 1976, for the consolidation of the 1976 and 1977 cash supplements into salary and fee sea and for the restoration of the established systems of remuneration forgeneral medical and general dental practitioners.   On this occasion, too,we have been able to change the basis of remuneration for the hospitaltraining grades, and to relate the salary scales to the standard working weof 10 UMTs (40 hours), as we have been asked by the professions and the health Departments to do.   We have also restructured the medical assistantand assistant dental surgeon scale at their request.   In addition, we havetaken account of the cost of the improvements in conditions of service forjunior hospital doctors and dentists and for community doctors and dentigtswhich have been agreed between the professions and the Health departments for introduction with effect from 1 April 1978.   We regard the implements13-of the second stage of the April 1975 increase in salaries above  13i000 ayear as a separate issue.   The further deferment of those increases wasidThe pay of the hospital intermediate career grades, of community doctorsdentists, and of ophthalmic medical practitioners move in line with thegroup of hospital doctors and dentists at comparable levels.10
CONFIDEIMTIALairect result of the impending introduction of the restraint measures in July1W5, and not of the form of those measures.   We see no justification for thecontinued withholding of part of increases that were accepted by GovernmentSome three years ago, and we are in no doubt that they ought to be implementedindependently of the restraint measures.13.   In our Seventh Report, we estimated that the overall earnings for theMedical and dental professions at April 1976 (after taking into account the^commendations in the Sixth Report) were on average some 10 per cent behindcomparable income groups, by comparison with the revised estimate of thePosition at April 1975-   Since then, we have assessed the shortfall positionln the light of information from the April 1977 New Earnings Survey. we estimate that, on a total earnings basis   for the medical and dentalProfessions as a whole (after taking into account our recommendations in the seventh Report), the shortfall increased by some 5 per cent between April 1976and April 1977, and amounted to over 15 per cent at April 1977.   It rangedfrom near-parity on average for junior hospital doctors and dentists as aSroup, to nearly 20 per cent for consultants on the scale maximum, and on average for general medical practitioners and genera1, dental practitioners:0ur estimate of the detailed position is in Appendix B.The Health Departments have drawn attention to limitations on the accuracy of the New Earnings Survey data as an indicator of the level of pay supplements which make comparisons over short periods unreliable; intheir view, such a comparison needs to be made over at least five years toProvide a reliable picture.   They have also referred to the fact that changeslri the national pay structure and in the medical and dental pay structurescan distort comparisons, and have drawn our attention to a seeming drift111 the earnings of doctors between April 1976 and April 1977 and to a seeminglDlProvement in them relative to the earnings of all men between April 1973^d April 1977 on the basis of the figures for &quot;medical practitioners1 inthe New Earnings Survey.   Furthermore, they have argued that movements of^Parable income groups ought to be compared on the basis of an August-AugustP^v* year since this has been the annual pattern for settlements at a common^evel of increase since 1975-15.    A 1&apos;   As we have said before , we are aware that the information in the Newrnings Survey has limitations for our purposes: for example, it is restricted18e - -Cmr!l*eW on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Fifth Report, 1975 -^d 6032, April 1975 (paragraph 9).
to the employed population only; it covers only one in every one hundredemployees, so that the numbers in the sample at the highest salary levelsare small; and the value of superannuation arrangements and of other benefitsthat are relevant to total remuneration i3 not reflected.    It also excludesearnings due at the survey date from settlements that have been reachedsubsequent to it and are then back-dated.   Experience suggests that the overall effect of this factor is not generally significant, particularlyin the longer term, but on the occasions when the difference has beensignificant, we have made adjustments to reflect known major settlementsto ensure that we have as accurate a picture as possible. Furthermore,salaried doctors and dentists are included in the population samples forthe survey: although the effect of movements in their earnings on thecomparisons is also not significant, particularly in the longer term, we make a small adjustment based on the data for 1 medical practitioners&apos; to exclude as far as possible the effect of movements in their earnings fromthe earnings with which we make our comparisons.   However, we do not use the earnings of these &apos;medical practitioners&apos; as the basis for our comparisonsibecause they relate to a very small number of individuals only - 230 orjust under one per cent of the 24,000 full-time hospital and communitydoctors but less than one half per cent of a total of 63,000 doctors in theNational Health Service - and they do not include any part-time hospital and community doctors or any general medical practitioners, who are regardedas self-employed, and who total 24,000, which is a very substantial proportion of the total number within our terms of reference. Moreover,the NHS doctors&apos; earnings that are reflected in the New Earnings Surveyinvariably exclude pay increases that are due to them, but that have notbeen paid at the time when the survey is carried out, because the April-Apr*timing of our reviews precludes the implementation of our recommendationsuntil after the survey information has been collected.   We estimate thatlatter factor accounts almost wholly for the element of seeming drift indoctors&apos; earnings between April 1976 and April 1977, and of seeming relativeimprovement in them between April 1973 and April 1977 as shown by the fi^ ^for &apos;medical practitioners&apos; to which the Health Departments drew our attest116.   Changes in the general structure of pay are, of course, reflected u1the information in the New Earnings Survey.   But the effect of changes fr0lDregrading, or scale restructuring, or for other reasons, is unlikely to be12c
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALSlgnificant, except in the longer terra.   On the other hand, gradingchanges which reflect changes in numbers in different grades are notreflected in the earnings figures used for doctors and dentists in ourcomparisons which are based on the manpower structure at the time whenremuneration was last brought up-to-date in relation to other professionalSroups.   However, examination shows that average earnings of hospital doctors^nd dentists have not been affected to any significant extent by structuralchanges over the period since 1975 (or since 1972).   In addition, the HealthApartments have told us that earnings have again been examined for anydrift as a result of the payment of increments within scales: as in 1976 and1977, this has been found to be negligible.   In making our comparisons, weexclude from our assessment of consultants earnings additional remunerationfrom fees for lectures, domiciliary and exceptional consultations, family planning work, and other official work: we are not provided with detailed^formation on the extent of the payments involved, but we understand thatthey are small.   We also exclude income from contraceptive services from ourAssessment of general medical practitioners&apos; remuneration, since the extension0^ these services to patients in social need in 197^ involved new and extraWQrk and we saw it as right to treat it separately from intended average netremuneration, at least in the early stages.   Even if reliable and up-to-date^-figures were available for private practice earnings of doctors and dentists,we would not regard it as appropriate to include these in total earnings, siniceare concerned with the remuneration for NHS work: past figures show that,e*cept for part-time consultants, the amount is in any case relatively small.17*   We have always recognised that the information in the New Earnings Surveycannot be used to provide an exact measurement of the difference in movements0^ doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; earnings from those at the same income levels0utside.   Clearly, the longer the period over which comparisons are made001 a baseline, the smaller will  be the effect of errors arising fromCertainties about the information, particularly on the timing of settlementsandi as a cross check in the process of making our judgments, we have looked^ck to 1972 and earlier (to i960).   Nevertheless, as we have said before,Pril 1975 ^s the baseline for our judgments since that was the lastasion on which the remuneration of the medical and dental professionsWas v.Drought fully up-to-date in relation to pay in other occupations.

Our 1975 recommendations, like all our recommendations both before and since, were designed to take effect from 1 April and, if we were to havebased our comparison then on an August-August pay year basis, it would havemeant that we should have had to take account at some stage in our con-:;idcrations of the expected level of settlements between April and August 1975*As we made clear in our 1971 Report , when we decided to carry out our reviewsat more frequent intervals than had been the practice previously, we con-sidered that it would be wrong to anticipate inflation since to do so would contribute to further inflation, and our judgments of levels of pay have therefore been designed to be right at the time from which they are put intoeffect.   While the general level of pay increases since August 1975 hasreflected settlements on an August-August pay year basis, in line with the timing of the three successive rounds of restraint measures, the extent towhich this concept of a &apos;pay year&apos; can legitimately be superimposed on asystem of annual reviews effective from 1 April each year is open to question&apos;particularly when a recent (1975) review resulted in a deliberate adjustment in the level of relativities.   But it is our function to assess the relative position of doctors and dentists in the pay structure generally at the time from which our recommendations take effect - that is, at 1 April - and wetherefore see it as right to make our comparisons of movements in earningson an April-April basis, bearing in mind the need for some adjustment. Aga111&apos;we emphasise that we share the view of the Royal Commission   that it would &amp;ewrong for doctors and dentists to occupy a fixed position in the general V9^hierarchy, or for their pay to be decided on the basis of some automaticformula.   Other important factors are relevant: changes in the cost of livi3^1the quality and quantity of recruitment to all professions, the need toretain highly qualified men and women in the service of the community, and changes in workload and responsibilities or in the working environment.We have looked again at all these factors in making our assessment of up-t0date pay levels.19&apos;   We noted last year^ that, like others in the community at comparableincome levels, doctors and dentists had suffered a fall in their standards^Report of the Review Body on doctors and dentists Remuneration, 1971 &apos;Cmnd 4825, December 1971 (paragraph 19).report of the Royal Commission on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration1957-60 - Cmnd 959, February i960 (paragraphs 424 and 425).Review Body on doctors and DentisCmnd 6800, May 1977 (paragraph 2).^   Review Body on doctors and dentists Remuneration, Seventh Report, 1^7714CONFIDENTIALf*r\ ki ci nckiri a 1
coNfidentialof living as a result of three main factors - the effects of inflationover the period 1975-1977, the redistribution of income brought about bythe form of the restraint measures, and taxation at the higher levels.Since our last report, additional tax relief has been provided as part ofthe general measures to control inflation and to halt the fall in living standards.   We now estimate that, between April 1975 and April 1977, the living standards   of a general medical practitioner or general dentalpractitioner, or of a consultant with a few year6 seniority, married with two children under 11 years old, fell be some 18-19 per cent (Appendix C): thisis slightly less than the estimate of the position that we made a year ago.The fall in living standards of junior hospital doctors and dentists(taking into account average income from extra duty allowances and Class A/Bsupplements) ranged from about 6 per cent for new entrant house officers to about 9 per cent for senior registrars on the scale maximum.   By comparison,the fall in the living standards of the average wage and salary earner wasiess than 5 per cent.   Over the past year, the cost of living as measuredhy the retail price index rose by 9-5 per cent5 and average earnings by9.4 per cent^; the annual rates of increase from 1 August 1977 are 6.5Per cent and 12.0 per cent^ respectively.    Because of the timing of theintroduction of the restraint measures and the greater extent of earningsdrift elsewhere in the community, the fall in the living standards in termsof the real disposable income of doctors and dentists (other than those in hospital training grades) has been greater than for many others in comparablewalks of life, and will continue to compare unfavourably until action istaken to restore them to the position in the pay hierarchy that recognisestheir current value to the community.20-   We have considered the Joint Evidence Committee&apos;s proposal that provision to offset inflation during the coming year should be introduced,either by recommending levels of pay appropriate to the mid-point of the reviewPeriod or through retrospective payments in respect of the current year equal1As measured by income including family allowances after tax, at constant prices.Single.&quot;^elve months to February 1978.4&quot;^elve months to January 1978 (New Series covering whole economy).5figures of the underlying trend in average earnings may be less reliablethan in previous years because of delay in reaching settlements due in*he 1^^ six months of 1977 and the effect of subsequent bunching on8ettlements and of back-payments.
coNrfiSa4fltfNT,ALto half of the increases in the recommended levels of pay for the reviewperiod.   The first proposal would involve a return to the practice of our predecessors, which we discarded as inappropriate in 1971, when we decidedto carry out reviews at annual intervals instead of every two to three yearsias had been the previous practice.   As we said in 1975i when this proposal was last put forward^, our view that it would be wrong to provide for inflat*onin advance remains unchanged, as to do so would itself be inflationary. nor do we consider that retrospection of the kind proposed is justified: our judgi&quot;of levels of pay are designed to be right at the time from which they are Putinto effect.   We agree with the view expressed by the Royal Commission in 19^that retrospective payments are not appropriate in principle for doctors and dentists : for the same reasons, we do not consider as justified either theproposal from the British Dental Association that the pensions of dentistswho have retired since April 1976 should be increased, since this would implyretrospective adjustment of the superannuable earnings on which their pensionwere based, or the proposal from the Joint Evidence Committee that thosesenior hospital medical and dental officers who were excluded from a 1973review, but who were regraded in a 1975 review, should now be paid corapensain respect of the notional los6 of earnings in the years between the tworeviews.   We have considered the Joint Evidence Committee&apos;6 request to usto recommend that the pensions of those who retire after 1 April 197^ shouldbe calculated on the basis of the up-to-date levels of pay which we makeknown in this report, in the same way as was done in 1975 in relation to increases which took salaries over  13,000 and were staged, both in this field and in some other parts of the public services.   a6 in 1975i z^eproblem will inevitably extend to a much wider field than doctors and dentists in the National Health Service, and we see this as a matter forGovernment to consider on that basis.    But we draw attention to the life&quot;long implications of retirement on artifically restricted salary levelswhich will not necessarily be balanced in the years ahead by the undoubtedadvantage of an inflation-proofed pension.1Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Fifth Report, 1975Cmnd 6032, April 1975 (paragraph 17).report of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration1957-1960, Cmnd 939, February i960 (paragraph 395).16
CONFIDENTIALP1 CONFIDENTIALCl-   We drew attention last year to the need to consider the problems created by the serious imbalance in the hospital staffing structure.   The health departments have told u6 that the joint view of the professions and themselves18 that service needs should be met primarily by doctors in career posts,and that the number of training posts should be decided by future careeropportunities.   They recognise that the hospital service depends heavily atPresent on doctors in training, a substantial proportion of whom come from overseas, but this has been because the rate in the growth of demand has notbeen matched until recently by expanded output from the medical schools.They expect that the increasing number of medical graduates will eventuallyenable the hospital service to be staffed mainly by British-born doctors,^d with a higher proportion in the career grades than at present. they recognise that restoration of balance in the hospital staffing structureWlH require changes in the organisation of medical work in the hospital8ervice.   The expansion of the medical schools has given rise to a certainamount of difficulty in relation to the provision of an adequate number of^-registration house officer training posts to meet the increasing numberQf medical graduates; this problem has now been considered by a working groupComposed of representatives of the Health Departments, the universities and^he health authorities, and targets have been set for the number of postsrequired in each region over the next five years to take account of the expected output of medical graduates and to provide a small margin in addition0 give a measure of flexibility and choice.   There are already indications that the degree of dependence on overseas doctors in staffing the hospital8ervice is beginning to decline, because the number who come to this country^or training is falling; the number of temporarily registered doctors reached a Peak in 1975, and since then the trend has been downwards.   This change11 trend accentuates the need to create more career posts to meet servicete(lnirements.^*   The professions have confirmed that it continues to be much moredif f iA1cult for doctors who want to do so to practise in Canada and in theoecause of restrictions and because of the increasing number of theirmedical graduates.   However, there has been no sign of change yet*n tVi . .^    ne net outflow of fully registered and provisionally registered^lted Kingdom and Irish-born doctors which, in 1977i continued at arounde higher level that was reached in 197 4 and has been maintained since.number of British-born doctors who, when leaving the National HealthervirACe, have expressed their intention to emigrate increased last year as the highest total for at least seven years - surpassing the previous

World demand for doctors in certain specialties - forexample, anaesthetics, radiology and pathology - remains high and could haveconsequences for the National Health Service-   We 6hall continue to keepthe situation under review.23*   The output from the medical schools has been growing steadily sincethe 1968 expansion.   The proportion of women graduates has risen over thatperiod and reflects the increasing percentage of women students admitted.Since 1974, the output of men graduates has remained virtually unchanged,and women graduates have accounted for the growth in total output. this situation is likely to continue at least until 1980.   At present, nearly one in three newly qualified doctors i6 a woman, and the proportion ofwomen may rise further in future.   In considering the future structure of medical services, it will be important to provide adequate career oppor-tunities in the National Health Service for the increasing number of womendoctors who want to practise, but some of whom will have domestic and family commitments which may limit the degree of service that they can giveat a particular stage of a career.24.   The fully up-to-date levels of remuneration at 1 April 1978, which weindicate in italics in Chapters 4-7 side-by-side with our current recom-mendations at that date, represent our judgment of what is required tobring the remuneration of the medical and dental professions into a properrelationship with the rewards in other occupations at 1 April 19781 taking account of all the relevant factors.   We emphasise the inherent importance ^of achieving those rates of pay, brought further up-to-date at least annnot later than 1 April I98O.   Meanwhile, we put forward recommendations f0implementation with immediate effect at 1 April 1978, that represent an overall increase in remuneration of 10 per cent.   We have distributed thetotal amount available within the guidelines in a way that reflects the j1 cflbindividual differences between the current rates of pay (including theeac^1977 cash supplements) and those that we regard as fully up-to-date for t1 a - ffe**remain group .   Before considering the increases in basic pay for the on1See paragraph 10.18
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALeroups, we have taken account of the cost of the correction of thoseanomalies within each group that we consider must be dealt with now, andalso the cost of the introduction of improvements in conditions of servicew*ich have already been agreed.   Thus each individual group will have borneth* cost of correcting anomalies within that group and of improving its0V* conditions of service: at the same time, a step will have been taken towards restoring order to the pay structure.   On the occasion of ourre*iew next year, we intend to look again at the levels of pay that we have indicated as being fully up-to-date in our judgment at the present time,and to re-assess them at that time.   We shall again examine the shortfallPosition since April 1975 relative to comparable income groups at that time.Meanwhile, we draw attention to the fact that, on the evidence that isdoming available on the pattern of increases generally since 31 July 1977,* further relative falling back is inevitable: the most recent assessment0f the position made in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin of March 1978ie that, after allowing for &quot;the changing composition of the labour force,Productivity schemes, job mobility and other wage drift, earnings seem likely to rise by 13 per cent or more in the current wage round&quot; .Cov^er recent forecasts of the increase in earnings over the period broadlyered by the current guidelines include:^he National Institute of Economic and Social Research - National InstituteEconomic Review, Number 83 (February 1978): 15 per cent.London Business School Centre for Economic Forecasting - Economic Outlook1977-1981, Volume 2, Number 5 (February 1978): around 15 per cent.Phillips and Drew- Economic Forecasts (March 1978;: about 15 per cent19
CONFfigWijaENT,ALCHAPTER k - HOSPITAL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS25.   The total number of hospital doctors in England and Wales increased by.8 per cent to 32,221 in 1977 : this is in line with the increase in 1976,but rather less than in each of the two previous years.   The increase in overseaborn doctors was again less than the increase in UK and Irish-born doctors, ^the proportion declined marginally from 3^-6 per cent in 1976 to 33-7 Per centin 1977.   The number of medical consultants increased by 122 or 1.0 per cent to 12,00**: this is a significantly smaller increase than in any of theprevious five years - the average over this period was 3-6 per cent - andis regarded as due mainly to the financial constraints imposed on employingauthorities, but also in some part to the reluctance of some doctors toaccept appointments that would involve a reduction in their income (forexample, senior registrars on promotion to consultant, in present circumstance5The proportion of overseas-born consultants increased to l*f.9 per cent lastyear from Ik.7 per cent the previous year, but the proportion of overseas-born junior hospital doctors decreased to k^.5 per cent from k7 .d per cent the previous year.   The number of temporarily registered doctors in thehospital service fell by 8.6 per cent in 1977 and is now 10.6 per cent of all medical staff.   The average age on appointment as a medicalconsultant remained unchanged at 37^ years.   The number of vacant medicalconsultant posts in England and Wales increased substantially from 686to 819 in 1977.   Although the proportion of vacant posts that wereadvertised remained virtually unchanged in 1977 and recruitment to advertisposts improved slightly, the number unfilled for more than a year (either because they had not been advertised or because they had not been filled asa result) increased from 2?8 to 356.   The balance of the posts   that were nooccupied by either a full-time or a part-time locum increased from 96 to106, or 1.0 per cent of all medical consultant posts.   At present, difficU^is being experienced in filling vacancies in anaesthetics, geriatrics,mental illness and radiology (as well as in community medicine), and thereis a surplus of candidates for general medicine, general surgery, gynaecologyfigures in this paragraph relate to numbers in post at end-September in theyear indicated.In whole-time equivalent terms.20
and obstetrics and paediatrics.   As part of the proposals under consideration for a new consultant contract, the Health Departments have suggested thatconsultant posts which have been vacant for at least a year and have beenadvertised twice without attracting suitable applications should be re-advertised offering a starting salary at the scale maximum (subject to approvalfrom the Department).   The number of dental consultants increased from 446 inA976 to 468 in 1977, or by 4.9 per cent; the total number of hospital dentistsxncreased by 3*4 per cent to 1,164 in 1977, compared with 1.5 per cent in 1976.^e latest figures for hospital workload in Great Britain relate to 1976, andxn that year the number of in-patients increased by 5*0 per cent and the numberQf out-patients by 1.1 per cent.   These numbers reflect the levels in the yearsPrior to 1975, which was the year in which the numbers of patients fell as a^sult of industrial action by some consultants over the issue of pay beds and byeome junior hospital doctors over the introduction of their new contract.^*   We referred in our Seventh Report&quot;&apos;&quot; last year to discussions which had^een re-opened between the professions and the Health Departments on a newcontract for consultants, which we hoped then could be brought to an earlydelusion, as 5 years had already elapsed since consideration of a new^orm of contract first began.   We understand that a substantial measureofagreement had been reached between the professions and the Healthapartments by mid-November 1977, and that it had been the aim to includenew contract in the present review.   In the event, this did notP^ove to be possible, and we have been asked to base our recommendations on fy,une existing contract.   However, the professions have also asked ifWould be prepared to price a new contract on the lines under discussion,Etaan extension of the present review, if agreement were to be reached within* teasonable period.uWe have given careful consideration to the professions&apos; request, but we66 diffio^t^gg about it in present circumstances.   We have carried outreview on the basis of the existing &apos;open&apos; contract arrangementsQf a salary scale that, in principle, is intended to recognise all theee and responsibilities of consultants other than those that attract^^ent of a separate fee - for example, for domiciliary consultations.CmnHW body on doctors&apos; and dentists Remuneration, Seventh Report, 1977^d 0800, May 1977 (paragraph 23).21
C0NrtSBHfiWiNT,ALUnder the proposed &quot;closed1 contract arrangements, a full-time consultantsbasic commitment would be remunerated by a basic salary, and additional commitments would attract additional payment at the equivalent rate tothe basic salary.   Other duties and responsibilities would attract newallowances.    On this basis, consultants with the heavier duties and responsibilities would receive higher remuneration, and those with the lessheavy would receive lower remuneration than under the present contractarrangements, and the present single salary scale.   The differences in remuneration of full-time consultants could be substantial.    But, sinceprotection of an individual consultants position is envisaged throughprovision of an option to retain their present contracts, and we have nomeans of knowing at this stage how many would opt to do so, it is inevitable that the introduction of a new contract on these lines would involve anof additional cost.   The dilemma is clear, and we do not see how it would be practicable for us to consider a change of the significance contemplated othethan when there is scope to accommodate the additional cost.   We would in anycase need to be provided with information on the likely pattern of contractedduties under the new arrangements and on the number of consultants expectedto continue on the present contract.28.   Steps have been taken to provide us with detailed information onthe existing pattern of consultants work and responsibilities that wewould need before we could consider the remuneration for a new contractthat specified an individual consultant&apos;s working commitment.   The onlyinformation available to us hitherto has been limited to a provisional andpartial analysis of a survey which had been carried out in 1974 in connectswith earlier discussions on a new consultant contract (but which had notbeen validated) and the outcome of a survey conducted in 1971 by the RegiHospital Consultants and Specialists Association&quot;1&quot;.   Only the main finding5from each survey were available, and neither of them provided sufficientlydetailed or up-to-date information on the pattern of work and responsibility^1 ^of consultants which would have enabled us to cost recommendations relateda new contract on the lines of the outline proposals then under discussi00between the professions and the Health Departments.   The Office ofovidEconomics therefore carried out a survey on our behalf in July 1977 to P 1the information that would be needed to enable such a contract to be prlalso, at the request of the parties represented on the special Joint Wor^&quot;^Subsequently the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association.22ot&amp;1
Group, to assist them in their discussions of the form of the contract. Weare grateful to all those who co-operated in our survey: although (forVftrious roasonn beyond our control) the response was not as high as we had hoped at the outset, we are satisfied that the results provide a representative^cture of consultants present working commitments.   The detailed results0*&quot; the survey are in Appendix D.29.It is clear from these results that the majority of consultants work^0r*ger weekly hours than is generally regarded as the normal working week in the community as a whole, and that a significant minority work unusuallyng hours.   For example, full-time consultants reported spending on average^ hours a week over a range of duties, and one in five a total of 56 hours&quot;lore,   it is of course not uncommon in other walks of life for people at0DlParable levels of responsibility to work long hours, and to go through^eriods of working unusually long hours.   But, in the main, they can plan^head^dand tailor their life pattern to the incidence of this demand. Theon consultants&apos; time cannot be planned and foreseen in the same way,emergencies will always be the overriding unknown factor.    Our assessmentOfne fully up-to-date levels of remuneration is designed to recognise thisNation, but we nevertheless consider that the length of the hours thatSomeconsultants now work regularly cannot be in the best interests of the^dard of care and efficiency in the National Health Service generally.30, wwe understand that discussions between the Health Departments and thePfofesaions on the working of the new contract arrangements for junior hospitalrs and dentists have resulted in a number of further changes. Indeed,^      rangements that were put to us at the outset were changed after our^ Emendations had been published, and the changes resulted immediately inAfferent pattern and number of contracted hours from the pattern that hadenvisaged by the Health Departments and the professions, and that hadvided the basis of our original calculations.   The definition of eligibilityClaPh  .        ^ UMTs has now been qualified to include a requirement to be, ysicallypresent, either working or standing-by at the hospital, or availablef it^     rk within a specified period of time.   The on-call requirement attached^-ass 3 UMTs for doctors who do not live in hospital has been defined asH      ailaole to give advice by telephone, for consultations and for occasional^gent call-out: doctors who are voluntarily resident in hospital are nowgivn^      e for Class B UMTs for on-call availability outside the time when they are.      ed to be physically present and immediately available for work. In^1        average weekly duty hours in future, no automatic addition of UMTsDe made for flexibility to take account of irregular commitments outside
CONFftfiHfflAlENT,ALnormal rostered hours, as has happened in many instances in the past: the assessment is intended to take account only of commitments outside normalrostered hours, that are recognised as necessary for the continuity of patientcare.   To give a measure of practical expression to a recommendation that theminimum assured period of off-duty time should be 88 hours a week, it has alsobeen agreed that, in drawing up duty rosters and entering into contracts,employing authorities should try as far as possible, and consistently with theneeds of the service, to avoid unnecessary social inconvenience to doctors; inparticular, doctors on a 1 in 2 rota for stand-by or on-call duty (equivalent to10^ hours duty per week) will not be expected to contract to provide cover forother doctors absent on annual leave or study leave.   The Health Departments donot expect the clarification of these aspects of the working of the new contractarrangements to result in any significant change in the pattern and number ofcontracted hours.   They have also confirmed that agreement has been reached withthe professions for an increase in the annual leave entitlement for senior nousofficers and registrars from k weeks to 5 weeks with effect from 1 April 1978?this will bring them into line with other groups in the NHS at comparable paylevels: we have made provision in our recommendations for the cost of introducingthis improvement in conditions of service.31.   We regret that no progress has been made towards an examination of the l011^hours of duty of junior hospital doctors with the object of reducing them,notwithstanding the fact that the need for such an examination was agreed betweethe professions and the Secretary of State in October 1975-   The professionssaid that they see difficulty in making real progress until the effect of theintroduction of a new contract for consultants on consultants pattern of workand on the maintenance of an adequate standard of patient care can beestablished.   For our part, we would have expected that a beginning could havebeen made on considering the problems involved in parallel with discussions onthe consultant contract.   As we have said , we consider the extent to whichjunior hospital doctors are called upon to spend very long hours on duty isunusual by comparison with most other professional people, and is undesirable-as a regular requirement, it can hardly fail to have adverse consequences forthe standard of patient care and for the efficiency of the National health service generally as well as for the doctors themselves.   It seems to us to bethethe responsibility of both parties to ensure that an early start is made on examination of junior hospital doctors&apos; duty hours which both accepted as necessary two and a half years ago.   In the meantime, in considering up-to-*datelevels of pay, we have retained a substantial measure of relative improvement ^in the earnings of junior hospital doctors and dentists from theintroductiontheir new contract.^Review Body on Doctors&apos;and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Supplement to Fifth Rep031975 - Cmnd 62^3, September Q0f$FQpENigb&amp;tm 15).rn/Mcir\cuTi a 1
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL52.   The professions have again asked us to relate the salary scales for juniorhospital doctors and dentists to the standard working week of 10 UMTs, and we*^ve decided to use the flexibility provided by the current guidelines to doGo*   We have not been able to take this step before because the form of thegeneral measures of pay restraint which have been in operation 6ince April 19751when we last reviewed the salary scales,. has been unsuited to a change in theoesis of remuneration of this kind: the increases that we recommended in 1976and 1977 were cash supplements to earnings (and the level of the supplementthat we recommended in 1977 recognised the change in the conditions of servicetender which additional Class A/B supplements are paid for providing cover forother doctors and dentists on leave).   The present salary scales are those that we recommended in our Fifth Report with effect from 1 April 1975 and, asWe said at the time , were designed to recognise all duties of junior hospitalActors other than those that attracted extra duty allowances. Since,as we specifically noted in the Supplement to our Fifth Report^, the salaryScales remained unchanged on the introduction of the new contract on 9 February1976, when the Class A/B supplements replaced extra duty allowances, theycontinued to contain an element of recognition of part of the long hours spentjunior hospital doctors and dentists on duty beyond the normal weekly hours^d the supplements as recognising the remainder.   As we indicated in the^rd Supplement to our Fifth Report^, a change of basis on the lines proposed would inevitably involve relatively lower basic salary scales for all juniorspital doctors and dentists and relatively higher earnings from supplementsfor those who qualify.   The general increase in the basic salary scales for^e training grades that we recommend below, after consolidation of the 1976I977 cash supplements into the salary scales and taken in conjunction with^*e effect of consolidation on earnings from Class A/B supplements, implies aNative adjustment between earnings from salary and earnings from the Class^ supplements.   It represents the change in the basis of remuneration that^e Professions have asked for, and it is our judgment of the appropriate relation-Q^^ew Body on Doctors&apos; and dentists Remuneration, Fifth Report 1975 -&quot;fcd 6032, April 19751 (paragraph 25).H?ev*ew Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Supplement to Fifth^ Port, 1975 - cmnd 62^+3, September 1975 (paragraph 21).*&apos;iff*eW on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Third Supplement toth Report, 1975 - Cmnd 6406, February 1976 (paragraph 15).25
ship between the basic salary scales of junior hospital doctors and dentistsand the standard working week of 10 UMTs.33-   The professions have asked that the rate of payment for Class A UMTsshould be not less than the rate implied by the basic salary for standardUMTs, since the duty involved relates to night and weekend work of a demandingnature which in some other walks of life is remunerated at not less than therate for normal working hours.   As we have said before , we do not regard itas appropriate to draw comparisons between the premium rates paid to manual workers and to some non-manual workers in industry for overtime work and thepayments to junior hospital doctors and dentists for stand-by and on-callduty.   Our recommendations for the rate of payment for Class A/B UMTs take into account the varying nature of the duty, only part of which relates toclinical work as distinct from availability, and the average amount of call-out involved.34.

We have also provided a measure of relative^compression in the salary structure between the consultant and senior^gistrar scales, through a higher general increase for the consultantth*n for the training grades (who have benefitted relatively to consultantssince I975), combined with a reduction in the span of the consultant scale to reflect more closely than at present the general rate of progression in8c*les at comparable levels of pay elsewhere.   The scale that we recommendfor medical assistants and assistant dental surgeons takes into account andement reached between the professions and the Health Departments toMorten the scale by removing the two lowest points and each alternate pointEducing the number of annual increments from fourteen to six), and isSigned to preserve the existing relationships with other hospital doctors**d dentists.   The professions have told us that proposals for a new contractfo* medical assistants and assistant dental surgeons have been put forward for discussion with the Health Departments on the lines of the proposed con-^tant contract, and have asked us if we would be willing to price it on a1 April 1978 basis as an extension of the current review, if agreement can beCached within a reasonable amount of time.   On the assumption that a sig-significant change in the basis of remuneration and protection arrangements would be involved (reflecting the proposals for the new consultant contract),We would see great difficulty in considering a new contract for medical^sistants and assistant dental surgeons other than in the context of a newteview.   However, we understand that no-one in the obsolescent senior hospital
CONFfi5aWIJJfNT,ALmedical ar.d dental officer grade i6 paid at a point in the scale below themaximum - which is linked to the maximum of the medical assistant andassistant dental surgeon scale - and we have therefore recommended a flat rate salary.   We also recommend increases in the pay of hospitalpractitioners and clinical assistants (part-time medical and dental officers)in line with those for general medical and dental practitioners: since wehave not yet been provided with the evidence which we first asked for in197^ on the duties and responsibilities of the new hospital practitionergrade, and on their relationship with those of other intermediate grades, wehave not been able to consider the structure and pattern of remuneration forthese grades, including the relationship with other hospital grades. full details of the recommended scales are in Appendix A.35-   Career grades: distinction awards.   We have been told in evidence that,in addition to the proposals for a new consultant contract, consideration isbeing given to changes in the system under which distinction awards may be conferred, with the object of extending recognition to a greater extent toa high degree of merit of the kind that is widespread, particularly in the regions, and is rather different from clinical distinction alone.    It is envisaged that, in future, the procedure for regional selection of awardsshould be strengthened by inviting Regional Medical Officers to put forwardformal recommendations to the regional advisory committees (instead of seeking their advice only) and that the distribution of new awards recom-mended by the central advisory committee would be made with a longer termaim of changing the balance of the share of awards between regions (including those with long-established teaching hospitals) to achieve a greater degreeof balance in the number of consultants with awards.   Steps would also betaken to achieve a more uniform distribution of award-holders betweenspecialties.   To assist the central advisory committee in its new objectivesithe intention is to appoint a small number of regional consultants to serve on the central committee, in addition to the present appointees who are nominated by the Royal Colleges for England and Wales and for Scotland, by tbeCommittee of University Vice-Chancellors, and by the Medical Research Counc1At the same time, confidentiality would be modified to provide access to ^list of award-holders to consultants and community physicians.

In the meantime, we have been asked by the Joint Evidence Committeeto recommend a larger overall increase in the number of awards than wouldbe required simply to take account of the increase in the number of con-3ultants in post, and to provide more of them at lower levels to enableAOng service to be recognised in lieu of promotion opportunity, and toenable the proportion of awards to community physicians to be broughtnore closely into line with the proportion for clinical specialties- Welnvited Sir Stanley Clayton to put his views to us as Chairman of the^vi60ry Committee on Distinction Awards-   We recommend an increase of 50awards, bringing the total number of awards to 5,392.   We make no provision*0r additional awards for the purposes proposed by the Joint EvidenceCommittee, as we do not consider it appropriate for distinction awards intheir present form to be used other than for the original purpose of^warding professional excellence or exceptional individual merit. We8till do not regard it as appropriate to distinguish between different8Pecialties a^d we do not therefore earmark a special share for communityMedicine1, which must continue to be considered on equal terms with theother specialties.&apos;   We said in our Fifth Report   that, if the present award system con-tinued in its existing form, we should want to review the past practiceunder which the value of each award has been increased by the same percentage*8 the maximum of the consultant scale.

Butthere is some evidence which suggests that the balance between theadditional remuneration represented by distinction awards and the scalemaximum itself needs to be considered, particularly at the highest levels of awards.   We believe too that the absolute amounts at the highest levelsnow provide adequate reward to attract specialists of the highest ability to the National Health Service and to retain them.   Between 1958 and 1971tthe proportion of whole-time consultants with distinction awards increased from just under 20 per cent to 50 per cent, and the proportion of part-tin16consultants with awards remained virtually unchanged at around 57 to 58 Percent compared with the average for all consultants of 55 per cent; the Pr0portion of whole-time consultant award-holders with A+ and A awardsincreased to approach closely the proportion of part-time consultants withA+ and A awards.   During this period, the top level of consultant remunerative(salary maximum and A+ award) was maintained at around twice the maximumthe consultant scale notwithstanding the steep rise in salaries and the c0^pression at higher levels of income that had occurred generally since 1959We consider that it is no longer appropriate to maintain a fixed and rigidrelationship between the value of each distinction award and the maximumthe consultant scale, and that, in deciding the values of the awards, someregard should be paid to the general factors that we take into account in assessing remuneration generally, including movements in earnings of other professions at comparable levels.

Our detailed recommendations ondistinction awards are in Appendix A.38*   Fees and allowances.   The fees and allowances that are payable to6Pital doctors and dentists - including those for domiciliary consul-1Qns, family planning work, lectures and membership of District Manage-^nt Teams - have not been increased since 1975*   The professions have^Sgested that they should now be increased substantially, and cite the fee0r domiciliary consultations as particularly important, because of the8lng costs of the provision and maintenance of portable equipment to^ble treatment to be given in the home, as well as to encourage recruit-oient f*o shortage specialties such as geriatrics.   They have also drawn ourention to an increase in fees for private work of just over 52 per centeffect from April 1977, which has been approved recently by the Pricelesion, as an indication of the level of increase that might be justified.TO not consider that any change in the relativities between the domiciliaryCitation fee and other fees and salary is justified on recruitment grounds:Reposal for a change in the additional fee payable to doctors who providehei*own equipment, which is directly linked to the service fee, is aer for discussion with the Health Departments in the first instance, butrecommendations for increasing the level of fees will have the effect ofi&amp;creasing the additional fees payable in these circumstances.   Nor do wePt that an increase in fees for work which is not identical, and which^seen approved in a different context, is relevant: moreover, that increase*elates to a shorter period than we are considering (the previous increasen April 1975) and includes an element for expenses as well as for*t  eration.   In our view, the right course is to restore the relationshipeen the various fees and allowances and the pay of the relevant grade*ich w.      was established by our 1975 recommendations.   We have adjusted themthile way: our detailed recommendations are in Appendix A.\
39-    Ophthalmic medical practitioners.   The profession have asked us to consolidate the 1977 cash supplement of ^.2p into the net remunerationclement of the sight-testing foe, and to recommend an increase in the feein line with the general increase that we propose for others.    They havesuggested that the present level of the net remuneration element (includingcash supplement) of the sight-testing fee compares unfavourably with thescale of payment recently agreed between the profession and the Department ofHealth and Social Security for medical examinations by doctors in connection.  . . 1with claims for non-contributory invalidity pensions for married women .They told us that the opening hours of eye-centres, where the great majorityof sight-tests by ophthalmic medical practitioners are carried out, aregenerally restricted to 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoonfrom Monday to Friday each week, and that this meant that it was not possiblein practice to carry out more than **,1*K) sight-tests a year, based on ourestimate of 20 minutes for the average time involved for sight-tests and allowing for annual leave of six weeks: this implied an average net remunerate011for full-time ophthalmic medical practitioners of  7,908 (including the 1977cash supplement).   They drew our attention to a number of advertisements forophthalmic opticians which offered employment at salaries ranging in the mainfrom around  9,000 to around  10,000 a year, and in some cases involvedrefraction work only.    They also referred to their proposal, on which dis-cussions with the Health Departments had begun, on the extension of the role of ophthalmic medical practitioners to enable them to treat patients where aneye condition which required medical attention was detected during a sight-teSkO.   The Health Departments have again suggested that we should not recommendan increase in the net remuneration element of the sight-testing fee, as they regarded the rate of average net remuneration of  9,508 (including the 197&apos;supplement), for full-time ophthalmic medical practitioners implied by ourestimate based on *f,990 sight-tests a year, as too high in relation to therequirements of the job.   They described the two principal considerationsthey saw as affecting the level of remuneration for ophthalmic medicaltrypractitioners - the training, qualifications and experience required for eninto practice as an ophthalmic medical practitioner, and the nature of thework carried out by them for the General Ophthalmic Service.

They acknowledged the higher level of clinical training required of ophthalmic medical practitioners, but drew attention to the longertraining in dispensing of ophthalmic opticians; they accepted thatophthalmic medical practitioners were no less adequately trained for pres-cribing particular types of lens than ophthalmic opticians, and withdrewthe view that they had expressed to us in earlier reviews that this wasnot so.   The ophthalmic medical practitioner&apos;s function in testing sightunder the General Ophthalmic Service was identical to the function of theophthalmic optician.   The Health Departments took the view, therefore, thatthe remuneration of ophthalmic opticians ( 6,579 including cash supplementsand a 7j per cent provision for employerfs superannuation contribution) was at least as relevant an indicator of the appropriate level of remuneration for ophthalmic medical practitioners as the mid-point of the consultant&apos;sscale ( 9,519 including the 1977 cash supplement), which the professionregarded as the appropriate standard.For our part, we do not consider it appropriate to relate the remun-eration of ophthalmic medical practitioners either to a particular pointxu the consultant&apos;s scale or to the negotiated pay of ophthalmic opticians.In making comparisons with earnings in other occupations and within themedical and dental professions as a whole, which we have now been able todo since the 1975 study by management consultants into the time involvedin sight-testing by ophthalmic medical practitioners, we find it helpful to make an assessment on a notional basis of the average net remuneration of ophthalmic medical practitioners.   For this purpose, we have used ourestimate of the average time involved per sight-test of 20 minutes and related it to the normal weekly hours of work (3&amp;J hours) and leave (6 weeksa year and public holidays) for senior hospital medical staff. taking into account the addition of one public holiday since 1976 and two additional^ys paid holiday agreed in 1974, we now estimate that the notional number0f sight-tests carried out by a full-time ophthalmic medical practitionerWouid be 4,920 a year: this implies a notional average net remuneration

It would in any case be wrong, inour view, to assess average net remuneration from sight-testing on the basisof the average hours of opening of eye-centres, even if adequate informationwere available on those hours.   We have been asked by the profession to1recommend an increase in the expenses element of the sight-testing fee but,2as we said last in our 1974 Report , it is not within our remit to proposeadjustments in the expenses factor.   Meanwhile, we await the results of the detailed inquiry into the practice expenses of ophthalmic medical practitionerswhich, we understand, will be carried out in the course of the coming year.We recommend that the net remuneration element of the sight-testing feeshould be increased with effect from 1 April 1978 to  2.10 ( 2.50): the 1977cash supplement has been consolidated into the basic fee.The expenses element of the sight-testing fee was increased from 55P ^with effect from 1 April 1977.Review Body on doctors and dentists Remuneration, Fourth Report, 197^Cmnd 5644, June 1974 (paragraph 35).34CONFIDENTIALTAMCmCKITIAI
CHAPTER     - GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSte.   The total number of general medical practitioners rose to 26,848 in1977.   The rate of increase of 1.6 per cent was slightly higher than in1976, and also slightly above the trend of the previous five years. Thedumber of principals who provide unrestricted services rose by 1.2 per cent to 24,948.   For the first time since 1974, there has been a small increasein the number of British-born men doctors, but the greater part of the overallincrease is attributable to the increase in the number of British-born womenActors and of overseas-born doctors.   All doctors in general medical practice^ required by the General Medical Council to hold the professional qualificationsSquired for full registration and to be registered before they can practise.number of principals who provide restricted services (for example, maternity&quot;fcdical services only) or who have limited lists (for example, hospital staff)feH again last year,thus continuing the declining trend which has been the^ttern over at least the last 20 years, subject to only one small interruptionin 1975.   The number of salaried assistants increased in 1977 for the secondyea* in succession.   There was a further encouraging rise in the number oftr*inees, and the proportion of women trainees now reflects the percentageof women medical graduates.   The Health Departments expect vocational training to become mandatory for all doctors entering general practice in 198l.

General medical practitioners were responsible both forxaS   patients and for &apos;caring&apos; for them, and increased access to55
conj4SMKENTIALdiagnostic facilities on the spot meant that they were much less dependenton specialist services in the hospital than they had been in the past.In their view, statistical information on the number of consultations orthe number of home visits did not reflect adequately the overall clinicaland administrative duties and responsibilities of general practitioners.They drew our attention to a number of recent developments which have led toa change in the pattern of general practice workload.   These included the wide range of screening measures now available in general practice which involve more preventive medicine than hitherto and, in particular, the proposedintroduction of regular screening examinations for children and for the elderly&apos;the growth of health care teams brought to light an increasing number of probie0of a clinical or social nature,and these had to be considered by the general practitioner;   moreover, their management role had increased, partly as a resultof the employment of increased numbers of ancillary staff and the attachmentof district nurses and health visitors to practices, and partly because ofthe need to maintain contact with the large number of administrative and professional bodies and committees concerned with the provision of medical and social services at different levels of Government.   They also told us that, in their view, the present average list size of 2,29^&quot;*&quot; was too large inHtio0relation to the increasing workload and complexity of work of general prac^J-and that no individual doctor should be responsible for more than 2,000 patieJ1this implied a target average list size of 1,700 in the future.kk.   We have no material evidence to show that the overall level of workloadhad changed to a significant extent over recent years.   As we noted in ourSeventh Report last year, in the period between 1970 and 1975, some indicator5showed a declining trend - for example, in average list size, in consultationper year per doctor, and in output as measured by gross income from individuagjidfees and allowances per doctor on a constant fee basis.   Average list sizer pel&quot;output also fell again by a small amount in 1976, but consultations per yedoctor rose. At the same time, the annual number of prescriptions per docand of sickness benefit claims per doctor have risen, reflecting increasedandmorbidity among the population.   Since morbidity varies from year to year, ^over the long term has shown substantial improvement as a result of the vi*&quot;tueradication of diseases such as tuberculosis, it does not seem to us that ^divergences from the long term trend provide conclusive evidence of an 111the general level of workload in general practice.This figure relates to 1976: the population per unrestricted principal inyear was 2,205-56CONFIDENTIALEir-te-ti-ri a i

The profession have asked us to re-assess the netr4unoration for out-of-hourn responsibilities separately from our assessmentQl&quot; remuneration for normal hours responsibilities.   They have suggested that,0n the basis of an hourly rate calculation, the net remuneration for out-of-hoursresponsibilities compares unfavourably with the rate payable to a general medical practitioner for a night duty session as a clinical assistant in hospital. We*re unable to agree with this proposal, since the terms and conditions of servicefQr general medical practitioners include an obligation to provide a servicethroughout the full 2h hours each day, although they are free, subject to theCo*sent of their Family Practitioner Committee, to make arrangements to beSieved of part of their responsibilities - for example, those that relateto out-of-hours work.   Our recommendations on remuneration are based on the0verall workload and responsibilities of general medical practitioners and itWo^d be wrong to consider remuneration for one part of those responsibilities6eParately from the rest: exceptionally, we have considered fees for contraceptive8e*vice8 separately from other remuneration since, so far we have seen these asSolving new and extra work, the pattern of which has not yet developed fully.concerned that the proportion of total remuneration represented by paymentsln respect of out-of-hours responsibilities (supplementary practice allowance,Elementary capitation fees, and night visit fees) should provide adequateSensation for those responsibilities.   We are satisfied that the balance is*i*ht: the rates are high enough to cover the use of deputising arrangements(or other arrangements for organising out-of-hours responsibilities on a collective^s) without being so high that the prospective financial loss deters thoseVho want to opt out from doing so: the provision of deputising services has beenf0wing, and nearly one third of all general medical practitioners now use them.do rot accept that a valid comparison can be made on an hourly rate basiseen the out-of-hours payments for general medical practitioners and the nightLionel payments for clinical assistants.   Apart from the fact that the definition0f Out-Of-hours1 is used only as the criterion for payment of the fees concerned,th6re is a wide difference in the nature of the work involved in a general medical^ctitioner&apos;s out-of-hours responsibility and in the work involved in a clinical**8i8tant&apos;s night duty session in hospital.   We understand that, on average, a*enerai medical practitioner makes around 18 out-of-hours calls per month, of*hlc* only two are between 11 pm and 7 am the following morning; a clinical*lstant on the other hand can expect to have the same amount of call-out ino^? 0n weekdays to 8 am the following morning and 1 pm on Saturdays to 8 ame following Monday morning.

Our recommendations provide for maintenance of the April1975 relationships &quot;between out-of-hours payments and the correspondingpayments for normal hours (basic practice allowance and capitation fees)-46.   Because of the form of the restraint measures which applied to thecommunity as a whole, our recommendations for increases in the netremuneration of general medical practitioners in 1976 and in 1977 were byway of cash supplements to gross fees and allowances.   As we have already said, we intend now to consolidate both of the supplements into the feescale.   At the same time, we propose to remove the imbalance &quot;between feesthat has resulted from concentrating the increased provision for practiceexpenses on the practice allowances and capitation fees in the last two year3Our recommendations are designed to restore the relativities generally to reflect the pattern that we recommended in 1975? &quot;but with two exceptions*In the case of temporary resident fees, we maintain the present relationship with the capitation fees, as they reflect the current workload relationship3more closely.   This is consistent with the approach that we adopted in 19?5on the &quot;basis of our examination at the time:   we have not yet been provided with information on the extent of the additional workload which thetreatment of temporary residents involves.   We also propose to maintain thepresent relationships &quot;between the ordinary contraceptive service fee andthe capitation fee for the same reasons:   we recommend an increase in theIUD contraceptive service fee to &quot;bring it into line with the fee payable to hospital doctors for the same service.   We make no recommendations for change in the level of dispensing fees:   under an arrangement agreed in 1975* the dispensing payments under the drug tariff basis^were broughtinto line with those paid to pharmacists and have been kept in line since then.   However, we have been told that changes have recently been agreedthat will affect the structure of payments under the drug tariff basis1and that the Health Departments and the profession are now discussing the1 j the^Approximately three-quarters of the 12 per cent of practitioners who doown dispensing choose to be paid wholly on a drug tariff basis: the re^iis*are paid partly on a capitation fee basis and partly on a drug tariff^The payment for each prescription is calculated on the basis of the netingredient cost at drug tariff rates, plus a percentage for on-costs, acontainer allowance and a dispensing fee.38confidentialso/MkicirxetiTi a 1

We have boonlQhl Lhat discussions have been held between the Health Departments and the profession on the introduction of developmental paediatric screening bygeneral medical practitioners, and we have been asked by the profession tor,&apos;f:ommond that the work should be regarded as new work and that remuneration for it should be treated separately from other income.   We are not in aPosition to consider the professions proposal at this time since we havenot been provided with any evidence on the detailed arrangements that are^der discussion or to show that extra work will necessarily be involved:We shall await evidence in due course.^-   The profession have again expressed concern about the position of traineeSeneral practitioners, as a result of the introduction of the new contract for^ior hospital doctors.   Trainees are required to spend 3 years in approvedhosPital posts and 1 year under training in general practice.   The trainingye*r in general practice can be spent at any time during the vocationalfining period and, during this period, the trainee is paid the equivalent of the basic salary that he would have received if he had continued to bee*Ployed in the hospital service.   As a result of the introduction of the newCo*tract for junior hospital doctors which provides for supplementary payments in recognition of all hours spent on duty beyond the standard 40 hours workingWee*, compared with the previous arrangement under which extra duty allowances were payable only beyond 80 hours a week, many trainee general practitionersfir* that their remuneration is reduced substantially during their generalNotice training year.   Currently, trainee general practitioners receive thefuU  208 supplement which we recommended last year, whereas junior hospital^tors receive a reduced supplement of  105 to take account of the change inthe basis of their remuneration to allow additional remuneration for providingC0Ver for other doctors on leave.   We have been provided by the Health DepartmentsVitb information on the pattern of work of trainee general practitioners obtainedftom medical post-graduate deans, which shows that, on average, a trainee&apos;sworking week amounts to about 40 hours: in addition, most trainees are0^call on one night a week and on one weekend a month.

In the circumstances,Ve ^e no recommendations, but we expect account to be taken of the increasestl**t we have recommended for junior hospital doctors from 1 April 1978. WeW0uId like to be informed of the outcome of the discussions.   We have been39

We propose that all of the trainees should be brought into line in this respect, and that all of them should receive London weightingif they otherwise qualify for it.   We have taken account of this recommendation in our costing.48.   We understand that agreement has been reached between the Health departments and the profession on an experimental scheme for payment in respect of the servicof wives and related dependents who are employed as ancillary staff.   We welcomethis development, the need for which was first brought to our notice in 1975*it had been raised first in 1967 and again (with the Health Departments) in 1972&apos;scheme is designed at present to apply to single-handed rural practitioners only&apos;and will be subject to review after two years of operation.   It provides forthe payment of an allowance to a practitioner normally in respect of the employment of one relative only (wife or other dependent) although, in exceptional cases, the allowance may be paid in respect of two relatives^.   The practitionerwill be required to certify that the relative is employed on a regular basis for at least 19 hours a week on duties that are ancillary to the work of thepractice - for example, nursing and treatment, secretarial and clerical workireceiving patients, making appointments and dispensing.

CHAPTER 6 - GENERAL DENTAL PRACTITIONERS52. The total number of practitioners in the general dental service roseby ^.3 per cent to 13,564 in 1977 and maintained the upward trend of recentyears.    The proportion of assistants again declined, and is now only 1.5per cent of the total of all practitioners.    The number of courses oftreatment continued to increase, and rose by 3.1 per cent in 1977; thenumber per practitioner increased by 0.8 per cent, thus resuming the steadyrise over a long period following the small decline last year.    There hasbeen no significant change in the distribution of dentists, which continuesto show a marked variation between regions in the southern part of Englandand in the remainder of the country.    Progress on the introduction in Englandand Wales of the experimental &quot;salary plus bonus&apos; scheme based on publiclyprovided premises, which was designed to reduce the imbalance in the dis-tribution of dentists, continues to be disappointingly slow: one appointmenthas been made, and the aim is to introduce the scheme in at least two other areas during the coming year: four dentists are now employed in Scotlandunder a parallel scheme.   We have been told by the Health Departments thatthe current target for the number of dentists in the National Health service is 20,000, including those in the hospital and community dental services: on present indications, this target is unlikely to be reached for a further 7years.    In the meantime, an inquiry is to be made into the general problemof dental education, training and manpower in the light of current and fore-seeable needs&apos;1.53. We have been asked by the Health Departments to recommend an appropriatesessional fee for practitioners who provide emergency dental services under arrangements organised by health authorities.    We understand that the extentto which emergency dental services are provided is limited at present to afew authorities, although in some instances individual practitioners havemade their own arrangements to provide emergency treatment generally fortheir own patients.    There are no formal arrangements and, in some cases,health authorities have arranged for official premises and equipment to beused and, in others, for dentists to provide the services in their ownsurgeries.   Neither the length of a session nor the times of coverage havebeen standardised, but a typical health authority scheme involves a daily__i1The inquiry is being sponsored by the Nuffield Foundation.44

The need for*fte provision of emergency dental services was first considered someS1xteen years ago, but the conclusion reached then was that specialUrgency arrangements were not justified since there was little evidence0^ demand.   More recently, in 1973* following the recommendations of aJQint working party composed of representatives of the Health Departments^ of the profession, agreement was reached on the introduction of aScheme on an experimental basis designed to assess the need for the provision0^ emergency dental services generally.   The experimental scheme was to beWaited to four areas and to the provision of services at weekends and public^0Udays;  surgery facilities were to be provided by the health authorities;^d the dentists who participated in the scheme would be paid a sessionalee of the same order as the fee paid to part-time salaried health centredental practitioners.   However, the profession considered that the proposed^evel of fee did not provide adequate reward for work done outside normalWeekdays: they have suggested that the sessional fee should be based ondQuble the equivalent rate per session implied by the recommended targetaverage net income and the average number of hours spent on general dental6ervice work.

In forecasting expenses,  the main dif-ficulty is that full information on actual practice expenses is not availablefor either of the two preceding years, so that the baseline for projectingthe level for the current year is three years old.    To reduce the gapsbetween the intended and the actual results the Study Group has, following the professions suggestion in 197^, adjusted the practice expenses1 provisionwithin the fee scale each year to correct for under-provision or over-provision in the preceding three years on a cumulative basis.    The followingtable illustrates the adjustments since 197^-75, and the projected adjust-ments for 1977-78 (assuming no change in the method of adjustment) based onthe Health Departments&apos; estimates and on the profession^ estimates:Year	Recommended		Adjustment to correct			Total	target average		forecast	expenses	(a)	adjustment	net income							1973-7^	197^-75	1975-76	1976-77		 	 	 	 	 	 197^-75	5,789	+ 291				+ 2911975-76	7,6*f3	- lkO	* 97			- ^31976-77	7,798	- 175	- 156	- 52		- 3831977-78(b)	8,011		- 299	- 669	- 773	- 1,7^1				(- k26)	(- 3^5)	(- 1,070)Difference between out-turn and provision madefor expenses -2k       - 358Note:    (a) The adjustment is made to the provision for practice expensesincluded in the forecast of gross remuneration used incalculatingthe fee scale.(b) The adjustments shown in the first line are based on the health departments&apos; forecasts and those in brackets on the profession sforecasts.55*    Last year, the Health Departments proposed to the Study Group that thesame approach should be adopted to average gross income, so that any dif-ference between forecast and actual output (as measured by average grossincome) would be corrected each year.   The profession were not prepared toagree, and they themselves proposed to the Study Group that adjustment to correct for under-provision or over-provision in practice expenses should cease to be made.    They argued that adjustment tended to produce large bal&quot;ancing factors in times of high inflation, and that these could seriously affect dentists&apos; standards of living from one year to the next: they pointed to the implied reduction, based on the Health Departments&apos; forecasts, o^ 1,7^1 in the 1977-78 expenses provision as an example of what could happenCONF.d1^&amp;DENT,AL

The Health Departments and the profession have now eachus to review the principle and methods of retrospective adjustment.^e Health Departments referred to the difficulty of forecasting the;s and output of general dental practitioners in periods of high inflation.suSgested that the Royal Commissions view that retrospective payments werePpropriate in principle for doctors and dentists   was based on the assumptionmuch higher degree of accuracy in forecasting expenses and output would^ thieved than had proved practicable in the event.

They estimated that dentists had received  1,201 more in neti      ration from fees in 1976-77 than the target average net income of  7,643,^      expenses had been lower and output higher than forecast; they consideredh &apos; al though output had increased by 3-3 Per cent in that year^, it did notignoring the large excess payment.

job to take account of changes in output and in hours worked in making our recommendations on the target average net income for dentists, but they themselves took the view that, on average, dentists should receive the recom-mended amount only: since precision in forecasting expenses and output wasimpossible, some form of adjustment remained necessary.   To avoid largebalancing adjustments that can create confusion about the intended level of net income, the Health Departments suggested that a new arrangement might beintroduced whereby a deduction of 2 per cent would be made from gross targetaverage remuneration to provide a &apos;pool&apos; out of which any under-payment of net income (whether on account of under-estimate of expenses or over-estimate of outpuwould subsequently be paid out as a cash supplement based on fee income received,and a deduction would be made in respect of any over-payment of net income.A scheme of this kind would mean that the fee scale would not be affected bythe adjustment process, and that dentists would be guaranteed 98 per cent ofthe target average net income, regardless of the amount of any over-payment.57* The British Dental Association explained to us that, in practice, dentistsequate their profitability, and hence their attitude to general dental servicework, to the fee scale.   They pointed to the fact that, notwithstanding thehigh rate of inflation since 19751 the fee scale had remained unchanged andprofit margins had been eroded.   The background to this is that, for 1976-77-the Study Group considered that the small increase in target average grossincome did not justify an increase in the level of fees, and that practitionersshould instead be paid a cash supplement equivalent to 3 per cent of fee income,there has been no change since then.   They drew our attention to the increasein output between 1962 and 1976 which, in terms of courses of treatment perdentist, had averaged 2.5 per cent a year and, in terms of volume of fees,1.4 per cent a year, and told us that the absence of any direct reward forrising output had long been a cause of discontent among dentists.   They indicatheir agreement with our proposal, which we made first in 1973j that the study group should take account only of changes in productivity within the standardhours and should avoid adjusting the fee scale for anticipated changes in outpuarising from changes in personal effort - a distinction, however, which the study Group had said they were not in a position to make.   They suggested thatthe Study Group should base the fee scale for the coming year on the actualoutput of the past year so that, in this way, the benefit of an increase in output above the level to which the target average net income was related woul^be retained by the dentist, and the effect of a reduction in output would be48CONFIDENTIALDENT(AL
b CONFIDENTIALne by the dentist for that year only.   They opposed the Health Departments1proPosal to extend the process of retrospective adjustment to correct forOVor-er.timates or under-estimates of output, since this would mean that dentistsWould not gain any benefit from rising output, and asked us to pronouncegainst continuation of the system of retrospective adjustment in respect ofVer-estimates or under-estimates of expenses.   They drew our attention to^e argument against retrospective adjustment - which they had already put^&quot;ard in the Study Group - that the swings in dentists living standards^ had resulted from its adoption were out of proportion to the possiblenefits from the process.    They also pointed to the fact that, in the period 1962^3 before retrospective adjustment was introduced, there was a net under-paymentltl remuneration that, in April 1975 prices (estimated by them as  875), morecompensated for the sum of the outstanding adjustments in respect of the*ctl*al over-payment of expenses in 197^75 ( 299) and their estimate of the^Payment of expenses in 1975-76 ( *f26).   Even in the modified form sug-^8ted by the Health Departments, they saw the adjustments as objectionable,Qce their impact would be felt three years later by dentists who had not beennVolved in the original over-payment, and their effect in changed circumstances could Vvnave severe financial consequences for individuals.   Moreover, the over-^  Jent could have the effect of moving individual dentists into a higher taxa^ket than when the adjustment was subsequently made, with the result thatwould be a net under-payment after tax.   They considered that the resultscne 12-year period showed that the Study Group was able to achieve itsOb-?ctive without the need for retrospective adjustment.^     na following table sets out the changes in general dental practitioners1Conies since 1971-72:**9coNfflBWMNTIAL

*t is clear from this that the extent of the divergences of the forecasts foraverago gross remuneration and average practice expenses from the out-turnslln&apos;r&apos; more often than not been relatively large in the last six years.    Where thedjfl&apos;orences have been additive, as in 1972-73 and 197^-75 and as is expectedto be both in 1975-76 and in 1976-77 on the basis of current forecasts, theactual average net remuneration has (or is estimated to have) differed sig-^ft-cantly from the target average net income recommended by us.   Based on the he*lth departments  forecasts for 1975-76 and 1976-77, the average difference0Ver the period is equivalent to 8.7 per cent of intended average netrei2uneration, and the balance on a cumulative basis is a surplus of 26.5 perCent; the corresponding figures based on the profession^ forecasts for these^Wo years are 7*3 per cent and 17.8 per cent respectively.   The effect oflntroducing an adjustment to correct for under-provision or over-provision of average practice expenses in the three previous years has had negligibleer^ect so far on the average difference between actual and target average netltlcc-me, and little effect on the balance.*   We have discussed the problem and the present position with the Chairmanthe Dental Rates Study Group (Mr S M Duncan).   He has confirmed that the relatively large divergences in recent years are due to the substantial dif-difficulties involved in forecasting the trend of dentists&apos; costs during a period0f highand fluctuating rates of inflation, combined with general measures ofPav restraint that had led dentists to cut back on their practice expenses to^foreseen extent in order to improve their income.    At the same time, dif-Culty had arisen in forecasting accurately the effect on dentists&apos; outputchanges in demand from the public, in reaction to changes in the levels ofCnerges to patients for dental treatment.   Moreover, if an intention to increase^arges in the following year were announced after the fee scale for the current year had been decided, as happened last in 1976, it was not possible to provide&quot;ie surge in demand for courses of dental treatment to begin before chargestheincreased.   He told us that his aim was to avoid such large divergences infuture, by seeking to develop and to refine the techniques used in fore-casting the level of expenses and of output.   To this end, the Study Group had put sxn hand a number of studies: these included proposals to widen the basis ofthetheInland Revenue sample on which information on practice expenses was provided;Use of a standardised account form by dentists, which would provide a more^Prehensive breakdown of their expenses than at present; an annual inquirythe employment of ancillary staff; and the provision of information on thetfenria of dentists&apos; expenses in the interim period between the latest year for51
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALwhich Inland Revenue information was available and the year for which the feescale was being set.   He also confirmed that the Study Group intended to carryout a fresh inquiry into the time taken for various dental operations in 1980:the last such inquiry on timing was in 1969*    He believed that, as a result ofthese studies, it should be possible to reduce divergences from the forecasts toan acceptable level in the future, both in relation to expenses and to output.60.    For our part, we understand the practical difficulties of forecasting thelevel of expenses in relation to general dental practitioners1 remunerationduring a period of high inflation: we have experienced the same kind of dif-difficulties ourselves in relation to general medical practitioners&apos; remuneration.There is, however, a fundamental difference between the two systems of reraun-eration that makes the forecasting of the level of output more difficult in thecase of general dental practitioners.    They are paid by way of a separate feefor each item of service, whereas the major part of general medical practitionersincome is made up of the standard and supplementary practice allowances andcapitation fees, and a relatively small part of their income only comes fromitem of service fees.   Moreover, patients are required to pay part of the costof dental treatment at the time, but are not required to pay part of the costof their medical treatment (other than a small contribution to prescriptions inthe majority of cases).    Unless changes in patients&apos; charges for dental treat-ment are known before the Dental Rates Study Group has set the fee scale foryear, it is impossible to forecast the effect on demand and to reflect it inthe fee scale.    Change in demand will also affect the provision to be made forpractice expenses, although to a limited extent only.    It is true that, by making adjustment to correct for the divergence of forecasts from the out-turnSjover the long run the total of average net remuneration received will be thesame as the total of target average net income recommended by us, but in the short term this will not necessarily be so.    The effect in times of highinflation of large adjustments that result in correspondingly large swings innet income undoubtedly creates difficult financial problems for those whom-system is intended to benefit, and creates uncertainty among them about thelevel of income that they can expect.    These factors alone weigh against continuation of retrospective adjustments.   But two other considerations are important also.   Because the adjustment process has to be retrospective and because it applies to general dental practitioners as a group, newly appoXIiprincipals have their remuneration adjusted in respect of income that theynot received, and the adjustment for individual principals will not be relateto the actual incomes that they did receive.   Moreover, where the adjustment52CONFIBKMTCAIENTIAL
Process results in a reduction in net income at a time when the cost of livingft rising sharply - as in 197^ - the natural tendency on the part of dentistswill be to make economies in their practice expenditure - for example, bydeferring the purchase of new equipment - which will obviously have anAverse effect of the quality of service and on the productivity of dentists.If this reaction were not foreseen - as seems to have happened in 197^ - afurther downward adjustment would be necessary in the following year, with thesame adverse effect.   If the process were to be repeated in future years, theemulative deterimental consequences for the provision of general dentalservices within the National Health Service would be very serious indeed. We^e the view, therefore, that retrospective adjustment is inappropriate in^incipie, and that a system closer to the system which we adopt for dealingvith general medical practitioners1 expenses should be explored.6l-   We now turn to the problem of output.   Our recommendations for targetav*rage net income are designed to provide the &apos;average&apos; general dentalPractitioner who spends broadly the &apos;average&apos; hours on general dental serviceWQrk with the level of remuneration that we judge to be appropriate, taking intoamount all relevant considerations.   These considerations include the factorsthat affect output, including changes in working hours and improvements in productivity:  the &apos;average&apos; hours are those that we have accepted as standard .8i*ce at least 1952, the productivity of dentists (as measured by the volume offe*s after correction for the effect of changes in age and practice structure*nd in the relativities within the fee scale) has increased steadily. Like0ur predecessors, we take the view that, where output has increased because ofhi8her productivity which does not directly involve greater individual effort,the benefit should be shared between the dentist and the community; but, where0utPut has increased because longer hours have been worked, the full benefit6hould accrue to the dentist.   Between 1965 and 1973, hours of work fell and0utPut rose, so that productivity (in the terms that we have defined) rose by^st under 23 per cent in that period.   We estimate that just over one-half ofthe benefit has been retained by the dentist in the form of reduced hours ofWork, since no adjustment has been made to target average net income on this*account, and just under one-half by the community in the form of reduced costs,*s the fee scale has been based on a projection of output throughout the period.1Review Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Fifth Report, 1975 -cmnd 6032, April 1975 (paragraph 57).coNfBKHBAfciAL
6?.   The function of the Dental Rates Study Group is to decide the gross feefor each item of treatment so that the target average net income is achieved in thc standard hours of work.    In order to carry out its task, the Study Groupneeds to know the average time taken to complete the individual dentaloperations that make up the structure of the general dental service work of theaverage general dental practitioner.   Over the longer term, the times willchange in the light of changes in dental techniques, and the structure willchange in the light of changes in the pattern of demand.   We welcome theintention of the Study Group to carry out a fresh inquiry into the timings of dental operations: we regard it as important that up-to-date information is available on which to base the fee scale.   The Study Group also carries out onour behalf inquiries into total hours worked in a year by general dental practitioners and, as we have said before, we attach great importance tohaving regular and up-to-date information on which to base our recommendations&apos;The last inquiry was carried out in 1974 and the next inquiry is being carriedout in the current year: we welcome the decision to carry out inquiries at regular intervals of three years in the future, as we asked last year shouldbe done.    It follows that, if there is a significant change in the averagehours spent on general dental service work, it should be reflected in theaverage net income received by general dental practitioners.    This situation could arise if dentists were to take on a higher or lower proportion of workoutside the NHS while maintaining the overall level of their workloadunchanged, or if they made more (or less) personal effort than the levelassumed in our target figure.    Like the parallel system for general medical practitioners, the system of remuneration for general dental practitionersis designed to reflect variations both in the workload of individuals and 111the general level for the group as a whole.    Unless it becomes possible to differentiate between changes in output due to changes in personal effort(including working hours) - essentially a short term factor - and changes in productivity related to efficiency - essentially a long term factor - and wehave been told by the Study Group on two previous occasions that it is not iadjustment as proposed by the Health Departments to correct for the dif-ference between forecast and actual output (as measured by average grossincome) means that the system will not operate flexibly and equitably- &apos;^llSis true also - but to a lesser extent - of the profession^ suggestion thatthe fee scale for the coming year should be related to the previous year&apos;8Review Body on doctors and dentists Remuneration, Fourth Report, 197Cmnd 5644, June 197^ (paragraph 55).Review Body on doctors and dentists Remuneration, Fifth Report, 197?Cmnd 6032, April 1975 (paragraph 58).C0NF&apos;RaWWfeENTIAL
0utput, since the benefit of increased productivity over the year would accrue to the dentist and, on the assumption that productivity will con-tinue to rise, it would mean that, for a given amount of personal effort,0ntists would earn a consistently higher level of remuneration each year than the target set by us.   We, therefore, do not agree either with the health departments  proposal to adjust average gross income to correctretrospectively for under-estimates or over-estimates of output, or withthe professions proposal to base the fee scale simply on the level of out-Pnt achieved in the previous year.   We recognise the difficulty of achieving^ acceptable degree of accuracy in attempting to distinguish the pro-activity changes that arise from the introduction of new equipment and^proved techniques from those that arise from individual effort, but weNevertheless hope that the Study Group will be able to give further con-5ideration to the problem to enable the fee scale for the coming year toDe based on projected output within the standard hours in the future.63 t&apos;   m dealing with the parallel problems in relation to general medicalPractitioners1 remuneration, we have always taken the view that under-paymentover-payment - whether due to under-estimates or over-estimates of theVolume of fees or the level of expenses - should not be carried forward into*he calculation of the next year&apos;s remuneration.   Our aim is to ensure that^here is no persistent tendency in either direction, taking one year with another and assuming no change in the general level of workload and responsibility.   The fact that there will be variations from the estimated average net remuneration that our recommendations on fees and allowances areS1gned to produce is inevitable in a system that has to rely on forecasts^s based on evidence of income and expenses that is up to two years outOf jaate: provided that we continue to achieve our aim of keeping a balance^ing one year with another, this seems to us to be the most acceptableAstern.In the circumstances, we suggest that the Dental Rates Study Group shouldContinue the practice of making adjustments each year to correct for under-P*0vision or over-provision of average practice expenses.    In our view, it0u^d not be appropriate for retrospective adjustments to be made in respectof th^    nose years for which the out-turn for practice expenses is not yet knownat is, for 1975-76 and 1976-77) particularly since, as we have indicated,dentists would be affected by the adjustment who had not been involved in55C0NEBWIlWVriAL
the over-payment.   We consider that, in future, when making provision forpractice expenses, the Study Group should follow the principle of ensuring that there is no persistent tendency to under-payment or over-payment takingone year with another.   But we take the view that the retrospective adjust-ment process should be completed in respect of 1974-75 since the out-turn isalready known, in relation to the fee scale for 1977-78.    Our proposals wouldinvolve making the third and final adjustment in respect of 1974-75 practiceexpenses - a deduction of  299 - completing the cumulative process for thatyear, and making at the same time a compensatory adjustment to cancel outthe initial adjustment in respect of 1975-76 practice expenses made to the1976-77 practice expenses1 provision - an addition of  52: the result wouldbe to reduce the 1977-78 provision for average practice expenses by  247-This would then make way for a fresh start on the new system.65. As we have explained (paragraph 12), we intend to consolidate the 197&amp;and 1977 cash supplements into the fee scale and to restore the establishedsystem of remuneration for general dental practitioners.    The current ratesof payment of the cash supplements that we recommended in 1976 and 1977 of 156 and  190, when added to the target average net income that we recom-mended in 1975 of  7,643, produce a current average rate of net income of 7,989.   For 1978-79, we recommend that the target average net income shouldbe  8,829 ( 10,511).66. Salaried health centre dental practitioners.

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 7 - COMMUNITY DOCTORS AND DENTISTSo7-   Community medicine staff.   Difficulty in filling community physicianPosts has continued in 1977-   Of 738 established posts in England and Wales,122 have remained vacant - one more than in 1976.   However, two appointmentshave been made on the special salary scale which we recommended in 1973 foruse should it be found necessary to fill some of the posts on an interimbasis, by appointing candidates who did not satisfy the full requirementsof the appointments committees.   There has been a further encouraging increaseln the number of senior registrars and registrars in training posts inimmunity medicine from 76 in 1976 to 108 in 1977-We have not yet received proposals on the pay arrangements for adminsitrative medical (and dental) officers in Scotland and Wales,^be Health Departments recognised last year that there were some differences^ responsibilities in area medical posts in Scotland and Wales from thoseln England, and we indicated that the implications of this were a matter^0r discussion between them and the profession in the first instance. The^rofession have drawn our attention to the fact that our 1975 recommendationsAltered the relationship established by us in 1973^ between the chief officerSuPplements payable to community physicians in administrative medical posts^d distinction awards.   They have asked that the 1973 relationships should1)6 restored.   We for our part have never taken the view that there should^e a fixed relationship between the chief officer supplements and distinction*ward8, nor do we regard a fixed relationship as appropriate now.   Our 1975Emendations established new relativities within the profession which we^udged to be right at the time.   The profession have told us that, if a contract for hospital consultants along the lines of the proposalsGently under discussion were agreed, they would want to negotiate a new0ntract for community physicians that would incorporate some of the features* that contract, and possibly some features of the general medical^actitioriers1 system of remuneration as well.   They have asked us to expressview on the form that a new contract for community physicians might take,but uwe do not consider it appropriate for us to do so: however, we would likeftetJlew Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Supplement to ThirdPort 1973 - Cmnd 5377, July 1973-\57
CONHUtN I IALCONFIDENTIALto be kept informed of the progress of discussions on a new form of contract for community physicians, as we have been on developments on the consultantcontract.69.   The Health Departments have told us that a new contract has beenagreed for doctors in training posts in community medicine.   At present,trainee community physicians are graded as registrar or senior registrar,and are paid on the equivalent hospital grade salary scale.   From 1 April1978, there will be one training grade only.   The Health Departments have proposed a nine-point salary scale corresponding to the combined registrarand senior registrar scales in the hospital structure, with the object of facilitating assimilation on transfer between the two structures, and ensuring no reduction in the freedom of employing authorities to giveincremental credit.   The profession have suggested a six-point scalespanning the first point above the minimum of the registrar scale and themaximum of the senior registrar scale, in order to provide a measure ofcompensation for potential loss of earnings from Class A/B supplements on leaving the hospital training grades for the new specialty, and becausethe recommended training period in the new specialty does not exceed six years.    A new form of supplement to salary will be payable to communitymedicine trainees in recognition of certain on-call commitments outside1normal working hours .   The payments will relate primarily to duties asmedical officer for environmental health in relation to communicablediseases and food poisoning, for which an emergency rota allowance is currently paid to doctors other than community physicians (or trainees),and for representing their employing authorities at certain committeemeetings held in the evenings.    Like the Class A/B supplements payable tojunior hospital doctors, the supplements for out-of-hours commitments of community medicine trainees will be agreed with their employing authority and written into their contracts: they will also be payable at the ratefor the normal duty week during periods of annual or study leave. Therewill be two rates of supplement: a payment in respect of duty on a weekdaynight from Monday to Friday, and a weekend payment in respect of all dutiesfrom Friday evening to Monday morning.   Other than in exceptional circumstan&apos;a community medicine trainee will not be contracted for a total out-of-hourScommitment that exceeds one night in three and one weekend in three on40 hours a week.58confidMdent,al

The profession have suggested that the rates of supplement should^e ^elated to the level of earnings associated with on-call duties insPital as a clinical assistant, work in a family planning clinic, andemPloyment with a deputising service to provide out-of-hours cover for general practitioners on a sessional basis.   For our part, we agree with the Healthapartments1 proposal for a nine-point scale corresponding to the combinedre8istrar and senior registrar scale.   Moreover, we understand that the form^d period of specialist training in the new specialty is similar to that0^ doctors in clinical specialties at the same level.   We consider thatetnPloying authorities should have discretion to fix the starting salary totalce account of age, experience and qualifications.   Since the responsibility^t falls on community medicine trainees in relation to their environmentalealth on-call duties will be no different from the responsibility thatiB on other community health medical staff in the same circumstances,* would not be appropriate for different rates of payment to apply: ourOnunendations are based on this approach.Community dentistry staff.   There has been a small reduction in the^ber of area dental officer and district dental officer posts that haveen filled in England and Wales, from 1**0 in 1976 to 136 in 1977.Ppointment of regional dental officers continues to be deferred.   We havebeentold by the Health Departments and the profession that community^nt *istry has now been recognised by the Royal College of Surgeons as alalty in its own right, but that this does not imply recognition ofCo^ult,&apos;ant status.   An Advisory Group on Training Posts in Community Dentistrybe 5been set up and procedures have been agreed; as a result, progress ise3cPected to be made towards establishing a number of higher traininggrammes leading to accreditation in the new specialty of communitylgtry.   Until the consultant status issue is resolved, we shall continueier recommendations affecting the eligibility of community dentists for action awards.   We have again been asked by the profession to restorerelationship between area dental officers and community medicinelalists that were establihsed by the recommendations in the SeconduPplement to our Third Report in 1973-   We have given careful considerationth6 profession&apos;s proposal, but we are unable to agree with it. The*QrresPonding grade in the administrative medical structure to the area^      officer is the area medical officer, and the corresponding grade in^^&quot;^trative dental officer structure to the district communitylcian (and community medicine specialist) is the district dental officer.59

The number of community health medicalstaff (senior clinical medical officers , clinical medical officers and othermedical staff) in England and Wales increased by 2.6 per cent to 7,036 in1977.   After consultation with interested organisations, the Government has accepted the general concept of an integrated child health service on the2lines recommended by the Committee on Child Health Services .    But theCommittee&apos;s proposal that there should be two new classes of doctors - general practitioner paediatricians and consultant community paediatricians - has notbeen accepted.   The intention is that the provision of specialist paediatricservices should be available increasingly on a community basis, and that allgeneral medical practitioners should in future have adequate training inchild health and should play a greater role in preventive work, particularly for children below school age.   Since it will not be possible for general medical practitioners to take over responsibility for all preventive work formany years to come, a need is seen for other doctors with appropriate traininSto provide preventive services, particularly in schools, and to strengthen the services provided in under-doctored areas.   The Health Departments intend to discuss with the profession the future career structure for community health medical staff in the light of these developments.   The professions have again proposed that, in principle, the existing structure should be regardedas consisting of a career grade (senior clinical medical officer) and a training grade (clinical medical officer) although both are nominally careergrades.   When we considered this proposal in 1975&quot;^, we said that we could no attempt to anticipate possible changes in the future career structure of community health medical staff and we still take that view.   We have takenaccount in our recommendations of the agreed increase from 4 weeks to 5 wein the annual leave entitlement of those clinical medical officers who arenot at present eligible for 5posts in community medicine).1The senior medical officer grade has been renamed senior clinical medical officer.2The Report of the Committee on Child Health Services: Chairman, ProfessorS D M Court - Cmnd 6684, December 1976.^Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, Fifth Report 1975Cmnd 6032, April 1975 (paragraph 66).^Clinical medical officers on the first 7 points of the salary scale (an0&quot;registrars in community medicine).not at present eligible for 5 weeks annual leave^ (and for doctors in train^confidential confidential

CONFIDENTIALUlAPrER 8 - SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS75.   We have explained why we believe it to have been in the interest of doctors and dentists themselves, as well as of the community as a whole, that observance of the restraint measures should take precedence over our normal criteria in assessing the amounts within the up-to-date rates of remuneration to beintroduced immediately.   We are satisfied that the increases which we recommendin doctors, and dentists&apos; remuneration for immediate introduction with effect from 1 April 1978 are consistent with the Government&apos;s current guidelines , andWe summarise our main recommendations below:Recommendedscales from1 April 1978Fully up-to-datescales appropriate to 1 April 1978hospital doctors and dentists (main grades)(whole-time salaries)(excluding earnings from Class A/Bsupplements for training grades)House officers	minimum	3,420	( 3,897 )	maximum	3,876	( 4,407 )Senior house officers	minimum	4,257	( 4,881 )	maximum	4,767	( 5,535 )Registrars	minimum	4,767	( 5,535 )	maximum	5,766	( 6,696 )Senior registrars	minimum	5,460	( 6,345 )	maximum	6,990	( 8,100 )The above scales take- into account adjustment for the change in the basisof remuneration to relate basic pay to the standard working week, and theCQet of one week&apos;s extra leave for senior house officers and registrars.The effect of consolidating the 1976 and 1977 cash supplements will be to**cre.V5o individual earnings from Class A/B supplements over and above the increases implied by the recommended scales.Consultantsminimummaximum9,52812,084Community .lo-tors and dentists   (selected grades)(whole-time salaries)Clinical medical officers      minimum 5,175maximum 7,155Dental officers                       minimum 4,896maximum 7,137The^(11,325 )(14,361 )( 6,012 )( 8,292 )( 5,691 )( 8,283 )Attack on Inflation after 3Jf&amp;N^EJWlAC Cmnd 6882&apos; July 1977 *

We estimate the overall cost of these increases and of agreed improvements in conditions of service,including provision for practice expenses and employer^ superannuation and national insurance contributions, to be about  66.2 million or 10.0 per cent of netremuneration in 1977-78.76.    The levels of salary indicated in italics in this table are those that wejudge to be appropriate for introduction on 1 April 1978 in the light of theevidence already available to us and of our normal criteria, were it not forthe existence of the current restraint measures.   Implementation of these rates would involve a further increase of  135 million or 18.5 per cent inoverall net remuneration.77.   By comparison with others in the community at the same income levels in 19751junior hospital doctors and dentists have fared not too badly following theintroduction of their new contract.   But consultants have fared particularlybadly over the same period, and most general medical practitioners and general dental practitioners have not done much better.   Over the next 12 months, their relative position will deteriorate further.   Because of this, we feel bound tofocus attention yet again on the demonstrable injustice of the impact of successive stages of restraint measures on pay systems and structures withwhich they were not designed to be compatible.   The up-to-date rates of remuneratispeak for themselves.   The consequences for the community will be increasinglyserious if members of the medical and dental professions continue to be subjectedco treatment that is so patently discriminatory.   We regard it as essential thatthe^ates of pay based on those indicated in italics in the table above, updated in light of the relevant information at the time should be introduced in not more ththree stages - of which our present recommendations are the first - and should he64confidential

The differencebetween the levels of pay that we recommend for implementation now and those that we judge to be appropriate is the measure of the extent to whichremuneration has fallen below the true worth of the professions since 1 April1975* We see an assurance that it will be brought fully up-to-date no later than 1 April 1980 as essential to the restoration of a measure of confidence in the future treatment of doctors and dentists in the NHS.VOFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICSk April 1978 CONFIDENTIAL65CONFIDENTIAL

LUNMUtN I IMLIMJLAPPENDIX DSlJKVEY OF CONSULTANTS&apos; PATTERN OF WORK AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THENATI0NAL HEALTH SERVICEand purpose in July 1977, the Office of Manpower Economics carried out a survey of thetern of work and responsibilities within the National Health Service of doctors and dentists on behalf of the Review Body.   Information was col-*ected by questionnaire from a sample of consultants employed in the National^e^lth Service.   The purpose of the survey was to provide information to assistpricing of a new consultant contract on the lines of the pro-^aLs that were then under discussion between the professions and the HealthIlL^ Partments in a special Joint Working Group, and also to assist the Joint0rking Group in their discussions. Members of the Joint Working Groupconsulted on the design and piloting of the questionnaire and inWlng the sample.    At the request of the British Medical Association and the^university Grants Committee the scope of the survey was extended to cover the^tivities within the NHS of honorary contract holders as well as of NHS paidl* the^^tants; information about the honorary contract holders, other than on theQf response, has not been included in this analysis.h copy of the survey questionnaire is at Annex A.    The questionnaire wasP^red in the course of June 1977 and, after being piloted among some kO^Itants in three hospitals, was despatched in early July to the home addressesOf a sample of consultants.    Information was sought on the hours spentOft tune basic clinical commitment, on preparation for and attendance at NHS^committees, and on NHS administrative duties, both in an average week and inCu**rent week of the survey, and on undergraduate teaching in an averageThe questionnaire also asked about the extent of on-call commitmentsrequired immediate availability to deal with emergency admissions and the^Uency and duration of emergency recalls to hospital.   The questionnaire didcover post-graduate teaching under an approved programme, domiciliary oroptional consultations, or lectures, since no change in their method of^ration was envisaged; neither did it cover research activities for thereason.8kCONTOWHft4TlAL

The main sample wastaken from lists held by the British Medical Association which included non-members and were classified by region and specialty.   Subsidiary sample listscovering dental consultants and honorary contract holders were provided by the health Departments.    The total sample drawn was 3,152 but, because the listswere not quite complete and because they included some consultants that were out of the scope of the survey (for example, retired, or no longer holding aconsultant appointment etc), the sample actually represented just over 20 percent, instead of the 25 per cent that had been planned, of all consultants at30 September 1976.Response (Table 1)4. The Response to the survey is in Table 1.   As explained in the footnoteto the table, the usable response received by the closing date was 51 Per cent of the estimated valid sample, or a little over 10 per cent of all consultants.The table shows that the response was reasonably well balanced betweenspecialities and between types of contract, except for a low response frompart-time consultants, other than those with maximum part-time contracts.Since it was important that the results of the survey should be correctly bal-anced between the different types of contract and the main specialty groups,the usable survey response relating to 1,24-5 NHS medical and dental consultantswas grossed to the total population of consultants for eleven groupings ofspecialities (based on che groups shown in Annex B) within each of the fourtypes of contract (whole-time, maximum part-time, other part-time and honorary)&apos;Excluding the honorary contract holders, the average sample size in each ofthese sub-groups before grossing was 38, and the average grossing factor about10.    Locums who were not asked to complete the main part of the questionnairehave been excluded from the analysis.5-   The response rate to the survey was just over half and, although it was noas good as had been hoped, it is nevertheless considered adequate in the absen ^of any evidence of significant general bias in the response.   While a surveyon returns from one in ten consultants provides acceptable sampling errors forthe main results of the survey (see paragraph 17 below and Table 13), it als0means that those parts of the survey that are based on small sample numberssubject to very large sampling errors, and should be used with some caution-Similarly the more extreme figures in ranges may be suspect for reasons ofsampling bias, or perhaps from errors in the returns.coiM?.fiaitfAP8NT,AL

Part-time consultants on contracts of less than 9 sessions a weekaveraged 29-4 hours.    In whole-time equivalent terms, part-time consultantsworked longer hours than whole-time consultants.   Although average hours perconsultant (in whole-time equivalent terms) were less in post-graduateteaching hospitals than in other types of hospital, additional hours willhave been spent on post-graduate teaching which was not covered by the survey(paragraph 2).   About one in every nine consultants had administrativecharge of an X-ray or pathology department, and the average time spent onadministration by these consultants was 5-5 hours.   The average time spenton administration by all consultants was 3-5 hours.Availability for immediate recall and duration of recalls (Table 3)9. Consultants were asked about their commitment to be immediately available by telephone for recall to hospital to deal with emergency admissions otherthan as required for the care of their own patients.   As explained in footnote(a) to Table 3, certain specialties were regarded by the Health Departments andthe professions as not being liable to this type of duty, and any reportedavailability for immediate recall in these specialties has been excluded fromthe analysis.   More than half of all consultants were required on at least one occasion during each week on average to be immediately available for recallto hospital to deal with emergency admissions or other emergencies.   The averageamount of time spent by consultants in attending either to their own patientsor to new patients admitted in an emergency outside normal working hours was2.1 hours per week.10.

For allCtivities, over one-third of whole-time and maximum part-time consultants workedurs or more and, in general surgery, pathology, geriatrics and diseases ofchest nearer one-half did so.    In paediatrics, three-fifths of consultants^ked longer than these hours, and at least seven out of eight exceeded the not-^ f :11 week.

The greatest commitment to continuouson-call for emergency admission (nearly one in four consultants) was ininfectious diseases and dental surgery and the least such commitment (aroundone in fifteen consultants) was in anaesthetics and general medicine. Overall,some kk per cent of consultants had no recalls in the current week, but theposition varied greatly by specialty from only about one in ten consultantsin paediatrics to fewer than one in five in general surgery and infectious diseases.   On average, consultants reported recall to hospital outside their normal working hours between once and twice during the week of the survey,either to attend to their own patients or to new patients admitted in anemergency: the estimated average duration of each recall (including travelingtime) was ij hours.   The specialties with the greatest average incidence ofemergency recall were paediatrics and general surgery, and these together withanaesthetics also had the longest average total duration.of call-out (between4J and 5 hours).   Consultants in dermatology and pathology had the fewestemergency recalls and the shortest length of call-out.Chairmanships and memberships of NHS committees (Tables 8 and 9)13*   Table 8 shows the relationship between the number of chairmanships andmemberships of NHS professional and management committees held by consultants,and the hours spent by them on attendance and preparation (these hours may havebeen somewhat overstated, as explained in the footnote).    Table 9 providesadditional detail about the chairmen and members of certain specific NHS management committees.   Some 95 per cent of consultants were members of one or moreprofessional committees and about one in six consultants of five or more; inaddition, about two-thirds of all consultants sat on management committees, DUunder 10 per cent sat on more than three.

On the whole, the table indicates a fairly wide range of differences in^e between current and average weeks. In the case of clinical work, the differ-8 largely average out but, when NIB committee work and administration areC^-Uded, current week hours tend to be rather shorter than average week hours.j     is probably due to the fact that the survey had to be carried out in July when^ r NHS committee meetings take place because of the leave season. On the basist^is information,most of the analyses have been based on average week hours.90CONFQBENF1AE N TIA L
CONFIDENTIALSampling errors (Table 13)17*   Any sample is subject to sampling variations.   The magnitude of thesedepends upon the standard deviation (the square root of the average sumof squares of differences of variables from their mean) and the number inthe sample.   These two factors can be used to derive the standard error,and there are nineteen chances in twenty that the mean in a sample willnot vary from the true mean by more than two standard errors.   The table shows that for total hours and their main component (clinical work) thepossibility of sampling error in the survey is negligible.     This doesnot preclude other forms of error, like bias in the responses.OFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICS91CONr%BlWftENT,AL

Whole-time equivalent (WTE): Where results are given on a whole-timeequivalent basis, recalls for part-time consultants (other than those for maximum part-time consultants which have been included withoutadjustment in the same way as those for whole-time consultants) havebeen adjusted on a pro-rata basi6 to the contracted number of notionalhalf-day sessions per week (out of a maximum of 11 per week).3-    Rounding: Because the figure for each item is rounded to the nearestdigit shown, the sum of these rounded items across or down a table maynot exactly equal the total.4.   Reliability: Means for items or analysis by ranges that are based onsmall sample numbers should be treated with caution: the data given inTable 1 provide a guide to the sample numbers on which each item is based.Similarly, extreme values shown in ranges, where these represent small numbers of consultants, will be less reliable for sampling and other reasons than the less extreme figures.   Selected standard deviationsand standard errors (derived from ungrossed data) are shown in Table 13*93CONFIDfiWftffiDENT,AL
