^UMENTIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 34 COPY no. 7 March 1978CABINETEMPLOYMENT MEASURES - CLAIMS ON the contingency RESERVEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General&apos; The paper by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(78) 30) recommendsat employment measures already discussed by Ministers should be accepted?,8a charge on the Contingency Reserve for 1978-79, at a cost of  155 million,s figure includes  13 million for Northern Ireland and takes account of amillion offset from Manpower Services Commission (MSC) expenditure^   c^ remains to be finally agreed.    These are all proposals which haveyGen recommended by the Ministerial Group on Unemployment Amongstng People (GEN 27) and, with one minor exception, already agreed by cabinet.    They are -a. Temporary Employment Subsidy (TES) and the temporaryscheme for the support of short time working(CM(78) 8th Conclusions, Minute 3).b. Small Firms Employment Subsidy - to be extended to coverAssisted Areas and Inner City Partnership Areas(CM(78) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 6).c. Job Release Scheme (JRS) - Cabinet approved the extensionof this scheme from Assisted Areas to the whole country. they asked GEN 27 to consider further the appropriate level of paymentunder the scheme (CM(78) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 6).    At presentJRS provides a tax free allowance of  26. 50 per week for up to ayear for employees within one year of the state pension age who leave their jobs and the employer agrees to recruit a replacement fromthe unemployment register.    Cabinet rejected the idea that the allowance might be increased to  40 a week tax free.    GF.N 27 now recommended that, as from 1 July 1978, the following allowances shouldbe paid, still tax free - for a single person and a married personwhose spouse has an income after tax of more than  8. 50 perweek -  26. 50for a married person supporting a husband or wife -  35.1
GEN 27 believe that this dual level of allowance adequately meets the criticism made of the  40 per week proposal that such a high rate would put the allowance out of line with existing benefits, particularly retirement pensions, and with actual earnings of many low paid.    It should increasethe register effect of JRS from 17, 500 to 22, 500.    The increased cost is allowed for within the  155 million which the Chief Secretary recommendsshould be set aside for employment measures.OTHER MEASURES CONSIDERED BY GEN 272. When Cabinet considered the employment measures covered inparagraph 1 above they also asked GEN 27 to consider any additionalproposals for relieving unemployment, including the suggestion by theSecretary of State for the Environment that the Development commission might have an enhanced role in relieving unemployment.a. The Development Commission3. The Secretary of State for the Environment proposed that an extra 4.4 million should be made available to the Development Commission in1978-79 with continuation of the grant-in-aid at the 1978-79 level in subsequent years.    This would enable the Commission to fund an ongoingprogramme of factory building providing 1, 500 jobs per annum, to meet theadditional demands expected on the Council for Small Industries in rural areas (CoSIRA) a loan fund to expand the CoSIRA advisory and trainingservices, and, subject to the outcome of the current review by the Secretaryof State for Trade of the possible extension on similar lines of assistance totourism under the Development of Tourism Act, to extend the tourism loansbeyond the Development Areas to which they were at present restricted.GEN 27 recognised that some of the new jobs which would result if theDevelopment Commission had more funds would have been created anywayin other locations.    However they noted that, in England, only through theDevelopment Commission could special stimulus be given to employment in rural areas and that it was helpful politically for the Government to be seen as responsive to the needs of those areas.    There should also be a furthermeasure of assistance to small firms.    They accoidingly favoured theSecretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposal.    If an extra  4.4 million were made available to the Development Commission their total grant-in-aidin 1978-79 would be  14. 5 million.b. Further educational measures to combat youth unemployment4. The Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP) includes provision forfurther education and training associated with work experience. the manpower Services Commission (MSC) want this to be a substantial element in all work experience opportunities, but in my view local educationauthorities need more resources than the YOP budget at present provides for if they are to respond effectively.    I proposed to GEN 27 that an extra2
 7.0 million thould be channelled to local education authorities throughthe MSC in 1978-79 to increase education and training provision in theYOP, to provide associated facilities, and to prepare teachers for this work.5. i also proposed to GEN 27 that an extra  1. 5 million in 1978-79should be made available to the MSC to contribute towards the costs of voluntary organisations, particularly youth organisations, involved in theco-ordination, provision and supervision of community serviceopportunities within the yop.    This would enable voluntary organisations to fund more posts.    I think this is essential if the target of 15, 000opportunities in the Community Services field is to be met.6. Finally I recommend that  2. 5 million should be made availableto enable the MSC to continue its support of the programme cabinet approved last year for the retraining and training of teachers in shortagesubjects such as mathematics, physical sciences and craft, design and technology.    Some of these teachers are qualified but unemployed, others are seconded and their posts should be filled by other teachers seeking jobs7. Subject to further consultation between the Departments concerned and the MSC, most members of GEN 27 supported the desirability of proposals on these lines, which would improve the quality of the yop, allo\for the appointment of about 300 staff to voluntary organisations, and provide 750 training or retraining places for teachers.    Some doubt was,however, expressed in GEN 27 as to whether, in view of the demographictrend, Local Education Authorities (LEAs) would be willing to expand theFurther Education contribution to yop if it meant employing more teachers and whether the MSC budget did not already cover support to voluntary organisations.    It should be noted, however, that even without any increase in the participation rate the demographic trend will not begin to affect the post-school age group before 1982.    LEAs are ready and willingto expand their provision for the young unemployed in the meantime if theyare given the resources to do so.    With regard to the second point, theMSC Programme allows only for the appointment of project supervisorsfrom among the unemployed, and there must be doubt as to whether the target of places will be reached without additional staff to prepare and runcommunity service schemes.8. The total cost of my package would be  11 million in 1978-79 for england and Wales.    I understand that the Secretary of State for scotland would support similar measures as they apply to the yop at a cost of aboutil million.9. Cabinet are asked -a. To approve new levels of payment for JRS, the cost of whichis already included in the  155 million claim on the Contingency Resfor Employment measures recommended by the Chief Seer etary.3
b. To consider the case for -i. An additional  4.4 million for the development commission.ii. An additional  9.5 million for the MSC to combatyouth unemployment (see paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8 above).iii. An additional  2. 5 million to allow Training ServicesAgency supported training schemes for teachers in shortagesubjects to continue for a further year (see paragraph 6 above).S WePartment of Education and Science7 March 19784
