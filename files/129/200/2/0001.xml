DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 27 COPY NO 303 March 1978CABINETCHILD BENEFITMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. From April this year the rate of child benefit will be  2. 30 a week for each child, with a premium of  1 a week for the first child in one-parent families.    The present rate is  1 a week for the first child,   1. 50 for others.2. At their meeting on 22 February the Home and Social AffairsCommittee reached a broad conclusion, on the merits and without referenceto other public expenditure bids, that child benefit should be increased to separately of  4 a week by April 1979.    The Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister for Social Security had proposed  4. 30 but had indicated that 4 would be acceptable - a figure which was also broadly acceptable to theChief Secretary, Treasury.3. There was no disagreement about a further proposal that the premium for one-parent families should be doubled to become  2.4. The question on which the Committee&apos;s views were divided was whether the increase should be staged (70p in November 1978 and  1 in April1979) or take place all at once in April 1979.    An April 1979 increase of atleast  1 is in any case necessary if the phasing out of the remaining childtax allowance (CTA) for under-lls (65p) is to be offset and if no-onereceiving housing benefits is to be worse off.5. The options are set out and costed at C and D in the table below. Aand B are included as background and for comparisons:1

The Secretary of State for Social Services and the Minister fcr social security see strong political advantages in a November uprating. TheTrades Union Congress (TUC) and Labour Party, and their joint working party on child benefit, have called for this.    It would bring earlier andvisible relief to 7 million mothers;   by November every order book would show the new rate either by its inclusion in recently issued books or by the over-stamping of older books.    A rate of  3 in November would make it possible for us to claim that we had done more than the Tories had everdone (even at the 1971 peak) for two-children families under 16.7. The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s view was that the Government hadno reason to be ashamed of the  2. 30 level of child benefit which would bereached in April this year at a net extra cost of  300 million.    It would takethe real value of family support for most families, ie those with youngerchildren, above the level left by the Tories.    An announcement, whichcould be made in the Budget or later this year, that the rate was to beincreased to  4 in April 1979 would put the Government in a strong positionto ward off any attacks.    Such an increase would concentrate the maximumimpact when pay packets were being cut by the withdrawal of the remainingtax allowances for under-lls;  and it would provide leeway in April to enablethe Government to withdraw the allowances for older children as well, thuscompleting the child benefit phasing-in and, incidentally, securing InlandRevenue staff savings (of 800) a year earlier than planned.    By contrast aNovember uprating would involve some  800, 000 extra administrative costs.2
8. There was strong support in the Committee for a November uprating.Of those members of the Committee who expressed a choice betweenNovember/April and April only upratmgs, a majority favoured November/April;  but others reserved their position pending Cabinet discussion ofother claims on the 1978-79 contingency reserve.    I must make it clear thatall present fully understood that a final decision wouid have to await cabinet discussion and conclusions on the use of the contingency reserve. doubt was expressed about the public impact of two smaller increases as comparedwith one larger increase when the loss of CTAs and other benefits were taken into account.    The Secretary of State for Social Services and theMinister for Social Security were therefore invited to circulate a notesetting out the implication for family income of the two options (CP(78) 29).Some apprehension was also expressed that a November uprating would create pressure for six-monthly upratings of pension and other benefits,although the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Minister for social Security see no real difficulty in resisting this.conclusions . The Cabinet are asked -a. To endorse the proposal for an increase in child benefit to  4by April 1979.b. To decide whether this should take effect whoLy in April 1979or whether there should be a first uprating of 70p in November thisyear, leaving  1 for April 1979.M RHome Office2 March 19783
