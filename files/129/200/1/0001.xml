S DOCUMENT IS THE FROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTonCP(78) 26 COPY NO1 March 1978CABINETTEMPORARY SCHEME OF SUPPORT FOR SHORT TIMEWORKINGNote by the Secretary of State for employment the Cabinet will be considering at its meeting on 2 March the outcome ofmy negotiations with the Commission on Temporary Employment Subsidy(TES).    It is my intention to announce a new temporary scheme of support for short-time working at the same time as my announcement on TES. Thisis essential in view of the assurance given by the Prime Minister and myselfthat the reduction in jobs saved by TES resulting from negotiations with theCommission would be offset by other employment measures.    I attach amemorandum on a short-time working scheme which is being considered bya Ministerial Group (GEN 27) immediately prior to Cabinet.    The Group&apos;conclusions will be reported to the Cabinet to enable decisions to be taken onthe scheme as well as on TES.A BDepartment of employment March 1978
(confidential)TEMPORARY SCHEME OF SUPPORT FOR SHORT TIME WORKINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment The Group agreed on 30 January that I should consult employers and unions in the  textiles,   clothing ana footwear sectors about a possioietemporary scheme of compensation for short time working in those industries,  along the lines set out in GEN 27  (78) 5*2 We have met the employers oh two occasions and their views a^creasonably clear.    We nave also met the TUC Textiles Committee twiceand while their formal position is that they do not want any change inthe TES and would prefer not to discuss alternatives,  we nave been aMeto obtain a pretty gooo idea of their views.3 The understanding I have reached with Commissioner Vouel wouldmean a cut of about one third   (some 32,000 -  37,000 subsidies) in thenumber of TES subsidies going to the textiles,   clothing anc footwearsectors.     So the snort-time scheme we are considering is not one toreplace the whole of TES in the sectors in question but one whichwould form one part of a joint TES/short-time scheme.    Its ieatureswould bo.as described in GEN 27  (78)  5 -  that is to say workers would receive 75% of gross earnings for each days work lost and employers would be compensated  100% for the cost from the Exchequer.
L _-(confidential)k.      Such a scheme would cost  &apos;i5 million gross offset by savings of 30 million 0:1 TES because of the cut-backs in that scheme. after allowing for lower displacement,   it would preserve  37,000 workers from unemployment ie it would be an equivalent compensation for theloss of TES.An Extra Six months-      The main point to emerge  from our consultations with the employersand unions is that they are both very strongly opposed to any diminutionin the TES -  the TUC,  as the Group know,   to the point of believing that we should refuse to reach any accommodation with the Commission.For their part,   the employers point out that while a  scheme of support for short time working ameliorates the situation for workers threatened with redundancy,   it does nothing whatsoever for the firm.    There issubstance  in this point and we have considered the possibility ofproviding some kind of guarantee  for bank loans,  as a way of helpingemployers who lose TES with    their cash flow problems.     I understand the      DI would see difficulty in such an idea but the main objection isthat it falls foul again of the Commission^ objections to supportingfirms  in the three industries.6. Both employers and unions,   therefore,   considered short time workingsupport a poor substitute for the TES.    Both made the point independentlythat they would think it a more adequate replacement if it could be made,available not only during the l8 month period of payment of the TES,but for a period afterwards.    We have worked      out the cost in the threesectors of providing six months support of short time working afterthe expiry of l8 months of TES and /or short time support. Ourestimate  is  15 million gross  in a year.7. This  is on the assumption that the six months extra support is available only to firms coming off TES supplement  in the future. Ifit were to be made available to firms  in textiles,   etc,  which haveexhausted TES in the past,  the gross cost would be about doubled to 30 million.8-      We have pointed out to both employers and unions that the questionof extending assistance in redundancy situations beyond eighteen monthsis not one that arises out of the e.c. negotiations.     Our purpose in proposing the short time scheme has been to replace TES lost during thelo month      period of its payment.     It  is also the case that a concession to the three sectors along the lines suggested could leadto pressure for a  similar concession to other industries,   though this could be easily countered by saying that industries other than textiles,etc, vere not suffering cutbacks  in TES support.(confidential)
9. On the other hand,  there is no doubt that an extra six months of support for firms that have exhausted TES in the  past as well as forrpfirms which exhaust it in the future would reconcile both sides of theindustries concerned to the partial loss    of TES and I have no doubtthat the same would be true of public opinion generally in the areasaffected.    We have had detailed discussions with the parliamentary labour Party and there is no doubt also that they would regardan extra period of support as being necessary but sufficient toplacate opinion in Lancashire and the West Riding.10. Moreover,   the Prime Minister and I have both given firm assurances that reductions in the scope of the TES will be replaced by equivalentsupport under an alternative scheme and I have used the expression&quot;equivalent support for employment&quot;.    Within its inherent limitationsthe short time scheme proposed fulfils these assurances in the sense that,   after allowing for less displacement,  an equivalentnumber of workers are preserved from unemployment. Inevitablyhowever,   the workers concerned will be on short time and there isa sense,  therefore,  i;-. which there will not be an equivalent amountof employment saved.    Moreover,  the calculation depends on takingcredit for a lower level of displacement,  a difficult concept to putacross publicly and open to  argument in detail.     I think we wouldbe in a stronger position for saying we hod honoured our pledges ifwe could provide the extra six months support on the lines indicatedin the last paragraph.    It would preserve ^0,000 workers fromunemployment for 6 months or 20,000 for a year  (the latter figurebeing comparable with others in this paper).Short-time in other than Redundancy Situations11.    Two other points on which I should like to consult the Groupcame up in our discussions with the employers.    The first concerns
compensation to employers-    The scheme of support for short time appliesonly where short time is an alternative to redundancy.    Short time isfrequently worked in other circumstances and our original proposal was that in such cases workers should get 75% of earnings as under our &quot;scheme but employers should be compensated as to 50% only of the costcompared with 100% under the scheme.    The employers have reactedstrongly against this,  pointing out that after they have met theirobligation to pay for five days loss of work per quarter under theEmployment Protection Act,   short time is at present supported by theUB system which costs them nothing directly.    The 50% proposal isborrowed from our long term plans for supporting short time and it mayget a hostile reception there.    Nevertheless,  there are difficulties in getting the two schemes out of line at this stage.12.    The problem can be minimised by restricting the provision of75% of earnings  to workers  on short time in the same establishmentas other workers being supported by TES/short time.    In other words,workers on short time outside such establishments,  would continue-to be supported under the EP Act and UB system.    I think if I wereto make this clear to the employers it would greatly reduce their objection to  the  &quot;50% of compensation&quot;  proposal.    The point has notyet come up in discussion with the TUC,   but I think that from their point of view too the distinction I am drawing should not seemunreasonable.
NI Contributions13.    The other point raised by the employers was that they would haveto pay increased NI contributions on the 75% of earnings payable for short time working and this ought to be covered in the 100%compensation we were offering,,     From April,  NI contributions areequal to 10% of earnings plus 2% surcharge if a firm is not contracted out for pensions.     Employers have a clear case for compensation underthis head,  bearing in mind that they are effectively acting as agents for the Government in paying the workers on short time.    The dangerwould be that the workers also might ask to be compensated for theirincreased NI contributions  (6J%).     I think this ir,ust be resisted asthe whole benefit of the arrangement is flowing to the workers, notthe employers,   and as the earnings they get under the scheme will, inthe normal way,  be subject to tax as well as NI contributions. Thecost of compensating the employers for their share would be an extra 5 million gross.     Similarly,  an extra six months short time support(for firms which have exhausted or will exhaust tes)  which has beencosted at  30 million above would involve an extra cost of 3 million for increased NI contributions.Other^Indus triesThe re is one other small item of cost.    The settlement withthe Commission will result in some small cutback in the amount ofTES available to industries other than textiles,   clothing andfootwear,   ic through come loss of TES supplement and possibly throughthe operation of the procedure for notifying important applications inadvance.    This is a minor matter, but I think a firm in any industry which has to be refused TES through the operation of the proceduresagreed with the Commission should at least be considered for short time support.    This is hard to cost but  5 million should besufficient provision.    I would not propose to give this the usualpublicity but to hold it in reserve.    There would be offsetting savings in TES costs of  3 million-Legal Aspects(15*    I have considered the legal aspects of the proposed scheme andthe implications for the social security system.    So far as thetemporary scheme is  concerned,   legal cover is provided by the[Employment Subsidies Bill at present going through Parliament. The(confidential)
guaranteed payment provisions of the Employment Protection Actstand and the right of workers on short ti:;ie to claim unemploymentbenefit remains.    Employers, in agreement with trade unions concerned would be free to apply under the proposed scheme for support for the workers on short time  (as a body),  but they wouldbe equally free not to apply and to finance any short time workingsome other way,  eg under a negotiated agreement as in the footwearindustry,  or through the U3 system.    If they came in, employers&apos;payments under the Ejr    Act would be compensated under the scheme.Double payment should net be possible as UB is not payable fordays in respect of which earnings are received.    However, Iunderstand the DIiSS propose to put the position beyond doubt bymalting regulations sp&apos;eci ictOLly Lo exclude tne payment of U3 fordays covered by payments unaG-.- the temporary scheme. TneEEC Commission have no objection to a scheme of support for short time working and it is not thought that they would object to theproposal to compensate for increased NI contributions.Openative Date16. We have told the Commission that we will not modify the TESuntil we are in a position to introduce alternative arrangements.The figures in this paper are on the assumption that a new short time scheme would be introduced in mid-l&apos;2ay.    That will just aboutgive us time to make the necessary administrative arrangements.17. I would propose to present the new scheme as an elaboration of the TES scheme.    In o^acr words,  there would be a specialsection of the TES scheme covering the textiles,  clothing andfootwear sectors and comprehending TES and short time support.(confidential&quot;)i
conclusionl8.     The various cost figures I have mentioned are summarised in the annex.    The total gross costs are  55 million after allowing for savings on TES due to cut-backs negotiated with the Commission. 32 million of this would fall on the contingency reserve in1978-79 and  23 million would be a charge on 1979-80. after allowing for savings in unemployment benefit,   the net cost is nil.19-     It is relevant that the extension of T2S on its present basis for a year from 1 April  1973 was approved by the Cabinet on the basis that it would cost  223 million.     We are now able to estimate theactual out turn for 1977-78 and this,   in turn,   enables us to revise the estimate for 1978-79.    We now believe the cost for 1978-79 wouldbe  55 million less ie  168 million (the figure quoted in the Annex).This re-estimation reduces the claim on the contingency reserves in1978-79 and 1979-80 compared with what was previously expected and is relevant to the additional  changes.    I am now proposing for a short time scheme.20. There would be some additional staff cost involved in running ashort time scheme but it would be fully offset by savings in staff employed on the administration of unemployment benefit.21. I therefore recommend expenditure on a temporary short timescheme of  55 million ( 32 million in 1978-79)made up of:-    a)     ^5 million  (offset by  30 millionsavings on TES cutjbacks)to replace TESsubsidies lost in textiles,   clothing andfootwear as a result of Comois&amp;ionDdemands.b)  5 million (offset by  3 million savings onTES cut backs)  to  replace T2S subsidies lost in other industries.c)  30 million to  provide an extra 6 monthssupport for short time working in firms inthe textiles clothing and footwear sectorswhich have exhausted TES in the past or will do so in the next  12 months.d)  8 million to compensate employers for increasedNI contribution on the earnings paid to workers on short time.7Department of Employment, SW1 AEB27 February 1978
