DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 49COPY NO26 April 1978CABINETDRAFT WHITE PAPER ON INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster GeneralBACKGROUND1. When the Bullock Committee report on industrial democracy in theprivate sector was published in January 1977 the Secretary of State for trade reaffirmed the Governments manifesto commitment to a radicalextension of industrial democracy through the representation of work-peopleon company boards and on the boards of nationalised industries, and to theessential role of the trade unions in this process.    Consultation with the confederation of British Industry (CHI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC)were piomised and a reference made to legislative proposals this session.2. Lengthy consultations with the CBI and the TUC have shown thedifficulty of devising proposals which   could have the support of both sides of industry.    There are also substantial differences of view within the tradeunion movement.    The TUC support for Composite Motion No 10 (Annex A)at Congress last September simply patched over the differences between those who want to develop industrial democracy along traditional collective bargaining lines and those who want board representation in order to 3harein responsibility for management.     The CBI, whilst formally supoorting inprinciple the need for fallback legislation for a right of consultation belowboard level, oppose employee representatives on boards and are disposedagainst any proposals which appear to ignore the position of non-unionisedemployees.THE WHITE papers. The draft put forward under cover of the Note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP(78) 48) is that broadly endorsed by the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy (EY) at their meeting on 12 April and amended inminor respects in the light of that discussion.    Whilst the Paper provides a firm Government commitment to legislate for below board level consulta-tion as well as board representation it is also intended as a further step inthe Government&apos;s consultations prior to the framing of legislation and hassubstantial &quot;green edges&quot;.    Legislation will not be possible in this parliament.1
CONSULTATION WITH THE TUC AND CBI4a EY invited me together with the Secretaries of State for employment and for Trade, to let the CBI and TUC see the draft and to hear their comments,    As expected, neither are very happy with it.     This is unavoidable-able.    To satisfy one would mean complete rejection by the other and no real prospect of workable legislationo    But neither totally rejected it, andI hope that it will be possible, within the framework of the proposals in theWhite Paper, to move on from the Bullock debate to discussion about thepractical issues involved in implementation of the proposals the White Paperputs forward.    The views of the TUC were summarised in my minute to thePrime Minister, dated 18 April.     The CBI&apos;s main concern related to theproposal that the ctatutory right to consultation would be conferred on aJoint Representation Committee (JRC) which excluded non-trade unionistsexcept by agreement;  the size of companies to which the right to consulta-tion should apply;  the proposal for a statutory right to board representation(though they accepted that there was no room for comprcmise on theprinciple involved);   and the involvement of the Advisory Conciliation and arbitration Service (ACAS).    The main questions arising from the TUC andCBI consultations which I think Cabinet should consider are:-a. Constitution of the Joint Representation committee we explained to the CBI that the JRC would have to be broadlyrepresentative of the trade unions in the company which in turnwould have to be broadly representative of the employees as a whole(paragraph 11).      They considered however that as we had been willing in regard to the selection of board representatives(paragraph 36) to consider possible solutions which would recognise the position of non-trade unionists we should also be willing to do soin respect of the composition of the JRC.     We put to the CBI the differences between the two circumstances which could justify a difference of approach and draw attention to the risk that an attemptto require the JRC to be representative of both union members and non-unionists would frustrate the objective of developing consultation,which the CBI share with us.    There are deep differences of view between the CBI and the TUC on this issue and any attempt to meetthe CBI will invite TUC criticism.    But if the Cabinet wished tomove towards the CBI&apos;s view then it may wish to consider the revisedparagraph 11 at Annex E.b. Limit on minimum size of Companies to which theStatutory Right, to Consultation would apply.The White Paper proposes (paragraph 8) a minimum limit of 500employees.     The CBI thought that this would bring in many smallcompanies, often not heavily unionised, and could disrupt existingvoluntary consultation arrangements.    The TUC on the other hand,wanted 200 to be the limit.    We explained to the CBI that we hadfixed on 500 to distinguish more clearly between the application of2
the right to consultation and the right to board representation (where we propose to accept the Bullock representation of 2, 000).    I would recommend that we stick to the 500 figure.    If we accept the revision to paragraph 11 (Annex E) this will reduce CBI oppositionto the 500 limit.c. Timing of the Statutory right to Board Representation.The White paper (paragraph 26) proposes a delay of four to fiveyears between legislation and the coming into force of thestatutory right to minority (one-third) board representation. EYincreased this period from three to four years.    The TUC recogniseda need for a maximum of two years and argued strongly that four to five years would cause the initiative on board representation to runinto the sand.     The CBI though: that any reduction would jeopardise the prospects of successful implementation of the proposal for a statutory right to consultation.    The Prime Minister has expressed a preference for leaving any concession until after publication of theWhite Paper.     I think a concession perhaps to three or four years will need to be made.d. Parity.The TUC felt very strongly indeed that the draft must refer to the objective of parity of employee representation on boards (paragraph 31,The majority view of EY was that, as any prospect of parity was manyyears away, any reference would jeopardise unnecessarily theprospects for limited progress.    There was also the risk that reference to parity would have an adverse effect on invafltment. TheSecretary of State for Employment would, however, like the white paper to say that &quot;the Government believes that when legislation is introduced giving employees the right to representation on the boax*dthere should initially be a right to constitute one-third of the board for a period of five years.    After that, employees&apos; and shareholders&apos;representatives should be entitled to an equal share in seats on theboard but for this next stage the shareholders&apos; representatives shouldbe entitled to appoint the Chairman, who should have a casting vote.The latter arrangements would be reviewed in due course in the lightof experience.    The TUC considered that, at the minimum, theremust be a reference to a commitment to parity as an objective withan indication that the phasing would be discussed when legislation was being prepared.    On the other hand the CBI argued that any modification of the safeguards in the White Paper of four to five yearsdelay, no commitment to anything beyond one-third employeerepresentation, and the option of a two tier board would exacerbateopposition to the point where no compromise on a way forward wouldbe possible.3
e. Selection of Employee Representatives for Board Membership.The majority of EY broadly endorsed the approach outlined inparagraph 36, though the Secretary of State for Employmentconsidered that the detail was out of proportion with the rest of thedraft and put forward a much shorter version.     The CBI weie pleased to see the recognition of the rights of non-trade unionists.     The TUCstrongly attacked the proposals set out in the draft both because of the reference to the possibility of elections and the prospect of a right ofappeal by groups of employees who could be non-unionists.     But the tuc (Me Lea) did suggest a revised approach, dividing thepossibilities in paragraph 36 into two separate proposals, the TUCmight be able to back the first though they would wish to reject thesecond.     The revised paragraphs are at Annex B together with the shorter version preferred earlier by the Secretary of State for employment.     I would commend the approach suggested by the TUC.f. Institutions.Paragraphs 50 and 51 indicate that the Government proposes initiallyto develop a role for ACAS, at least in respect of below board levelparticipation, rather than set up an independent Industrial DemocracyCommission (IDC) as recommended by Bullock.     The TUC thoughtthat the White Paper did not fully present the advantages of an IDCand are uncertain about the involvement of ACAS and the CentralArbitration Committee (CAC) on the lines proposed.    The CBIconsidered that, whilst there were in principle advantages on buildingon existing institutions, the views many companies had of both theACAS and the CAC were such that it would be better to set up a newinstitution.    In the light of both the TUC and the CBI comments 1 now propose that this section of the White Paper should indicate a clearpreference in favour of an IDC though leaving a final decision untilconsultations on the White Paper are complete.    I commend the revised paragraphs 50 and 51 set out in Annex C.g. National Trade Union Education Centre.The TUC would like there to be a reference to the proposed centrein the section dealing with education and training (paragraphs 45-49)even though they admit that the centre would mainly be concerned withthe general run of trade union training rather than industrial democracy.This could be met by a neutral reference in paragraph 49 to the effectthat the Government would discuss with the TUC and others how these(training) needs might best be met, including any contribution whichmight be made by the TCJCs proposed National Trade Union EducationCentre.    But even this goes further than I think is desirable in thelight of current discussions with the TUC about the proposed centre.The CBI consider that the present draft already overplays the role ofthe TUC in training.    I would prefer no reference at all.4
OTHER CHANGES5. In addition there are a number of minor changes which would help to make the draft more acceptable to the TUC which would not alter our approach on substantive points.      These are listed in Annex D.     I commendthem to colleagues.    They include changing the title to &quot;industrial democracy&quot; removing the reference in paragraph 30 to adverse effects on overseas investment (which the TUC think may be self-fulfil ling), strikinga more positive and welcoming note on industrial democracy in the nationalised industries, and bringing in a stronger reference to these industries at the beginning of the Paper.NORTHERN IRELAND6. Also in Annex D is an additional paragraph to be added to the white paper making clear its application to Northern Ireland, which I alsocommend.PUBLIC services. The White Paper does not refer to the public services as distinct from the nationalised industries.    EY agreed that there should be a reference to the public services in the public statement when the White paper is published which would refer to the limitations imposed by the applicationof the elective principle.PUBLICATION8. The Prime Minister indicated in EY that, subject to Cabinetendorsement, the White Paper should be published as soon as possible. he proposes that it should be in his name and that of the Secretaries of Statefor Trade and for Employment.conclusions . I invite the Cabinet to agree that the White Paper should bepublished as soon as possible and to decide:-a. whether or not to adopt the revised version of paragraph 11 onthe compojition of the JRC (paragraph 4a. above and Annex E).I recommend we should;b. whether or not to keep 500 employees as the minimum size forthe application to companies of the statutory obligation to consult(paragraph 4b.).    I recommend we should;c. whether or not to retain the reference to four to five years inparagraph 26;  and if not then what should be said (paragraph 4c.).I recommend we move to three to four years but the timing is forconsideration;5
d. whether there should be a reference to the objective of parityand if so in what form, in paragraph 31 (paragraph 4d.);e. whether to revise paragraph 36 on the selection of employeerepresentatives on the lines of one or other of the alternatives in annex B (paragraph 4e. )e    I recommend we accept the revised draft;f. whether or not in paragraphs 50 and 51 to adopt a line more infavour of setting up a new institution (paragraph 4f. and Annex C).I recommend we accept the revised draft;g. whether there should be a reference to the National Trade UnionEducation Centre in paragraph 49 (paragraph 4g.).     I recommendagainst it.h. whether to accept the minor amendments listed in Annex D(paragraph 5).    I recommend we should.S w department of Education and Science26 April 19786
TRADES UNION CONGRESSBLACKPOOL 1977Composite. MotionINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY(Motion 99 and Amendment and Motion 100 and Amendments)This Congress weleomrs the analysis of tht BullockCommittee Report highlighting tlic need for industrial democracy and reaffirms ill belief in lcp:*lativc action in this field. This dors not assume that I he only way forward is iolegislate for worker representation on the poLcy-making boardsoi companies. This Congress is convinced that collective bargaining can be extended to greatly increase trade unioninfluence over main policies. The extension of worker rcprc-tcntation on policy boards or committees should not be used asa means of frustrating thc processes of existing collective bargaining machinerv. Congress calls upon the Government to legislate lor lull disclosure of information necessary to enabletrade union representatives to properly represent their members.In order to maintain maximum unity within the trade union movement on this issue, Congress calls upon the general council to press the Labour Government to provide forstatutory baching to all unions wishing to establish joint controlof strotegic planning decisions via trade union machinery. this legislation would include the option of parity representation on the board, but would also link up with more flexible formsof joint regulation more clearly based on collective bargaining.Congress further believes that the objective of making thepublic sector of industry serve social purposes will bestrengthens! by effective worker participation on managementboards and utges immediate steps to implement the proposalsof the Nationalised Industries Committee for parity trade unionrepresentation on the boards of nationalised industries where itIs the wish of the members.Moved by national Union of General &amp; Municipal WorkersStcondcd bylilcctrical Electronic Telecommunication&amp; Plumbing UnionSupported byTransport &amp; General Workers&apos; UnionAmalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (TASS)Greater London Council Staff AssociationMfcM I; itx 1&apos;mm C*Ar&apos;&apos;&quot;- BftM R*&quot;* I S&apos;&quot;&quot;- *CIH ILSfn/WKi k; Uutcd Inn.&quot;! f*r**4t, ll!i:lfSMi. lT L )
HALSELECTION OF EMPLOYEE BOARD REPRESENTATIVESAlternative Versions of Paragraph 3&amp;a. As proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment but not accepted by the majority of EY at their meeting on 12 April.EY(78) 5th Meeting.Delete paragraph 361 insert -&quot;One solution might be to leave the method of selecting the employeerepresentatives in the first instance to the JRC but to provide aright of appeal to ACAS/CAC by any homogeneous groups of at least100 if they consider that their interests would not be adequatelyrepresented under the system chosen by the JRC.    Such appealswould be judged by a pre-determined set of criteria.&quot;ORb. As redrafted on lines suggested by Mr David Lea (TUC) which might enable the TUC to go along with the first proposal (paragraph 36) though not with the second (paragraph 36A).&quot;36. Thus there is a clear dilemma.    One view is that industrial democracy should mean that every employee has a right to be directly involved in selecting representatives on the board.   The other view is that any arrangements should be consistent with the establishedsystem of collective representation of employees in British industry.One solution might be to build on the procedure proposed by the Bullockmajority whereby the JRC would have the right to determine how the employee scats on the board should be filled, but if any trade unionconsidered that the method or results of the system proposed wasinequitable it could appeal to the ACAS (or IDC).    The ACAS (or IDC)
could delay tho implementation of the scheme until it was satisfiedof its fairness, but could not impose a solution.    A similar right oi(appeal might be extended to any substantial homogeneous group of employees.36A. A further possibility would be for the statute to set out the criteria by which any such appeal would be judged and these couldcover the geographical and occupational distribution of employees in the company; and in the event of a successful appeal there could also be a requirement for elections based on nomination of candidateby trade unions and by groups of at least 100 employees whether ornot they are members of trade unions.    There could be other criteriaif it wan thought desirable.&quot;
CONFIDENTIALINSTITUTIONS - REVISED PASSAGE PROPOSED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR EMPLOYMENT50 The Bullock Committee recommended the establishment of an industrial Democracy Commission (IDC) to provide advice and conciliation, to give rulings on disputes, and to monitor andevaluate the operation of the legislation proposed in their report.151 Responsibility for advice and conciliation in industrial relations generally, and on collective bargaining and joint consultation in particular, currently resides with the independentAdvisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), set up underthe Employment Protection Act 1975*   There would clearly be asubstantial overlap between the functions of an IDC as envisaged by the Bullock Committee and those of ACAS.   Indeed, ACAS is alreadyactive in the developing field of employee participation   below boardlevel and it together with the Central Arbitration Committee wouldbe competent to undertake the advisory and other functionsconnected with the disclosure and discussion of company strategy.52 On the other hand the Bullock Committee concluded that theduties envisaged for the IDC in relation to board representationinvolve an important difference in kind from those of ACAS in thatthe IDC would be   concerned not only with industrial relationsbut   also with company law and administration.Those functions could not, according to the Report, be satisfactorilydischarged by ACAS, even if that body were to be reorganised and strengthened, since the aims and objectives of the Service arerelated entirely to industrial relations and its strength lies in the coherence of its various tasks.   To widen the ambit ofACAS to include the new fields of industrial democracy would, itwas thought, not only fail to ensure that important tasks werennvrmrwTIAl
CONFIDENTIALcarried out as well as possible but would also subject theService itself to damaging strains and pressures.53     The Government is disposed to accept the Bullock recommendation and to provide in legislation for the setting up of a newinstitution.     It will however explore the matter further withthe TUC, CBI, ACAS and other main interested parties.     In themeantime, to ensure the necessary institutional support duringthe initial phase the Government proposes to consult the Councilof ACAS about the Service expanding its existing role in the field of employee participation - for example, the provision of voluntaryenquiry, advisory and conciliation services to employers andtrade unions on participation procedures, and the monitoringof developments on industrial democracy.CCNFiDENTlAL

Insert &quot;This lackof consensus may in part reflect differingviews about the role of employee directorsin an industrial relations structure basedlargely on a system of collective bargain-ing.   On one view employee directors would bea natural complement to the collective bargaining process, and their principal rolewould be to ensure that matters of concern to the employees were discussed with them,and that their representatives had all the relevant information of this purpose.21.   The approach in the Bullock majority report was that, while employee represen-tation on the board should complement exist-ing collective bargaining arrangements, the role of employee directors would go beyond this and would enable employees to participatedirectly in the management of the company and to share responsibility for its decisions.&quot;Paragraph 25: delete, in the last line &quot;involve a majorrestructuring of the company&quot; and insert&quot;fundamental changes in the legal con-stitution of the company&quot;.Paragraph 30: add, after &quot;this&quot; on the last line on page 15,&quot;it is argued&quot;delete &quot;damage&quot; insert &quot;affect&quot; on line one on page 16 and delete the rest of the sentence after &quot;capital&quot;.

They might range .......11
Northern Ireland   The Northern Ireland Department of commerce and the Northern Ireland Office want a reference in the White Paper to theapplication of the proposals to NorthernIreland,   A paragraph might be insertedimmediately before the Conclusions on thefollowing lines -&quot;Northern IrelandThe proposals in this White Paper are forthe United Kingdom as a whole.   The law governing industrial relations in NorthernIreland is in general very similar to thatin Great Britain though there are someinstitutional differences which will need to be taken into account.    For example ACASfunctions are carried out by a separatestatutory body, the Labour Relations Agency.&quot;
Add at tho end of paragraph 2 -The remit of the Bullock Committee did not include the nationalised industries.    The Government has carried out its own study in this area.    It is especially concerned to promote industrial democracy in these industries andhas already taken action to that end.    This White Papersets out its legislative proposals for the extension ofindustrial democracy in the nationalised industries aswell as in companies, in the private sector.Paragraph 1, line V\ delete from &quot;where decisions&quot; to the endof the paragraph.    Insert -&quot;Such developments will improve the efficiency of Britishindustry and open up a wide range of new and creativeideas that can greatly benefit this country.&quot;Paragraph 3, line 13, add after &quot;and equally important to share in responsibility for their implementation.&quot;    &quot;Where employeerepresentatives serve as company directors this responsibilitywill be legal;    in other cases where they agree decisionsthrough consultations then they will have a moral responsibility.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL^W ANNEX ECOMPOSITION OF THE JRCParagraph 11 -Delete and substitute -We therefore propose that the right to require theboard to discuss company strategy should be vested in a JRC broadly representative of the independentrecognised trade unions in the company which in turn would be broadly representative of the employeesas a whole.   Members of the JRC would be employees ofthe company.   If any trade union considered that the composition of the JRC was inequitable then it couldappeal to the ACAS (or any new institution set up by legislation - see paragraphs 50 and 51 below). Thatinstitution could delay the setting up of the JRCuntil it was satisfied with its composition and could make proposals but could not impose a solution. Anysubstantial homogeneous group of employees might also have a right of appeal on the basis that the JRC wasnot representative of employees as a whole. Therewould be no statutory obligation on companies todiscuss with employees who were not members of unionsbut where it was agreed between the parties, nomineesof non-union members could be admitted to the discussionwith the JRC.    If no agreement was reached companies would be free to set up parallel arrangements for consultation with non-union members if they wishedto do so.
