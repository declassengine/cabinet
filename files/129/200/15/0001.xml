UMENT IS THE I-ROPFRTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 40 copy no 804 April 1978CABINETRHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. At my meeting with President Carter which I reported to Cabinet on9 March (CM(78) 9th Conclusions, Minute 2) it was agreed that we should aimfor a meeting between ourselves, the Patriotic Front (PF) and the SalisburyFour (Smith, Muzorewa, Sithole and Chirau).     Discussions in South Africawith representatives of the Rhodesian regime showed that they did not rule out attending such a meeting but wanted time to consolidate their recentagreement.    The front-line Presidents met at Easter in Dar-es-Salaam andseem at long last to have exerted effective pressure on the PF.    As a result,^ey now claim that the PF are ready to accept the main points of the Anglo-United States proposals and to meet the Salisbury Four, provided we firsthave a preliminary bilateral meeting with them.2- After extensive consultations with Secretary of State Vance in Lagos,*e have both agreed to offer to attend a preliminary meeting with the PF inDar-es-Salaam on 15 and 16 April and, if the Salisbury Four wish, a preliminary meeting with them on 17 April.    We both have to attend a central Treaty Organisation meeting in Washington on 19 and 20 April which also gives us time to pressure the South Africans before the proposed meeting of all the parties on 25 and 26 April in Africa.    Our aim at that meeting would be to widen areas of agreement between the parties. TheMeeting would also provide a forum in which Joshua Nknomo and Mr Smithcould get together.3- I have been deliberately using the internal settlement for some monthsno^ as a means of pressure on the PF but realistically the option of continuing to wait and see what happens in Salisbury is no longer open to us.Wi*h great difficulty we persuaded the other four Western Security CouncilMembers to abstain and not to condemn outright the internal settlement but*n the Council debate they were all very critical of the internal settlementterms.    The President and Secretary of State Vance have accepted our line to date of neither condemning nor endorsing the internal settlement.      But ifWe were now not to respond to the front-line Presidents&apos; desire for a furthei
meeting \,-, would not only be isolated internationally and in the Common-wealth but we would risk (\n open breach with the United States.     Both we and the United States are worried about the possibility of Cuban involvementx* we were to become identified with support for the internal settlement. Itls hard to assess the Cuban risk but if either Zambia or Mozambique were to invite Cuban combat troops as opposed to the present levels of Cubanmilitary teams of 70-80 and 50C in their countries respectively then we could expect the military balance to be rapidly and decisively shifted as occurredln the Horn of Africa.    This is also of concern to South Africa.    I have nodoubt that the front-line states do not want Cuban involvement and that this is*n large part the explanation for their pressure on the PF to accept our proposals.     There are obvious difficulties in the course I propose and failure to reach a negotiated settlement could manifest itself in three main ways:a. Fiustiy, the PF come to the preliminary meeting but stil!refuse to accept the substance of the Anglo-United States proposals.We would then net wish or be able to hold the meeting of all theparties.     But the front-line Presidents and the world would aee thatwe had done everything we could.b. Secondly, the PF accept our proposals at the preliminary meeting hut either the Salisbury Four refuse to meet us (or make no attempt to negotiate seriously) or the Front stand by their acceptanceof our proposals and refuse to negotiate further.     We would then havereached agreement with the PF alone and would be under widespreadpressure to implement the agreement and ensure the collapse of theinternal settlement in particular through sanctions on South Africa.Measures against South Africa, to be effective, would not only be economically damaging but would be very difficult to defend in chiscountry.     Even if the PF had clearly and honestly accepted theAnglo-United States proposals we would be depicted by our critics acbacking the terrorists against the men of peace.     It is because of the dangers of that scenario that I have insisted that Secretary of StateVance attend future meetings to represent the United States.c. Thirdly, the PF attend a meeting of ail the parties but neitherthey nor the Salisbury Four show any disposition to negotiate tonarrow the gap between them.    In this situation we might well come under increasing domestic pressure to encourage and support theinternal settlement.     But the more unreasonable th% PF are, theeasier it will be for us to continue to avoid condemning the internalsettlement.    Instead, if this begins to look viable we shall have considerable room for manoeuvie within our declared position ofneither condemning nor endorsing the settlement.     Only when the fifth principle, whereby the settlement is seen to be acceptable to thepeople of Rhodesia as a whele, is put to the test will we have to meetthe issue of recognition,    I have preserved the Government and the2
Mouse of Commons position on the fifth principle in the united nations and at ovsry stage.     The question of recognition should notbe faced until an election has taken place, a transfer of powercarried out and a new Constitution implemented.4- I invite my colleagues to note the present position, and I will report back.D A L O0reign and Common reGlth Office3 April 19783
