CONFIDENTIAL ^5VDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITA.NNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 50 COPY NO2 May 1978CABINETPAY OF DOCTORS AND DENTISTS AND UNIVERSITYTEACHERSMemorandum by the Secretary ox State for Prices and ConsumerProtectionBACKGROUND1. At their meeting on 20 April (CM(78) 15th Conclusions, Minute S)the Cabinet asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for doctors&apos;and dentists&apos; pay and university teachers&apos; pay to be reconsidered by the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on pay negotiations (EY(P)).    This memorandum sets out the conclusions reached by EY(P).DOCTORS AND DENTISTS2. The Cabinet needs to take decisions both in relation to the substance of the recommendations in the 8th Report of the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos;Review Body (DDRB) (CP(78) 47) and on timing.    The two issues inter-relate.    On timing the options are -a. To make and announce a decision now on the lines followedfor the armed forces, on the recommendations of the DDRB report as a whole, including the increase to be paid in 1978-79 and anyforward commitment for later years.b. To make no announcement at all at this stage and to deferdecisions on the whole of the Report until the Top Salaries review body report is available (not expected before the end of May).c. To announce now a decision for 1978-79 and to defer decisions on later years until the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) report has been received.1
3. Most of the Committee believe that b. would be the wrong choice butviews were di /ided between a. and c. above.    In favour of a. it was argued that there was no case for treating the DDRB Report any differently fromthe Armed Forces&apos; Review Body (AFRB) report; that any delay in announcing decisions on the report as a whole would increase pressurewithin the professions for a forward commitment and might lead to industrial unrest; and that deferring decisions would not make them any easier. Infavour of c. it was argued that decisions on forward commitments for doctors and dentists should net be taken until the TSRB report was availableso as to avoid prejudicing decisions on that report.    Deferring a decisionon doctors and dentists also provides a freer hand for dealing with theuniversity teachers&apos; pay anomaly (see paragraph 6 below).4. Whatever our decision on the rival merits of options a. and c. above,it is necessary to decide what increase should be paid this year in orderthat an early announcement can be made.    The Review Body recommended10 per cent with an uneven distribution giving 11. 2 per cent to consultants,10. 5 per cent to general practitioners and ?. 7 per cent on average to thehospital training grades.    EY(P) recommend that this should be acceptedsubject to the proviso that they have yet to reach the view on whether thecost of payment of increments lost in Stage I by some doctors and dentistsshould count against the 10 per cent or not.    The Review Body did not take this element into account in their calculation.    We shall be considering thispoint before Cabinet meets on 4 Ivfay and I will report our conclusions.5. The DDRB report calculated that an increase on average of28 per cent was necessary to bring the pay of doctors and dentists intowhat they regard d as the correct relationship with that of other comparablegroups.    So an increase of 10 per cent this year would leave a further18. 5 per cent to be paid subsequently if the report were to be implemented.The Review Body wanted any staging of increases to be ever a period of notmore than two years so that it would be completed by April 1980. Infavour of accepting staging over two years it was argued that, as the armed forces had received a commitment to staging over that period, soshould the doctors and dentists as there was no way of distinguishing between the two groups in this respect.    Not to stage over two years or lesswould cause the Review Body to resign and seemed almost certain to leadto industrial action by doctors and dentists generally within the national health Service - the first time this would ever have happened.    As well asthe dangers and hardship this would cause throughout the country there could be serious political damage especially in a pre-election period. Themajority view in EY(P) was, however, that there was advantage in stagingany forward commitment over a three year period.    This would distinguishthe doctors from the armed forces, firemen and the police (if, following the Edmund Davies report, the police also received a firm forwardcommitment over two years).    It would also preserve the distinctive&quot;law and order&quot; group and make it easier to stage the TSRB reportrecommendations over three years should the Government wish to do so.2
Staging over three years would cause less damage to pay policy next yearbecause the forward commitment would be to a smaller sum, some members of EY(P) questioned whether there should be any forwardcommitment at all to the doctors and dentists as this meant giving theman automatic right to have their relativities protected which was notavailable to many other employees and already appeared to be a matter of concern to some union leaders.    It was recognised however, that eitherto reject the findings of the DDRB on the proper relativities and the size of the shortfall (which the Cabinet had decided not to do in the case of the armed forces) or to decide not to restore those relativities, would effectivelydestroy the raison d&apos;etre of the review body system.    It would certainlycause the DDRB to resign and the other review bodies might well follow suit.It would precipitate an even worse crisis with the doctors and dentists.UNIVERSITY TEACHERS6. The university teachers suffer from a recognised anomaly which arose when the introduction of pay policy in July 1975 frustrated the intentions of an arbitration of June 1975, accepted by the Government, whichdetermined that university teachers should be paid by reference to the agreed pay scale at that time of teachers undertaking similar work inpolytechnics and other institutions of further education.    The siz2 of theanomaly has been agreed between the Government and the Association of university Teachers (AUT) as 12 per cent.    Various attempts to find asatisfactory formula for dealing with this anomaly have been made but nonehas satisfied the AUT.    Industrial action through refusing to markuniversity examination papers is being taken and is likely to be extended tocover marking oi &apos;A&apos; Level examination papers, some of which isundertaken by university lecturers.7. The AUT have now formally notified the Government that they propose to seek arbitration.    The Attorney General advised EY(P) that theymight not have a cast iron legal right to arbitration.    There is a risk,however, that any attempt to block the AUT might be successfully challengedin the courts.    EY(P) were advised that the AUT would almost certainlywithdraw their arbitration request if they were offered a firm forwardcommitment to rectify the anomaly in two equal annual stages. Equalannual staging over three years would however be most unlikely to persuade the AUT to change their mind.    EY(P) noted that the problem was one of an outstanding anomaly dating back to 1975 rather than restoring relativities toa current date as in the case of the DDRB and the AFRB reports. they thought there was a good case for considering that the university teachershad a more serious injustice than the armed forces or the doctors. bearing that mind that arbitration could well lead to a decision by the arbiter that thewhole of the anomaly should be rectified in one step, EY(P) thought itwould be right to offer university teachers a foiward commitment to remove the anomaly within two years regardless of the decision reached on doctors and dentists.3
conclusions. I invite the Cabinet to decide -a. whether the doctors and dentists should get a 10 per cent increase for 1978-79 on the basis proposed by the Review body and whether an announcement about 1978-79 increase should bemade now;b. whether the announcement at a. should be limited to theincrease for this year, leaving decisions on the forward commitmentsuntil after the TSRB report is received;  or whether it should alsosay that the Government accepted the findings of the Review body on the increase necessary to restore proper relativities, thatthey will stage the remaining part of that increase, and whetherstaging should be over two or three years and of equal amountseach year;c. whether there should new be a firm forward commitment to the university teachers to phase out their 12 per cent anomalyin two years (October 1978 and October 1979) or in three years; andin equal stages each year, and, if not, whether the Governmentshould resist the request for arbitration.R HDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection2 May 19784
