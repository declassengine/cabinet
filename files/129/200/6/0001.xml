DQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 31 COPY NO 806 March 1978CABINETSCHOOL MILKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department** At their meeting on 1 March the Home and Social Affairs committee considered a proposal by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food toextend free school milk to 7-11-year-olds, as from September this year, inorder to take advantage of a 50 per cent rise in the European economic community (e.c.) subsidy on school milk which will continue at least until*982.    At present local education authorities must provide free milk for children up to the age of 7 and for certain other special groups of children.An extension of their duty to provide free milk would lequire legislation, butai* extension of their powers to do so, as the Minister proposes, could beachieved by regulations.    The Minister urged the social, economic andpolitical advantages of extending free milk, particularly if it took effect this autumn:  milk has high nutritional value;  the Brussels subsidy4 million in a full year) would be far greater than our additional contribution to the relevant e.c. expenditure ( 1. 3 million);   and the rever-sal of the last Conservative Government&apos;s decision to cut the school milkProgramme would hearten Government supporters.2* The net additional cost of extending free milk would be aboutmillion;  and for 1978-79 (two school terms) the net cost would be about 9 million.    These are cash figures and take no account of provision already in Cmnd 7049 for the introduction in 1979-80 of cheap, rather than free,milk under the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976.    In terms of1977 Survey prices, and taking account of that provision, the net additional public expenditure cost would be some  6- 8 million in 1978-79 and^1 rnillion less than that in subsequent years.    From 1979-80 the cost couldDe taken into account in rate support grant.    But for 1978-79 the rate&quot;upport grant is already settled.There was a wide measure of agreement in the Committee with theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&apos;s proposal.    It was fully**ecognised, however, that the priority for this expenditure would have to beconsidered by the Cabinet in the context of other claims on the 1978-79CQntingency reserve.    I should record that the Minister of State, Treasury,
questioned whether, given the resources available, the expenditure was justified in relation, for example, to other priorities in the general healthfield.    In any event, expenditure in 1978-79 will depend on some meansbeing found of reimbursing local authorities, whether at the rate of 100 percent or less.    It would also be necessary, at some stage, to consult localauthorities and the teachers1 representatives in order to ensure that theywould not oppose the measure or, if powers are available, the use of a specific grant or other subsidy.    Ths Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General, in consultation with other ministers concerned, is urgently exploring whether suitable powers do exist.    She hasnone herself.CONCLUSION4- I invite my colleagues to consider, in the light of the Committee&apos;discussion, what degree of priority should be accorded to the proposedadditional expenditure of some  6- 8 million (at 1977 Survey prices) in1978-79 on extending free school milk to 7-11-year-olds (or 7-12-year-oldsunder the Scottish school system).m rHome Office6 March 19782
