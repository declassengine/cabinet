&apos;UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 30 COPY NO3 March 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE MEASURES IN THE 1978 BUDGETMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury** At Chequers on 19 February XCM(78) 6th Conclusions), I was asked to circulate a paper on possible public expenditure measures in the context of areport cn the state of the contingency reserve.Our present concern is with proposals concerning 1978-79, forannouncement in or before the Budget.    We must take into account anyconsequences for later year?.    But the time to review our programmes as awhole for the later years is in the annual survey in the summer.Our recent public expenditure White Paper raised the previouslyPlanned total for 1978-79 by  1 billion at 1977 survey prices (all figures inthis paper are at 1977 survey prices unless otherwise stated), including 400 million for construction.     For budgetary purposes this translates into 1.15 billion at outturn prices.^* I assume that we keep to the overall plans which we published inJanuary.    But we can now allocate part of the contingency reserve. Thisoffers room for some useful public expenditure announcements in or beforethe Budget.CONTINGENCY reserve the White Paper provided contingency reserves of  750 million for1978-79 and  1, 500 million for 1979-80.    For 1978-79, the balance nowstand8 at approximately  717 million after charging up to  10 million arisingfrom decisions on the thermal reactor programme and  23 million forincreased United Kingdom contributions to the European economic community budget following the recent agreement on the new unit of account.We must leave enough in the reserve to cover requirements andCQntingencies later in the year;  and our judgment on this point needs to beseen as realistic.    The year has not yet begun.    The requirements could beeavy, and there are major uncertainties, eg over industrial support, where
we cannot be sure that requirements can be covered within existing plans.Also we should not close prematurely the option for a further statement, egin July, covering such items as a Christmas bonus for pensioners, 01 a fuelrebate scheme.7. My proposal is that out of the contingency reserve for 1978-79 we nowallocate up to half, that is,  375 million at 1977 survey prices, including thetwo items already committed (paragraph 5).    This will represent some 420 million at outturn prices.    Given the possibility that we shall want to announce more later in the year, as well as covering unavoidable contin-gencies, in my judgment it is imperative to keep at least half our reserveintact now.    We must also ensure that our present decisions are consistent with our published plans for 1978-79.POSSIBLE MEASURES8. Colleagues have tabled the proposals for additional expendituresummarised at the annex and in table 2.    If accepted, these proposals would add substantially to the level of public expenditure in 1978-79.    We cannotaccommodate all of them within a total of  375 million.    We have to decidepriorities.9- Some of the proposals have already been discussed by Ministers, andthere are reasons for reaching decisions now and announcing them soon -the employment measures, the measures to help steel closure areas and thecancelling of the planned increase in the school meals charge in the autumn.These proposals will cost an estimated  231 million in 1978-79, and i recommend that they should now bo accepted.There is also the overspend of  40 million on local authority capitalexpenditure on education in England and Wales.    I suggest that this, too,rnust now be accepted.    It v*ill come as an additional benefit to the con-struction industry, on top of the  400 million package announced last october.U-        The figures leave no room for an increase in child benefit inNovember 1978, or for exceeding the statutory uprating of social security benefits.    But there is a case for a substantial increase in child benefit inApril 1979.    I would see merit in announcing an increase to  4 a week fromthat date.    This would concentrate the increase at the time when take-homePay will be cut by the withdrawal of the remaining child tax allowances(CTAs) for younger children and would allow us to withdraw the CTAs forolder children at the same time.    The total cost would be some  515 million1979-80.12-        We need to limit the effect which our decisions will have on 1979-80the subsequent years.    The measures in paragraphs 9-11 above would^one use up more than half of the reserve of  1, 500 million included forl9?9-80 in the last White Paper.    But we shall need to begin 1979-80 (likeyear and 1978-79) with a contingency reserve of around  750 million.2this
J-3.        The items in paragraphs 5 and 9-11, listed in table 1, would leave a balance of up to  71 million to be allocated at thir stage in 1978-79.CONCLUSION!4.       I invite the Cabinet to agree to the proposals in paragraphs 9-11, whichare summarised in table 1;   and to decide how the balance of up to  71 million in 1978-79 should be allocated, bearing in mind the need to avoid addingfurther to planned expenditure in 1979-80.J treasury Chambers3 March 19783

MAIN PROPOSALS FOR ADDITIONAL expenditure . This annex describes briefly the main proposals which colleagueshave tabled for additio?ial expenditure in 1978-79*   Table 2 liststhe proposals,2. Employment measures.   We are committed to substantial extra expenditure on these.   The mensures on which we have decide^ will cost about  155 million in 1978-79 and about  14-0 million in 1979-80,after taking credit for offsetting savings by the Manpower services commission.3. Measures to help steel closure areas.   The measures which ministers have apreed in GENH6 will cost ud to  1^ million from the contingency reserve in 1978-79*4. Grants to farmers following storm damage.   The recent adverse weather in Scotland, the South West snd South Wales has damagedagriculture.   The farming unions are prepared to undertake a self-helpprogramme but seek a government contribution ( 2 million) and additional government expenditure on replacement of buildings, fencesand other fixed equipment (up to a further  2 million).5. Sea deferces. The Minister of Agriculture has proposed afurther  2 million for expenditure by Water Authorities on seadefences, following the recent floods.6. Energy conservation.   The Secretary of State for Energy has proposed two measures.   The first is a selective scheme for industry,which would involve committing  20-30 million in the next two years.Actual expenditure might be some  2 million in lG78-79 and  8 million in 1979-80.   The second would assist insulation of private dwellings,at an estimated cost of  25 million a year, but possibly less in1978-79.7. Housing.   The Secretary of State for the Environment has proposed that, in addition to energy conservation measures, housing expenditure in England should be increased by further assistance towardsthe improvement of owner-occupied and private rented housing at a costof  50 million in 1978-79 and  30 million in 1979-80.   He proposesalso an extra 2,000 houses in new towns costing  15 million in1978-79 and  10 million in 1979-80 ; and  6 million for a National^welling and Housing Survey.
8. Other environmental services etc.    The Secretary of State forthe Environment has proposed extra expenditure in England under11 headings,   totalling  109 million in 1978-79 and about ^9 million in 1979-80.     The largest items are the Urban Programme( 30 million)  - for current expenditure in partnership areas andfor land development and site clearance;    New Towns  ( 20 million) -for industrial and commercial development;    Regional Water AuthoritieS( 15- 20 million)  - for extra new construction, maintenance and repair work;     control of pollution  ( 10 million)  - for more localauthority waste  disposal  sites and plant;     and coast protection( 8 million)  - partly because of recent storms and floods. Smalleramounts are proposed for the British Waterways Board; ancient monuments;     the Development Commission;     gypsies;     sport; andthe Nature Conservancy/Countryside Commission.9. Devolution.    An extra  5 million has been proposed in 1978-79for staff for the Scottish and Welsh Offices and for accommodationcosts of the Scottish Assembly.?0.   Law, order and protective services (Home Department services).The Home Secretary has proposed small additions to expenditure onprison manpower, probation and after-care, police civilians andcadets, and magistrates  courts, which together amount to  10 millioria year.   After offsetting prospective savings on police manpower and increased court receipts, the net cost would be  3 million a year.11. Education.   The Home and Social Affairs (HS) Committee have recommended that the school meal charge should not be increased inSeptember 1Q78 as planned.   The cost for Great Britain would be 60 million in 1978-79 and, if there were no further increase until september 1979*  90 million in 1979-80.   There is also likely to bean unavoidable overspend of  40 million in 1978-79 and  20 million in 1979-80 on education building work by local authorities inEngland and Wales (where the control applies to starts not to expenditure).12. In addition, the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceput forward proposals for reducing or ameliorating youth unemployme^and for the retraining of teachers for &quot;shortage subjects&quot; such asmathematics by making additional funds available to the Empower Servic^6Commission.   Together these proposals are estimated to cost  11 mill1in 1978-79, continuing into subsequent years.
13. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has proposedrestoring free school milk for 7-11 year olds.   HS Committee havecommended this proposal.   The net cost, compared with the White Faperprovision, would be  6-8 million in 1978-79 and  5-7 million in 1979-80.14. Health.   The Secretary of State for Health and Social Services has proposed extra expenditure of  50 million on the national health service in 1978-79 and 3 per cent growth in 1979-80 and thereafter.   The prorosalfor 1978-79 received a wide measure of support from HS Committee(see CF(78) ).15%   Social Security.   The White Paper plans are based on ourstatutory commitment to increase pensions and other long, torn benefits in line with the better of earninrs or prices, and short term benefits in line with prices.    On present rrospects for the relevant period(November 1977 to November 1978), this looks like rrquiring an upratingof pensions and long term benefits by 11-J per cent and short term benefits by 7 per cent.   This uprating would increase the marriedpension from  28 to  31.20 and be worth in cash terms some  500 million in 1978-79 and  1300 million in a full year.16. The Secretary of State for Social Services and Minister for social security do not think that an uprnting limited to the statutory minimumwill, suffice.   They believe that the single weekly rate of retirement pension snd other long term benefits should go up by 14.3 per cent to 20 ( 32 married) or at the very least by 12.6 per cent to  19.70( 31.50 married).   Similarly, they believe that the single weekly rate of short term benefits should go up to at least  15.90 (an 8 per cent increase).   The cost of the higher increase proposed above would be some 110 million in 1978-79 and  ?65 million in a full year.   The loweralternative would cost some  45 million in 1978-79 and  115 million ina full ye*r.17. In addition, in view of the growing gap between the short and longtnnn benefit rates, they propose that from April 1979 the lonr term rateof supplementary benefit should be extended to all those who havebeenreceiving supplementary benefit for at least a year.   This would cost 70 million a year starting in 1979-80.18. Finally, they recommend a reduction in family income supplementhours of work rule from 30 to 20 hours a week, for one-parent families,at a cost of about  2 million in 1978-79 and  4 million in a full year.
/19*   Child benefit.   Social Security Ministers hsve proposed incren^eSin child benefit of  1 both this November and again in April 19791 ata cost of some  230 million in 1978-79 and  725 million in 1979-80.HS Committee have considered this and have a^ked Cabinet (seeCF(78)     ) to endorse an increase in child benefit to  A in April1979 and to decide whether there should be a first increase of 70pin November this year, leaving a further  1 for April 1979.   A 70pincrease in November, followed by a further  1 in April 1979, would cost  165 million in 1978-79 and  565 million in 1979-80.   HS Commit^ 1were divided on whether there should be a November uprating. aqi](K
