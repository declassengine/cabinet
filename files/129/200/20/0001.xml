UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 45COPY NO18 April 1978CABINETPAY ANOMALIES AND FORWARD COMMITMENTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTION1. I hope to report fairly soon on the way in which we might approach theforthcoming talks with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the confederation of British Industry (CEI) on the next round of pay policy.Meanwhile we have to take some important decisions in the present payround which have implications for future rounds - on the recommendationsof the Review Bodies on Armed Forces and doctors and Dentists&apos; pay.We have discussed these two cases   in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) and this paper reports the Sub-Committee1 s provisional views.4.RMED FCRCES PAY REVIEW BODY2. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) has estimated the pay of the Armed Forces, including the X-factor, to have fallen 32 per centbehind that of comparable jobs outside.    Although there is scope forargument, EY(P) considers that we must accept the factual findings of the review Body on the grounds that we cannot shuot the referee.    The immediate problem is how we phase the implementation of these findings.    The AFPRBrecognises the constraints of the present guidelines, but says that the32 per cent gap should not be allowed to widen further in this round.    On theassumption that earnings generally will increase by about 14 per cent overthe present pay round this would imply that Armed Forces&quot; pay should go upnow by this amount.    EY(P) considered that we should give the Armed forces the basic 10 per cent, plus whatever extras we could find which werespecifically related to the special conditions of the Forces and would have noimminent repercussions.    Officials have identified a package of measures^hich would allow us to give a further 4 per cent - 2 per cent through variousincreased allowances and 2 per cent by an improvement in the X-factor.Soth these additions - but particularly the X-factor improvement - could bePrayed in aid by otner groups and the Secretary of State for Employmentthought that the improvement should be restricted to allowances only(ie 2 per cent) in view of his explicit assurances to the TUC at the time of thefiremen&apos;s strike that nobody in the public sector would get more xhan10 per cent in the current round.    The Secretary of State for Defence, on theQther hand, recommends a general increase of 10 per cent plus a further10 per cent by way of catching up.     The majority view in EY(P) was againsttois.    We thought the package put forward by officials was defensible.1
DOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REVIEW BODY3. This pay body has estimated that the Doctors and Dentists havefallen 28 per cent behind their analogues and recommends a 10 per cent increase in the overall pay bill this year.    It would divide this unevenlybetween junior doctors (who have done well in previous rounds and who would now get 7 per cent) and most consultants (who would get between 11 and 12per cent).    General Practitioners would get 10. 5 per cent.     The two health ministers recommend immediate acceptance of these recommendations.EY(P) concurs.FORWARD COMMITMENTS4. Both P.eview Bodies have thus established the extent of the anomalyand made proposals for interim increases this year which EY(P) recommendswe should meet.    Both bodies however also recommended that theGovernment should undertake a firm commitment to eliminate the remainingshortfall - below the &quot;rate for the job&quot; - by April 1980, and both referred inthis context to the model oi the undertaking to the firemen.     To do thiswould mean adding to the forward commitments we already have and thequestion arises how far we should go.5. At present we have an absolute commitment to put the firemen in the top quartile of manual worker earnings by two equal steps in the next payround (ie November 1978) and the one after that (November 1979).    We havealso committed ourselves to accepting Lord Edmund-Davies&apos;s forthcomingrecommendations on the level of police pay though we have reserved to ourselves decisions on the timing of the implementation of his recommenda-tions.     In practice EY(P) believes that if the Edmund-Da vies&apos; award is nottotally unreasonable we shall have to adopt for the police the two-stageimplementation already agreed for the firemen.D. In view of these commitments, and the serious implications ofsignificant under payment for the Armed Forces, (EY(P) also agreed thatWe could not avoid a commitment to them of the same kind as that already given to the firemen   and, in practice, implied for the police.    Subject tothat three main views wore expressed:-a. Some members of the Sub-Committee felt that we could and should draw a ring fence round the &quot;law and order&quot; groupconsisting of the Armed Forces, the Police and (less plausibly)the firemen.     These would then be the only public service groups to receive absolute assurances of full rectification of theidentified anomalies by April 1980.b. Some members of the Sub-Committee felt that if the armed Forces were to be given an absolute forward commitmentthey should, at the same time, be held to 10 per cent in thecurrent pay round.2
c.       Some members of the Sub-Committee felt that the ringfence concept was not viable and that consequently the forwardcommitment would have to be aleo extended to other public services groups who had, or would have, authoritativequantification of the extent to which their pay had fallen behind their analogues in the past 3 years.     The immediate problemarises over the Doctors and Dentists - where the Secretary ofState for Social Services argued for parity of treatment with the armed Forces.    There is a complication in that the unversity teachers, who have a quantified anomaly dating back to 1975,have been given publicly a general assurance that this anomalywill be rectified within 3 years (and are currently threateningindustrial action, in the form of refusal to mark this year&apos;suniversity examination papers and. A-]evel papers for schools,unless the assurance is made more specific on the phasing ofimplementation).    There will also be in the near future thereport of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB),     Moreover inApril 1979 the revived Pay Research Unit will produce evidencerelevant to the pay of the non-industrial Civil Service as a whole.Some members of the Sub-Committee felt that to extend forwardcommitments to any or all of these groups as well as the armed forces, Police and Fireman wculd jeopardise our chances of negotiating an acceptable pay regime with the TUC for the fourthround because they would see the increases not as &quot;catching up&quot;but as points of reference for their own claims.THE CASE FOR NEW MACHINERY7. In an attempt to find a way through this dilemma I floated, at EY(P),the idea of dealing with the problems of the forthcoming claims, includingthe Doctors and Dentists, by establishing an &quot;anomalies board&quot; with a pre- -determined budget and an initial, pre-determined list of clients providedby the Government.     The board would later develop through a rollingprogramme of references - extending perhaps into the private sector - and subsequent allocations of funds.     The way such a board might work istentatively sketched oat in the attached Annex.    EY(P) generally agreedthat the idea was worth taking further, in consultation with trade union leaders concerned with the public services.    But there was also agreement that a new board could not be established or announced quickly enough to help us deal with the &quot;law and order&quot; cases nor, possibly, with the Doctors and dentists.    The view was that we must take our decisions on these groups ontheir own merits.    Subject to the views of my colleagues  EY(P) is ready togive further thought to the role and nature of an anomalies board and to the tactical problems of bringing it acceptably into being.conclusions* I suggest therefore that:-i.        We increase Armed Forces&apos; pay by 14 per cent overall in1978.     This would be presented as 10   per cent, plus improvementsequivalent to 2 per cent in allowances and 2 per cent on the X-factor.3
The task uf preci.de allocation of the 10 per cent would be handed over to the AFPRB ?s tliey recommend in their report.ii.        We undertake to eliminate the residue of the anomaly forthe Armed Forces in the time scale recommended by the ReviewBodies, using the same formula we used in Ihe case of the fire service.iii, We increase the pay of Doctors and Dentists by 10 per centoverall, allocated as the doctors and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB)have recommended.iv. As regardu an announcement either -a, w3 announce both sets of pay increases simultaneouslyand at the came time accept the quantification of theremaining pay anomaly for both groups.    We would alsopromise a farther announcement in the near future aboutthe remainder of the DDRB recommendations. In practicethat announcement will have to deal also with the unversity teachers and probably the TSRB groups as well;ORb. if no formal commitment is to bo made to the doctors and Dentists it is for consideration whether theannouncement should be confined to the Armed Forces,with nothing said about the Doctors and Dentists (or theUniversity Teacners and TSRB Groups) until we havedecided what should be done in their case.D W treasury Chambers18 April 19784
i (confidential)ANNEXANOMALIES AND FORWARD commitments in discussion of Armed Forces&apos; pay at the EY(P)(78)27th MeetingQn 6 April, I undertook: to circulate a paper for discussion the Sub-Committee on possible arrangements for dealing withanomalies in a future phase of pay policy.2-   As I indicated very briefly during the previous discussion,I nave in mind some kind of Anomalies Board which, on a carefullylimited and defined basis of operation, could help resolve theProblems of implementing pay awards outside the guide-lines oftnis or future pay rounds, as would be necessary to deal adequately*ith clear anomalies, the bulk of which are likely to arise in thePublic sector.   What follows is a sketch of possible arrangements,^ which I draw attention to some of the difficulties which willW to be tackled or avoided and make a number of suggestions aboutthe main characteristics which would be needed in the establishment and terms of reference of a Board for this purpose.   In developingand implementing the idea, it would be necessary to carry a measureof agreement on the part of TUC leaders, particularly those^Presenting public service employees, and I would aim to pursue this in early discussions, in the light of views of the Sub-Committee0n the concept as a whole.    It will not, I believe, be necessaryto nave specified and reached agreement on all details of the^angement before reaching and announcing decisions on pay of the(confidential)
(confidential)Armed Forces (and Doctors and Dentists), although it will plainly benecessary to have reached some understanding in principle about thegeneral approach to the problem of forward commitments and this proposed method of tackling them.Basic Assumptions3. A fundamental assumption of the approach I am seeking todevelop is that for the immediately foreseeable future we shallhave a framework of pay policy, as we have for the current round,which seeks to limit the scale of pay increases in general; but which, because it is impossible to combine it with wide flexibilityfor individual settlements, will not of itself provide scope fordealing with major anomalies.   A further fundamental assumptionis that there are at least some major anomalies which, in thenational interest, need to be corrected fairly quickly.4. Taken together, these assumptions point necessarily to some special provision for dealing with anomalies, which can be incorporated in the specification of pay policy for a future payround, and which will leave the basic rules of that.future roundotherwise intact.General Description5. My proposition is that we should establish (and announce not later than we announce decisions on pay arrangements for the comingpay year) a new &quot;Anomalies Board&quot;;    that a sum of money should beset aside as a pool on which the Board can operate during the pay year 1978/79;    that certain cases should be remitted to theBoard as candidates, and that the main task of the Board shouldbe to decide how to divide the available pool between the Candida^63in the list. I envisage that the Anomalies Board could continue for future years, and some important questions arise on how it w0develop, questions which may need to be covered in the initialterms of reference and other arrangements.6. I now turn in more detail to details of the specification and problems which are likely to arj.se.(confidential)
(confidential)A Limited Pool Arrangement7.   I can see no way of limiting the effects of awards to be made any Anomalies Board, other than establishing a fixed global amountof money. I therefore propose this as a central feature of thearrangement.   The Government would decide at the end of this payround (and at the end of future pay rounds if the arrangement canbe sustained) that a certain amount should be set aside for dealingwith acknowledged anomalies. The amount could he determined by theGovernment in the light of its knowledge of the range of anomaliesto be dealt with, and in the light of its calculations of the totaltolerable national earnings increase for the coming year. I comment^ greater detail below on the problems of fixing the amount, butnote at this stage that, in my judgment, the total in itself shouldnot be such as to undermine pay policy, provided that we can preventthe operation of a special arrangement on this subject from raisingtbe general level of normal settlements and making employers and employees less willing to work within the general framework.gimlnfi8*   I would like to envisage the arrangement as one which could continue and develop over future years. This prompts the suggestion of a kind of rolling programme, which could have a number of virtues.Specifically, candidates for anomaly treatment would be listedduring a particular year, at the end of which they would constitute the agenda for decisions by the Anomalies Board within the following year.     They would be dealt with, in whole or in part, to the extent possible within the pool made available, actual awards being madewlth effect from normal annual settlement dates. At the endof the second year the unsettled residue of candidates from the first-year list, plus any new candidates emerging during the second year,WQuid form the agenda for decisions during the third year, and so on.9* Among the virtues of an arrangement of this kind, if it couldbe made to work, are that the Board would be able to consider how to divide the annual pool in full knowledge of the available listof candidates, which could then be compared with each other in a(confidential)
(confidential)single process.    This could be particularly valuable in helping to prevent leap-frog claims, at least within the same annual cycle.Indeed, the process of delay in actual settlement, if those concerned could be induced to accept it as the price of gettingexceptional settlements at all, could be very helpful in easing theproblems of analysis and decision on special cases.Public and Private Sectors10. We may need to face head-on some general arguments aboutrelations between public and private sectors. The obviouslyoutstanding anomalies at the present time are all in the public sector.   My proposal would be that these, and no others, should bedealt with as the 1977/78 list of candidates for the Board to be given*to tackle in 1978/79.   This does not mean that we should rule outfuture candidates from the private sector, as well as the public sector, but:- there are special problems in admitting private 3ector cases(touched on later);- we shall need to consider and be prepared to defendconfining the arrangement to public sector cases in thefirst year.11. We might indicate at the outset that both public and private sector cases would be accepted by the Anomalies Board forconsideration in future years.   We would then be left to defendstarting with a group of public sector cases only, although thebulk of future candidates would probably tend to be public sectorrather than private sector.   There could be two approaches todefending this position:-(a) One approach, not so much a defence as an adjustment whicbwould remove the complaint, would be to set a differentnorm or guide-line for public and private sectors, abati^the public sector figure by an amount which would accomn10^the pool made available for anomalies.JL(confidential)
(confidential)(b) An alternative approach would be to argue that it is inevitable that in a Government pay policy the public sector is treated more rigidly than the private sector and, as there will undoubtedly be some evidence to show,the private sector tend to enjoy more &quot;drift&quot;, &quot;self-financing productivity deals&quot;, etc., then the public sector and thus emerge at the end of a pay round with alarger overall earnings increase.I would not be wedded to either approach for all time. Forexample, I can imagine that it would be extremely difficult to8ecure public sector agreement on the first approach for 1978/79.**ut I would not rule it out for subsequent years. Meanwhile, the^ospect of selling the second approach to the private sector (the tuc in general and the CBI) for 1978/79 would no doubt bell*iuencedby the amount involved, and the percentage of the relevant^y binwhich it represented, together with the evidence of relativeMovements over recent years. This is plainly an area of discussion in which we must try to bring public service and other TUC leaders to talk with each other.^U978/79 ListWe have certain obvious candidates for the initial list: the^nree Review Bodies (Armed Forces, Doctors and Dentists, Top Salaries),^lremen and Fire Officers, the Police, and University Teachers,^atinex some very rough figures (including various guesses) of^ eir estimated pay bill, possible cost of rectifying their &quot;anomaly&quot;^UH, and the relationship of this to total national and sector**** Mils.V      t +w      it is or wni be a feature of all these cases that authoritativefa -commendations or agreements have been made on the existencej    ne &quot;anomaly&quot; and on what should in time be done to correct it*0  eiieve that there would be fairly wide public assent on allthem (indeed, the case of the Firemen, to which the Government^J?e ialready publicly committed, is probably the only contentious one)o(confidential)
(confidential)The problem, therefore, is not going to be whether special treatment for these cases will arouse hostility, but how far such special treatment will provoke demands for parallel treatment elsewhere.15*   It may be useful to look briefly at a few cases and groups:-(a) Non-industrial civil service:    there can be little doubtthat the Pay Research exercise to be completed aroundApril 1979 will provide evidence of shortfall over thegroup as a whole, probably on a scale which would establish a major anomaly. The question is whether thishas to be included in the 1978/79 list, or whether it couldbe regarded as an anomaly emerging in that year, to bedealt with in the following year. The former answer wouldtI fear, open up widespread possibilities of additionalcompetition for the 1978/79 pool.   The latter would bedifficult to defend against Civil Service negotiatorswho would claim that it was opposed to the principle onwhich they accepted the deferment of pay research until1979.    It might be worth trying for the latter solution,however, and relying on the Anomalies Board to take account of special Civil Service timing problems by giving them a degree of preference from the 1979/80 pool(b) &quot;1975 Cases&quot;:    there may be a few outstanding cases of relatively small size in which agreements were reached or nearly reached on substantial increases in 1975, whichwere then interrupted by Stage I.   Some are alreadyincluded in the main list, but an argument could be presented to admit others, probably with little effecton the total claim, and with limited risk of creatingrepercussions because what happened in 1975 is a finitegroup of problems.(c) Other major groups: local authority staffs and manual3&apos;NHS staff, particularly nurses, and teachers are obviouscases in which, against the background of special arrana(confidential)
(confidential)of the kind envisaged, claims for anomaly treatmentwould undoubtedly be made.   We must at least envisagethat some claims of this kind would have to be accepted in 1978/79 for inclusion in the list to be tackledin subsequent years;    but it could be very important to resist adding such cases to the initial 1978/79 list.(d) Other;   there can be no doubt that a large number of cases would be presented or attempted;    it will be important tomake it as difficult as reasonably possible to becomeaccepted as an anomaly or special case.. tie Amount of the Pool16.   The figures in the Annex represent groups which it would ingeneral be desirable to handle within two consecutive years. Thesecond year would undoubtedly have to accommodate additional claims.We would plainly not be tackling the problem satisfactorily unless we were prepared to make available for the first year something in the region of  250 million, or possibly more. This would representa relatively trivial amount on the national wages bill, but a ratherfcore significant percentage on the bill for the public sector as awkole, or particularly for the narrower definition of public services.    250 million would for example represent an extra 1-J percent on the present total pay bill for the narrower definition ofPublic services, and this, although it would inevitably pose theProblem of public and private sector competition to which I have referred, might be judged a managable order of magnitude.Sgle of the Board17*   As I have indicated, the essential role of the Board would be to divide an available pool of money among a list of candidates forwhpm specific increases had been agreed in principle.   The initial*ist on the limited basis I have suggested would consist entirely of cases in which the claims in question had been endorsed by the0Vernment and the only problem was the selective staging of*mPlementation within the given total. For this purpose, the BoardWQuld have regard to the history of the claim, current recruitment(confidential)
(confidential)and management difficulties and any other factors bearing on the urgency of correction;    they would not need to re-examine anyof the detailed justification of the proposed pay changes.18.    It would be highly desirable that the bulk of cases coming tothe Anomalies Board in future should similarly carry the authorityof some prior agreement, as a minimum that employers and employeesshould have jointly established and agreed the arguments for andthe nature and amount of changes proposed. We do not want, and onthis basis would not need, to develop an institution as elaborateas the National Board for Prices and Incomes;    nor would we need &quot;toendow it with any substantial analytical capacity.    It would need,however, and its terms of reference should express these duties:-(a) To quantify its own recommendations (in large measure this could be done in liaison with the sponsor department, andthere might need to be back-up Whitehall machinery to liaisebetween individual sponsor departments and central pay andfinancial departments to maintain consistency and coordinateprogress).(b) To take evidence (from representatives of employers,employees, government and review bodies, commission, etc)where any further explanation of the background of a clai111was needed, or where they wished separately to appraiserelative recruitment, etc. problems and their importance.(c) Possibly to judge whether to admit certain candidates to alist. For the public sector, it might suffice if this responsibility were left with government, on the basis.   that endorsement of a particular claim by the government asemployer would leave the admission of that claim beyond doubt. For the private sector, there would be the choice of leaving the Board itself to adjudicate, or arranging for some form of processing in which the government wouldvet cases. There could be great advantages in leavingthis task to the Board, always under the controlling8(confidential)
(confidential)influence of the total amount of the pool, but it wouldrequire that the Board developed an appropriate capacity to analyse claims put forward.The last point is the most delicate and dangerous ground. It is however possible that the initial establishment and responsibilities of the Board could leave it on one side.    There will be a problemof reconciling the need for a clear contribution which the Boardcould make with the risk that, in giving it too extensive a power,we might encourage greater burdens on it than the Board itself, orthe amounts to be made available for its judgment, could stand.There could also be problems if the position ever arose in whichthe Government as an employer did not wish to accept the decisionsof the Board, even where those decisions were consistent with thegeneral pool arrangements.Structure of the Board1S.    it would obviously be of the first importance to create aBoard carrying authority. In trying to develop the idea at all,^uch must depend on discussions with TUC leaders, and to a muchlesser extent with the CBI. Indeed it could well prove impossibleto construct any satisfactory institution without reasonablyauthoritative representatives of both sides of industry. eneraj.20*   I have no illusions over the risk that a concept on theselines could prove to be too elaborate to be negotiated, or indeedoperated, with any success.   But I think it would be worthexPloring the possibility initially with TUC leaders, especially those representing major public service groups, some of whom haveindependently been developing ideas which point in this kind of direction.    Even if it were not possible to develop the concept fully,with hope of carrying it forward in future years, the discussions^ight lead to an arrangement which could accommodate the settlementswhich will ha-veto be reached for our main list of 1978/79 candidates,in a form which would run the least risk of provoking repercussionsan(* undermining our general hopes for a satisfactory future pay strategy.s5*!%, (confidential)D.W.H.
