Thu^restimates of demand in 1982-83 all fell within a range of 17. 4-2 3vl-milliontonnes, as against a BSC capability at that time, cn existing policies, oiwell ove r 30 million -tonnes- with more capacity under construction towards3. In the light of these findings, GEN 116 agreed with the following recommendations:A.    Steelmaking Capacity and Closures.    We should not seek to fix a capacity target for 1982-83 but instead accept bsc&apos;s proposal for astep-by-step approach over the next few years so as to bringcapacity more into line with likely demand, thus retaining flexibilityto adapt to unexpected changes in the situation.    In particular:
i. Expansion projects in Scotland, Wales and Englandalready well under way snould be completed.ii. There should be no starts on new or increased steel-making capacity until demand forecasts improve sufficiently tomake such investment economic.iii. We accept that BSC negotiate terms for the closure of&quot;high cost&quot; plants, mainly &quot;Be8wick&quot; plants, in close consul-tation with the TUC Steel Committee and the local workforces.Product Mills.     There should be continuing substantial invest-nient in mills so as to improve product quality and thereby ensurecompetitiveness in the 1980s.    However, we should accept bsc&apos;s viewthat the major product mill developments at Port Talbot, Tees side,etc, cannot be justified in the present state of the market and must be deferred until market conditions would make them economic. Sub-ject to completion of the financial evaluation and a renewed commit-nient by the workforce on manning levels, the Corporation intends toproceed with the continuous casting scheme at Port Talbot and hopesto make a start on this in 1978-79.^*     Capital Development Programme.     Following on the above, weshould approve a capital investment programme of  500 million for19/8-79 and of a similar amount (details to be fixed later) for1979-80, at outturn prices.Finance.i. BSC clearly needs a capital reconstruction since, on present forecasts, it will not be able in the foreseeable futureboth to pay interest on National Loans Fund (NLF) loans and adividend on Public Dividend Capital (PDC).     However, thereare powerful reasons against a major write-off now, not least the uncertainty caused by the present state of the market.While we can relieve BSC of the need to remunerate PDC in ourstatement to Parliament - and I propose we do this - relief ofthe obligation to pay interest on NLF loans would require legislation and this would cause adverse public reaction.ii. Accordingly, I propose that BSC be financed for the timebeing by further advances of equity under Section 18(1) of theIron and Steel Act 1975, but these advances would be clearlydifferentiated from the existing issues of PDC because of thedifferent remuneration requirement (see below).     I also propose early legislation to authorise additional issues of up to If 000 million, with power by Order to increase this limit by afurther  1, 000 million subject to an Affirmative Resolution.2
The present balance under the existing ceiling (just under 1, COO million at 1 April 1970) would also be available for use.The new issues would be available to pay interest and capitalrepayments on existing NLF loans, as well as for BSC a capital investment programme and working capital needs,including covering the operating losses expected in 1978-79.iii. We would need to make it clear there would be noremuneration on the new equity issues before the reconstructionbut that we would expect these issues to be remunerated after a capital reconstruction;  it would be premature to fix a rate at present  sent.iv. We could ease bsc&apos;s problems further by making grants for the specific cost of closures, including running-down costs.This should be acceptable internationally (although the method offinance I propose above would remain vulnerable to inter-national criticism as alleged subsidy).     However, it wouldinvolve the Government directly in closures, and therebyincrease pressure on us for more generous terms, eg forredundancies and, in the light of the financial package I now propose, BSC are against such grants, at least before anyreconstruction.     I seek my colleagues&apos; views on this issue of specific grants for closures.     Legislation would be requiredfor such grants.v. The system of cash limits should be continued, but wecannot fix the cash limit for 1978-79 until the method of financing BSC has been agreed.E*     Productivity.     The Government should give full, sustained andpublic support to steps to achieve greatly improved productivity,including pressure on BSC management and the TUC SteelCommittee to enable BSC to compete internationally.4. Tput       1 consider that these recommendations are necessary first steps to of     e **SC back on the road to financial viability and towards our objectivee*ftcient, competitive and profitable industry in the 1980s.

DRAFT WHITE PAPERBRITISH STEEL CORPORATION: THE ROAD TO VIABILITYIntroductionSteel is basic - the lifeblood of a major industrial nation.It is unthinkable that Britain should be without a substantialbulk steel making capacity.    The British Steel Corporation playsthe key role in supplying our manufacturing industries withthe major part of their steel requirements.    That must continue,lake almost every bulk steel producer in the Western world, theCorporation is in serious financial trouble, with substantialsurplus capacity.   Most of the problems facing the Corporation areshared with the other steel producers;    some are particular to theCorporation because of the history of the British steel industryover the past decade and longer.    The Government are determined that these problems should be overcome.    The BSC must win an assured future as a competitive large scale steel producer able toBeet its customers&apos; requirements reliably, competitively andprofitably.2 There are two main reasons for the serious problem of worldover-capacity for steelmaking.   First, a huge amount of modern,highly productive new capacity was either completed or under way in Europe, Japan and the developing world before the Middle Eastwar in October 1973 and the steep rise in energy prices thatfollowed it.   When this new capacity was built or planned,continued expansion in world industrial activity was widelyexpected with a sustained growth in the demand for steel./Instead ...
Instead, - and this is the second factor - the growth of *oV^industry has, in recent years, fallen well below the levelsestablished before 197^.    Demand for steel has tended to &amp;eC- at the very time when much of the new capacity was only 0uScoming on stream.   A graph showing world consumption anat ^is attached at Annex A.     The conjuncture of these factosto severe pressure on prices and to the deepest world recessin steel for 40 years.The bsc&apos;s Special Problems5   The particular problems of the BSC stem in part from adecade of low investment in steel prior to the White PaperFebruary 1973-   Investment in the British steel industry waSlow in the years immediately before nationalisation inthe period from 1967 to 1970 the Corporation was organistout of the 14 companies that were nationalised.   There ^aBSC85&apos;delay during the Conservative Government1 s review of theits expansion proposals in 1971/72.   Expenditure grew to reheights in 1975 and 1976,after the present Government toofcin these years we have been investing more than any other in the Community.   The following table illustrates &quot;thesince 1964:

As a result, in 1974 and subsequently,overseas demand was still high, BSC productione(iuate to meet home demand;    Britain became a net importers^eei fXQr the first time.   At that time the &quot;Beswick&quot; plants,/though ...
though becoming technically obsolescent, had a useful roleas suppliers of steel badly needed by our manufacturing industries. The &quot;Beswick&quot; closure review was designed, inter alia, to ensure that these plants were not shut beforereplacement steel became available from the new plants still being built.5   By late 1976, with some new capacity coming on stream &amp;ndwith improved performance at other plants, BSC was well place(^to supply demand at a time when it was generally expected tna*there would be an upturn in the world as a whole and in Brital11Instead, there was a further downturn in demand at home and197?overseas.   UK demand for steel has fallen by 23% since the peak (instead of the continued growth then expected) and isat the lowest level ever experienced by BSC.   The UK industrya5is currently operating at about two-thirds capacity, the sa ,Japan.    Other e.c. countries are operating at about 60% oxand the USA at about 75%-   More intensive world competitionexerted further severe pressure on prices whilst costs oxtnann^^and labour continued to rise.    There was acknowledged overin the Corporation with little progress towards internatiproductivity levels.   All this caused a continuing financialdeterioration in bsc&apos;s financial position.   The graph at Annshows how total deliveries of steel to British industry reduring 1976 but then declined again.Action by Government and the Corporation6   Early in 1977, there was a reasonable expectation that ^this deterioration would be reversed as demand picked up-was preparing to meet British industry&apos;s requirements mCOMRQENTIAL
expected upturn. To have abrupt and precipitate action at thattime to cut back BSC capacity would have been very badly received.without consultation with the unions, abandonment of the under-taking on closure dates for the plants covered by the Beswickreview would without doubt have led to industrial unrest. Thiswould have added seriously to bsc&apos;s problems.    The need, therefore,was for measures to try and relieve the immediate pressures. TheCorporation took remedial action to contain its losses - by shiftreductions (particularly at rolling mills and foundries), pruningoverheads, improving plant loading etc.    Since April 1977, theCorporation has withdrawn from service, permanently or temporarily,plant with capacity to make 1.8 million tonnes of coke, 3*75 milliontonnes of blast furnace iron, 2.4- million tonnes of steel and2.1 million tonnes of rolled products.    The Corporation also agreed with Government on the rephasing of large capital projects inthe light of the depressed market prospects, with substantial reductions in capital expenditure.   For their part, the government took steps, both at home and in the Community to discourage-isruptively priced imports.    Some anti-dumping duties were imposedthe Department of Trade and other arrangements negotiated withexporting countries.    In the Community, the Government havesupported the measures proposed by Commissioner Davignon to restorePrice stability in the European market.   As a further step , theSecretary of State for Trade sought assurances, e.g at the Council0* Ministers of 3 May, that the level of &quot;guidance prices&quot; for trade in specified products should be increased:    such increases*ere published by the Community on 22 July 1977-^he^Government Review&apos; It became clear in the latter part of 1977 that the imbalanceCONFIDENTIAL
between world steel demand and world steelmaking capacity was likely to persist, and that (on unchanged policies) financial-losses being made by the BSC would remain unacceptably high-BSC put forward proposals for dealing with this and also ente einto urgent discussions with the TUC Steel Committee. For tneirpart, the Government undertook a study in depth of the medium and longer term position, in order to clarify the remedial a necessary to put the Corporation back on the road to viabili^&apos;Close consultation then took place with the British steel corporation and the TUC Steel Committee.   The views of the Prlsector steel trade association (BISPA) and of the British Ir011and Steel Consumers Council were also sought.    The Governmeirtalso able to take account of the reports of the Select Comtflion Nationalised Industries.8 The Government have now agreed with the Corporation onresults of the review and the remedial action needed. Thenf &amp;eSteel Committee have been closely involved.    The results oj-Government&apos;s review are set out below.9 Meanwhile, while the study was taking place, the Governfleagreed that the Corporation should seek to negotiate tern13for the early closure dates of high cost plants with thektanceSteel Committee, who would in turn consult the local workforconcerned.   This is by far the best way of securing accep1for the closures while maintaining the good industrial ?elwhich are essential to efficient performance at the on-SoiIlgplants.   These negotiations are a practical demonstration 0/the
the Corporations policy of seeking partnership with its workforce.Terms had already been agreed in September 1977 for the closure of the Clyde Iron Works.   This was followed in December by myreport on the closure of the Hartlepool Steel Works, and in March1978 for the closure of the East Moors Steel Works, Cardiff.world Supply/Demand10 The examination of world demand in the short and longer term,and of developments in world production, confirmed that the pattern of supply for steel has been changing and will continue to change to the disadvantage of traditional suppliers.   The share of worldsteel production held by e.c. countries fell from 28% in 1969 to under 20% in 1976.   The United States&apos; share of world productiondeclined from 26% in 1969 to 17% in 1976.   Since 1976, new construction in developing countries has been much less curbedby the recession than in developed countries.   Following theslump in demand in recent years, the growth in demand for steelis expected to be below previous trends over the next few years;this reflects comparatively poor prospects for growth in the major steel using industries throughout the world.   More new capacity and slower growth in demand mean a world surptes formany years to come.jj? Steelmaking; Capacity11 It is clear that the sales possibilities for BSC, both athome and overseas, on which the 10 Year Development Plan ofFebruary 1973 was predicted, are no longer realistic. Whengrowth in the economy is resumed, it will be from a much lowerbase than implied by the previous trend.   Failure of world demand/to ...
to grow in recent years together with the new capacity avail8-^to supply it, have gravely affected bsc&apos;s export expectations.The Corporation is suffering from substantial over-capacity nowThis is likely to persist over the next few years - because,the next year or two, additional capacity of some 5i mill1011tonnes will become available including new capacity from expan5and modernisation schemes at Ravenscraig and Redcar, whicn areclose to completion.12   The over-capacity that would result from unchanged policiewould be more costly than either the Corporation or the country can afford.   Accordingly, the BSC has proposed and the Govern^has agreed:i)     modernisation and expansion project alreadyapproaching completion must be completed;ii)     there must be continuing substantial investmentto improve product quality and so ensurecompetitiveness in the 1980s;iii)     there is no case at present for new starts onsteelmaking capacity.   Accordingly, the proposedexpansion at Port Talbot and the construction ofelectric arc plants at Shelton, Hunterston andRavenscraig should be deferred until demand forecaimprove sufficiently to justify their construction&apos;It was confirmed in March 1977 that the projected major m *t progplant at Hunterston was not part of the current develpmen^ v and that its commencement was dependent on market condition&apos;remains the position.13   The Government and the BSC believe it would be wrong t0establish a &quot;blueprint&quot; for future capacity over a period/oi/
of years, of the kind set out in the Ten Year DevelopmentStrategy of February 1973-   Buth the Government and the BSCfavour a step-by-step approach which will retain flexibilityto adapt to unexpected changes in the situation.14 As part of this approach, the Government have consideredBSCs approach to the problem in 1978/79 of &quot;high cost&quot; plants,in particular the &quot;Beswick&quot; review plants.    The Government accept that BSC should seek to negotiate closures at such plants - not including Shotton - in close consultation with the TUC SteelCommittee and local workforces.   As noted earlier, BSC havealready agreed terms for the closure of the Clyde Iron Works,the Hartlepool steel works and East Moors steel works.   It willhe for BSC to begin fresh negotiations at their discretion. no action will be taken without prior consultation with the TUCSteel Committee and the local workforces.15 The Government acknowledge that further rationalisation mayveil prove necessary in future but believe this should be considered on the step-by-step approach described in paragraph 14, with laterdevelopments in the market situation taken into account. Forthe achievement of financial viability, it is necessary forcapacity to move more into line with demand.Alleviating Measures16 It is the policy of the Government to ensure that everything possible is done bo provide alternative employment in the areasaffected by steelmaking closures.    In some cases, measures toliaprove infrastructure will also be needed if the lost jobs are
to be adequately replaced.   It is the intention of the Govern111to make an announcement where appropriate when closure Qduannounced by the BSC.   As regards closures that have alreadybeen announced, the position is as set out below.17   The Government considers that it would be right to take into account the temporary loss of rate income to local auarising from closures.    This loss will be compensated for ^the extra resources element when the lower rateable valueare used in the Rate Support Grant calculations.   This cowinwill apply to the closure areas discussed in detail below-addition, the Government considers that there should be spearrangements to help meet the difficult problems and decislfaced by the local authorities.     Detailed proposals will be announced in due course.18   The Government also welcome the intensification of theefforts of the Corporation, through its subsidiary BSCLimited, to create new jobs through attracting new industrysteel closure areas.    The Government1s powers to assist ^ndevelopment will be used in full support.Hartlepool19   The Government has long recognised the special probie^of Hartlepool.   As a Special Development Area HartlepooJ-eligible for the full range of regional assistance at theofhighest rate available in Great Britain.   Up to the end ttryRegional Selective Assistance offers made under the Indusnt 0*1972 had totalled  4.1 million involving a total investme 26.3 million and estimated eventually to provide 3600 &amp;eW/as
as well as safeguarding a further 4-20.   At Hartlepool thereare now 10 advance factories completed and available. TheSpecial Employment and Training Measures introduced by this government have already benefitted over 2,000 people in Hartlepool,and unemployed people in the area also stand to benefit from thehath Opportunities Programme and the Special Temporary EmploymentProgramme.   The National Enterprise Board is developing closelinks with local authorities in the North to ensure that suitableinvestment opportunities are not neglected.20 The BSC intend to reclaim a slag bank for redevelopment asalight industrial estate.    The Department of the Environment hasno* decided to make funds available under the Derelict LandReclamation Programme to enable this to be expedited. Theapartment will also discuss with -BSC a possible scheme whichWQuld attract a 30% grant from the European Regional Developmenttowards the cost of providing infrastructure.    In addition,the Department of Transport will approach the County Council toconsider bringing forward road schemes to help alleviate unemployment1 the area and to improve access to the town and its industrial&apos;ctates.   Hartlepool has requested &quot;designated district&quot; statusthe terms of the Inner Urban Areas Bill.   The department the Environment is giving sympathetic consideration to thisreque8t.
torieS&apos;East Moors21     The closure of the East Moors steelworks will have aserious effect on manufacturing employment in Cardiff whicknew developments in surrounding areas (such as the Fordsplant at Bridgend) cannot entirely redress.    The welsh office will be holding urgent talks   with the Welsh DevelopsAgency, South Glamorgan Council and Cardiff City Council t0identify suitable sites for the provision of advance facUp to  A million of additional resources will be available^6the Agency in 1978/79 for suitable measures.

Subject to these twothe Corporation has every intention of proceeding with &quot;the continuous casting scheme and hopes to make a start on &quot;the investment in 1978/79.

The Beswick repo--H-ed t0 3of 4 February 1975 noted that the Corporation was commitprogramme of far-reaching modernisation of the Ebbw Valefirs*operations and that the Corporation planned to follow tne 4-0 million development scheme now commissioning with a seCpnewed t*stage development.   This undertaking was subsequently reuthe Secretary of State for Industry in June 1977 and it sstands.   However, as was also indicated at the time, theof this further investment must, of course, be dependentthefinancial evaluation in the light of the development m* demarket in the future.

InClrcumstances, the further issue of NLF and of PDC underu^ced criteria is inappropriate.   Accordingly, it isthat BSC should be financed for the time being through
16subscription of capital under Section 18(1) of the Iron andSteel Act 1975-   All new capital to be subscribed under thisSection would require to be remunerated by dividends after a capital reconstruction had taken place.   Legislation will shortly be presented to Parliament to authorise such issuefunds.   More detailed information about financing BSC will-be made available to Parliament at that time.Cash Limits29     The system of annual cash limits introduced by theGovernment in 1976/77 has proved an effective discipline oDthe Corporation, as on other nationalised industries. lSthe intention of the Government to settle the cash limit oDa year by year basis taking account of the Corporation^progress towards improved operating and financial perform3The cash limit will be fixed at ^....    million.
