CIIAFrER 1GDNFIDEMTIALTHE PROBLEMS1*   This is the seventh occasion since we were appointed in September 1971on which we have put forward recommendations on the pay and allowances ofthe members of the armed forces within our terms of reference and on thecharges for food and accommodation for the armed forces as a whole. on two occasions only - in 1972 in our First Report and in 1975 in our fouth report - have we been able to base our recommendations wholly on theprinciples and considerations that we regard as appropriate to recognise^d reward the many and varied tasks carried out by the Services and on those principles and considerations alone.    We have discussed them in earlier Reports : their objective is to relate Service pay to pay for jobsQf comparable skill and responsibility in civil life established byobjective standards, while at the same time preserving internal coherencel&amp; the complex rank and trade structures of the three Services; and to relate charges for food and accommodation to living costs in civil life ina way that is accepted as &quot;fair&quot; to servicemen and women, both by them andby the community which they serve.   In 1973 and 197*f and in 1976 and 1977,however, we have carried out our reviews against a background of restraintmeasures which have been intended to apply to the community as a whole butV;hich, in practice, have had much greater impact on some sections of itthan on others.    In these years we used the relevant outside pay comparisonstQ demonstrate that the maximum increases permitted under the counter-^-nfiation measures of the day were fully justified.    In 1975, we were ableu0 recommend rates of pay that, for a brief period, restored the shortfallthat had arisen during the period of the statutory restraint measures and,m our 1976 and 1977 Reports , we drew attention to the fact that armed forces&apos; pay generally had again fallen short of the levels that would havebeen justified by the evidence of outside earnings for jobs of comparableWeight (we discuss this further in paragraphs k and 5)-   We quantified the^Eiount of the shortfalls as evidence for a future review, but we took theReport of the Revie-; Body on Armed Forces Pay 1972, Cmnd. ^95**, Chapter3; Third Report 107**. cmnd.. 5631, Chapters 1 and 2; Fourth Report 1975,Cmnd. 6063; Fifth Report 1976, Cmnd. 6*f?0.a review Body on Armed Fcrces PayT Fifth Report 1976, Cmnd. 6^70, paragrapho; and Sixth Report 1977, Cmnd. 6801, paragraph if.1
view that it would have been wrong either to create expectations byindicating in our reports a single figure of shortfall in percentage terms which might have been interpreted as applying to everyone, or tosingle out the armed forces from the rest of the community by recommending that the Government should accept for them increases that were incon-sistent with its declared policy   for the community as a whole.2.   The concern that we expressed in our last two reports has been widelyreflected throughout the armed forces themselves.   We have been left inno doubt, in the course of our visits to Service units during the year andby the content of formal and informal evidence put to us by senior officers who have responsibility for management, that concern on this score is a major preoccupation within Service communities, not only of servicemen ofall ranks themselves, but also of their wives.    Moreover, a series ofParliamentary debates on pay and conditions in the armed forces, a steadyflow of Parliamentary Questions and a considerable volume of press commentover the past year have all provided evidence of lively public interestand - unmistakeably - of mounting public concern about the present stateof pay and conditions in the Services, particularly bearing in mind thejobs that servicemen are called upon to take on in time of emergency, inaddition to their normal military duties.   The extent of the discussion andcomment is welcome evidence of widespread interest in and sympathy forservicemen&apos;s problems and, in our view, it is indicative of a growingPublic determination to see a square deal for the armed forces in operation as a first priority in the period ahead.    In order to provide a firm basis for consideration of an issue of real and widespread public concern, we see it as essential to identify in detail the extent to which the restraintMeasures that have been in operation since July 1975 have borne moreharshly on the armed forces than on their recognised counterparts in civil life, by making known the rates of military salary and the consequent pay increases that the application of our normal criteria justifies at 1 Aprili978, and to indicate the timescale within which we consider it essential*or them to be put into effect in an up-to-date form.   We do this in chapters 3 and k. _ _ _-ne White Papers, The Attack on Inflation, Cmnd. 6151; The Attack onInflation, The Second Year, Cmnd. 6507.2
3.   Because the pay and conditions of the armed forces are rightly amatter of great public concern, we think it important to dispel some ofthe more common misunderstandings that colour much of the comment on them both inside and outside the Services, so that public discussioncan more readily concentrate on the very real problems that undoubtedlyexist.   We do this in Chapter 2 in describing our approach to the currentreview.   The fact that misconceptions do exist within the Services under-lines the importance of ensuring that adequate explanations are given atall levels within the Services both of the principles on which pay isbased and of general restraint measures that affect them in common withother sections of society.   Since Service &quot;populations&quot; change continuously,the process of explaining the system must be continuous.^.    The principal problem that faces us is, of course, the extent of the&quot;shortfall&quot; and the steps that are needed to eliminate it.   The emergence of a shortfall as a result of restraint measures that were intended toaPPly outside as well as inside the armed forces has led to questioningof the way in which the &quot;comparability&quot; principle has been applied.Obviously, it is inherent in any system that relies in part at least oncomparisons, that reviews of pay can only reflect the impact on totalearnings of settlements that have already come into effect.    The intro-duction of restraint measures which come into operation almost as soon asthey are announced, as in 1975i interrupts the process and creates a gapwhich, sooner or later, has to be bridged.   We last brought Service payuP-to-date on 1 April 1975 on the basis of outside pay for comparableJobs that reflected pay settlements reached before that date. Subsequentsettlements outside, made before the introduction on 1 August 1975 of the restraint measures announced on 11 July 1975i would normally have been reflected in our 1976 recommendations but, because of the operation ofthe restraint measures, they have not, even now, been reflected in fulliri the military salary: this is the origin - but not the only cause - ofthe shortfall.   By April 1976 when we next reviewed Service pay, the outside evidence disclosed significant shortfalls at most - but not all -ranks of the Services which the payment of a standard supplement to thoseearning less than  8,500 a year did not remove.    In theory, the general application of the restraint measures ought to imply that a shortfall of3
this kind would not change while they continued to be in force. Batthis does not happen in practice: even strict application of themeasures does not alter the fact that earnings continue to increasebeyond the limits imposed, whether from increased overtime or shiftwork, or from changing jobs: and these are options that are either hotopen at all to servicemen or, in the case of changing jobs, are not readily available.    The Government has made known   that the &quot; 6 policy,which represented an average increase in wage settlements of nearly11 per cent, produced an increase in earnings for the year of about Ikper cent.&quot;   The increase in earnings in the Services was 9-6 per cent.The same pattern is bound to emerge from the second round measures, inwhich the increase in Service pay averaged k.B per cent: our evidenceindicates a substantial increase in the shortfall.   We discuss this further in Chapter 3-5.   Since pay increases outside come into effect on different annualdates throughout the year, a measure of timelag in relation to thereflection in armed forces&apos; pay of some settlements outside is inevitable.This does not invalidate the system, or throw doubt on the role of job evaluation within it, but it underlines the urgent need for sufficientflexibility to enable the pay of the armed forces to be restored to aPosition that properly reflects both the rewards outside for jobs of comparable weight, and the unique contribution that they make - both in military terms (as in Northern Ireland) or in civil emergencies. recently the restraints imposed on the system have prolonged the delay in reflectingdevelopments outside; this is the real issue at the root of the presentunease about pay and conditions in the Services.    It is clear to us that,within the community as a whole, the armed forces are entitled to expectimmediate recognition of what is due to them, and a firm commitment onthe date when up-to-date rates of military salary will be given full effect, if confidence is to be restored in a system which is widely recognised as the most suitable, but whose operation has been frustratedin more years than not since its introduction in 1970.   We have in mind that a commi-raent of this kind has recently been given to firemen employedby local authorities, and we can see no shadow of justification fortreating the armed forces any less favourably in this matter.1The White Paper, The Attack on Inflation after 31st July 1977,Cmnd. 6882, paragrs^&apos;
6.   The real problems at the root of the widespread malaise about pay and conditions of service in the armed forces have to be faced becausethey have serious implications for manning and, consequently, for the operational capability of the armed forces which is crucial to thesecurity of the community.    It i6 not for us to comment on decisionsrelating to levels of defence expenditure except to the extent thatthey directly affect the workload, the conditions and the attitudesservicemen.   In the view of senior officers, dissatisfaction with pay and conditions is an important contributory factor to the present and prospective increase in the outflow of officers and servicemen incertain key ranks and trades by premature voluntary release; by theexercise of options to leave the Services; and by failure to re-engageon completion of engagements.    This trend has been confirmed in therecent Defence White Paper .   The situation is fluid, and comprehensivestatistics are hard to come by: but we are in no doubt that, in some important areas, shortages of special skills have become serious and,unless corrective action is taken quickly, the Services will lose moreand more of their best men, particularly in the technical branches whereindividuals have readily marketable skills even at a time of high unemploy-ment generally.    In our view, in the interests of the community as awhole as well as of justice for the armed forces, sensible action must betaken to reverse the present clear trend before it goes any further. Itcannot be too strongly emphasised that the services strength lies in theirstock of highly trained and experienced officers and men: it is obviouslya shortsighted policy to allow the very significant investment in training to be wasted in the loss of those men that they most need and at the same2time to incur further vast expenditure on training their replacements,Perhaps only to lose them too to better paid jobs outside.   It is not a financial question alone.   Training, particularly for the most highly skilled jobs, is a long-term process: experience can only be acquired overtime.   Losses now will inevitably take many years to make good.1Statement on the Defence Estimates 1978, Cmnd. 7099-In the Royal Air Force, for example, costs vary according to aircraft androle.   The training of a &apos;fast jet1 pilot is the most expensive. Theestimated cost to the RAF to train such a pilot to full operationalstandard covering all elements of training from initial officer tooperational training and including elements for fixed costs is of theorder of  1 million at 1977-78 price levels.5
7.    The deteriorating manpower position about which we have been told is,of course, additional to the planned reductions that resulted from therecent defence review: combined with the continuing demands in NorthernIreland and with other emergency operations (one example is the job doneby the Services during the recent firemen&apos;s strike), it has created what has been described as &quot;overstretch&quot;.    In our judgment, the flexibilitydisplayed by the armed forces in these circumstances would, in any othercontext, be held to justify the introduction of some form of recognitionas productivity1.    But, provided that comparison with total earnings incomparable jobs outside is the main yardstick both for assessing the levels of armed forces pay that are appropriate and for deciding those that are actually paid, it would not be right to introduce special rewardsfor productivity (even if it were possible to measure and distinguish jbetween individual contributions), or for any other aspect of work thatis already reflected in the levels of total earnings obtained through our surveys.   When the evidence of these surveys is taken fully intoaccount, productivity arrangements in outside employment, overtime pay-ments which recognise long hours of work, and various bonuses are allreflected in armed forces pay in an averaged out way in the broad-banded pay structure that has, up to now, been regarded as appropriate to the circumstances of the armed forces.   Their significance at thePresent time is of course that, in employment outside the Services,productivity arrangements can be introduced over and above general pay increases within the guidelines and are outside the scope of the 12 monthsrule.    They will inevitably increase outside earnings in the coming year in ways that are not available to the armed forces and thus increasefurther the shortfall that already exists.8-   The X factor presents a further problem.    It recognises the balance ofdisadvantage of Service life by comparison with civil life by, in general,a standard addition of 10 per cent (men) and 5 per cent (women).    It is abroad-brush approach which has been based on the assumption that, over aPeriod, the experience of an individual will tend to be self-balancing.But a system of this kind is only satisfactory so long as the range of theaer;.^r.l.  mare on i idi- .;iv u.s. is not too wide over too long a period: it is
not designed to cover,  for example, cases of exceptionally long hours worked habitually for long periods.    If this is the situation that isin practice emerging for particular groups - as it may be in NorthernIreland; or in trades which have been and are being most seriously affected by manning shortages; or in ships at sea - we may need toconsider whether a broad-banded structure of fixed salaries incorporatinga standard X factor is sufficiently responsive to the changing demandsof the situation, or whether it may provide less than adequate rewardsfor some servicemen in recognition of the demands made on them. Itwill be necessary to inquire into this in greater depth.9.    The unsatisfactory pay position is made still less tolerable by minorirritations created by the relative deterioration in some other conditionsof service.   A simple example illustrates the point: baggage allowances for servicemen posted overseas on accompanied tours are effectively frozenin cash terms because to increase them would (we have been told) be interpreted as a non-wage benefit which would have to be offset against apay increase.    But the scales of provision of equipment in married quartersmay not reflect individual standards and, if a Service family needs to&quot;transport a higher proportion of personal belongings as a result, it canonly be done at the cost of an excess baggage charge.    It is a furthersource of irritation that the scale of the allowance for the removal of personal effects is less generous than the scale available to the civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence, and it is small consolationin a situation of cash shortage that this stems from differences in pay and conditions of service in general which are designed for a very dif-ferent purpose.l0-   We believe that members of the armed forces accept that government policies on pay must affect them in the same way as they affect othermembers of the community.   In a system based on comparisons with outsideearnings, the introduction of rigid restraint measures between payreviews inevitably creates the kind of shortfall that we have described,Dut the armed forces find it increasingly difficult - and we do also - toAccept a situation in which the shortfall continues to increase duringthe operation of restraint measures that are intended to apply equally toeveryon^, because means are provided that are not open to servicemen, by7
which earnings can be increased by more than the basic increases thatthe measures allow.    This is still more difficult to accept when many members of the armed forces are themselves required to take on increasedworkloads with all that this implies for flexibility in working arrange-ments, but without the financial recogxiition that employees outside mayhave without violating the current guidelines.8
CHAPTER 2OUR APPROACH11. We are concerned in this report with the pay of all ranks of the armed forces up to and including Brigadier, except medical and dental officers: we shall make our recommendations on medical and dental officers&apos; pay in the light of the recommendations of the Review body on Doctors&apos; and dentists Remuneration for doctors and dentists in theNational Health Service, also with effect from 1 April 1978.   Last year,exceptionally, the nature of our recommendations enabled us to includethe pay of medical and dental officers in our general recommendations,but we now revert to our normal practice and will put forward our recommendations separately, in a Supplement to this Report.12. The common feature of the different forms of restraint measures that have been in operation in five out of the last seven years is thatthey have imposed limits on individual increases in pay - sometimes anupper limit only, and sometimes a lower limit also.    There is, of course,a tendency for upper limits - whether expressed as a cash sum or as a percentage - to come to be regarded as the standard increase for everyone.But in the case of the armed forces, we have invariably taken the viewthat every pay increase has to be justified by the criteria that we haveevolved to assist us in assessing the levels of pay that are appropriate&amp;nd that we first described in our 1972 Report .   The mam criterion iscomparison with earnings in jobs of equivalent skill and responsibility in civil life, judged by objective standards.   To translate this criterioninto practical terms, a system which provides internal consistency andcoherence of evaluation throughout the complex rank and trade structures0r&quot; the separate Services, and between the Services and outside employment,is essential.    Other considerations are the rewards and incentivesrelated to special features of Service lii- - for example, the broadbalance of the advantage.: and disadvantages of a disciplined Servicecareer compared with a career in civil life, which is reflected in the Xfactor, ar.d the need to provide incentives to encourage prolongation ofservice, or commitment to a career, in the armed forces.1Report of the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay 1972, April 1972, Cmnd.H95^-9
13. . Job evaluation is the main technique used on our behalf to comparethe relative values of jobs at key levels in the Services and of equiv-alent jobs outside.   At present, three systems of job evaluation are in use: for Corporals, the results of which are reflected downwards to lowerranks; for senior NCOs and Warrant Officers; and for officers from Captainto Brigadier.   In each, jobs are analysed in terms of factors related tothe demands of the job - for example, skill and experience requirements,responsibility etc - weighted according to their importance. Theallocation of points scores to each factor translates demands andqualities in like and unlike jobs into a common &quot;currency&quot; of points,and brings within the scope of the system of comparison Service jobs forwhich there are no counterparts in civil life.   The detailed application and continuous review of the job evaluation process is carried out byspecially trained and experienced members of the armed forces who make upthe Joint Services Job Evaluation Team, under the guidance of independentconsultants employed on our behalf: in this way, the Services themselvescan be confident that all the demands of their own jobs are properlyunderstood, and we ourselves can be satisfied both that this is so, andthat a check is kept on the consistency and objectivity of the standards of judgment.1^.   For pay purposes, servicemen&apos;s jobs are grouped into broadly basedPay bands according to their points scores.   Thus, any one band may includewholly dissimilar jobs - for example, clerks, drivers, and infantrysoldiers - which fall into the same broad range of points scores. Forthis reason, the type of comparison of pay in specific jobs in the Servicesand in civil life that is sometimes attempted is not a particularlyreliable guide: it is important to see the job evaluation process in proper focus in relation to the range of jobs included in the outsidecomparisons.    In the case of the Corporal, for example, the range of earnings in outside jobs of the same weight is wide.   Even after taking account of ali other considerations that enter into the process ofassessing a particular military salary, it will not be unusual to findSQme examples of higher rates of pay in civil life, notwithstanding the* factor, for jobs carrying the same descriptive title.   In short, itwiH always be possible to find particular individuals within a trade in10
civil life who are paid more than servicemen in the same trade, but the levels of military salaries in each pay band will reflect the earnings of all the outside jobs of equivalent weight.    We review the evidenceobtained on this basis in Chapter 3.15. Comparisons of servicemen&apos;s pay with earnings in industry or inother public services are sometimes made in terms of &quot;take home pay&quot;without sufficient regard to the need to compare like with like.   It isan unrealistic basis for comparison in any case, since &quot;take home pay&quot;normally means gross pay net of income tax and national insurance con-tributions, which reflect an individuals personal circumstances ratherthan the rewards of his job, which are measured by gross pay.    It is notvalid at all when, on the Services&apos; side of the calculation, the figuresquoted are also net of charges for housing and/or food.   Men and women in civil life also have no choice in relation to the rising costs offood and housing, but they undoubtedly have greater freedom in relationto ways and means of increasing income or adjusting their expenditure inorder to meet them.16. The comparison criterion extends also to consideration of the charges for food and accommodation, where these are provided by the Services, inthe parallel sense that they reflect the corresponding expenses whichPeople in civil life have to bear and the pay that servicemen receive.We describe in Chapter 3 the methods by which this is done.   We haveexpressed doubts in earlier reports   about the methods used since 1970 to assess accommodation charges, but neither we nor the Ministry of Defencehave so far been able to find a suitable alternative that is fair both tothe serviceman and to the taxpayer.   Nevertheless, we well understandthat servicemen find it difficult to accept that charges should continueto increase according to the established basis of calculation when the established basis for assessing pay has been virtually put into suspense,giving rise to shortfalls in pay.    So long as Service pay is competitivewith earnings outside, the basis of assessing charges is inherentlyadvantageous to servicemen because it is related to local authority rents and other costs that are up to one year out of date.   But as the military1Report of the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay 1972, Cmnd. ^95^; second report 1973, Cmnd. 5336; Fourth Report 1975i Cmnd. 6063.11
salary falls increasingly out of line with earnings in jobs of comparableskill and responsibility outside, this advantage diminishes and before long disappears.    The balance can be (and normally is) maintained fairlywhen reviews of pay and charges are not made subject to artificialrestraint measures imposed extraneously and, within moderate limits,some imbalance is tolerable.    But the imbalance in pay now disclosed bythe evidence is no longer moderate and some modification of the applicationof the method may be justified.    We consider this problem further in chapters 3 and k.17. We have noted continuing public comment on the effect and implications of the armed forces own rent and rates rebates system, which is associatedwith accommodation charges.    The extent to which servicemen make use ofthis system is sometimes presented as evidence that the earnings of thoseservicemen are somehow below the &quot;poverty line&quot;, and as a stigma. Thisis wrong.   The system is intended to reflect the general arrangements incivil life to help families who occupy rented property, according totheir family circumstances as well as to their means.    At any particularincome level, the size of family is the main deciding factor whether thereis an entitlement to rebate.    Short of abolition of the entire scheme, theonly way in which entitlement could be avoided for everyone would be tointroduce a minimum rate of pay for all servicemen, regardless of familycircumstances, equal to the amount needed to disqualify the man with the!argest family from entitlement to rebate.    Whether or not this would be practicable, it would undoubtedly be in conflict with the general principlethat servicemenfs pay should reflect the rewards for work of comparableskill and responsibility outside.   This brings us back again to the need to restore the military salary to the levels that properly reflectearnings outside and the special features of Service life.    When this hasbeen done, we are confident that the rent and rates rebate scheme will beseen in its proper social and financial perspective.18. It will be apparent that our reviews are concerned with an inter-related package of pay and charges, both administered by the employer.This is an unusual situation, but it is not unique - other employersProvide accommodation and many provide some part of their employees&apos;food - but the great majority of people in all walks of life are paid by12
their employer and buy their food and their accommodation in the open market.    It is at this point, in relation to an inter-related package,that artificiality is introduced by measures of restraint which arbitrarilyaffect the individual components that go to make up the package.Specifically, since 1 August 1975i the cost of non-wage benefits has hadto be offset against the total cost of the pay increase allowable withinthe guidelines in each year.   We have referred before    to evidencepresented to us on behalf of Government which indicates that a change inthe basis of calculation that would result in a lower charge than would otherwise have been justified, or any abatement or standstill, would create such a non-wage benefit, the cost of which would have to be offsetagainst the total amount of money available for a pay increase and would reduce the amount of the pay increase itself.    We can well understandservicemen&apos;s resentment at what they see as inconsistency in the treatmentci pay and charges and we have been watching the position with great care.Some rough justice is inevitably involved in general measures at a time ofeconomic crisis and in its wake and, in our 1976 and 1977 reviews, wewere satisfied that what was happening to pay and charges in the Serviceshroadly reflected what was happening in the community generally.    But were recognised that problems were developing and, in our Sixth Report last year,We urged that the third stage of the Government&apos;s restraint measures shouldincorporate enough flexibility in a form that was directly relevant to the armed forces pay system to enable us to deal with these problems. Regrettably,this has not been done: indeed, the continuation in the current guidelinesof the provision concerning non-wage benefits emphasises the differences between what is happening in the Services and in the community generally.Ambers of the armed forces cannot enhance their pay by working overtime,0r shifts, or in the last resort, by switching jobs at short notice in theway that is open to outside employees.    Equally, for those outside who live in rented accommodation, a standstill or a change in the basis on which their landlord - whether private or public - assesses their rent is not hold to confer a &quot;non-wage benefit1 which then has to be offset againstthe pay increase that their employers may agree.   It seems inconceivable,for example, that a decision by a local authority to impose a standstillReview ..ody on Armed Forces Pay, Fifth Report 1976, Cmnd. 6^70, paragraphs15 and 16: and S^xth Rcoort 1977, Cmnd. 6801, paragraph 15-13
in rents would be transformed into a series of limitations on the pay increases that their tenants employers could pay within Governmentguidelines.19.   Against this background, we have again collected the evidence thatenables us to assess the levels of pay and charges that are appropriatenow on the existing criteria.   The present pattern of payment ofmilitary salary and supplements and of additional pay has become1far removed from the structure that we recommended in 1975 * Thisdistortion is a direct consequence of the rigidity imposed by the 1976and 1977 restraint measures with which the recommendations in our Fifthand Sixth Reports^ complied.    We have therefore seen it as essential totake stock of the situation, to measure the extent to which armed forces1Pay is now out of line with outside pay, and to establish the structure and levels of pay that would be appropriate for the armed forces in 1978,if there were no obstacles to their introduction.   Moreover, on this occasion, it is not enough that we should know the answer: we believethat Government should know it, that members of the armed forces them-selves should know it, and that the general public should know it. our intention to give details of the structure and levels of pay for the armed forces appropriate to 1 April 1978 has already been made known tothe Prime Minister, and he has told us that, under the guidelines thatare in operation at present, implementation of the new rates of pay may need to be phased.    It will be obvious that, whether they are implemented in full with effect from 1 April 1978 or staged, the levels that weindicate will soon become out of date: if an increase were to be limitedwithin the 10 per cent earnings guideline without regard to the pro-visions for self-financing productivity arrangements that are a featureQf the current measures, it would allow only a limited reflection of theappropriate structure of pay, and partial removal only of the anomaliesthat undoubtedly exist.Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Fourth Report 1975, May 1975, Cmnd. 6063.2 Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Fifth Report 1976, May 1976, Cmnd. 6^70.3 Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, Sixth Report 1977, April 1977, Cmnd. 6801.Ik
20. The evidence of what is happening to pay and to prices in thecommunity generally is discussed in detail in Chapter 3-    It comes from several sources.    The primary sources include the job evaluation-based earnings surveys that provide first hand evidence of earnings injobs outside that are of equivalent weight to jobs in the Services.We do not, however, consider these in isolation: as far as possible,their implications are tested against evidence from secondary sourcesthat offer a useful check whether the primary evidence is in line withother observations.    Among the &quot;secondary&quot; sources are the New EarningsSurvey and the Index of Average Earnings, although (as we explain inparagraphs 33 and 3*0 at certain levels in the armed forces pay structurewhere job evaluation does not operate, these become primary sourcesthemselves, and need to be tested against other evidence.   Evidence oncharges is also subjected to a cross-checking process: the primaryevidence - on rents, on rates, on the costs of furnishing and equippingquarters and of maintaining them - is factual.    But we also consider the broader spectrum of outside experience - for example, what people incivil life spend on food and accommodation in relation to their incomes;or whether - as in 197^ - there is a standstill on local authority rentswhich may influence our view of the primary evidence.    These secondaryfactors play an important part in helping us to make our judgments.21. Apart from factual evidence on developments outside, we rely on theMinistry of Defence for evidence on other essential background issues,such as manning, and the implications of wastage and of recruiting trends.They also provide evidence on matters of principle: the objectives thatthey aim to achieve and their views on what is necessary to do so. But,Perhaps of greater importance even than these, the senior officers of the armed forces who have special responsibility in these matters are ableto distil the experience from their constant contact with officers andmen wherever they may be, and to provide us with firm evidence of ServiceVlews and attitudes to pay and conditions of service from a broader basethan the impressions that we obtain at first hand on our necessarily more limited visits to Service units.15
22. All the evidence has limitations however: it does not, and cannot,provide &quot;the answer&quot; in terms of a unique set of pay rates, or of charges,for the armed forces.   Even with the advantage of a system of job evaluation to facilitate the task of classifying and co-ordinating infor-mation on earnings, there is no single level of earnings appropriate tojobs that are judged to be of the same value.    The wide range of earningsat each level (paragraph 14), even when allowance has been made for suchobvious differences as hours worked, regional allowances and the like,illustrates the point.    The reduction of evidence of this kind to ratesof pay that take account of differences in other conditions of service;of what we believe to be a unique rank structure; and of the specialfeatures that have to be taken into account if sufficient men and women ofthe necessary qualities are to be recruited and - more important still -retained, is a matter of judgment.23. We also have to consider the evidence that has been put to us on theapplication to armed forces&apos; pay of the current guidelines   with which theGovernment has asked us to comply in making our recommendations.    We have referred to their implications for the structure and levels of pay thatare appropriate for the armed forces on 1 April 1978 (paragraph 19) andfor the level of shortfall.   The absence of a specific limit on individualPay increases provides a degree of flexibility within which a start canDe made on correcting the worst anomalies that have arisen since 1975- Wecomment on this in greater detail in Chapter 3-   We note in passing theeffect that the very existence of artificial restraint measures has on the approach of the Services management to the priorities.    In a situation ofa substantial overall shortfall, an equal share of the available cake foreveryone perforce becomes their first priority at the expense of therestoration of proper order to the pay structure.   We are currentlyexamining a number of forms of additional pay from the points of view ofjustification, structure and levels of payment, and are considering pro-Posals on changes in structure as part of our longer term review: andthe Ministry of Defence have urged us to recommend, in principle, thatthe levels of additional pay be restored to the relationships with theMilitary salary that existed in earlier years.    In the case of major forms1The White Paper, The Attack on Inflation after 31st July 1977, Cmnd. 6882.16
of additional pay - for example, flying pay and submarine pay - we endorse the view expressed in 1970 by our predecessors   that for review purposes,additional pay ought to be considered with the military salary as total income, and that its value vis-a-vis the military salary ought broadlyto be preserved.   We therefore agree in principle with the Ministry ofDefence view of this issue.    But the Ministry of Defence have told us that, in a situation in which pay increases are restricted by theGovernment&apos;s restraint measures, they would not in general want any ofthe forms of additional pay to be increased at the expense of increases in the military salary.   We have questioned the Services management aboutthe basis of this view and they have confirmed that, in the context ofan increase within the guidelines, they see no alternative to its application wholly to the military salary, although this would mean that part of the increase in the military salary would be madeat the expense of additional pay.   They see any other course as pot-entially divisive.    We understand their concern that all members of theServices should receive the greatest possible benefit as individuals in circumstances of a pay increase within the Government&apos;s guidelines againstthe background of a substantial shortfall at all levels.    But additionalPay has not been increased since 1975 and we believe that, notwithstandingthese representations, it is right to take this opportunity - the firstsince 1975 - to make the initial move towards restoration of the levelsthat are appropriate now.    The major items of additional pay can makea substantial contribution to total earnings of individuals and the ratescan be increased substantially at a modest cost.   We believe that the relatively few forms of additional pay that contribute substantially to earnings are as important as the military salary, and we explain our conclusions in Chapter zt.21f*   Turning from the general issue to specific problems, the Ministry ofDefence have made a number of proposals to which they would give priority in a situation that was free from restraint measures.   We mention two ofthem in particular: a substantial increase in the rate of Northern IrelandPay, which was introduced with effect from 1 April 197^ at the rate of50p a day, and has since remained unchanged; and an abatement of the rentaldement of married quarter charges on grounds that can conveniently be1National Board for Prices and Incomes Report No 1^+2, paragraphs 89 and 100,17
summarised as &quot;social justice&quot;.   But they have told us in formalevidence and have confirmed in discussion with us that they would not want the increases in basic pay on 1 April 1978 to be reduced by the implementation of either of these two measures, whose cost accordingto the present interpretation of the Government&apos;s guidelines wouldhave to be found out of the total sum available for the pay increase.There is obvious conflict between what is desirable and what is expedient, and the right course can only be a matter of judgment. we discuss the problem further in Chapter 3 and our recommendations arein Chapter *t.18
CHAFIER 3THE EVIDENCE AND OUR CONCLUSIONS25. We now consider the evidence on pay and on charges for food andfor accommodation which provides the basis of our conclusions on the levels that are appropriate for introduction with effect from 1 April1978.26. We have obtained a wide range of evidence of outside earnings thatrelates to key points in the pay structure: to Privates; to Corporals;to Warrant Officers; to Second Lieutenants; and to officer ranks fromCaptain to Brigadier^.    In the case of Captains to Brigadiers and ofCorporals, the evidence is based on comprehensive job evaluation studies(which we have described in Chapter 2).   Job evaluation is also carriedQut for Warrant Officers and senior NCOs, although at present the com-Parison with civil life is rather more limited and we aim to expand it.We discuss each of these in turn and describe our conclusions.Pffic^7.   We have explained in previous reports that, so long as the maincriterion for assessing Service pay is comparison with earnings outsideln jobs of comparable &quot;weight&quot; in terms of skill and responsibility,Reliable methods are vital to enable those earnings to be related to jobSl2e, both in the Services and in the outside organisations from which theevidence c.i earnings comes.    In the case of officers, the system of jobValuation that we use is used extensively in other organisations, andthe process is monitored by consultants whom we have also employed tosatiSfy ourselves independently that the use of the system within theServices is consistent with the standards of other users.   The advantage0f this system is the ready access that it affords to evidence of payPractices in, at present, more than 260 organisations of many types which1Here and elsewhere in this report, references to army ranks are intendedto include equivalent ranks in the other Services where the context allows.19
are fully representative in terms of numbers of employees - fromorganisations with less than 500 employees to those with more than20,000.28. This provides a means of comparing, from a common basis, the range of earnings in jobs that are comparable in size to the jobs held by officers from Captain to Brigadier; and, as a matter of practice, we take the median earnings indicated by the evidence as our guide. the calculation of earnings is based on the rewards for jobs of comparablesize to those of officers at different ranks, adjusted to take accountof differences in pension arrangements and of the incidence and thevalue of benefits derived from such items as bonus payments and profitsharing schemes, and from the private use of company cars, where theseform part of outside remuneration.    The pay of Lieutenants and SecondLieutenants needs to provide a sensible and competitive entry salary and early progression in relation to the starting salaries and early salaryProgressions of junior management recruits, and of recruits of parallelcalibre and standards to other professions; it also needs to stand in asensible relationship to the pay of Captains, as the rank to which theywiU be promoted at the appropriate stage.    A further and most importantobjective is to establish a satisfactory relationship with the pay ofnon-commissioned officers and other servicemen in the light of theevidence on pay differentials in outside employment.29. The evidence based on job evaluation indicates that the median levels of salary in outside jobs that we use to establish salary scale mid-points^e higher than the equivalent figures in 1975 by between about 56 percent and about kk per cent, both in terms of basic salaries and after thenecessary adjustments, including the X factor, have been made (paragraph 28).We use 1975 as the base for comparison because it is the most recent yearir* which the evidence was used fully as the basis for our judgment. the increases among the organisations that make up the sample are, of course,in a much wider range than movements in median figures alone imply. In0rder to test the validity of this evidence, we have considered the impliedsalaries for each rank by applying the movement between April 1975 and april 1977 in the most appropriate New Earnings Survey percentile   to the1we define the &quot;most appropriate New Earnings Survey percentile&quot; as the per-centile which, in April 1975 had a level nearer to the mid-point of a salary scale (excluding X factor) for a given rank than the level of anyother pc ^entile available.20
April 1975 salary (less X factor) for that rank.   Equivalent salariesat 1 April 1978 have been calculated from this base by the addition of10 per cent, which seems to us to be a moderate assessment of the likelymovement in earnings in the twelve months period from 1 April 1977 to1 April 1978, bearing in mind the extent to which self-financing pro-productivity arrangements have been introduced in the last eight months.On this basis, the 1978 levels (after the addition of the X factor) arebetween 35 per cent and kO per cent higher than their 1975 equivalents -amounts that are entirely consistent with the evidence of current levelsQf remuneration in jobs of equivalent weight outside (between 36 percent and kk per cent, see above).30.   The basic evidence does not of course provide a blue-print for an appropriate structure of military salary for officers up to and includingBrigadier.    But, taken with the necessarily more limited evidence at the entry rank of Second Lieutenant, we are satisfied that the structure inTable 1 below, which reflects all the evidence and includes the X factor,would be entirely appropriate at 1 April 1978 and ought to be introducedwith effect from that date.   The levels in this structure are higher thanthe salary levels introduced with effect from 1 April 1975 by amounts thatdo no more than reflect the evidence: the range in percentage terms is^om 35 per cent to **3 per cent.    Since 1975, however, two pay supplements^ve been paid at salary levels up to the mid-point of the Colonel*sscale1 and, as a result, the increases over current pay levels are lower than the figures above: they range between 19-5 per cent at Secondlieutenant to over 30 per cent at the mid-point of the Major&apos;s scale and above, and represent shortfalls from the salaries justified by outsideevidence that range from about 16 per cent to about 26 per cent. the cash amounts are, of course, the same whether they are described asincreases or as shortfalls2.   In addition to the shortfall which existed0n 1 August 1975, these figures reflect the extent to which the restraintMeasures of the last three years have borne more hardly on Service officersthan on their outside counterparts.   This does not imply widespread breaches1   In 1976, under the limits imposed by the White Paper, The Attack on InflatioCmnd. 6lSl, July 1975, those whose earnings would have exceeded  8,500 werenot eligible for an increase.For example,  800 fc .1s short of  1,000 by  200, or 20 per cent, but anincrer.se of  200, or 2r- per cent, is needed to increase  800 to  1,000.21
CONFIDENTIALof the restraint measures: it does no more than reflect the initial shortfalland the effect of drift over the three year period.    It also includes recog-nition of the increase in the value to the individual of those quantifiablebenefits in kind - for example, the private use of a company car - v/hichwere reflected by cash sums in the military salary in 1975 and again in this review, but which could not be taken into account in 1976 and 1977-Table 1Scales of military salary inclusive of X factor appropriate at April 1978 for officers up to Brigadier based on theevidence (annual rates____)Rank		Military salary		 brigadier		13,501Colonel	- after 8 years	12,^98	6	12,198	4	11,899	2	11,600	on appointment	11,300it Colonel	- after 8 years	10,497	6	10,249	4	10,001	2	9,753	on appointment	9,505Hajor	- after 8 years	8,702 8,526	7		6	8,351 8,176	5 4			8,001	3	7,826 7,650	2		1	7,475	on appointment	7,300Captain	- after 6 years	6,720 6,563	5		4	6,406	3	6,249	2	6,092	1	5,935 5,778	on appc-ntment	ueutenant	- after 4 years	5,146	3	5,022 4,898	2		1	4,774	on appointment	4,650Second Lieutenant		5,749Annual salaries are derive 1 from daily rates in whole pence and rounded to*ae nearest  .22
Servicemen31.   Parallel information on job and pay comparisons for servicemen is less readily available.    We know of no single system of job evaluationthat is as widely used outside the Services as the one that we use for officers, and we rely on the co-operation of a large number of outsideorganisations which are willing to provide facilities for the evaluationQf jobs and to supply the earnings data that are essential to our task.It is a major and continuing business each year to carry out theevaluation of a substantial sample of jobs, and to collect the associatedinformation on earnings: it is carried out on our behalf by the JointServices Job Evaluation Team of the Ministry of Defence, under the guidance of consultants in association with the Office of ManpowerEconomics, acting on our behalf.   We acknowledge gratefully the majorcontribution of the organisations which provide the facilities and supporting data without which we could not carry out our remit.32-   A sample of just over 600 jobs in civil occupations has been built upto reflect job sizes that span the full range of Corporals&apos; jobs in theServices; a major part of the sample is designed to reflect, as far as is practicable, the distribution of occupations within industry and withingeographical regions indicated by the New Earnings Survey.    But becauseCorporals are more often in jobs that carry some responsibility forsupervision compared with the generality of outside jobs at this level,the sample has been deliberately adjusted to include more supervisoryJQhs than would be appropriate on the basis of the New Earnings Surveydistribution alone.   Each of these jobs has been evaluated by the samemethods and criteria as have been used in the armed forces to evaluate^hs at Corporal level.   The evaluation of the jobs within the outsides**Ple is kept up-to-date each year, within a five year cycle, as is the valuation of Corporals&apos; jobs in the armed forces.   The hours workedar- the total earnings in each job have been ascertained for a reference&apos;eek in November 1977 and, using regression analysis, the relationshipbetv;een earnings and job size has been calculated from these data for&apos;1obs equivalent to the jobs of Corporals.   The range of earnings in jobsta*t are evaluated at the same level is wide; it is our practice to takeeGrr - ,:s at median points scores in the various Service points ranges as? guide.23
33.   This evidence on its own is not sufficiently comprehensive toprovide a basis for the entire structure of pay which encompassesthirteen army ranks from recruit (Private IV) to Warrant Officer Class 1and includes three bands at ranks up to and including Corporal and four bands at ranks above which differentiate between jobs at each ofthe thirteen levels according to relative job size.    It is, however,the only evidence that is based on the job evaluation systems used inthe armed forces.    Other more general evidence complements it and provides satisfactory indicators on outside pay levels for jobs thatare broadly equivalent to the jobs done by Privates and, at the top ofthe structure, to the responsibilities and skills of Warrant Officers.Because these come from a variety of sources, they do not necessarilyall pull in the same direction as the evidence on earnings in jobs of equivalent weight to Corporals - there are, after all, few (if any)outside organisations which would base their pay structure on the requirement to pay separate and distinct salaries designed to providesignificant incentives to promotion or advancement at eight separate and distinct levels below the equivalent of Corporal Class I.3^.   To assist us in judging appropriate salary levels for the fourclasses of Private, we have hitherto taken the average earnings of full-time employees under the age of 21 as recorded in the New Earnings Surveyas our main indicator: and we based this approach on evidence of theaverage ages of junior non-commissioned ranks provided by the Ministry ofDefence.    Their most recent analysis of the ages of serving soldiers,sailors and airmen shows that there has been an upward shift in theseages compared with previous years.    For example, at Private IV (the lowest adult recruitment level) a significant proportion (some 21 per cent)are currently age 20 or over, although the minimum age of recruitment as911 adult is age 17^.   We have therefore developed according to our bestjudgment a progressive pay structure from Private Class IV to CorporalClass I which is compatible with the pay levels for Corporals derivedfrom the job-evaluation evidence and which, for Privates, on the basisof weighted averages, broadly reflects average earnings in the NewEarnings Survey at equivalent ages to the age groups of Privates.2k
35. At the upper end of the structure, we have obtained some valuableinformation on current earnings levels in a small number of jobs that have been judged to be the equivalent of certain V/arrant Officerjobs that combine a very high degree of technological skill and thehighest level of responsibility in the non-commissioned ranks. this information confirms clear but more general evidence - and theexperience of those of us who are directly connected with industry - thatthe rewards for technological skills of this quality have increasedrelatively to the rewards for junior management: translated into armed forces terms, it means that the military salaries of senior NCOs andWarrant Officers in these trades should be given a relative &quot;lift up&quot;vis-a-vis the military salaries of junior and middle rank officers. they already overlap, but we are satisfied that the extent of the overlapshould be rather greater.    We have discussed this aspect of the evidencewith the Principal Personnel Officers of the Ministry of Defence and wehave taken full account of the management considerations that arise. Asa result, we have incorporated some movement in this direction in the structure that is appropriate at 1 April 1978.   We are satisfied in theiight of the evidence and indicators of developments outside that areflection of this relative movement in the armed forces pay structureought not to be delayed: we intend as the next step to undertake a detailed comparison of jobs and earnings at Warrant Officer and seniornon-commissioned ranks, on a parallel basis to the regular comparison forCorporals.    We do not yet know how long such a comparison will take: itwiH depend on the resources that can be made available.    But we regard it as essential for a start to be made on it immediately.36. The pay structure for servicemen that we regard as appropriate at April 1978 has been strongly influenced by new evidence which justifieschange both in the internal relativities that were appropriate in 1975and in the relativity with the officers1 structure.   For this reason, directcomparison with the position in 1975 at the extremities of the structurecannot be made: the age groups appropriate to Privates in the 1977 New^nings Survey are not zhe same as in 19751 and we had no parallelevidence at all in that year to the material that is now available to us at Warrant Officer level     Likewise, comparisons at Corporal level need25
to be approached with caution because, as we have said, the evidence atone level only cannot be directly translated into the complex rank^d band structure in isolation: account has to be taken of the need tomaintain sensible internal relativities and progressions.    The evidencesuggests that outside earnings levels in jobs evaluated and foundequivalent to Corporals1 jobs were between about hj) per cent and MfJPer cent higher in November 1977 than they were in November 197^, thedate of the corresponding survey on which the recommendations in ourFourth Report were based.   By 1 April 1978, indicators suggest that theywill be between about 5lJ&quot; per cent and 53 per cent higher than inNovember 197^-    But, because we have been able to establish a new, andmore reliable reference point for the top of the senior NCO and warrant officer structure, we have also been able to reflect the evidence onCorporals1 pay more closely in the structure that we judge to be appropriate at 1 April 1978 than has been practicable on any previous occasion.    In short, because the salaries at the bottom and - more par-ticularly - at the top of the structure are higher relatively than theyWere, there is a bigger differential between them within which it hasDeen possible to combine both the outside evidence and the need for asensible salary progression on promotion.    The reconciliation of con-conflicting items of evidence to provide a sensible progression of salariesWlthin any structure calls for a measure of compromise, and it so happensthat, on this occasion, the discrete items of evidence conflict less with each other than they have done in the past.&apos;*   One piece of secondary evidence completes the picture on Corporals1^av*    In the period between our surveys of November 197^ and November 1977ithe index of average earnings of all workers increased from 199-0 to^0.2, that is, by almost 51 per cent - some 7 or 8 percentage points1110 re than the increase in the levels of earnings disclosed by our surveyslri the same period.    This does not afford a direct comparison with ourevidence because the index relates to all employees, whereas our ownsurveys relate to adult men only.   A comparison with the average earnings0^ full-time manual men aged 21 or over whose pay was not affected bysence, as recorded by the New Earnings Survey, is more relevant. InAPrii197^ and April 1977 these figures, updated in each case by the26
movement in the index of average earnings to November in each year,show a movement of kki per cent - within the range of **3 per cent to^ per cent indicated by our own surveys.38.   All servicemen and women have received two pay supplements since1975 - the first of  6 a week in 1976 and the second of 5 per cent of earnings with limits of  2.50 and Sh a week in 1977-    The disparity between current earnings levels and the levels that we judge appropriateat 1 April 1978 in the light of all the evidence is therefore lower(between 30 per cent and 37i per cent).   The up-to-date rates of pay which would be appropriate at 1 April 1978 and which ought to be intro-duced with effect from that date are in Table 2 (senior NCOs and warrant officers) and Table 3 (Corporals and below):   they consolidate the1976 and 1977 supplements into salary but, unlike the consilidation of supplements into basic rates in some other employments, this has noimplications for total earnings because no premium rates, for example,for overtime or shift-work, are derived from them.    The two tablesillustrate Scale B salaries for men in the army only, in accordance withQur usual practice, in order to facilitate the working out of equivalentsalaries for the other Services.   In practice, many senior NCOs and mostWarrant Officers are paid on Scale C, which is appropriate for those whohave served for 9 years or more, and would also qualify for long serviceincrements.    Taken together, these could increase the salaries shown bybetween  255 and  ^75 a year, according to length of service.27

39.   Tables 1, 2 and 3 set out in terms of the army, the structures andlevels of salaries for officers and servicemen that are, in our view,appropriate at 1 April 1978.    Salaries in the Royal Navy and the RoyalAir Force, and in the women&apos;s and nursing Services will need to be cal-culated from this base.   We make one reservation on this structure: itis clearly necessary to preserve a sensible progression from Brigadierto Major General but, because of the timing of our recommendations, wehave had to reach a conclusion on the military salary appropriate for theBrigadier without knowing the up-to-date salary of the Major General.The current Major General&apos;s salary was introduced on 1 January 1975 onthe recommendation of the Review Body on Top Salaries in its ReportNo 61.    It is now  12,208, including a supplement of  208 a year intro-duced in 1977, and it is currently under review.    We are satisfied thatthe up-to-date salary for the Brigadier is appropriate in the light ofthe other evidence, but until the result of the current review of the major General&apos;s salary is known, we regard it as provisional.The X factor^G.   The salaries in Tables 1-3 incorporate an X factor of 10 per centtapered above the rank of Lieutenant Colonel to reflect the extent towhich the aspects of Service life which are recognised in it bear lesshardly at these higher ranks.    The Review Body on Top Salaries took thisinto account in its 197^ recommendations   for Major Generals and above,when it concluded that these aspects were still less relevant, and thatthe concept of the X factor was not valid at those levels.^i-   The Ministry of Defence have proposed to us that the amount of theX factor should be increased because, in their view, the balance of dis-advantage over advantage of Service life by comparison with civil lifenas increased since it was last reviewed in 197^ (paragraph 8). Insupport of this view, they have put forward evidence and argument abouttfte elements that they see as relevant to the make-up of the X factor,to show where the Service position has changed relative to the position0utside.   A precise assessment of the balance is not practicable on this basis but, on the other hand, we recognise that the X factor poses difficult1Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6, Cmnd. 5846, December 197^.ibid, paragraphs 50 and 6l.
Problems.    In our view, a broad-brush treatment of the kind inherent in an overall X factor applicable to everyone within a large group canonly work satisfactorily where the range of individual experience thatit recognises is fairly limited, and where there is a reasonableassurance that - taking the rough with the smooth - the experience of allindividuals evens out over time.   We are not satisfied that this happensnow: the planned reductions in Service strengths in combination with theunplanned wastage - which now shows a disturbing increase in key areas -are creating what the Services call &quot;overstretch&quot;, particularly whenadditional tasks in emergencies are added to their primary militarytasks.   But we understand that the impact of manpower shortages isuneven, and it will not therefore be remedied by an arrangement whichtreats everyone alike.    The recognition of differences in individualcircumstances and conditions is, however, a complex matter and raisessome difficult issues.    We intend to examine these in more detail withthe Ministry of Defence, and until this examination has been completedWe cannot recommend a change in the level of X factor. ggcial pay seales^&apos;   We have already referred to the position of Service doctors and^entists who form the largest group within the Services that is effec-tively a profession within a profession, whose members carry out broadly the same duties in a military context and community (including dependents)48 different categories of National Health Service doctors and dentistsPerform in the community generally.    Their primary function within the armed forces is to carry out the medical (or dental) duties for whichthey have been trained and, in assessing their military salary, accountkas to be taken both of career rewards in the National Health Serviceof an appropriate career pattern within the general rank structurer combatant officers.    At present, special scales exist also forveterinary officers, for chaplains, for legal officers, and for youngetltrants to the Services (including apprentices): in the case of legalOff i^-cers and veterinary officers, the scales incorporate a small leadcombatant rates of pay, and in the case of chaplains they are lowerai^c for rank than combatant salaries.    In the case of young entrants,30
account is taken of what young people at the same point in a career can expect to earn.   Relationships between these scales and the militarysalaries of officers and servicemen were last considered in 1975- Weare satisfied that, with one exception, those relationships should beMaintained with the military salary structure and levels that we have indicated are appropriate at 1 April 1978.    In the case of legal officersin the army and in the RAF, we are examining the basis of the presentlead over combatant salaries, but we have not yet been provided with allthe evidence necessary either to confirm the present arrangements or toJustify changes in them.    Until the Ministry of Defence have completed their examination of the work and organisation of the legal branches ofthe two Services concerned, and until we have been able to consider theirinclusions, we consider it appropriate for the present lead over com-combatant military salaries to be maintained in cash terms.&amp;   Our review of all forms of additional pay has continued and, althoughw* have not yet reached final conclusions on all aspects of the futurestructure or on the levels of every item, we have made progress, particularly0* the major items that constitute a significant proportion of the totalearnings of those who qualify for them.   We are generally convinced aboutth* justification for flying pay, submarine pay, and parachute (and**achute jumping instructors&apos;) pay, as we were of the justification fordiving pay (including dip money) and hydrographic pay when we reviewedth*n.   Our view that the value of the major forms of additional pay inNation to the military salary ought to be broadly preserved (paragraph 23)i5 intended to apply to each of these items of additional pay at the presenttiD*.   They have not been increased since 1975, and we conclude that they^Uld, in principle, be brought up to levels at 1 April 1978 that restore the relationships with the military salary that existed on 1 April 1975-In broad terms, this involves increasing the rates by some 50 per cent.We also accept in principle the case which the Ministry of Defence has madefo* an increase in Northern Ireland pay from 50p a day (the rate at whichlt was introduced in April ^97*0 to  1 a day, although the increase is moreth*n would be required simply to c intain its value in real terms. We31
shall make further recommendations in future reports on all the formsof additional pay that we currently have under review, as our examina-tion of each item is completed.   Allowances in the nature of pay, suchas education allowance and separation allowance, also fall within ourfield of review.   Arrangements now exist for the regular adjustment ofthe level of education allowance in relation to costs and these appearto be working satisfactorily.    Separation allowance was reviewed in1974 .    It is analogous to additional pay only in the sense that itis subject to income tax: it relates to personal circumstances, notto the requirements of the job as such, and the relationship with themilitary salary that we believe to be right for additional pay is not appropriate.   Nevertheless, we believe that, in principle, the value of separation allowance should be broadly maintained, and we shall considerit further in a future review.Charges god charges^*   The basis of the food charge continues to be the formula, based onthe retail value of the daily ration, which was used prior to the intro-duction of the military salary in April 1970 to calculate the amount ofNation allowance paid to servicemen who were not on the ration strength0f their unit and did not therefore receive free food.    It does not cover the cost of preparing, cooking and serving the meals, but itCQvers the cost of raw materials and makes some contribution to overheads,^he gross sum calculated by this formula is abated by 10 per cent to take account of absences of less than 48 hours, and the net sum is paid on aCo*itinuous (daily) basis by single servicemen and servicewomen who are011 the ration strength of their units, whether or not they eat the meals,e*cept that it is not levied when they live out, are on leave for 48 hours0r more, or are serving at sea or in the field for two nights or more.It is this last arrangement which was recently invoked by the Secretary0^ State for Defence in extending field conditions, which already appliedReview Body on Armed Forces Pay, Second Supplement to Third Report 1974,Cmnd. 5853, January 1975-32
to all those on emergency tours in Northern Ireland, to officers andservicemen serving in the Northern Ireland garrison.    The Ministry ofDefence have examined alternative methods of payment, but have founathem to be administratively impracticable and we see no alternative tothe continuation of the present system.45.   The gross sum calculated as the appropriate charge with effect from 1 April 1978 is  1.2*4 a day.    After the 10 per cent abatement,this becomes  1.12 a day ( 7.84 a week) - an increase of 19p a day( 1.33 a week) over the current charge of 93p a day ( 6.51 a week).In percentage terms, this is an increase of 20.4 per cent (fractionallysmaller than last year).   As far as we are able to judge, the subsidyelement in the cost of food provided is in line with the subsidiesprovided by many outside employers who supply meals to their employees.In our view, the charge is reasonable and the food that it purchasesis very good value for money.Accommodation charges^6.   The present basis for the calculation of the accommodation charge was recommended by the National Board for Prices and Incomes as part ofthe military salary system, and was intended to match the expenses of servicemen to the corresponding expenses of people in civil life, whosePay, in general, provided the basis of comparison for the militarysalary, in order to provide an assurance to servicemen that theirstandard of living in the armed forces would be broadly equivalent tothe standard that they could reasonably have expected to achieve if theyhad been employed outside.    Implementation of the new levels of chargeswas staged, and those recommended in 1973 and 1974 were moderated fromthe level justified by strict application of the NBPI formula - in 1973,hy treating the rent increase provisions of the Housing Finance Act 1972as if they applied to Service houses and, in 1974, by reflecting a stand-still in local authority rent increases.    Pay and, for the first time,charges were brought up-to-date in 1975-   Since then, the effect of theGovernment&apos;s restraint measures has been to prevent pay from being brought up-to-date and increases in charges from being moderated.33
^7.   We have long had doubts about the NBPI formula1, and the Ministryof Defence have examined the problem almost continuously since weundertook our first review, but have not found a practicable alternative.However, we now have evidence of our own which indicates that thebenefits provided to the serviceman in return for the rental element inthe charges do not match the facilities provided by an increasing numberQf local authorities for their tenants, on whose average rents therental element in the charge is based.   This clearly undermines the objective of ensuring that the serviceman has an equivalent standard ofiiving to his comparators.   We have referred before to differences insecurity of tenure and to the need for servicemen to find their ownaccommodation when they leave the Services relatively late in life. Weh*ve been told of the difficulties that some experience at this point inobtaining rented accommodation or, because of the nature of their careerin the Services, of qualifying to be put on a local authority&apos;s waitingiist.   Meanwhile, rising house prices makes house purchase less easy,Particularly if an extended mortgage is needed.   But there are other dif-ffences which are to the advantage of local authority tenants: some ofthem have an opportunity to buy their homes and, in general, they haveIonger, more secure and more stable tenancies which enable them to take^vantage of their greater freedom to improve the properties.   In contrast,the frequent moves inherent in Service life would make it difficult for^ost servicemen to enjoy the full benefit of similar improvements. Moreover,*any local authority tenants have greater freedom and greater security inother ways: they are able to take in lodgers; several members of the family*ay contribute to the total income of the household, which must rarelybe Possible for a Service family, partly because it is a relatively,voung&apos; career and partly because of the amount of turbulence; and muchheater security is provided for dependents should the householder die -the family will not be dispossessed in these circumstances.   These areSamples only, and we do not suggest either that the list is exhaustive0r that all local authority tenants enjoy these advantages: indeed, we^e^that a Bill to provide a &quot;council tenants&apos; charter&quot;   has been_^1   Report of the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay 1972, Cmnd. 4954, paragraph?9; Second Report 1973, Cmnd. 5336, paragraph 15; Fourth Report 1975,Cmnd. 6063, paragraph 86.Hansard Volume 945 No 70, Wednesday 1 March 1978, Columns 462-4.34
introduced in Parliament with the aim, inter alia, of improving theirstatus, providing for their security of tenure, removing certainrestrictions and granting freedom in the alteration and decoration ofthe interior and exterior of their dwellings.   The fact that the cashamount of rent paid by servicemen approximates to the average paid bylocal authority tenants one year earlier is an advantage in aninflationary situation which to some extent weighs against our doubt about the calculation of the rent element in the charge, but it doesnot remove it.   The point is that to an increasing extent local authoritytenants and Service tenants do not receive the same return for theirrent, except in the narrow sense of four walls and a roof and the landlords fixtures.   We have observed on our visits to Service units,the serviceman&apos;s lack of choice in essential equipment.    This has been particularly noticeable in the forms of heating supplied: we have seenSamples of expensive and inefficient heating in inadequately insulatedbarters which many servicemen cannot afford to use but, because oftheir relatively short tenancies - in many cases averaging little morethan twelve months - cannot afford to change as they might if longtenancies were normal and they were allowed to do so.    We understandthat a programme of improvements to the thermal insulation of Servicehonses has been announced but, even if this results in a substantial improvement, the serviceman&apos;s lack of choice and scope for do-it-yourselfimprovement in this respect as in others may have further implicationsfQr accommodation charges.Against this background, the Ministry of Defence put proposals toUb for a reduction in the rental element of married quarter charges by&quot;at least 15 per cent&quot; to take account of factors which they summarised^ &quot;social justice&quot;.   We do not discuss these proposals in detail heresince they have told us in later evidence that they do not in any casewant them to be implemented with effect from 1 April 1978 because, underthe Present interpretation of the Government guidelines, the cost of doing so would have to be found out of the total sum of money availablefor a pay increase.   We would not want to imply that, but for thisEjection at the present juncture, we would accept the whole of the case and Proposed solution put forward by the Ministry of Defence, and indeedWe want to consider whether it is possible to establish an objective*ethod of assessing the differences in benefits derived from Service
and local authority tenancies and the consequences for the rentalelement in the charge, and whether a more radical revision of the bar,in of the charge is required.**9.   However, any comparison of the conditions of Service tenants andof local authority tenants that aims to reflect differences in tenancyin the rents charged still requires equivalent rents to be calculatedQn a standard basis in order to provide a stable starting point. Underthe present system, charges for all types of Service accommodation arederived from the charges assessed for servicemen&apos;s married quarters.These charges have four elements: unfurnished rent, rates, furniturebire and additional maintenance.   Rent is based on local authority rentslighted according to the ages, types and locations of Service quarters:for officers&apos; quarters up to Type III, rents are calculated proportionatelyto the rents for servicemen&apos;s quarters according to floor area. Therates element is the average payment on account of rates and water ratefor each type of quarter paid to the local authorities by the Ministryof Defence.    The furniture hire charge is the annual sum that would berequired to repay the cost of furnishing and equipping each type ofbarter (on the assumption that the contents are, on average, ten years0ld) on an annuity basis over a twenty year period; the additional main-tenance charge covers maintenance work not normally undertaken by localauthorities and is based on actual costs for each type of quarter. We^ve worked out the comprehensive charges on the present method of cal-speculation, before taking into account in our recommendations our doubts about the continued use of average rents in isolation as the standardfor the rental element in charges.^   On the basis of the present method and from the most recent evidence available, the charges for standard married quarters from 1 April 1978Vould be as shown in Table 4.   The charges for standard single quartersderived from them are set out in Table 5-   Our recommendations (paragraph 66)^ake fun account of our doubts.

51-   The charges for sub-standard quarters (married and single) on aparallel basis would be derived from the charges for standard quartersby the same method as hitherto.52. Before we consider our conclusions on pay and charges in the con-text of the current guidelines (Chapter 4), we take stock of the manningPosition in the Services, to which we have referred (paragraphs 6-7),as it is an important indicator of the adequacy and competitiveness of pay to recruit and to retain the men and women of the quality and skillsrequired.    The recent Defence White Paper   and the Ministry of Defence&apos;s most recent figures on recruitment indicate that, in general, recruitment^-tself is reasonably satisfactory, although there are difficult areas -ln particular, officers in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, with markedshortfalls of engineers; and in the Royal Air Force, where the shortageof engineer recruits is accompanied by sometimes substantial shortfallsof officers required for General Duties - aircrew, aircraft controllersand fighter controllers.    In the army, too few officers are beingrecruited to maintain the officer strength at the level required. Like-Wlse, the recruitment of servicemen is said to be satisfactory in termsQf total numbers, but difficulty is being experienced in relation toPotential Royal Navy artificers, to the Royal Marines and in severalsupporting trades in the RAF.53. The most significant feature of the manning situation in all three services is, however, the present and prospective level of wastage of highly trained officers and men and, in particular, those with the greatestskills and experience.    In many key areas, the rate of applications forPremature voluntary release has risen dramatically in the last year and,although the rates are not as high in absolute terms as in some recentYears, superimposed as they are on the planned reductions in manpowerfollowing the Defence Review, they will inevitably add to the &quot;overstretch&quot;to which we have referred.    There is no shadow of doubt that, even in atime of high unemployment, the quality of technical skills that the armed ^rces produce in some essential areas is very readily marketable in1Statement on the Defence Estimates 1978, Cmnd. 7099-38
civil life, and the Services can ill afford to lose the men Who havethem.   The loss of trained and highly skilled officers and servicemenis a serious matter: it adds to the future recruiting targets simply to maintain the same relative manning position that now exists and tothe already very high costs in training replacements.   But even if the numerical targets increased in this way could be met, the restorationof the proper balance of fully trained strength and experience can only he achieved over a long period - in the case of the most highly skilledtrades and professions, of several years - during which &quot;overstretch&quot;can be expected to continue and, unless corrective action is taken, maywell worsen.   The process is in any case wasteful and enormouslypensive (paragraph 6): it involves the diversion of scarce resources from other areas of defence expenditure which are already severelysqueezed.    It is clearly both wrong and inefficient to have to man theServices in this way, instead of providing conditions of employment(including pay) that are sufficient to attract a higher proportion ofthose whom the Services 1serve for a full career.those whom the Services have trained to a high pitch to continue to senior officers have told us that, in their view, increasing dis-6atisfaction among officers and servicemen with their pay and conditions0   service has made these the dominant factor affecting decisions toleave the armed forces prematurely, and that many officers and servicemenare waiting to see the outcome of this pay review before making aVision.    They see this review as crucial to the position of the armedforceneed for action now.s in the immediate future and have impressed upon us the urgency ofthe--e^Government1s current guidelines on pay increases the Government&apos;s guidelines for pay increases in the twelve months from i August 1977 aim to contain inflation by keeping the overall rate^-ncrease in earnings in the community in general within 10 per cent:^ney also provide for the introduction of self-financing productivityarrangements in addition which allow earnings to increase by more than 10 perCent but do not affect unit costs.    They continue to require the costofnon-wage benefits to be offset against the cost of pay increases and39
the cost of operating incremental scales to be self-balancing. Thetwo important developments that provide a measure of flexibility arethe absence of any limit on pay increases for individuals within the overall 10 per cent increase in earnings guideline, and the provisionfor the introduction of self-financing productivity schemes outsidethe overall 10 per cent increase in earnings guideline and outside therequirements of the &apos;12 months rule&apos;.   While we welcome the additionalflexibility afforded by the absence of an individual limit, we cannotb^t be dismayed by the absence of further flexibility in a form thatis directly relevant to tho armed forces pay system.    We focused1attention on the need for this in our Sixth Report .56-   The fact of the matter is that productivity schemes, whether self-financing or not, have no place in the armed forces pay structure atPresent, and both the main functions of the Services and the circum-stances in which they carry them out make it highly unlikely that sucha scheme could be devised for general application.    In principle, it isdifficult to see how such a scheme could be operated fairly against the background of the regular changes of role and location which is aaormal feature of Service life for many servicemen, even if the seeminglyinsuperable problems of measurement could be overcome.    Indeed, theintroduction of a scheme or schemes on these lines, were it possible at^li would require a drastic revision of the present comparison ofService remuneration with outside earnings for comparable jobs.   We are,however, in no doubt that, in almost any other working environment, theEduction in Service manpower consequent on the Defence Review and theWorking flexibility inherent in the Services&apos; capacity to take on civilAgency tasks in addition to their military role would provide theb*sis for a productivity agreement that would have to be paid fordirectly in increased earnings.5?-   We have already drawn attention to the earnings drift of 3 percentagePoints or so that occurred in the first twelve months of the current8eries of restraint measures - from August 1975 to August 1976 (paragraphk): during the 12 months from August 1976, the increase in earnings, as1cmnd. 6801, paragraph 23.40
measured by the movement in the index of average earnings on the same basis, was 8 per cent&quot;1 compared with the Government&apos;s estimate thatthe effect of the restraint measures would be to increase earnings by4 Per cent.   The great majority of settlements both for these twoPeriods and for the period from 1 August 1977 have been within therespective guidelines.   Nevertheless, compared with the 10 per centoverall guideline for the current round, the Bank of England Quarterly^Uetin3 of March 1978 states that &quot;allowing for the changing com-Position of the labour force, productivity schemes, job mobility andother -wage drift&apos;, earnings seem likely to rise by 13 per cent or^ore during the current wage round&quot;: the increase in the &quot;new series&quot;index of average earnings (which is not yet seasonally adjusted) from august 1977 to January 1978 is 4.8 per cent, or 12 per cent at an^ual rate4.    Other estimates5 of the increase in average earningsduring the current round are pitched at or around 15 per cent.5^implications of these considerations for our recommendations58-   We have set out the structure and levels of military salary and ofaduitional pay which we are satisfied are fully justified with effect from l April 1978 on the basis of what is currently paid outside forJobs of comparable skills and responsibilities, and taking into accountthose features of a career in the Services that are reflected in thefactor.   We have also set out the levels of charges for food andThe &quot;new series&quot; index of average earnings, which has a wider coverage,rose by 7.3 per cent.The White Paper, The Attack on Inflation The Second Year, Cmnd. 6507-Volume 18 No 1, March 1978.The &quot;older series&quot; index of average earnings, on a seasonally adjustedbasis, shows a larger increase - 6 per cent over the period or 15 per cent at an annual rate (these are less than the increase in the unadjustedindex).   In both series, because of delays in reaching settlements, theannual rate of increase implied by the actual increase from August 1977to January 1978 may be less than the increase over the full year.National Institute of Economic and Social Research - National InstituteEconomic Review, Number 83, February 1978; The London Business SchoolCentre for Economic Forecasting - Economic Outlook 1977-1981, Volume 2,Number 5, February 1978; Phillips and Drew - Economic Forecasts,March 1978.41
accommodation that would be justified from the same date by the standards that have been regarded as appropriate since 1970: we have again indicated our reservations about the basis of the charges for accommodation.   The introduction of these levels of military salaryand of additional pay with effect from 1 April 1978 would restorePay in the armed forces to a proper relationship with current outsideearnings on the basis that we have described.   To the extent that pay and conditions of service can undoubtedly exert an influence on manninglevels, the introduction of these rates of pay now could be expected tohalt the present disturbing trend in wastage of trained&apos;and experiencedmen.   We do not, however, suggest that wastage is always a reliableindicator of the adequacy or inadequacy of rates of pay: there can be other reasons for it and its validity as a test must, for example, beaffected by outside demand for particular skills.    Nor do we want toinfer, in principle, that where there is little or no wastage, ratesof Pay are necessarily &quot;right&quot;, or that where there is a high degreeof wastage they are necessarily &quot;wrong&quot;.    But we are in no doubt ataH that the present deterioration in the Services&apos; manning position insome areas, and the recent substantial increase in the rates of application for premature voluntary release by fully trained officersand men, are in part at least attributable to the progressive det-erioration in their pay and conditions relative to their oppositenumbers in civil life.    Nevertheless, in putting forward our recora-mendations, we have to consider the implications of the current guide-mines, after taking full account of all the circumstances and demandsQf Service life which cannot be recognised by forms of payment thatWoiUd be normal outside.    The armed forces are entitled to be treatedno less favourably than the rest of the community but, in practice,they have been given less favourable treatment than their outside com-Parators in the last two years.    In these circumstances, application ofthe letter of the current guidelines without regard to the additionalprovisions that are permissible can only intensify the disparity andsense of frustration and resentment that it generates in the Services.theThe extent of the &quot;overstretch&quot;, the extent to which the armed forcesused to take on additional responsibility in an emergency, and thek2
extent to which many servicemen are called on to work very long hourswithout additional financial reward, combine to make an overwhelmingcase to reflect a substantial part of the earnings from self-financingProductivity arrangements elsewhere which have been and are being introduced within the provisions of the guidelines as a whole, and to^ so now.   The cumulative effect of earnings drift in outside employmentduring the past two rounds of restraint measures, which is not yetreflected in earnings in the Services, and the prospect of still furtherdrift by the end of the current round combine to provide a formidableargument for ensuring that military salaries do not fall relativelyf*other behind earnings for comparable jobs, even if implementation off*Uy up-to-date rates has to be staged.   We discuss the implications ofPaging in Chapter 4 but it is important to emphasise that, in the caseof Pay increases that are lower than those implied by the fully up-to-date^ structure outlined in Tables 1, 2 and 3, a flat percentage increaset0 every salary would not be appropriate.   We would want to apply the sumliable in a way that as far as possible reflects the up-to-datestructure, while providing the safeguard of minimum increases for individuals: only in this way can a start be made on the correction ofDalies that have arisen in recent years and on progress towards theaPPr0priate structure.43
CHAPTER kOUR RECOMMENDATIONSPajr60. In indicating the detailed structure and levels of pay appropriateat 1 April 1978, we are carrying out an intention that was made known tothe Prime Minister in July 1977.   Our recommendation cannot be otherthan that these levels should be brought into effect at the earliestpossible date.   The Prime Minister has drawn our attention to theGovernment!s expectation that increases which exceeded the guidelineswould need to be staged.   The increases implied by the introductionQf the fully up-to-date structure at 1 April 1978 clearly exceed thecurrent guidelines and, in these circumstances, bearing in mind theprime Minister&apos;s caveat, we have considered the implications of staging.61. The provision in the Government&apos;s guidelines for self-financingProductivity arrangements, and experience of past earnings drift, point to the likelihood - indeed the inevitability - of an overall increasein national earnings of more than 10 per cent during the year&apos;s cur-rency of the pay increase for the armed forces that is implementedwith effect from 1 April 1978.   This conclusion is shared by theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research, by the London BusinessSchool Centre for Economic Forecasting and by Phillips and Drew.   In thesecircumstances, the introduction on 1 April 1978 of military salaries scaleddown from the appropriate level to comply strictly with a 10 per centguideline would undoubtedly result in a further decline in Service payrelative to outside earnings in jobs of equivalent weight during the subsequent twelve months.    If the implementation of the fully up-to-daterates of pay is to be staged, we strongly urge that the first stageshould take into account the importance of preventing further relativedeterioration in a continually moving situation.   We do so against theWkground of the existing high level of shortfall which, after an increasestrictly within the guidelines, would still require an increase of some20 per cent overall to extinguish it.   We have also taken account of the
Present trend of wastage of skilled and experienced officers andservicemen, the high cost of training their replacements and the cumulative effect of manpower shortages on the efforts required fromthe Services as a whole, all of which have implications for morale, forthe defence capability of the country and for its ability to meet its international obligations.   There are clear indications that, not leastbecause of manpower shortages, conditions of work for some servicemenhave already worsened.   The fact that servicemen cannot leave the services at short notice in normal circumstances may well mask a potentially more serious trend in the months ahead.   This is a gloomy picture, but we seeways in which it is possible to retrieve the position.   First, a clear and firm Government commitment to bring Services&apos; pay fully up-to-datewithin the timescale that we indicate is essential.    Second, action shouldbe taken now to recognise the Services&apos; own productivity in the form of increased workloads stemming from planned and unplanned reductions in manpower; the introduction of new technology; and the working flexibilityof the Services, for example, in carrying out a variety of duties in civilemergencies in addition to their primary military tasks.    This would, ofCQnrse, be unnecessary if, on 1 April 1978, they were to be paid the salaries that we are satisfied do no more than reflect what their counter-Parts outside have already had.   Failing this, measures to prevent afurther relative worsening of the position on the lines that we suggestbelow would in our view be justified.    Implementation of fully up-to-datesalaries in due course would automatically reflect productivity paymentsQUtside and would restore the normal basis for deciding armed forces&apos; pay which has been accepted in principle by successive Governments.62-   In our view, it is essential and equitable to ensure that servicemenare no less favourably treated in the current cycle of pay restraintMeasures than other members of the community.   At the very least, thisSquires an assurance that their pay will not fall further behind during theCor*ing twelve months.    We know that this view is shared by senior officers who provide the management of the armed forces, we believe that it will be8hared by the community at large and we urge the Government to adopt it.Thismeans, in the first place, providing with effect from 1 April 1978^ increase in Service pay which will give no less than the latestailable estimate of the increase in average earnings in percentage terms45
that has arisen from settlements under the current guidelines since1 August 1977, expressed as an annual rate.   This would be the first stage in the implementation of the pay structure in paragraphs 30 and 38,appropriately brought up-to-date.63.   We now turn to the question of the timescale within which we believethat the revised structure should be fully implemented in an up-to-dateform.   We are, of course, aware of the undertakings which have been givenin connection with the future implementation of a settlement for firemenemployed by local authorities; and of an undertaking to implement the outcome of a special review of the pay of policemen.   We cannot conceivethat the Government would be prepared to do less for the armed forces - for whom the object is to do no more than restore pay to levels established on abasis that has long been accepted as equitable to the serviceman and fair to the taxpayer.   We consider that the balance required to bring payfully up-to-date ought to be paid as soon as possible and, in any event,not later than 1 April 198O.    Implementation of pay levels that are justified now at a date so far ahead of course implies the need tohring the levels fully up-to-date again on each occasion when a stage isimplemented.    It would in our view also be essential to make substantial^ogress towards fully up-to-date scales at the then current levels in 1979and, if there were still an outstanding balance, to bring pay fully up-to-date at the then current levels in 198O-^-   We have considered the Ministry of Defence&apos;s proposal (Chapter 2) that,in circumstances in which an increase in Service pay is restricted byQovernment restraint measures, any increase within the guidelines should beapplied wholly to the military salary.   However, the major forms of additionalPay - flying pay, submarine pay, parachute pay and parachute jumpinginstructors&apos; pay, diving pay and hydrographic pay - are drawn continuously^d are a substantial element of the annual and career earnings of thosewho qualify for them, and they are part of the remuneration for the jobsCoHcerned. We take the view that there is no equitable alternative to the^cognition of those items as an integral part of the earnings of those&amp;1 igible to receive them, and that increases in pay should relate to the
sum of the military salary and these major forms of additional pay. TheMinistry of Defence have also said that they would not want the total sumavailable within the guidelines to increase the military salary to bereduced in order to increase Northern Ireland pay (paragraph 2l\) by theamount that they have proposed and that we have accepted in principle.Indeed, they would prefer Northern Ireland pay to remain unchanged, in common with all forms of additional pay.   We understand their approach:an increase in the rate of Northern Ireland pay to  1 a day would reducethe total sum available within the guidelines by some  3 million,equivalent to a 17.5 per cent increase in the whole of additional pay,and would reduce the rates of military salary for everyone - includingof course, those serving in Northern Ireland.   We consider, however, thatthe case for some increase in Northern Ireland pay and in the five majorforms of additional pay that we have identified is so strong that wecannot recommend that they should be left unchanged.   We recommend thatthey should be increased in the same proportion as the military salaryis increased with effect from 1 April 1978, and that they should be bought to fully up-to-date levels in exactly the same was as the militarysalary is brought up-to-date.    We recognise that the cash increase inNorthern Ireland pay on this basis will inevitably be regarded by some as very small, but we consider it essential to start the process of bringingU to a more appropriate level now, rather than wait until it is possibleto do so in one step.^cial scales of2EL65    ,.&quot;   We have explained our general approach to the treatment of special8cales of pay (paragraph k3) and their relationship to the normal scales^ rates of military salary.    We consider that the same approach should befollowed in the event of the introduction, with effect from 1 April 1978,ofa scaled down military salary structure based on the structure that weegard as appropriate on that date.   This means that the scales for legalfficers should incorporate the current cash lead and that all other specialary scales should maintain the same proportionate relationship as now to6 up-to-date military salary.   The form of flying pay paid to specialist^rcrew is not the standard form of flying pay: it is designed to fulfil the0le of a special scale of pay, and should therefore be adjusted to achieve the Rsame effect in a scaled down structure as it has in the up-to-date47
structure.   We recommend that the pay of university cadets, which ismtended to provide an incentive to take up a university cadetship, shouldDe increased by the same average percentage as the military salary with effect from 1 April 1978.ChareesA commodation charges66.   We have discussed (Chapter 2) the disturbance of the balance betweenPay and accommodation charges, in particular because of the extent of the shortfall in pay.    It is no longer possible to justify a recommendationQf levels of charges determined on the existing standard basis (Chapter 3),which assumes that what is happening to armed forces tenants reflects whatls happening to the community generally, as we now have evidence thatthis is not so.   A lasting solution cannot be found in circumstances in whichrestraint measures impinge on every course of action open.   We therefore recommend that, on this occasion, if the increases in pay involved in thelDlPlementation of the fully up-to-date salary structure are to be staged,then the increases in accommodation charges for married and single members0f the armed forces that would follow the implementation of the up-to-datelevels (Chapter 3) should be staged in exactly the same way.   As we haveSai-d (paragraphs 47-48), we intend to examine further how ft*r rents foriQcal authority houses continue to provide an appropriate standard by which^0 Judge the rental element within the charges, in the light of developments0utside.   The doubt on this account adds weight to the already strong caser Phasing the increase in charges justified on the existing basis.F-22PLcharee6? u&apos; We recommend the introduction of a charge of  1.12 a day ( 7.84 a week)Wlth effect from 1 April 1978.48
Cost;The estimated additional cost of the fully up-to-date structure andlevels of pay for the three Services and the women&apos;s services based onthe outline for men in the army (Tables 1, 2 and 3) in a full year is:Military salary (all Services)  millionOfficersOfficers promoted from the ranksServicemen and servicewomenYoung entrants and apprenticesAdditional pay (all Services)Northern Ireland pay (all Services)Total cost of increases in payCharges (all Services)Increased yields: FoodAccommodation  million6.33.26.66.k59.86.3299-27.3372.79.5382.213.0Net cost of fully up-to-date structure of pay and charges369.2^ the basis of the evidence: see paragraph ^9,49
The total additional cost of the increases in pay represents an average increase over the current paybill of 32 per cent. The coot of a scaleddown increase within a staged implementation would be proportionatelylower, and would depend in 1978-79 on the sizo of the staSe introduced0n 1 April 1978 and, after that, on our further consideration of therental element in accommodation charges as well.Conclusion09.   We have indicated the structure and levels of pay that, on the basisof the evidence of earnings in civil life, we are satisfied ought to beintroduced on 1 April 1978 if the position is to be fully restored. Anillustrative pay structure (Appendix 2) shows revised salaries within an overall cost of 10 per cent.   Within this constraint, the structure shownis the one that we would regard as the most suitable.   But it will be seenthat these salaries fall very substantially below those that we consider to be appropriate at 1 April 1978 (Tables 1-3), and we are of the opinionthat this structure would not be equitable in the circumstances described in our report; it would, moreover, leave even larger amounts to bestaged over a period of not more than two years when earnings in thecommunity generally would be continuing to rise.   We have concluded that the minimum increase required must at least be capable of preventingfurther relative deterioration, and that this could well be done withinthe Government&apos;s policy if some account were taken of what, in anotherworking environment, would be regarded as productivity that could bePaid for outside the overall &quot;10 per cent guideline&quot;.   For these reasons,We propose the provision with effect   from 1 April 1978 of an overallincrease in Service pay to give no less than the latest available estimateof the increase in average earnings in percentage terms that has arisenfrom settlements under the current guidelines since 1 August 1977e*Pressed as an annual rate (paragraph 62).   We recommend accordingly,are ready to advise on appropriate scales and rates (and their costs)50
if this course is adopted.    We also recommend that the Government shouldRive a firm commitment that fully up-to-date rates *of pay will be implemented by 1 April 1980 at the latest.7  \&apos;OFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICS31 March 197851
