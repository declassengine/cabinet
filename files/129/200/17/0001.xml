DQCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTI CP(78* 42 COPY NO 80&apos;10 April 1978CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND REPRESENTATION ATWESTMINSTERNote by the Secretary of State for Northern ireland,        At its meeting on 8 March the Ministerial Committee on NorthernIreland (IN) agreed that the Government should accept the recommendation in the Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference (Cmnd 7110) that NorthernIreland&apos;s representation at Westminster jhould be increased from 12 to 17seats.    This would give Northern Ireland one seat more than strict paritywith Great Britain;   but it would not elevate Northern Ireland to the generouslevels of representation of Scotland or Wales.    Although the necessaryreorganisation of Northern Ireland constituencies will probably produce livecapable of returning non-Unionist members, the Social Democratic andLabour Party (SDLP) will not be pleased;    they will see any increase as a move towards integration.    But the figuie oi 17 seats should be acceptable to tne British political parties and also to most people in I,orthern Ireland.2* IN also considered timing both of an announcement of acceptance offce recommendation and also of the legislation to give effect to it va short,Probably one clause, Bill to amend the Hou^e of Commons (Redistribution of seats) Act 1949),    As to the announcement, the general view was that it shouldb* made as soon as possible to dispel uncertainty:  there has already beensorie Press speculation.3-        As to the timing of the legislation, IN considered the case fcrimplementing the Conference^ recommendations as quickly as possible.A*y political harm caused by setting up the Conference was now in the pasta*d delay now might cause trouble with the Ulster Unionists, who could accuse^e Government of bad faith if it appeared to be ignoring the Conference^re commendation a4&apos;        But the Committee also saw strong objections to legislation this^mmer.    It would be a fourth Constitutional Bill;  and it would thereforeSquire Committee time on the floor of the House when the Government&apos;sAegislative programme was already heavily over-burdened.    Gerry Fittmight be able to gather some support to embarrass us and cause unnecessarycontroversy about Northern Ireland this summer which should be avoided.*** decided that the balance of advantage lay in deferring legislation until next session.    The announcement of acceptance should be accompanied by a1
promise of legislation next Session and by an explanation that the reason fordelay was lack of Parliamentary time.     The Governments commitment tothe Conference&apos;s recommendation should be emphasised privately both toJim Molyneaux and Enoch Powell and to Gerry Fitt.5- I ask my colleagues to confirm the conclusions of IN, by agreeing:-i.       that the Government should announce at an early dateacceptance of the Conference&apos;s recommendation, and ii.       that this announcement should explain that because ofpresMtre of Parliamentary time legislation will not beintroduced this Session and go on to give a firm commitment that a B:.ll to give * fact to the Conference recommendationwill be introduced in the next Session of Parliament.A draft of an Arranged Question and Answer which I would propose to use for this purpose is attached.R MNorthern Ireland Office10 April 19782
