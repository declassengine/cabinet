IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTdocumentCP(78)38 COPY NO28 March 1978CABINETPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF MEMBERS OF PUBLIC BOARDSNote by the Prime minister in my minute of 21 December 1977 I invited comments on draft^vised rules to govern the political activities of members of public boards.Annex 1 are draft rules further revised to take account of some of thepylllrilen*8 Q* colleagues.    Rule 9 has been amended and a new Rule 10 covers^ spective Parliamentary candidature.    However, the draft avoids changesch would, in my view, move substantially away from the statement of intentn Paragraphs 1 and 2.    The existing rales were agreed by Cabinet in 1948 andre Bet out in Annex 2.t*        The broad framework of the new rules as they now emerge io asa* Full-time and part-time Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen, andfall-time ordinary members, of all public boards are expected to abstain from controversial national political activities, and to exercisediscretion in respect of other political activities, especially anyrelating to the board of which thev are members.^nuj-enon in respect oi otner political activities,relating to the board of which they are members.D* Part-time or unpaid ordinary members of all public boardsmU8t exercise discretion in respect of political activities, especiallyany relating to the board of which they are members.c* Full-time and part-time Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen, andfall-time ordinary members of major boards (specified), may notconcurrently hold prominent political offices at either national or(except for certain named boards) local level.^* Part-time or unpaid ordinary members of major boards maynot concurrently hold prominent political office at the national level.1
The broad framework of the draft revised rules I circulated was generally supported.    The outstanding questions are:i. Whether the requirement in Rule 3 for all full-time publicboard members (and part-time Chairmen and Vice-chairmen) to abstain from controversial national political activity is too restrictive.This restriction derives from the existing rule &apos;b&apos;: &quot;Whole-time members should abstain from controversial political activity&quot;. Thedraft new rules relax this restriction by confining it to national issuesonly,ii. Whether all part-time Vice-Chairmen may be treated lessre strict! vely.Vice-Chairmen are treated by the draft new rules in the same way asChairmen in all respects because of their liability to assume theChairmanship at any time.iii. Whether the restrictions in Rules 8 and 9 on the concurrentholding of prominent political office by members of major boards maybe relaxed     In particular should Rule 8 debar part-time Chairmen and vice-Chairmen only from membership of the national committee of apolitical party or paid political office involving executive duties in thenational organisation of a political party or (as presently drafted) alsodebar leadership of a political group on a major local authority?These restrictions derive from the existing rale &apos;a&apos;:   &quot;Members ofthe boards, whether whole-time or part-time, should not serve asofficers carrying cut executive duties in any political party&quot;. Theexisting emphasis on &quot;executive duties&quot; has been changed in the draftrules to political prominence, in order to reflect more accuratelythe way in which the existing rule &apos;a&apos; has come to be applied inpractice over the years.    The existing rule has also been relaxedin that the equivalent draft rules apply only to major boards, and lessrestrictively to part-time members of such boards.4.I invite the Cabinet to endorse the draft rules at Annex 1.LJC10D0*ning Street28 ^rch 19782
ANNEX 1POLITICAL ACTIVITIESRules for the guidance of members of public boards.Statement of intent1. The purposes of the rules are (a) to avoid conflicts of interest,either between a board member and his own political party, or between a board member and an opposing political party such that hiscontinuation on the board might be unwelcome in the event of a changeof Government; and (b) to avoid possible suggestions of improper useof patronage when making appointments to public boards.    The generalintent of the rules is to allow the continuance of political activities, with due discretion, by members of public boards, pro-vided that national political interests are not high-lighted by con-current tenure of a prominent political office whose duties arelikely to be publicised.2. The rules fall into 3 sections.    Those rules which should be observed by all members of public boards (paragraphs 3-5); those&quot;hich apply at the point where appointments to certain public boardsare under consideration and to tenure of such appointments(paragraphs 7-9); and the special provisions relating to Peers(paragraph 10).Conduct of members of public boards. The Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of public boards, whether whole-or part-time, and all paid whole-time ordinary members, shouldabstain from controversial political activity on national issues.(Unpaid service to a paid office will count as a paid appointmentfor the purposes of these rules.)Subject to paragraph 9, part-time ordinary members and unpaidordinary members are free to engage in political activities, pro-vided that they are conscious of their general public responsibility and exercise a proper discretion, particularly in regard to the work.
of the boards of which they are members.5. Members of public boards should avoid engaging in activities which might be seen to conflict directly with the interests of the boards to which they belong.6. Any member of a public board who is doubtful about the appl1&quot; ^cation of these rules, or about the propriety of any such activityis mentioned in paragraphs 3 to 5 above should seek guidance fromMinister responsible for his board.Appointments to specified public boards7. The duties of certain public boards are such that tenure oj- jof 5prominent political office or role concurrently with membershipa public board might be incompatible with the proper discharge 0^public responsibility.    This is taken into account when consider^appointments to such boards.    The public boards included withincategory are those listed in the White Paper on Public Boards ,(Cmnd 6803, May 1977), and other major boards which may be specifrom time to time having regard to their responsibility for admiing a public service, for the expenditure of significant allocs-&quot;, &amp;of public money, or for the levying of payments to public fundsilist of those currently specified is appended.8. The Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen of the above specified boards*whether whole- or part-time, and all paid whole-time ordinary 111 ^are required on appointment to resign from any political officerole which requires, or is likely to require, regular and contr0versial public advocacy of the views of one political party oT ^wise suggest an unduly prominent or controversial political /Qftion.    These would include membership of the national committeeits equivalent) of a political party, and elected local govern^appointments of an obviously political nature - eg leader of apolitical group on a major local authority.    Such local govern!11611appointments may however continue to be held by the ChairmenfChairmen or members of New Town Development Corporations, Sco^New Town Development Corporations, the Commission for New ^oWll^eSRegional Water Authorities, Health Authorities in England andand Health Boards in Scotland.2.
9. provided the general rules of conduct in paragraphs 4 and 5are observed, part-time ordinary members and unpaid ordinarymembers are permitted to take part in political activities provided they are not such as to suggest an unduly prominent or controversialpolitical affiliation at the national level (eg as Chairman of thenational committee of a political party).Parliamentary Candidature10. It will normally be in order for Board members to remain pros-pective parliamentary candidates until Nomination Day provided suchcandidature is essentially passive and does not conflict withparagraphs 3 and 4.    But the precise legal position will depend ineach case on the circumstances of the particular appointment. ABoard member who intends to seek adoption as a parliamentary candi-date should therefore consult the sponsoring department in advance to establish what his position will be if adopted.Provisions relation to Peers who are members of public boards11-   Members of public boards, whether whole-time or part-time whoare also Members of the House of Lords will no doubt be guided intheir conduct in that House by the statements made by Lord Addison111 the House on 21 March 1951 and, in the case of the british broadcasting Corporation and Independent Broadcasting Authority,lord Home on 3 June 1959.Merpre-hAJH on12. irulesThe foregoing rules are for general application. Specialmay apply additionally to particular public boards.
