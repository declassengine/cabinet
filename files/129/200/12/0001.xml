A DISCUSSION PAPERIntroduction1. The fair and effective administration of justice according to law is a basicfunction of the State and a fundamental guarantee of the citizen&apos;s rights. Over thecenturies the courts have therefore developed powers to prevent and punishconduct which tends to obstruct, prejudice or abuse the administration ofjustice. These powers arc considerable, and they are exercised by the judgeswithout trial by jury. The rules governing their exercise are known as the law ofcontempt of court.2. In 1971 the Government of the day appointed a Committee, under thechairmanship of the late Lord Justice Phillimorc, to consider whether any changes were required in the law relating to contempt of court in England and wales and in Scotland. The Phillimorc committee&apos;s Report was published in Decem-ber 19741. In the meantime, in 1973, the House of Lords had given an importantjudgment on the law of contempt in the case of Attorney-General v. TimesNewspapers Ltd.,2 which concerned the proposed publication by the Sunday times of an article about the thalidomide litigation.3. The Phillimore Committee unanimously concluded that the law of con-tempt is required as a means of maintaining the rights of the citizen to a fair and unimpeded system of justice and of protecting the orderly administrationof the law: but its operation should be confined to circumstances where the achievement of its objectives requires the application of a swift and summaryprocedure; and that in its essentials, especially as it affects the press, the law should be the same in England and Wales and in Scotland so far as proceduraldifferences allow. However, the Committee also concluded that the law as it stands contains uncertainties which impede and restrict reasonable freedom of speech; and that the law should be amended and clarified by statute so as toallow as much freedom of speech as is consistent with the basic purposes forwhich the law of contempt exists. To this end, the Committee made a number of recommendations which arc summarised in the Annex to this paper.4. Many of the Phillimore recommendations are relatively uncontroversialin principle: for example, the recommendations that sentences of imprisonment for contempt should be for fixed terms limited to a maximum of two years, andthat magistrates should be given powers to impose limited penalties for con-tempt in the face of the court. However, the central recommendations concerningliability for contempt by publication raise difficult and important issues ofpublic policy about the proper balance between the freedom of the press andthe right of the citizen to a fair trial. After prolonged and careful study, theGovernment has decided that satisfactory conclusions cannot be reached onthese issues without informed Parliamentary and public discussion. This green paper is intended to provide a basis for such discussion, by outlining the problems and the various possible solutions. The Government will therefore welcomereactions to this paper and comments on the Phillimore recommendationsgenerally, and will take them fully into account in deciding on its policy.1 Cmnd. 5794.1 [1974] A.C.273.
5. Thc main issues arising from thc Phillimorc recommendations concern: (a) thc starting point for strict liability for contempt in both criminal and civil proceedings;(b) certain proposed defences against strict liability;(c) the extent of liability for prejudice intentionally caused; and(d) thc extent to which litigants may be subjected to pressure and influence.6. Two additional factors will, in due course, have to be taken into account.One is the forthcoming decision of the European Court of Human Rights onthc complaint of Times Newspapers Ltd. that the decision of the House ofLords prohibiting the Sunday Times from publishing its thalidomidc article in1973 was a restriction on freedom of expression which put thc United kingdom in breach of its obligations under Article 10 of the European convention on Human Rights. This complaint was upheld by a majority of the european commission of Human Rights in May 1977. Thc Commission subsequentlyreferred the case to thc Court, whose judgment is expected during the courseof this year.7. Thc other factor to be taken into account is thc forthcoming report of thcLaw Commission on Offences relating to thc Administration of Justice. Philli-more recommended that the contempt jurisdiction should be invoked only where(a) the offending act does not fall within the definition of any criminal offence or(/;) urgency or practical necessity require that the matter be dealt with summarily.This presupposes that the law of contempt will continue to be available to deal effectively with cases of urgency or where no criminal offence can be charged.That is the position at present, because of the flexibility of the law of contempt.Phillimore accepted that, because of the &quot;almost infinite variety of circum-stances&quot; in which they may have to be applied, the contempt powers must beflexible. But PhilIimore&apos;s specific recommendations would tend inevitably toreduce their scope, and therefore their flexibility. These recommendationstherefore need to be assessed, not only individually, but in their collectiveeffect, and not only by themselves but in relation to the law of offences againstthc administration of justice, so that no unacceptable gaps in the law arecreated. In England and Wales, this branch of thc law is under considerationby the Law Commission. In March 1975 thc Commission published a WorkingPaper^ which provisionally proposed the abolition of thc common law offences of, or akin to, perverting the course of justice or conspiring to do so, andtheir replacement by a number of more limited and specific offences. ThcCommission^ final report is expected during 1978.8. This paper, like the Phillimore Report itself, is concerned with thc law ofcontempt as it applies to proceedings in courts of law (including not only thchigher courts, but also inferior courts such as magistrates&apos; courts, local valuationcourts4 etc.). The law of contempt as it applies to tribunals of inquiry set up under thc Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was considered some yearsago by an Interdepartmental Committee, under the chairmanship of LordJustice Salmon (as he then was), which reported in June 19695. Thc SalmonCommittee was particularly concerned with section 1(2) of the 1921 Act. this No. 62.* Attorney General v. BBC, Diblc v. BBC, Thc Times. 17 February 1978.1 Cmnd. 4078.
provides that where a person does an act which would, if the tribunal of inquiryhad been a court of law having power to commit for contempt, have beencontempt of that court, the chairman of the tribunal may certify the offence tothe High Court (or, in Scotland, the Court of Session); and the Court, ifsatisfied on inquiry that the offence was committed as certified, may punishthe offender as if he had been guilty of contempt of the court itself. The SalmonCommittee recommended that this provision should be expanded to make itclear that any unjustifiable attack on the integrity of a member of the tribunal,or anything said or done in relation to any evidence relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry which is intended or obviously likely to alter, distort,destroy or withhold such evidence from the tribunal, should be punishable ascontempt. In May 1973 the then Government, in a White paper giving itsviews on the Salmon Report, did not disagree with the substance of the recom-mendations. However, it considered that the existing law already enabled suchconduct to be dealt with as contempt, and noted that future tribunals wouldhave the benefit of the Salmon Report to serve as a guide when considering whether any particular action should be so dealt with. Any amendment ofsection 1(2) of the 1921 Act that attempted specifically to describe the conductwhich constituted contempt would, it was thought, leave a tribunal powerlessto deal with unforeseen circumstances. Accordingly the Salmon Committee&apos;recommendation for amendment of the 1921 Act was not accepted. However,since the contempt powers given to tribunals of inquiry by the 1921 Act are based on those exercised by courts of law, it must be borne in mind that changesin the latter arc liable indirectly to affect the former.9. Finally, in considering the Phillimore recommendation that as far aspossible the law should be the same throughout Great Britain it must be borne in mind that, if the Scotland Bill now before Parliament becomes law, contemptwill be a devolved subject. This will mean that, subject only to the overridingneed to comply with the international obligations of the United Kingdom, itwill be for the Scottish Assembly to decide what the law of contempt should bein Scotland. Until then, the matter remains within the jurisdiction of theGovernment and Parliament of the United Kingdom. This paper thereforedeals with the law both in Scotland and in England and Wales.Starting point for strict liability10. Phillimore recommended that strict liability for contempt (that is,liability even though the contempt was unintentional) should apply only topublications. For this purpose, they defined publications as including any speech,writing, broadcast or other communication, in whatever form, which is addressedto the public at large. They further recommended that a publication should giverise to strict liability only if it &quot;creates a risk that the course of justice will be seriously impeded or prejudiced&quot;. The requirement of serious prejudice embodiesin itself a significant narrowing of the scope of contempt, and a corresponding increase in freedom of publication.11. A publication in a newspaper, or a broadcast on radio or television,although intended only to convey news and comment to the public at large,may at the same time prejudice the fair trial of legal proceedings. Examplesgiven by Phillimore include interviews with witnesses to crimes and accidents&apos;Cmnd. 5313.
who will later have to give evidence; descriptions and photographs of personswho are or may be accused of crimes in cases where identity is an issue; historiesand records of accused persons; and comment on issues arising out of civil proceedings which prejudges the issues in those proceedings. Phillimore drew attention to the real dangers of allowing anything in the nature of &quot;trial bynewspaper&quot;, and particularly to the risk that it might lead to a loss of public confidence in the impartial administration of justice. On the other hand, thepublic has a legitimate interest in legal proceedings and the matters involvedin them, and the media are entitled to the greatest possible freedom, consistent with the due administration of justice, to publish information and commentabout them. In certain circumstances, as when the newspapers print photo-graphs of wanted men, publication can help the purposes of justice. Moreover,as far as possible the media should not be incidentally hindered in activities which in themselves are desirable in the public interest, such as investigationsof suspected malpractices and abuses, and public discussion of issues of generalconcern. However, the power of the media to influence attitudes of mindtowards legal proceedings is so great that in practice the need for some restric-tions on its exercise is not seriously disputed. As Phillimore pointed out, the crucial question is what measure of restraint is required. In all the evidencereceived by Phillimore and others, there was no suggestion that the law was wrong in principle. Anxiety was, however, expressed about the uncertainty ofits scope and application.12. It was against this background that Phillimorc approached the difficult question of fixing the point after which the law should prohibit the media from publishing anything which, whether intentionally or not, risks seriouslyprejudicing the course of justice in legal proceedings. The effect of decided casesmakes it prudent for the media to assume that strict liability for contempt appliesas soon as legal proceedings are &quot;imminent&quot;. There is no fixed point in timewhen proceedings become &quot;imminent&quot;; each case depends upon its own facts.In criminal cases in Scotland, the present position is different: publication may bea contempt at any time after it has been established that a crime has been com-mitted. Phillimore reviewed the arguments for and against restricting the periodof application of the law of contempt. Any fixed starting point is bound to bearbitrary. It has many times been pointed out that statements made beforeproceedings begin can be just as prejudicial as those made thereafter: &quot;it ispossible very effectively to poison the fountain of justice before it begins toflow&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;imminent&quot; rule may not be much more uncertain inpractice than any apparently fixed point which might be selected. Further, themedia already have the protection of section 11 of the Administration of JusticeAct 1960, which provides a defence to a publisher if he can show that he didnot know and had no reason to suppose that proceedings were pending orimminent, as the case may be. (This statutory provision applies only in Englandand Wales, but Phillimore recommended that a similar statutory defence beprovided in Scotland.) But in spite of these arguments against restricting theperiod of application of contempt, Phillimore considered that the concept of&quot;imminence&quot; was unacceptably vague and had &quot;an inhibiting effect on thefreedom of the press which is out of all proportion to any value there may bein preserving it&quot;. Although there were undoubtedly risks of prejudice beforeproceedings begin, it could be argued that they should not be exaggerated. Inpractice a serious and immediate threat to the administration of justice would
only be likely to arise when the trial was due to take place in the near future.Moreover, they noted as relevant that the rules of the House of Commonsrestricting debate on matters which are sub judice apply only where proceedingshave already begun by a charge being laid (and, in civil cases, where they havebeen set down for trial or otherwise brought before the court). Phillimoretherefore concluded that the law should give the media more definite guidancethan at present about when publication will and will not be allowed, and thatfor this purpose an appropriate point should be fixed at or after (but not before)the formal commencement of proceedings.13. Criminal proceedings. In applying these considerations, Phillimoredistinguished between criminal and civil proceedings on the ground that criminal proceedings require more protection from prejudicial publication as beingusually shorter and frequently involving the liberty of the subject. In criminal proceedings in England, the &quot;imminence&quot; rule usually means that in practiceprejudicial comment must be taken to be forbidden when a man is beingquestioned by the police but before he is formally charged. In Scotland, as mentioned above, the present rule is clearer but stricter: comment must be takento be forbidden as soon as a crime is known to have been committed. However,the media should not be prevented from investigating and disclosing mal-practices and abuses which they suspect to be criminal. On one view, Lord Clydein a part of his opinion in Stirling v. Associated Newspapers1 could be read ascasting doubt upon this proposition. Moreover, the Scottish rule means that apublisher might render himself liable to contempt for a publication concerningsome old unsolved crime if proceedings are then unexpectedly instituted follow-ing the discovery of fresh evidence. Having rejected these and other possiblestages, such as the issue of a warrant for arrest and the arrest itself, Phillimorerecommended8 that the starting point for strict liability in England and wales should be the moment when the suspected man is charged or a summonsserved; and in Scotland when the person is first publicly charged on petition orotherwise, or at the first calling in court of a summary complaint, as the case may be. This recommendation is based on the view that there ought to be a lessrestrictive starting point than at present and that the time when the accused is charged is the most readily identifiable such point in practice.14. These are important considerations. But, in giving full weight to them,dangers may be created in other directions. Charges often follow shortly after aserious crime becomes known; and indeed, from the point of view of an accusedperson it may be as important to have protection from prejudicial commentduring the period immediately before he is charged, when media and publicinterest in the crime is strong, as it is after a charge has been formally laid.During this period the present Scottish rule (starting point when the crime isknown to have been committed) is logical, though more restrictive than theEnglish rule (starting point when proceedings are imminent). Any point later thanwhen the crime is known to have been committed is necessarily artificial andcreates, as Phillimore acknowledged, at least some risk of unfair trial. Onthis footing, there is ground for the view that the Phillimore recommendationgoes too far in allowing prejudicial publication before a formal charge is made,so endangering the fair trial of accused persons. This can make it impossible--- --^-----^-7 11960] JC 5. This judgement has meantime come under review, and will be considered bya full bench of the High Court of Judiciarv in the near future in the case of Hall, Petitioner.&quot;Para. 123.
for the prosecuting authorities to allow a trial to proceed; or, if the trial doesproceed, any conviction secured is at risk of being overturned on appeal.In either case, the result is that if thc accused person is innocent, he has beendenied the opportunity to clear his name; if he is guilty, his release may con-stitute a danger (and in some cases a serious danger) to the safety of thepublic. For these reasons, the authorities concerned with the prosecution of offenders have serious doubts about the Phillimore recommendation asit stands. Moreover, while the time of charge is no doubt the most readilyidentifiable point after a crime is known to have been committed, the factthat a criminal charge has been made is by no means always announced inthe absence of inquiries. In many cases, therefore, its adoption would not remove the uncertainty which is the principal subject of complaint.15. Among the possible alternatives to the Phillimore recommendations are: (1) Leaving the present rules as they stand. Phillimore described the disadvantages of this course; but it may be arguable that neither thePhillimore recommendation nor any other alternative is so dcmonstrablysuperior as to justify the risk of abandoning the existing arrangements which work reasonably well in most cases. Phillimore recognised thatalmost any rule is bound to embody a more or less unsatisfactory corn-promise, and the present rules may turn out to be the least unsatisfactory.The objection that they are vague and uncertain may be answered by the argument that certainty can only be obtained by adopting a rule which goesto one extreme or the other. It must, however, be accepted that the presentrules are anomalous in so far as they differ between England and Scotland.(In considering this and other alternatives, it must be borne in mind that,as mentioned on page 5 above, the High Court of Judiciary has announcedits intention to review the present Scottish rule.)(2) Codification of the present rules by incorporating them in an act of Parliament. This would make the position clearer by removing someof the uncertainties. On the other hand, it would sharpen the differencebetween the present English and Scottish rules.(3) Codification of the present rules in such way as to extend theEnglish rule to Scotland. This would remove the differences, and in thedirection of freedom of the press, by allowing comment in Scotland after a crime is known to have been committed but before proceedings are im-minent. On the other hand, this benefit would be purchased at the price ofthe greater protection which the present rule gives to accused persons inScotland; and in so far as the English rule may be less certain than theScottish, it would extend that greater uncertainty to Scotland.(4) Codification of the present rules in such a way as to extend thepresent Scottish rule to England and Wales. Putting the starting pointthroughout Great Britain at the moment when a crime is known to havebeen committed would remove the anomaly by protecting the rights of the accused to the fullest possible extent. This is perhaps the most logical andclear-cut course. On the other hand, it would considerably increaserestrictions on freedom of publication in England and Wales.(5) Extending the present Scottish rule to England and Wales but with no liability if publication was reasonably in the public interest. an example would be where the purpose of publication was to assist the arrest
of an offender or alert the public to the danger of an attack. This coursewould offer some of the benefits of the present Scottish rule but with itsrestrictions tempered by an escape clause. The disadvantages are broadlythose which led Phillimore&apos; to conclude that no defence of public benefit should be created. These are that it might be extremely difficult for the mediato know in advance whether a particular publication could be defended onthe ground of public benefit. &quot;Public benefit is notoriously difficult to define. . . . Moreover, the ventilation of a misconceived defence on those lines could well exacerbate the risks of prejudice&quot;. On the other hand, the objection which Phillimore also took, that a defence of public benefit would introduce a further element of uncertainty into the law, though valid, maybe less so in this context since the new element of uncertainty would be balanced (in England and Wales) by the removal of the uncertainty of the&quot;imminent&quot; rule.16. Civil proceedings. Phillimore considered that the protection of theadministration of justice did not demand that strict liability for contempt shouldbe imposed on the press from the commencement of civil proceedings, and still less from any time before their commencement. In the higher courts, such proceedings usually take much longer than criminal cases. Their rate of progress is in the hands of the parties, whose liberty is unlikely to be at risk as it generallyis in criminal cases. Further, to apply the law from the initiation of the proceed-ings would leave unresolved the problem of the &quot;gagging writ&quot; (that is, a writissued solely for the purpose of stifling comment). Phillimore recommended10that in relation to civil proceedings strict liability for contempt should operate as from the date of setting down for trial in the High Court in England andWales, and as from the date of allowance of proof or jury trial in the Court of session and in the sheriff court in Scotland. In county courts and magistrates&apos;courts, they recommended11 that the starting point should be six weeks beforethe date fixed for the hearing of the case. In view of the system of written plead-ings in Scotland, they also recommended that, while it should continue to be acontempt to publish any part of the unadjusted pleadings in actions in the Courtof Session and the sheriff court, it should not be a contempt to publish any information about the case which is not proved to have been derived from or to relate directly to the unadjusted pleadings.17. In civil proceedings in the superior courts the usual time taken fromsetting down to trial ranges from about six to 18 months. The PhillimoreCommittee made it clear that most of its members, and also certain of its judicialwitnesses (including the Master of the Rolls), would have preferred a shorter period of restriction. If a later stage in the proceedings could have been identified as reasonably practical and convenient for the purpose, they would have recommended that stage instead of setting-down. Mr. Robin Day, in a separatenote, stated his view that liability ought not to arise in respect of civil proceed-ings until shortly (say one or two weeks) before the trial; and, since the existingprocedures provided no appropriate footing, he recommended that one shouldbe specially created for the purpose by the publication of a &quot;sub judice list&quot;showing which cases are shortly to be tried.* In paras. 143-145.10 Para. 127.&quot;Para. 131.
18. It would be impracticable within reasonable limits of public money and staff to operate a special sub judice list on the lines suggested by Mr. Day.In England and Wales alone, separate lists would have to be prepared and maintained, not only by the House of Lords and the different offices concernedwith the various branches of the Supreme Court, but also by each of the 130District Registries of the High Court. If the system were to extend to the lowercourts, as in principle it should, separate lists would also have to be kept by thenearly 300 county courts and over 700 magistrates&apos; courts. Such an arrangementis not feasible, and even if it were the result would be to burden the media witha mass of daily-changing lists of all the current business of the civil courts.19. Fixing the starting point at the stage of setting-down in England andWales, or allowance of proof or jury trial in Scotland, as recommended by themajority of Phillimore, has much to commend it for the reasons which they gave.It poses, however, certain technical difficulties. There are numerous other formsof proceedings (such as applications for interlocutory injunctions or interiminterdicts) which have no such stage, or any obvious equivalent to it. It might bepossible to select arbitrary fixed points for some of these proceedings, aftercommencement and before trial, which would serve the purpose. But these points would all be different for each of the particular proceedings concerned,and the result would be a complex and elaborate rule under which the avoidance of liability would depend on the careful ascertainment of detailed and technicalfactors. It may therefore be that in these cases the formal commencement of proceedings is the only identifiable stage which can practically be fixed as the starting point for strict liability. It is noteworthy that the sub judice rule in theHouse of Commons applies from the time that the case has been set down for trial &quot;or otherwise brought before the court, as for example by notice of motion for an injunction&quot;; and that the provision generally is subject to the discretion of the Chair11.20. Moreover, even in proceedings which do have a setting-down stage, orthe equivalent in Scotland, the earlier stages of the proceedings may well need the protection of the law of contempt. This applies particularly to applicationsfor interlocutory injunctions or interim inteidiets, on which issues of consider-able, and sometimes decisive, importance can arise. These applications have nosetting-down stage and they are often heard at very short notice. Phillimorerecommended18 that provision should be made for rules of court to specify astarting point where appropriate for each form of proceeding, which would normally be the moment when the date for the hearing is fixed. In practice,however, there is usually no such moment in any formal or identifiable sensewhich could be used for the purposes of the law of contempt, and the date on which the application is first made seems likely to be the only practicablestarting point. The adoption of the Phillimore recommendation in respect ofthe main proceedings would mean that the issue of the writ would not putprejudicial publication at risk, but an application for interlocutory relief (whethermade immediately or later) would do so. When the interlocutory applicationhad been determined, freedom of publication would revive, unless or until theaction was set down for trial. This intermittent system could give rise to confusion and uncertainty, which it was one of Phillimore&apos;s main objects to avoid.11 Resolution of the House concerning Debate on Matters awaiting Judicial Decision.Hansard 23 July 1963, Vol. 681, Cols. 1416-7 and 28th June 1972, Vol. 839, Col. 1627.&quot; Para. 129.
21. For the county courts and magistrates&apos; courts, Phillimore&apos;s recommendedstarting point of six weeks before hearing was based on the assumption that in county courts the usual procedure is to fix a date for the hearing when thesummons is issued. In fact the return day fixed when the plaint is enteredin the books of the court is, in all actions other than for the recovery of land,and unless the court otherwise directs, not the date of the trial itself, but thedate of the pre-trial review. It is arguable that strict liability for contemptshould apply only from the date of the pre-trial review; but the Registrar haswide powers and many actions are, in fact, disposed of at the pre-trial review.It seems more appropriate to make the commencement of the proceedings the starting point for strict liability in county court cases. Only in the most excep-tional instances will the period between the filing of the plaint and the hearing of the action begin to approach the six months which the Phillimore majoritysuggested as the maximum desirable delay in civil cases. Similar considerations apply to magistrates&apos; courts.22. The recommendation that in Scotland it should continue to be a contemptof court to publish the content of written pleadings before the record is closed,but that it should not of itself be a contempt to publish any information aboutthe case which is not proved to have been derived from or to relate directly tothe unadjusted pleadings, was based on the assumption that in virtually all civil proceedings of importance in Scotland there were written pleadings. SincePhillimore reported, the small debt court, which heard monetary actions upto a limit of  50 in value, has been replaced by the new summary cause, which applies to a much wider range of actions, including all monetary actions up to 500 in value. Like the old small debt actions, these actions do not have writtenpleadings. The question now rises as to whether reports of what is contained inthe statement of claim and any defences in a summary cause should be coveredby the same rules which cover reports of what is contained in the unadjustedwritten pleadings in other court actions.23. There appear to be three main alternatives to the present rule: (1) The Phillimore majority recommendation. In practice this seems likely to mean the date of setting down in all actions begun in the superiorcourts by writ or originating summons, and the date on which proceedings are commenced in other cases, including interlocutory applications withinmain actions which have a setting-down stage. This arrangement offers the advantage of a later starting point, and so more freedom of comment,in many of the major cases which come before the superior courts; but the disadvantage of different rules for different kinds of proceedings, and uncertainty and possible confusion in relation to interlocutory proceedings.(2) Adoption in all civil cases of the date on which the main proceed-ings are begun. The arguments against this were fully stated by Phillimore(see paragraph 16 above). On the other hand, the date of commencement hasthe great advantage of being simple, clear and certain. The danger of the&quot;gagging writ&quot;, issued solely to stifle comment, to which Phillimore rightlydrew attention, appears to have diminished in practice since the judgment of the House of Lords in the Sunday Times case. If liability in respect ofpublications is limited to that which creates a risk of serious prejudice,there is a stronger argument for applying the law of contempt throughoutthe prodeedings.
(3) Adoption of different rules for jury and non-jury trials. Very fewcivil cases are tried by jury, and the judges arc generally considered to be lesssusceptible than jurors to improper influence by publication. One view put to Phillimore, for example by Lord Salmon, is that there is no need for any period of strict liability at all in a case tried by a judge alone. On this footing,it might be provided that there would be no strict liability for contemptunless and until an order were made for jury trial. Phillimore rejected thiscourse14 on four grounds. First, witnesses and parties, as well as the court,have to be protected by the law of contempt regardless of the mode of trial.Secondly, even if judges are less likely than laymen to be swayed by themedia, the public at large might well believe that their decisions had been influenced by extensive press comment and opinion, and hence loseconfidence in the impartial administration of justice. Thirdly, it is not alwaysknown until a comparatively late stage whether a case will be tried by juryor not, especially in Scotland. Finally, Phillimore considered it desirable in the interests of simplicity to have one rule for all civil proceedings what-ever their mode of trial. The proposed definition of contempt wouldrequire any court applying it to have regard to the different susceptibilitiesof judges and jurors where it was relevant to do so. These are cogent objec-tions. Nevertheless, there are clearly arguments in favour of this course.In particular, it would greatly increase the freedom of the media to publishinformation and comment about matters which are the subject of civil proceedings without risk of being held in contempt if they inadvertentlypublish something which creates a risk of serious prejudice to thoseproceedings.Proposed defences against strict liability24. A further question about strict liability concerns defences: how far should it be a defence to strict liability that a publication creating a risk of seriousprejudice is nevertheless justified because it is: (i) a fair and accurate report of legal proceedings in open court publishedcontemporaneously and in good faith; or(ii) part of a legitimate discussion of matters of general public interest which only incidentally and unintentionally creates a risk of seriousprejudice to particular proceedings?These are not necessarily recognised as defences under the present law.Phillimore proposed that they should be.25. Reports of legal proceedings. Phillimore observed that until 1974 theposition, though not entirely clear, was thought to be that a fair and accuratereport of legal proceedings published in good faith could not be a contempt.Then in 1974, in R. v. Poulson and Pottinger, the judge (relying on certain earlierauthorities) ruled that certain evidence given at the trial could not be publishedbecause of the risk of prejudice to other criminal proceedings which had already begun. Phillimore accepted that there were strong arguments for applying thesame rules to published reports of legal proceedings as apply to other publica-tions. Nevertheless, they concluded on balance that publication of such reports should not be subject to the law of contempt. Their reasons were, first, that any&quot;Para. 125.
other rule would impose an unacceptably heavy burden on court reporters,who could not always be expected to know of other proceedings involving thesame evidence as in those they are reporting. Secondly, the first trial may be along one and its outcome, or even the ultimate aspect of the evidence when set in its proper context, cannot be determined during the course of the proceedings.Moreover, the degree of prejudice caused may vary considerably depending onthe time elapsing between the first and second trials. Further, where the accusedis the same person in both trials, the application of strict liability for contemptin order to avoid prejudicing his position would make much of the first trialunreportable. This would be too great an incursion into the principle that legal proceedings should be freely reported, a principle which must prevail at the trial (as opposed to committal proceedings) over the interest of the accused toprevent publications prejudicial to him. Phillimorc therefore recommended15that it should be provided by statute that it is a defence to contempt proceedingsto show that the publication was a fair and accurate report of legal proceedings in open court published contemporaneously and in good faith.26. The only reservation to this recommendation which Phillimore made wasthe case of the so-called &quot;trial within a trial&quot;, when evidence and legal argumentare heard in open court, but in the absence of the jury, to determine whetherthe evidence in question is admissible. They said that clearly such evidenceshould not be published during the trial unless and until it is held to be admissible.Apart from that single reservation, they made no exceptions, in the main bodyof their Report, to their proposal that court proceedings should be freelyreported. (They did not mention that for the same reasons it is also wrong to publish material relating to other offences during the course of the trial, as was reaffirmed in the recent case of R. v. Border Television Limited16.) they stated expressly that in reaching this conclusion they had been influenced bythe fact that the press had usually been willing to co-operate with a request notto report particular items of evidence or name particular witnesses. However,after the Committee had finished their deliberations, a case occurred in whicha newspaper published the names of two victims of alleged blackmail who, byorder of the judge, had not been named in the trial at the Old Bailey (this wasthe Socialist Worker case, further referred to in paragraph 34 below). ThePhillimore Report was completed before the outcome of the contempt proceed-ings against the publisher and writer of the article was known, but the committee felt it necessary to include a reference to the incident. In a footnote17 they stated that the case &quot;suggests that the traditional co-operation of the press cannot longer always be relied upon. . . . We incline to the view that the important question of what the press may publish concerning proceedings in open court should no longer be left to judicial requests (which may be disregarded) nor tojudicial directions (which, if given, may have doubtful legal authority) but that legislation . . . should provide for these specific circumstances in which a court shall be empowered to prohibit, in the public interest, the publication of namesor other matters arising at a trial&quot;.27. The Committee thus added, at a late stage, a substantial exception to the irrecommendation that there should be no bar to reports of legal proceedings.It is true that in practice the power they proposed to confer on the judges would&quot;Para. 141.&quot; The Times, 17 January 1978.&quot;To para. 141.
do little more than guarantee the existing voluntary co-operation of the press.It is also the case, as Phillimore noted, that the law already imposes restrictionson the reporting of certain legal proceedings. Examples are committal proceed-ings, proceedings relating to children, evidence in matrimonial and certain other domestic cases, matters which may affect national security, and the names of complainants in rape cases. Nevertheless, Parliament has always been reluctant to authorise such restrictions by law unless the case for doing so is abundantlymade out. There is undoubtedly a strong case for making it clear beyond doubtthat the courts can restrain publication, where the public interest requires, of matters such as the names of blackmail victims, and the identity of somewitnesses in trials involving official secrets which would otherwise have to beheld partly in camera. Such a power is likely to have to be framed in general terms, because if it were put in specific terms in the interests of certainty, itmight be impossible to be sure that in a case of genuine need not so covered a judge&apos;s request that certain matters should be withheld from publication would always be heeded. This is a point which deserves attention in considering the implementation of the Phillimore recommendation concerning reports of legal proceedings.28. General public discussion. Phillimore proposed18 that it should be a de-fence to strict liability for contempt that the publication formed part of a legiti-mate discussion of matters of general public interest and that it only incidentallyand unintentionally created a risk of serious prejudice to particular proceedings.This recommendation is intended to reflect the view expressed in an Australiancase in 193718, and cited with approval by the House of Lords in the Sunday times case, that: &quot;The discussion of public affairs and the denunciation of public abuses,actual or supposed, cannot be required to be suspended merely because thediscussion or the denunciation may, as an incidental but not intendedby-product, cause some likelihood of prejudice to a person who happensat the time to be a litigant.&quot;Thus Phillimore pointed out that a general public debate about fire precautionsin hotels ought not be brought to a halt simply because a particular hotel isprosecuted for breach of the fire regulations; or a debate about corruption in an area of public life because a few individuals are charged with bribery.29. The underlying intention of this recommendation, that the public interestin uninterrupted discussion of the issues of the day should not be defeated bythe incidental commencement of proceedings, is plainly right. But the recom-mendation has to be taken with the proposed narrower definition of contempt,namely that a publisher will only be at risk if the publication causes a risk of serious prejudice to particular proceedings and he knew, or ought to have known,of those proceedings. These are substantial, and arguably sufficient, safeguards;and it may be said that where they are not satisfied the needs of justice shouldprevail. On this footing, the recommended defence of general public discussionmay tilt the balance too far against accused persons and litigants. To takePhillimore&apos;s example, it is unlikely that the need to avoid a risk of seriouslyprejudicing a litigant would significantly interfere with general public debateabout fire precautions in hotels. Conversely, it may be argued that it would be&quot;Para. 142.&quot; Ex parte Bread Manufacturers (1937) 37 S.R. (N.S.W.) 249.
wrong to allow an accused person or a litigant to be seriously prejudiced in theinterests of uninterrupted public discussion. Moreover, the concept of &quot;legitimatediscussion of matters of public interest&quot; is inevitably subjective. It gives rise tothe kind of difficulties which led Phillimore to reject suggestions that thereshould be a defence of &quot;public benefit&quot;. Finally, as mentioned above, the&quot;gagging writ&quot; appears to have been much less effective in practice since thedecision of the House of Lords in the Sunday Times case.30. Thc recent Scottish case of Atkins v. London Weekend Television (as yetunreported) illustrates some of the difficulties which arise when prejudicialreference is made to particular proceedings in a discussion of a matter of general public interest. Mrs. Atkins was a nursing sister charged with assaulting a12 year-old girl, who had suffered severe brain damage and was a patient in an intensive care unit, by having twice attempted to block the girFs air supply.Mrs. Atkins denied committing these acts. In a feature entitled &quot;The LivingDead&quot;, London Weekend Television were held by the High Court of Justiciaryto have committed a serious contempt by referring to the Atkins case in such away as to imply that the real issue at the trial would be whether she was morallyand medically justified in committing the acts charged, whereas her defence wasthat she had not committed them at all. Thc references to her case formed partof the discussion, the remainder of which was unexceptionable taken on itsown. The Lord Advocate has since decided not to proceed with the chargesagainst Mrs. Atkins.31. Thus, there are grounds for dissenting from the Phillimore recommenda-tions. On the other hand, it can be argued that thc public interest in an unfettereddiscussion of an issue of major importance to the community may outweigh the claim of an individual accused person or civil litigant to an unprejudicedtrial.Liability for intentional prejudice32. The proposals considered so far have been concerned with strict liability for contempt: liability, that is, where the publication in question only uninten-tionally prejudices the legal proceedings concerned. Phillimore also had toconsider the position where the conduct complained of was intended to prejudice the proceedings. They recommended&quot; that any conduct, whether by publicationor otherwise, which was intended to pervert or obstruct the course of justice inparticular proceedings should continue to be capable of being dealt with ascontempt of court, but: (a) only if the proceedings in question have started and have not yet been finally settled or concluded; and, in any event,(b) such conduct should normally be dealt with as a criminal offence unless there are compelling reasons requiring it to be dealt with as a matterof urgency by means of summary contempt procedures.33. Because it is concerned with intentionally mischievous conduct, and because of its proposal that such conduct should normally be dealt with as a criminal offence, this recommendation in particular will have to be considered in the light of the Law Commission^ forthcoming Report on Offences againstthe Administration of Justice (see paragraph 7 above). But whatever recom-&quot; Paras. 66 and 72.
mendations the Law Commission may make, a question which seems likely to arise is whether it is desirable to limit the operation of the law of contempt to particular legal proceedings, and then only to the period after they have formallystarted.34. The proposal to confine liability to particular proceedings makes no provision for conduct affecting, not a particular case, but the administration ofjustice in general. For example, in the case of R. v. Socialist Worker ex parteAttorney General21, the Divisional Court held that publication of the names oftwo victims of alleged blackmail who, by order of the judge, had not beennamed in court was a serious contempt. The publication could not haveprejudiced the particular proceedings: the witnesses had already given their evidence and the jury&apos;s verdict was unlikely to be influenced by publicationof their names. The publication was objectionable, not merely because it affrontedthe authority of the court, but (and more importantly) because it tended to deter blackmail victims from giving evidence in future cases and thereby pre-prejudiced the course of justice as a continuing process. It is true that this particularoffence could be dealt with under the proposed power of the court to prohibit the publication of names or other matters arising at a trial (discussed in para-graph 27 above). But it would not necessarily be prudent to assume that thegrant of such a power would enable the courts to deal with every kind of conductwhich could prejudice the administration of justice in general. No doubt thecourt would hold it to be a contempt for a newspaper to incite its readers to write to or telephone a witness or party to proceedings to persuade him not to appear. (The House of Commons held it to be contempt when a newspaperincited its readers to telephone a Member and complain of a question of whichhe had given notice&quot;.) But it might be similarly contrary to the public interest for a newspaper to incite its readers, for example, to call or write to a debt-collecting agency to deter it from taking county court proceedings againstdebtors, even when no particular proceedings were on foot or contemplated.35. Phillimore&apos;s view that liability for intentional contempt should be confined to the period after the proceedings have formally begun was basedon the judgment of the Australian High Court in the case of James v. Robinson&apos;-3.After reviewing the (mostly English) authorities, the Court held that publicationbefore proceedings might well constitute a crime but could not be a contempt.Mr. Justice Windeyer accepted: &quot;That the harmful consequences of a publication made before proceed-ings are commenced may be no less than if it were made afterwards does,naturally, seem a ground for saying that it, too, should be unlawful. And itwell may be. But it is not punishable as a contempt: that is all that I meanto decide. Contempt of court is historically, and by its name and nature,concerned with the position of courts, with proceedings in court and withthe protection of parties in court&quot;.Although Phillimore said that they were attracted by the logic of that view, it is arguable that it embodies a limitation which does not follow from the funda-mental policy of the law of contempt. The purposes of the law include theprotection of parties and witnesses as well as of the court, and the maintenanceof public confidence in the administration of justice. At the least, the limitation&quot; [1975] 1 Q.B. 637.&quot; Report of the Committee of Privileges, H.C. 27 (1956-57).M (1963) 109 C.L.R. 593.
proposed by Phillimore, like Mr. Justice Windeyer&apos;s dictum, assumes that the criminal law will provide effective remedies other than by the law of contempt.This it may not always be able to do, since Parliament rightly insists thatcriminal offences must be framed in specific and restrictive terms. It may wellbe contended that there is no overriding reason of principle against, and definitereasons to favour, arming the courts with a residual power, independent of andto some extent no doubt overlapping with specific criminal offences, to deal withconduct intentionally aimed at subverting the administration of justice, either generally or in particular cases, even if thc proceedings in question have notyet begun. If the conduct in question is deliberately aimed at particular proceed-ings, the question whether or not they have formally been commenced may in a sense be regarded as unimportant.Bringing influence or pressure on parties to proceedings36. Another difficult problem with which Phillimore had to deal was theextent to which the law can properly allow pressure or influence to be broughtto bear on litigants to continue, abandon or compromise the proceedings inwhich they are involved. Phillimore observed that although this problem was most likely to arise in relation to civil proceedings, the absence of reportedcases suggests that it does so but rarely. Only one alleged contempt of this type(which occurred in 1965&quot;) appears to have been reported as coming before thecourts between 1930 and the Sunday Times case in 1972-73. The Sunday Timescase brought it into prominence, and the views expressed on this and other aspects of the law of contempt by Phillimore and all other commentators must take substantial account of that case, which was a landmark. But although every case is bound to be different from every other, the Sunday Times case was particularly unusual; and Phillimore rightly warned against making it the solebasis for re-formulating the law: &quot;It must be remembered . . . that the thalidomide litigation is itself quiteexceptional, if not unique. The tragic quality of the circumstances out ofwhich it arose, the number of children involved, the uncertainty as to thelegal liability of the defendants, as well as the delay in bringing the proceed-ings to a decision, were all exceptional and of themselves well calculated toexcite public interest, concern and debate. It may reasonably be hoped thata comparable case will not occur again in the foreseeable future, and tothat extent this case may not provide a sound foundation for recommenda-tions for reform of the law. It is perhaps unfortunate that thc only case ofcontempt which has come before the House of Lords in recent years shouldhave combined so many unusual features&quot;&quot;.This factor must be borne in mind in considering the Phillimore recommendation on pressure and influence.37. In the Sunday Times case, the article about the thalidomide litigation whichthe newspaper proposed to publish was treated by the Divisional Court as: &quot;. . . deliberately seeking to influence the settlement of pending proceed-ings by bringing pressure to bear on one party. Not only is the interferenceintended, but, having regard to the power of public opinion, we have no84 Vine Products v. Green [19661 Ch. 484.&quot; Para. 109.
hesitation in saying that the publication of the article complained of would create a serious risk of interference with Distillers&apos; freedom of action in thelitigation. It would therefore be a clear contempt. .The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court&apos;s decision on the ground thatin the circumstances of the case the public interest in fair comment outweighedthe possible prejudice to a party; but the Master of the Rolls expressly confirmed that it is part of the undoubted law of contempt that: &quot;.. . there is this further rule about bringing pressure to bear on a party:none shall, by misrepresentation or otherwise, bring unfair pressure tobear on one of the parties to a cause so as to force him to drop his complaint,or to give up his defence, or to come to a settlement on terms which hewould not otherwise have been prepared to entertain&quot;17.The House of Lords upheld the original decision of the Divisional Court thatthe article would be a contempt, although the majority based their decisionprimarily on the different ground that it was improper to prejudge the issues inpending proceedings. They nevertheless made it abundantly clear that it was andshould be a contempt to use improper influence on a litigant to forego his legalrights and to settle on terms to which he did not wish to agree. Whether theinfluence was improper depended on the way it was exerted. If it was exertedby threats of unlawful action, by abuse, by misrepresentation of the nature ofthe proceedings or the circumstances out of which they arose, it would beimproper. If it was exerted (as Lord Reid put it) &quot;in a fair and temperate way and without any oblique motive&quot; it would not be improper.38. In considering how to define what should and what should not amount toimproper influence, Phillimore recognised the great power which the mediacould bring to bear on a litigant; but they did not think it justifiable to draw a distinction between public and private pressure. They concluded that criticism of a litigant, whether public or private, was not something from which the law of contempt should protect him. Their recommendation accordingly was&quot; thatconduct directed against a litigant in connection with the legal proceedings inwhich he is concerned, which amounts to intimidation or unlawful threats to persons, property or reputation should be capable of being treated as a contemptof court; but that conduct falling short of that should not be contempt.39. In other words, Phillimore recommended that influence on a litigantshould never be &quot;improper&quot; unless it consists of intimidation or unlawful threatsto person, property or reputation. It is not entirely clear what conduct would beincluded in this broadly-framed concept, and how far it would be prohibitedby other branches of the law. Phillimore instanced threats by an employer tohis employee, a landlord to his tenant, or a trade union to its member, as wellas threats of physical violence. Other improper conduct would, no doubt, beincluded. It is uncertain whether threats to the litiganfs family or associateswould be. It does, however, seem clear that even quite a virulent campaign ofexecration by the media against a litigant, designed to induce him to abandonhis claim, would not necessarily be a contempt of court under this formula.40. The Phillimore recommendation is thus intended, with the Sunday Times&quot; [19731 1 Q.B. 710 at pp. 726-7.17 [1973] 1 Q.B. 735 at p. 739.&quot; Para. 62.
thalidomide case in mind, to permit free publication of any comment whichbrings influence or pressure to bear on a litigant, however great the risk ofprejudice. This seems to conflict with the general principle that comment of any kind should amount to contempt if it creates a risk of serious prejudice; and itmay be argued that there is no sufficient justification for such an exception.It is true that a litigant cannot be protected from private influence or pressuresfrom friends and associates, but it does not follow that all forms of publicpressure should therefore be allowed. A media campaign can involve pressure of a wholly different order from that of private advice or influence. The ruleproposed by Phillimore would have to be applied in all cases, including circum-stances which might be entirely different from those of the thalidomide litigation.The proposal draws no distinction, as the House of Lords sought to do, betweenpress comment and criticism which is fair and temperate (and therefore accept-able) and that which is unfair and intemperate (and therefore unacceptable).Instead, it would allow both.41. An alternative approach is to recognise that a valid distinction can bedrawn between private and public pressure. As Lord Diplock put it in the sunday Times case29: &quot;... a distinction is to be drawn between private persuasion of a partynot to insist on relying in pending litigation on claims or defences to whichhe is entitled under the existing law, and public abuse of him for doing so.The former, so long as it is unaccompanied by unlawful threats, is not, inmy opinion, contempt of court; the latter is at least a technical contempt,and this whether or not the abuse is likely to have any effect upon theconduct of that particular litigation by the party publicly abused. Forthe public mischief in allowing a litigant to be held up to public obloquyfor availing himself in a court of justice of rights to which he is entitled under the law as it stands at the time, lies in the inhibiting effect which itmight have upon all potential suitors if it were to become the commonbelief that to have recourse to the established courts of law for the ascer-tainment and enforcement of their legal rights and obligations would make them a legitimate target of public abuse. If laws are unjust they ought tobe changed. Under our constitution it is for Parliament to decide whether any change is needed. A campaign to change them should be directed topersuading Parliament of the need, not to vilifying individual litigants forexercising their rights under the law as it stands. If a campaign directed tothe latter object were to succeed in deterring litigants from enforcing theirlegal rights in courts of law which are under a constitutional duty to enforcethem, the practical result would be to substitute government by the &apos;media&apos;for government by Parliament in the particular field of legislation withwhich the campaign was concerned.&quot;42. Accordingly, it may be contended that the Phillimorc recommendationwould tip the balance too far against the interests of justice, and that a distinctioncan and should be drawn between private influence and pressure on the one handand public obloquy on the other.Conclusion43. The Phillimore Report was a most valuable review of this difficult and&quot; [19741 A.C. 273 at p. 313.
sensitive area of the law. It will be seen in this paper that in the Governmentsopinion there is room for legitimate argument both ways about some of themost important of the Phillimore recommendations. As with many problemsinvolving the conflict of equally valid aspects of the public interest, there is noabsolutely &apos;right&apos; answer: the question is how to achieve a fair balance inpractice. These arc matters on which the views, not only of experts, but of the widest possible range of opinion and experience can be helpful. The government therefore hopes that all who feel that they can contribute to the discussion ofthese matters will do so.44.

annex summary of Conclusions and Recommendations of the Report of the PhillimorcCommittee on Contempt of Court (Cmnd. 5794)general. Thc law of contempt in England and Wales and in Scotland is required as a means of: (a) maintaining thc rights of the citizen to a fair and unimpeded system of justice;and(b) protecting the orderly administration of thc law.2. Thc operation of thc law of contempt should be confined to circumstances wherethe achievement of its objectives requires thc application of a swift and summaryprocedure.3. In essentials the law of contempt, especially as it affects the press, should be thesame in England and Wales and in Scotland so far as procedural differences allow.4. Thc law as it stands contains uncertainties which impede and restrict reasonablefreedom of speech. It should be amended and clarified by statute so as to allow asmuch freedom of speech as is consistent with thc basic purposes of the law of contempt.5. A particular area of uncertainty concerns thc period of operation of thc law ofcontempt, as to whether publications arc at risk when proceedings arc &quot;imminent&quot;and, if so, what period that expression covers.Unintentional contempts out of court6. Strict liability for contempt (that is, liability even though the contempt wasunintentional) should apply only to publications (including for this purpose any speech,writing, broadcast or other communication, in whatever form, which is addressed tothc public at large), and not to any other conduct.7. A publication should give rise to strict liability for contempt only if it creates a risk that the course of justice in particular proceedings will be seriously impeded orprejudiced, and this definition of contempt should be provided by statute.8. In criminal proceedings, strict liability for publications should apply in Englandand Wales only when thc accused person is charged or a summons served (instead ofwhen proceedings are imminent, as at present), and in Scotland when he is publiclycharged on petition or otherwise, or at the first calling in court of a summary complaint(instead of when a crime is known to have been committed).9. In civil proceedings, strict liability for publications should apply, not as at presentfrom the commencement of the proceedings, but in England and Wales when thc casehas been set down for trial and in Scotland when proof or jury trial has been ordered,or the equivalent stage in other civil proceedings in which those stages do not occur.(This recommendation was subject to a note by Mr. Robin Day, who recommendedthat liability should not apply until shortly (say one or two weeks) before the trial,with thc publication of a special sub judice list to show which cases have reached thisstage).10. Strict liability for publications should cease when thc judgment, sentence orother order of the court is given; but in a criminal case in England and Wales, if thejury fails to agree, strict liability should continue to apply until it is clear that noretrial is to be ordered; in the event of a new trial it should apply as before.11. Thc existing defence of innocent publication and distribution under section 11of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 (which protects a person who publishesprejudicial matter if, having taken reasonable care, he did not know and had no reasonto suspect that legal proceedings which might be prejudiced were pending or imminent)should be retained in England and Wales and extended to Scotland.12. It should also be a defence to an allegation of contempt that the publicationwas a fair and accurate report of legal proceedings in open court published contem-porancously and in good faith.
13. It should further be a defence to an allegation of contempt that the publicationformed part of a legitimate discussion of matters of general public interest and thatit only incidentally and unintentionally created a risk of serious prejudice to particularproceedings.14. A general defence that a publication, though prejudicial, is in the public interestshould not be introduced into the law.15. The existing law governing editorial and corporate responsibility for publicationsshould be retained, with necessary modifications in regard to broadcasting and television organisations.Intentional contempts out of court16. Any conduct, including publication, which is intended to prevent or obstruct the course of justice in particular proceedings should continue to be capable of being dealt with as contempt of court, but: (a) only if the proceedings in question have started and have not yet been finally settled or concluded; and, in any event,(b) such conduct should normally be dealt with as a criminal offence unless thereare compelling reasons requiring it to be dealt with as a matter of urgency bymeans of summary contempt procedures.17. In Scotland, it should continue to be a contempt of court to publish the content of the written pleadings before the record is closed.18. It should be provided by statute that bringing influence or pressure to bear upon a party to proceedings shall not be held to be a contempt unless it amounts tointimidation or unlawful threats to his person, property or reputation.19. It should no longer be a contempt to take or threaten reprisals against a witnessor juror after the conclusion of legal proceedings with the intention of punishinghim for his part in them. Instead, such conduct should be made an indictable offence,with provision for the victim to recover compensation for any loss or damage he mayhave suffered.20. &quot;Scandalising the court&quot; should cease to be part of the law of contempt. Instead,it should be made an indictable offence both in England and Wales and in scotland to defame a judge in such a way as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.Proof that the allegations were true and that publication was for the public benefit should be a defence. In England and Wales this offence should be made a branch ofthe law of criminal libel.21. All distinctions between &quot;civil&apos; and &quot;criminal&apos; contempts in England and wales should be abolished, so that breach of a court order is not treated differently from other forms of contempt.Contempts in court22. Contempt in the face of the court should continue to be dealt with by the judgehimself, in accordance with the present practice, but: (a) the judge should always ensure that the contcmnor is in no doubt about thenature of the conduct complained of, and give him an opportunity of explainingor denying his conduct, and of calling witnesses;(b) before any substantial penalty is imposed there should be a short adjournment,with power to remand the contcmnor in custody. The judge should havepower to obtain a background report on the contemnor, and the contcmnorshould be entitled to speak in mitigation of sentence;(c) for the purposes of defending himself and of making a plea in mitigation thecontemnor should be entitled to legal representation, and the court should havepower to grant legal aid immediately for the purpose where appropriate; and(d) if the contempt also amounts to a criminal offence, the judge should considerreferring it to the prosecuting authorities to be dealt with under the ordinarycriminal law, and should so refer it in serious cases unless reasons of urgencyor convenience require that it be dealt with summarily30.30 In Scotland these recommendations were largely put into effect by a memorandum tojudges and sheriffs from the Lord Justice General issued in August 1975. Similar guidance to courts in England and Wales was given by the Court of Appeal in Balogh v. St. AlbatfsCrown Court [1975] I Q.B. 73.
23. Magistrates in England and Wales should be given power to impose penalties for contempt in the face of the court (subject to the limits proposed in recommenda-tions 34 and 35 below).24. Bankruptcy Registrars in the High Court in England should be given the same powers as county court judges to punish contempts in the face of the court.25. For the purposes of section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925 (prohibition onuse of cameras in courts and their precincts) a map or plan should be displayed wherever practicable indicating the boundaries of the precincts of the court.26. Regulations should be made governing the unofficial use of tape-recorders incourt, and of recordings obtained thereby. Breach of the regulations in court shouldbe punishable as a contempt.Procedure, appeals, sentences, etc.27. The right of private individuals to initiate proceedings for contempt both inEngland and Wales and in Scotland should continue, without prejudice to thc powerof either the Attorney General or thc Lord Advocate to take proceedings at his owninstance should he consider it proper to do so in the public interest.28. In all contempt proceedings which a private individual seeks to institute, otherthan those for the enforcement of a court order made in his favour, he should berequired to serve notice of those proceedings on the Attorney General or the lord advocate as the case may be.29. Ex parte committal orders in England and Wales should in any case include a direction that thc contemnor is to be brought up before the judge making the order(or another judge if he is not available) at the earliest opportunity.30. There should be created a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal inScotland by way of Note of Appeal from a finding of contempt in a criminal trial onindictment.31. All sentences of imprisonment for contempt of court in England and wales should be for fixed terms (as they already arc in Scotland), but the power to reviewa case and order release before the full sentence is served should be retained. Exerciseof thc Royal prerogative of mercy should not be advised in any case of contempt.32. In superior courts both in England and Scotland the power to fine for contemptshould remain unlimited but the power to imprison should be limited to a maximum period of two years. All courts should in addition have appropriate powers to dealwith mentally disordered offenders.33. The powers of judges of county courts (in England and Wales) and sheriffs(in Scotland) to punish for contempt should be increased and reduced respectively toa maximum fine of  150 or three months&apos; imprisonment.34. Both in England and Scotland, magistrates and justices of the peace should havepower to impose a fine of up to  20 or imprisonment for up to seven days for contemptin thc face of the court.35. Powers of both sheriffs and magistrates in Scotland and of magistrates inEngland to certify more serious cases of contempt in the face of the court to the HighCourt of Justiciary or thc Inner House of the Court of Session and the DivisionalCourt respectively should be given or confirmed, as the case may be.36. Prison regulations in England and Wales should be amended to require notifica-tion to be given to the Official Solicitor of prisoners committed for contempt by county courts for fixed terms of less than six weeks, in the same way as for other contemptprisoners.37. The machinery for the enforcement of fines for contempt in the High Court and restrictive Practices Court in England and Wales should be replaced by a system onthe lines of that provided by the Criminal Justice Act 1967.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;!
