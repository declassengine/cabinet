UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(7 ) 44 COPY NO11 April 1978CABINETUNION MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS IN THE CIVIL service memorandum by the Lord Privy SealINTRODUCTION1- The Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El) on8 March endorsed additional safeguards against dismissal to be included inany union membership agreement (UMA) for industrial and non-industrial civil servants.     My letter of 23 March to the Secretary of State for Industryreported the difficulties we had encountered.     The Prime Minister&apos;scomments are recorded in a note of 3 April (Annexes A and B). the implications of the threatened industrial action are assessed in Annex C.El is to consider the position further on 11 April.INDUSTRIALS:  THE PP.OBLEM2. There are four main options -a. We could stand firm.b. We could change the threshold conditioni. by reducing the threshold level from 90 per cent to, say,75 per cent on an establishment by establishment basis;ii. by making the threshold an overall percentage of membership rather than determining it establishment byestablishment.    To be a real concession this \*ould need to be accompanied by a reduction in the threshold level from 90 percent.c. We could withdraw the threshold condition, but still insist onthe general charity option and exemption for existing non-members.1
d.       We could withdraw the threshold condition and the charityoption requirement, returning to the earlier position in which weinsisted on protection for conscientious objectors and expellees, andexemption for existing non-members.INDUSTRIALS: recommendations. Nothing less than option d. will be acceptable to the unions. Thiswould be a major concession, as would options b. ii. and c.    Any of these would result in the extenrion of UMAs to establishments where currentunion membership is very low, though present non-members would not beaffected.    They would also be a major weakening of the conditions agreed at.El on 8 March.     The Prime Minister&apos;s view in the note of 3 April is that we ought to stand firm, prepare to state our position publicly and to run a defensive campaign if the unions decide on industrial action.     The offer ofthe minor concession of b. i. above would be useful for the presentation ofour case.4. If we stand firm, the unions could justify industrial action byclaiming that in negotiations lasting well over a year they had agreed to eurearlier safeguards only to have fresh demands made for more far-reachingones than feature in any existing UMA.     They will say that we conceded theprinciple of a UMA but are now trying to avoid it by imposing extra andunreasonable demands.     Our answer is tnat jve are prepared to agree to aUMA where the unions1 claim is barked by a high member snip, but that it is unreasonable to force a UMA on an establishment where there are fewmembers.    Although the safeguards that the unions accepted go some way towards avoiding the risk of dismissals after the introduction of a UMA.they do not cover those who resign from their unions for reasons other thanreligion or conscience.NON-INDUSTRIALS:  THE PROBLEM5. Our decision here need not follow that for industrials,  since theposition of non-industrials is quite different.     There is much less of atradition of UMAs or closed shops amongst whfte collar workers, and it seven more important that any UMA for non-industrials should be publiclydefensible.     Furthermore, the non-industrial Civil Service, unlike theindustrials, would be seen by the public to be in a special position. More-over, the Conservatives appear to be more opposed to UMAs for non-mdustrials than for industrials.     All this means that the dismissal of anon-industrial civil servant for non-membership of a union would result ineven more adverse publicity than that of an industrial.N ON-INDUSTRIALS: RECOMMENDATIONS^&apos; Any UMA for non-industrials must have adequate safeguards againstdismissal, and be acceptable to the staff at the levels it will affect. our proposals ensure thin.     There is no prospect of minor concessions being2
acceptable to the unions, and major concessions would weaken our positiontoo much.     Accordingly, whether or not we make any concession forindustrials, we should stand firm for non-industrials and continue to insist on the ballot, general charity option and cut-off.     We must be prepared toexplain our position publicly if the unions&apos; publicity campaign takes place.SUMMARY7. Given the impossibility of making any major concessions which would secure a settlement with the unions, colleagues are invited to agree, both forindustrials and non-industrials, that we should stand firm on the safeguardsagreed at El on 8 March, and that we should prepare to state our positionpublicly and to run a defensive campaign if either set of unions decide on industrial action, or otuerwise seek openly to further their case.PCivil Service DepartmentU April 19783
rj Rt Hon Eric Varley MP^crelary of State for Industryfpartinent of industry Victoria Streetondon       SW1H OETCivil Service DepartmentWhitehall London SW1A 2AZ01-273-4400-xi March 1978MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS IN THE CIVIL SERVICEflowing our discussion at El on 8 March I presented our agreedfsition to the Trade Union Side of the Joint Coordinating Committee;Jr Government Industrial Establishments (JCC) on 15 March. MyFjicials also met on 13 March the General Secretaries of the 3 non-V^ustrial unions which have submitted claims for UMAs (CPSA, CSU and&apos;^).   I am writing to let you know the unions1 reactions.^STRIAL CIVIL SERVANTSf told the Trade Union Side of the JCC that the Government requiredy DMA to be conditional ional on a union membership threshold of 90J&amp; atestablishment where it was applied, and that such a UMA shouldJnclude a general option to pay to charity.   The trade unions objected* these proposals very forcibly.    They regarded them as an abrogation- the agreement in principle given a year ago to a UMA with suitable^guards.   They said that further discussion was pointless. UnlessGovernment reconsidered its position they would not hesitate tol&quot;5ort locally to the sort of tactics which they use in outside industry*J secure 100JS union membership.   With such tactics there would be noRation of exemption for existing non-members.    If the Government1 sJproach was aimed at avoiding unfavourable publicity it would fail,*Jth because of the local action which they would take, and because ofne reports they would be making at their forthcoming union conferences.!understand that the unions will not, for the time being, inform their..:!r&apos;toers of their meeting with me.    They will, however, report the^corne to their Executive Councils who will consider within the nextI 0r 3 weeks what action should be taken.   This is most likely to take1
the form of refusal to work with non-members, which will involvemanagement in the need for unpopular disciplinary action, eg suspensionfrom pay and even lay-offs, which could lead to escalation. their action is likely to be highly selective and aimed at places and taskswhere we are most vulnerable and where they will gain the best publicity for their cause.    There may be requests to see the Prime Minister.Unwelcome attention might also be drawn to those places, eg certainROFs and the Stationery Office, where de facto closed shops, have beenin operation for some years.I see no prospect of persuading them to accept either the membershipthreshold or the charity option safeguards.   Unless we withdraw them&amp;nd insist merely on protection for conscientious objectors andExpellees with exemption for existing non-members, I think we mustregard the negotiations as having broken down.    We shall then have toaccept the need for appropriate disciplinary measures against any action taken by the unions.^INDUSTRIALSThe CPSA, CSU and IRSF were unanimous in opposition to the package of conditions which we have proposed for UMAs in the non-industrial CivilService.   They took exception to the fact that some of the conditionsv&apos;e required had already appeared in the Daily Mail on 10 February,taking it more difficult to be flexible in negotiations.    They alsofiade it clear that they would object     if.^ they were offered more stringent conditions than the industrials.    Their attitude to thevarious safeguards was as follows. * *a. Ballot- The unions argued that our proposal for a ballot would be regardedas a serious Official Side interference in union affairs. Itwould throw into question their ability to represent the viewsof their members.    They also objected strongly to the proposal that existing non-members should be included in the ballot.b. General Option to pay to CharityThe unions were willing to contemplate special provisions forexpellees from unions, but considered that a general option toleave the union at any time would undermine the whole value tothem of a UMA.c. Cut-off at Clerical Officer levelAlthough the unions&apos; main concern at this meeting was about the ballot and charity option, it was clear that there would be difficulties about the cut-off.    The CPSA, most of whose members are at clerical officer level or below, would probably be preparedto concede a cut-off.    But the CSU and IRSF, with some of their membership well above the proposed cut-off level, would find this,less easy to accept.
They proposed to do nothing within the next 2 or 3 weeks after themeeting hut, thereafter, would feel free to use Parliament and themedia to further their cause. &quot; **For the industrials, we must decide whether to make any furtherapproaches^ to the Trade Union Side or whether to leave things as theyare and regard the negotiations as having broken down, with the inevitable consequence of industrial action and the need for counter-vailing measures.    The unions have made it quite clear that they regard the belated additional demands of a ballot, a union membership thresholdand a general charity option as amounting to abrogation of the agreement in principle to a UMA which we gave them a year ago.   A further approach is therefore likely to be quite unproductive unless colleagues areprepared to withdraw the requirement for both the membership thresholdand the general charity option.For the non- i ndu s tr i a Is, we must decide whether v/e wish to revise ourposition.    It&quot;would, for example, be possible to withdraw either the ballot requirement which was specifically designed to make a UMApublicly defensible, or one of the other conditions designed to ensurethat no-one was dismissed for not belonging to a union.    But the unionsv/ould almost certainly require a more extensive withdrawal before reaching agreement and would press for the same terms as industrials.The alternative is to stand firm, which will almost certainly resultin a breakdown of negotiations and possibly a CPSA-sponsored publicity campaign.If we decide to stand firm - v/hich would be less difficult for thenon-industrials than for the industrials - we shall need to explainour position publicly.   Our case will rest on the fact that we arefiot opposed to UMAs for civil servants as long as they include adequate safeguards against dismissal, and as long as it is clear that themajority of those concerned are in favour.    We could not contemplate. a*iy agreement that might force us to dismiss staff who may have givenlong and devoted service simply because they would not join a union.I am copying.this letter to the Prime Minister, members of El, the secretaries of State for Defence and Social Services, and Sir John Hunt.fcRART
The Prime Minister has seen Lord Peart1s letter of23 March to the Secretary of State for Industry, aboutUnion Membership Agreements in the Civil Service.It seems to him necessary that this subject shouldbe discussed again in the El Committee and I should be grateful if the Cabinet Office could make arrangementsaccordingly.On the substance the Prime Minister has minuted:(1) We can&apos;t make more than very minorconcessions(2) We should be preparing to state ourposition publicly - and to run a campaign if they decide on industrial action -*(3) Mr.  Booth may want to see the T.U.C. aspart of (2).. In view of the possibility of industrial action you may think it desirable to ensure that El has before it thelatest assessment of what industrial action is possibleor likely and what its implications would be for theGovernment.I should be grateful if the Prime Minister could havea n ;^ort on the conclusions of EI&apos;s discussion.Copies go to the Private Secretaries of the membersof I i, and to Roger Facer (MOD), Mike Malone-Lee (DHSS)and Martin Vile (Cabinet Office).
ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION BY INDUSTRIAL CIVIL servants in SUPPORT OF THEIR CLAIM FOR A UNION MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTIntroductionIt is assumed that in general the industrial action will take theform of refusal by union members to work with non-union members.It is known, however, that the trade unions nationally will leave it largely to their local representatives, ie Shop Stewards andConvenors, to decide what action is appropriate in their local circumstances.    It is not impossible, therefore, that industrial action will be taken in other ways, depending on the militancy of union members at a particular establishment.SgJlsitive areas most likely to be affected^he most sensitive areas likely to be affected are as follows:-1. Rosyth Dockyard - refits of Polaris submarinesClyde Submarine Base Faslane - operation of PolarissubmarinesArmament Depot Coulport - associated with FaslanePSA Services covering Electronic Security and Anti-Intruder systems in sensitive buildingsIndustrial staff at these  four  establishments are particularlyMilitant.2. Chatham Dockyard - refitting nuclear submarinesPortsmouth and Devon DockyardsAtomic Weapons Research Establishment, AldermastonRoyal Ordnance Factories, Burghfield and Cardiff -nuclear research and productionMost Royal Ordnance Factories - many undertakingimportant contracts for foreign governmentsMany REME Workshops - repairing and maintaining a wide range of technical equipment for the ArmyRAF Strike Command Units - these are RAF operationalunitsRAF Support Command Units - logistic backing for RAFoperationsFylingdales   Early Warning Radar Establishment.
Other establishments where industrial action could be embarrassingProperty Services Agency covering:-Lifts in Government buildingsServices to the Palace of WestminsterServices to the Joint Air Traffic Control Centre, West DraytonServices to the NATO Control Centre, Northwood, MiddlesexRoyal residencesOther services which could be inconveniencedThe Property Services Agency is responsible for a wide range of accommodation services where withdrawal of their labour would causes considerable inconvenience.   Areas most likely to be affected includeaccommodation housing computer installations. ^Hgans of countering industrial actionSome help might be forthcoming from non-industrial supervisorygrades who are members of the IPCS or other non-industrial trade^ion: which is not interested in securing a union membership agree-&quot;ient.   Their readiness to help in this instance is, however, likelyto he tempered by their anxiety not to upset their National Staffsiae colleagues.   There is also some doubt in Departments about howfar non-union members would be willing to undertake the work of^ion members who had refused to work with them.   The general assess-ment is that union members will stand together in this instance andthat even those hostile to the closed shop concept would not befiling to &quot;break ranks&quot;.   Military personnel could be used to somee*tent, for example at the Clyde Submarine Base, Faslane, but thee*tent to which they would be able to maintain essential operationalServices would depend very much on the extent and effectiveness of the* industrial action by industrial staff.   Military personnel couldnot he used to replace industrial staff engaged on nuclear refits ornuclear research.
