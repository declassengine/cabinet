^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 327 March 1978COPY NO80CABINETWINDSCALE:   PLANNING PERMISSION FOR OXIDE FUELREPROCESSING PLANTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. Before the debate in Parliament, we need to take a view on the main issues raised by the Inspectors Summary of Principal Conclusions andRecommendations, which I circulated to my colleagues under cover of myminute of 1 March.?. These issues are summarised in the Annex to this paper.THE NUCLEAR industry- None of us is likely to be in any doubt that we need to maintain a healthy nuclear industry.    This will entail the construction of additionalreactors, and the arising of greater amounts of spent fuel for storage,treatment and ultimate disposal.WHY REPROCESS?4- The nub of the present application is about spent fuel storage, wastedisposal and the recovery of nuclear fuel for future use.    The objectorscontended that we should store spent fuel for a substantial period withoutreprocessing: it had not yet been established that the highly active wastesresulting from reprocessing could be safely disposed of;  disposal of spent^el, as such, might prove preferable; no further highly active wasteshould be created until this possibility has been fully researched; otherrnethods might also be found.5* The Inspector concluded against these arguments; it would besensible to store increasing quantities of spent fuel only if it were likely that it would ultimately be decided to dispose of the spent fuel (with itsentire content of plutonium and other radioactive substances) withoutfeprocessing.    He judged this unlikely; it would involve throwing away largeindigenous energy resources;  and it would commit future generations to greater risk of the escape of plutonium and other substances from the^sposal site.    In other words, prolonged storage as such would be costlyai*d in all probability a dead end.1
6. I do not know how far the Americans would find these argumentspersuasive.    But in British circumstances I find the Inspectors viewconvincing.    It would be in the interests of greater energy resourceindependence to recover usable uranium and plutonium.    And it would bein our environmental interests to do so.7. In the light of the Inspectors appraisal, reprocessing andvitrification seem a more promising route to ultimate waste disposal thanlengthy storage and the disposal of spent fuel elements.    Not least thevolume of waste for disposal would be considerably less if large quantitiesof uranium and plutonium had been removed.    Moreover, as the Inspectorpoints out the size of the plutonium inventory could be reduced by using itin thermal and fast reactors, though we should need to manage the nuclearfuel cycle with that in mind.8- I do not need to stress the importance of making early progress in establishing a safe means of disposing of highly active wastes.    We went along way in our White Paper &quot;Nuclear Power and the Environment&quot;(Cmnd 6820) towards agreeing that we would do so before committing ourselves to a large-scale nuclear programme.    The reprocessing/vitrification approach, though not yet fully developed, seems to offer thebest option for long-term disposal.TIMING OF NEW PLANT9- The objectors argued that we should defer the project and awaitfurther developments.    Ey doing so, we should gain further knowledge of potential hazards and means of reducing them, and further time to strengthenaafeguards.    The Inspector recognised that there are no compelling reasons of fast reactor fuel requirement for making a start now.    We could fuel asizeable programme of fast reactors from stocks of plutonium from Magnoxreprocessing.    On the other hand, however, the Inspector concluded that itvould be preferable to start on the new plant without delay since thetechniques could then be developed at a reasonable rate, and greaterexperience gained, both of the process itself and of the behaviour andeffects of the emissions involved, whilst spent fuel stocks and arisings arecomparatively small.    I believe it would be prudent to do this.1Q*        The Inspector discusses the risks from the emissions involved inreprocessing and concludes that they are likely to be very small. Any^charges of radioactivity will require to be authorised by the appropriateMinisters in due course.    Authorisation, and not planning permission, is^e real control.    The present system of control is substantially satisfactorybut is, prima facie, capable of improvement on the lines recommended by the  Inspector (see paragraph 17).Having considered the Inspector^ report and conclusions, there is,in my view, no reason why we should not agree to the construction of theProposed plant, and to a start being made now.
SIZE OF PLANT:  FOREIGN FUEL REPROCESSINC*2.       For domestic purposes, it seems to be agreed that we would, in due course, need a reprocessing plant of 600 tonnes annual throughout. Theproposal is to provide a plant double that size.    This would enable BritishNuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) to reprocess foreign fuel in addition to united Kingdom arisings.    I understand, however, that their intention isnot to run the plant to capacity, but allow a large operating margin. Asafirst point I draw attention to the issue of scaling up raised by the objectors.BNFL would be going from a pilot plant to a design capacity of 1200 tonnes.The Inspector pronounced himself to be satisfied on this.We need to be clear about the financial advantages of the Japanesecontract.    I understand that under the contract they would contribute to thecapital financing of the project and that the resulting profit would thereforehe relatively free of risk.    How much can be said in Parliament to put thefinancial merits of the contract beyond doubt?^m       According to the Inspector there are also clear disadvantages in accepting foreign fuel:  there would be additional routine emissions ofRadioactivity, additional storage of spent fuel, additional highly active wasteto dispose of, and additional movements of plutonium.    In reply we can statethat authorising Ministers would not permit additional radioactivedischarges, eg to the Irish Sea, which went beyond tightly defined limits,themselves a fraction of the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection (ICRP) recommended safety limits.    Additional storage should present no significant risk.    As for highly active waste, we need to confirm that we are free under the terms of the various contracts to return such^ste to the originating country if that is desirable.****       On the question of movements of plutonium and proliferation, we needtc* be clear that we can secure a return of plutonium in a form which will^th discourage terrorism and minimise the risk of proliferation.    I believeat discussions with the Japanese Government have begun.    We need toCo*i8ider how far we can disclose our intentions to Parliament in order tothe necessary reassurances about the form in which plutonium iseturned in line with the Inspector&apos;s conclusions.^*       On the question of non-proliferation, the Inspector balances the riskreturning plutonium to non-nuclear-weapon countries against the risk that^al of reprocessing facilities will serve as an incentive to create theirtechnology.    He records that this assessment is a matter for the*vernment.    Hi s own conclusion is that the risks inherent in the supply ofciuum to non-nuclear-weapon states can be alleviated to some extent byt   ^ucal fixes;  that it will not in any event happen for ten years;  and that alettU8a* t0 acceP* fore^S11 fuel would be in breach of the spirit, if not theer, of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thereby putting pressure on non-ear-weapon states which could lead them to produce their own plutonium3
long before they couJd receive any from the Thermal Oxide ReprocessingPlant (thorp).    We need to judge the likely reaction of other nations,particularly the United States, to these arguments, and decide to what extent we share the Inspector1 s assessment.    It would, among othermatters, be helpful tc establish that it is the Japanese who are at risk inthe application of the American case-by-case consent procedure and thatthis need not affect our own decision on the signing of foreign contracts.Among the questions in the House following my Statement, and atthe subsequent Press Conference,   the International Fuel Cycle EvaluationProgramme Conference was referred to;  and i was asked why theGovernment did not delay its decision pending the outcome of the Conference.i indicated that indefinite delay awaiting a rather uncertain timetable was not acceptable.    We are, of course, taking part in the Conference withoutPrejudice to our reprocessing arrangements; it would be unrealistic to expect all need for reprocessing to be eliminated;  and i do not think we0ught to hold back on a contingency basis.^*       Subject to the views of the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary on the points in the last paragraph it seems to me that the building of a1200 tonne plant should go ahead; the taking of foreign business would becommercially advantageous:  and a plant on the scale proposed is unlikely to present significant extra risks.Recommendations on radiological protection and safetyi draw attention to the fifteen specific recommendations made bythe Inspector for reinforcing our present arrangements.    Most of them should prove to be acceptable.    Officials should be asked to examine andreport on these recommendations.conclusion^*      I invite my colleagues to agree the line we should take during the debate on the main issues raised by the Conclusions in the Inspector1 s Report,P SApartment of the Environment7 March 19784

ISSUES      COMMENTARY (The&apos; numbers refer to the numbers in the annex to the Draft Cabinet Paper)Should Oxide Fuel from UK reactors be reprocessed in this country at all1. There is no doubt that v/e want a healthy nuclear industry. Butve must make safe arrangements for the disposal of wastes.2. The risks from reprocessing itself are likely to be small interms of radioactive emissions, and accidents.   There are separatecontrol systems for authorising discharges and for licensing nuclearplants for the safety of operators and the public at large.    If itwere impossible to design and operate THORP within the requiredlimits, it would not be built or operated.The risks from terrorism, via thefts of plutonium, which might arise from the separation of plutonium and an increase in stocks wereassessed by the Inspector as not significant.   In our White Paper&quot;Nuclear Power and the Environment&quot; v/e accepted that security wouldhave to be designed into nuclear systems.   The Inspector distinguished&apos;IH0RP from a commitment to large-scale nuclear power which exercisedthe Royal Commission.   He took the view that risks could largely be eliminated by irradiation or other technical fixes.    He recommended&quot;*uc xuucpciiucii o   vcuoj-ilg  Ox   ocuuixuy   ax 1 cui ,ciucii co   a. u   rt xiiu.oua.xc .      x o&apos;,;ould be necessary to ensure the effectiveness of security measuresst other BNFL establishments were fuel containing plutonium to befabricated there.2.a) On the basis that reprocessing risks are acceptable, it makessense to recover usable uranium and plutonium for further energyuse.2.b) Reprocessing, and vitrification of residual high-level wastes,though not yet fully developed, seem the best route to ultimate wastedisposal.   The amount of waste will be less.   It v/ill contain lessPlutonium (with its very long half-life).    Solidified v/aste in theform of glass will be less vulnerable to leaching by water whenfinally deposited.
The alternative is prolonged storage, and Just possibly dispo-spent fuel elements with minimal treatment, or more likely s00^form of reprocessing.   We have little know/ledge of AGR spent in stainless steel cladding when stored for long periods.   EXR.of fuel storage in the United States and Canada with the fuelthere is not comparable.    Apart from the need to create long&quot;storage facilities, we would have to undertake urgent R &amp; D ^storage methods themselves.    Moreover, long-term storage woulfiprobably be abortive since we are unlikely to be able to disp0&apos;of spent fuel without reprocessing.    It seems to be better to pursue the technology of which we have some familiarity, andoffers a good prospect of ultimate disposal.3.     On the basis that we should reproces&quot;s oxide spent fuel &amp;\we should put ourselves in a position to do so as soon as V0i3We should then be able to deal with AGR fuel which deterioratewet storage, without the provision of alternative facilitiesiresearch into new storage methods.3.a) It is eminently sensible not to disperse the design teatf&apos;reassemble a new one some years hence. And it v/would  be pru^&apos;,to have to build the plant to a tight &apos; schedule for imine^full-scale production.5.b) These matters have been dealt with in 2 above.    If the 1were very big, it would be sensible to wait.    But they do n0 Jappear to be.    If, however, BNFL cannot design and build the Pto the tight standards required, then it will not go ahead.3. c) Dealt with in 2 above.Should reprocessing be at VJindscale?4. The balance of advantage favours location of THORP atIt is not an ideal site.   But the existence of the presentfacilities, and the store of know/ledge and operating experi0&quot;make v,&quot;ind scale the obvious location.   Emissions can be kept ;&apos;tolerable limits.    It is acceptable to the local planning a^and to most local people.
Should the plant be double the size in order to reprocess foreign fuel?5. The Japanese contract is very favourable.   The fact that theycontribute to capital costs makes it virtually risk-free. Theprofits should be substantial.6. a) The Inspectors view that the grant of permission v/ould have anon-proliferating effect rather than the reverse is in line withthe criteria for the UK attitude to the International Fuel CycleEvaluation (INFCE) programme presented by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in his paper EY(77)82,considered at EY(77)23rd on 16 December 1977 viz:-&quot;It would be unrealistic to expect that the demand forreprocessing of spent fuel can be eliminated.    Yet theacquisition by at NNWS of its own reprocessing facilities is a potential source of proliferation.    The risk of thishappening v/ould be reduced if NWS were in a position toprovide reprocessing services since any plutonium returnedwould be under the appropriate safeguards (paras 7 and 8).depend on the outcome of the BNFL planning applicationat V.rindscale on v/hich the Inspector1 s report is atpresent, awaited .116.b) The Inspectors close analysis of the Non-Proiiferation Treatybrings him to a conclusion v/hich fits with the UK approach above.It is also consistent with the UK position on INFCE.   The UK agreedto participate, without prejudice to any requirements of the UK&apos;snuclear programme v/hich might emerge during the period of INFCE.6.c) This is much more tenuous.    There is some oxide fuel reprocessingcapacity in the world already, in France, plus a little in Germanyand Japan, and there will be some at V,rindscale when the B204/B205unit is refurbished.   Whether that capacity would match the risk,given the amount of spent oxide fuel v/hich will have been producedthroughout the world by the end of, say, the next decade, must bea matter of conjecture.   Here, as at several other points in theReport, the Inspector comes down firmly on the side of prudence.
7.a) At the Inquiry BNFL. presented figures to show the envi^0impact of the discharges they hope to achieve,   broadly spe^^the discharges from the refurbished Magnox plant will be ^-eSthose from the existing Magnox plant.   The discharges from ^will be less than those from refurbished Magnox.    The combin^discharges from refurbished Magnox and THORP will still be Wthan those from existing Magnox.    The suggested levels oi aJ-are a very small fraction of the ICRP safety limits, but in -course the Department and MAFF will explore whether it is ?epracticable (BPM) to arrive at still lower figures for thestatutory authorisation.   To the extent that the plant is 0?e ^at less than its full planned throughput, the actual discha^6will be even lower.7.b) There appear to be no additional problems for the stor^Japanese oxide fuel.7.c) The consequence of reducing the emissions to the envi^is of course that more of the waste has to be stored. There... .-.aa : tihna3 hichlv active waste for    :........- rLui- vi&apos;^^The contract provides an option for the return of such was&quot;Japan.7.d) The &quot;spiking&quot; of plutonium appears a more likely foi^ tprotection for international movements at this stage, unies5 .the time the UK is engaged in fabricating fuel rods for J2P  f;.&apos;r reactors.   However, the form cannot be decided now and ^time these movements take place, alternative technical &quot;f1&quot; a*have been developed to make illegal diversion of plutoni^31 tmore difficult.    The Inspector is correct in saying (7.7/ &quot;..there is no provision in the proposed Japanese contract whientitle BNFL to insist on a return of plutonium to Japan a jirradiated fresh fuel rods.    But the Government after cons Jv/ith the Japanese Government could impose such a requiredit still appear desirable when the situation arises.7. e) See notes on 6.a) and 6.b) above.
8. If there v/ere to be no reprocessing of Japanese fuel BNFLwould not seek an immediate start on building a smaller plant.They would relate the timing of the new plant to the build-up ofAGR fuel from UK reactors.   Only a trickle of spent fuel is nowemerging from the first of the AGR reactors.    The undesirablefeature of the delay v/ould be that the design team v/ould bedispersed and there would be no opportunity for a considerable timeto acquire operating experience in this form of reprocessing. the inspector argues that this v/ould be imprudent given the need fora continuing nuclear programme.Specific recommendations concerning Security, Safety and Radio-logical Protection9. Nine of the fifteen peripheral recommendations in Chapter 7 are for my Department and/or RAFF.    They are mostly acceptable - some are already being implemented, eg specifying specific dischargelimits for each significant radionuclide, and publishing a com-prehensive annual survey of discharges.The appointment of a person or body to review security at wind scale-ould be a matter for the Home Secretary.    The appointment of aradiological protection &quot;ombudsman&quot; v/ould be for the Secretary ofState lor Social services.   Safety in operations at wind scale isfor the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the Health and SafetyCommission, as is the current review of their methods of workingrecommended by the Royal Commission.    Emergency planning and the reform of the local liaison committee are matters for BNFL and theCumbria County Council.    They are all recommendations v/hich can befollowed up after and separately from the decision on thisapplication.
