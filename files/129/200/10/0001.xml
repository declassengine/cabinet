KTKODUCTION1.    The purpose of the Final Act of Helsinki isfundamentally long-term;   it is a charter and code ofbehaviour for what we hope in time will become a more normal and open relationship between governments and peoples in Eastern Europe as well as between East and west.     The aim of the Belgrade meeting was not only to^view progress in implementing the Final Act, but also* make possible another atep forward in the evolution ofthis relationship.2-    In a speech at Chicago in September 1977 the Foreignend Commonwealth Secretary said &quot;Detente heightens theoompetition between the Eastern and Western ways of life.contact and communication grow between countries and peoples in the East/West dialogue, so the system on eachsi*e faces fundamental challenges from the system on theother ..... The ideological struggle is fundamental todetente and it has to be steadfastly pursued..... *etfundamental point which has to be recognised is thati,: is no use asking for rapid change.considerations which underlay the British Government&apos;sbroach to and preparations for the Belgrade CSCE follow-UP meeting, the background to which is set out at Annex A.3*    At Belgrade there was first a preparatory meeting from15 June to 5 August 1977, which drew up the agenda and rules0f Procedure.   During this stage the aim of the British and pr^ner delegations was to ensure full scope for a thoroughof views and mutual criticism about ^^J^J^0f       Final Act of Helsinki by all countries whxch subscribed/ to

The main meeting began on 4 October with a round ofspeeches by heads of delegations.   Lord Goronwy-Robert6,Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,represented the UK.    The text of his speech is.attached at annex B.    The first phase after the opening speeches consisted of a review of implementation.    This lasted through most oCNovember, and the meeting then addressed itself to new proposals, ie to proposals for the improvement ofimplementation.   Finally, just before Christmas, attention wadturned to the task of trying to record in an agreed tJoeUinejthe nature and substance of the discussions.i5. The first stage was the most successful of the bjirce.There was a vigorous exchange on deficiencies in ijnplemcn.il : ,n1The debate on new proposals was lively but inconclusive. the attempt to draft a substantial agreed document was a CaiJUicft-The following paragraphs analyse the meeting in greaterUK OBJECTIVES AT BELGRADE HKETTHG6. Apart from the general aim described in the quotationin paragraph 1 above, the British delegation Went to Belgi &apos;d0*with three specific objectives:(a) to check thoroughly but realistically how the/States
States which signed the Helsinki Final Act had been carrying out the commitments they undertook.(b) to get all the States which took part in theCSCE to re-affirm that all these commitments must be fully and scrupulously carried out.(O        to get agreement by all participants on 3omePractical proposals designed to put more life intothe execution of the Final Act.
THE REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION7. Once the round of opening speeches vaip over, tho rovieviof implementation started in plenary sessions.    Tho review was then continued in detail in working groups until the endof the third week in November.    The British delegation Used the review to comment in detail on the ways in^vhich some other participating States, notably the Soviet Union nnd its Al.ll!.&quot;,were failing to carry out the provisions of the Final Act.The British delegation also gave a full account of the UK&apos;sown performance.   Throughout this review the UK acted in clonecooperation with other members of tho e.c. and the NATO AJJ Lancet8. The British approach duringjthis part of the meeting was ; Vofrank and detailed in listing those points in the record qother States which required criticism and colled for iropro    v n&apos; .but to avoid heightening the tension by concentrating oriindividual cases where practical results were unlike!;/. in following this approach, the UK had in mind that tho. best hopeof persuading the Soviet Union and its partners to linfceoperhaps improve their perform.-men was to formulate criticisms and prop &quot;for improvement in a way which related them to thoof the Final Act^and 4ju leavtejmoro specific representation&apos;&apos;   &apos; \rthe usual government to govorumoui. channels.    It was iTpplTciiin this approach - and the UK delegation made this cienr at hhestart - that the UK itself would not object to the discussion at/Belgrade
Belgrade of anything in its own record of carrying outthe Final Act, including alleged breaches of human rightsprovisions.9. The aim was thus to test the receptivity of the soviet union and its Allies to reasoned and reasonable criticism.It was only if there was no response at oil that the UK andother Western delegations expected the temperature of the debate to rise.    Throughout, it was necessary to strike theright balance.   Western delegations had to give cli &quot;expression to their assessment of tho performance of Eantet&quot;European Governments and yet to stop short of angry axth-unproductive exchanges.    It was important not to endanger &apos;!whole CSCE process which has brought undoubtod benefits trt10. In the event the Soviet Union arid its Allies did notrespond as satisfactorily to Western criticisms as had been hoped.   They refused to acknowledge shortcomings arid bng &apos;( in a dialogue.   Nonetheless, the review book place,    i; &apos; icriticisms of all aspects of the record of the Soviet union and other Eastern European Governments were made- TheUnion and its Allies stayed at the meeting and listened tothese criticisms, many of which touched on areas highlysensitive for them.
11. This itself i^ an important new event; in East-Ventrelations.   The principle has now been established that ailCSCE States have the right to comment on the way other signatory States are carrying out their undertakings underthe Final Act.   The Soviet Union and its Allies frequentlyinvoked the principle of non-intervention inthe internal affairs of other States in order to claim that criticism directed atthem was impermissible.   But the firm insistence of V/esterricountries on the right to criticise won the day, as thecontinued presence of the Soviet delegation tacitly c        \ cd*It may in time be possible to develop this into the dialoguewhich was missing on this occasion.PHOPOSAIS FOR IMPROVING IMPLEMENTATION12. From the last week of November until 22 December, theneeting, in its subsidiary working groups, discussed 1proposals for improving the implementations of the Final Act.The UK delegation again played a prominent and constructivipart, co-sponsoring together with oth&apos; p Wosterijpountries atotal of 22 proposals, many of which were of British origin-These proposals formed a carefully balanced package desiito build on the Final Act   constructively in those areas wheree*perience had shown that progress was most necessary. Theiare set out in detail at Annex 0.A3.
13.    The UK attached particular importance to some of theseproposals, ie.Basket I    (principles and measures relating to security in Europ- A proposal designed to support and, where necessary,justify the activities of those groups which had setthemselves up throughout Europe inorder to play *a partalongside governments in implementing the Final Act.This proposal recognised the right of individuals tohelp Governments in their task of ensuring that theFinal Act was put into ef f ect^ ie to monitor the performance of Governments.

THE BELGRADE CONCLUDING DOCUMENT14.      The British delegation and its partners wanted aconcluding document which would do three things:(a) contain a full and accurate account of thework done by the meeting;(b) reaffirm the commitment of all the Statestaking part to carry out the provisions of theFinal Act;(c) contain proposals for better implementation of the Final Act which would be of benefit to individuals in both East and West.When in December, the meeting turned to the drafting of afinal document, the UK along with a number of other Wostorr-li *J J. n l  f \countries tabled a text on the review of implementsI ;on(Annex D).    This text was deliberately drawn up in morlci    - ,unprovocative language, in the hope of achieving a consensus.But it set out clearly those areas Ln which the performance of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries incarrying out the provisions of the Final Act had beenunsatisfactory.15*      Discussion on the concluding document resumed inJanuary after the Christmas recess.    The Soviet Union nod nnumber of Eastern European countries took a negative andunconstructive line.   The Russians made clear their inability
to accept any text along the liner. o.f that -r&apos;i, Anner P.They then tabled on 17 January a draft concluding document which made no reference to shortcomings in implementation,and no concession at all to the Western proposals for improving implementation.16.       On 1 February the neutral and non-aligned delegationsintervened.    They put forward a draft designed to be a compromise between all the views put forward up to that point.Western delegations immediately made clear their readiness bonegotiate on the basis of this draft, while havingreservations about a number of the points in it.    But theSoviet Union refused to follow suit.    The Russians subsequent!tabled three amended versions of their proposal of 17 Januaryithe last on 17 February, without making any substantial changes in their position.   Western, noutrnJ and non-alir,&quot;delegations were forced to conclude that there was no chanceof reaching agreement on a document of substance. Westerndelegations therefore tabled on 21 February, for purelydemonstrative purposes, a text (Annex E) netting out their view of what would have been an accurate reflection of thecourse of the meeting, fair to all parties.   This text, whichagain was couched in moderate language -in order to demonstra^the constructive approach of Western delegations, none the I *stressed the importance which the UK and other western countries attach to human rights issues and included a numberof the new proposals to which the UK attached primary/importance.
importance.17. The concluding document eventually agreed (Annex F)is a considerable disappointment for the UK.     It achieves onlythe second of the three aims set out above (to reaffirm the commitment of all the States taking part to carry out theprovisions of the Final Act).     It does not reflect adequatelythe detailed review of implementation which took place nor thenew proposals put forward.     The British assessment of the concluding document and of the Belgrade meeting as a whole was expressed by Lord Goronwy-tfoberts in his concluding speech atBelgrade on 9 March, the text of which is at Annex B.18. All that emerges is a narrow range of agreement on thefuture of the CSCE process.     There is to be a further meetingon the pattern of the Belgrade meeting, to take place in madrid on 11 November 1980.     This will be preceded by apreparatory meeting at Madrid beginning on 9 September 1980.The concluding document records also that between Belgradeand Madrid there will be three subsidiary meetings:   the first to consider a Swiss proposal for the peaceful settlement of disputes, the second to discuss the establishment of a&quot;scientific forum&quot; and the third to discuss ways of promotingcooperation between the CSCE signatory States in theMediterranean area.     The first two of these meetings hadalready been agreed in the Helsinki Final Act.
conclusions^.     Because of the failure to achieve consensus on a substantialdocument, the measurable product of the Belgrade meeting is meag ,There has not been a step forward beyond the Final Act of HelsinThe Soviet Union has shown that it is not yet prepared to op^1itself to broad or thorough implementation of the Final Act.But it has been prepared to reaffirm, in common with the other participating States, that it recognises the validity and import-ance of the Final Act and is committed to carry out its provisionSThe CSCE process has not been noticeably advanced, but it remained^9in being.   The development of detente is slower than was hoped,but the CSCE process is still there and will continue to be pursued in the two and a half year interval between Belgrade andMadrid.2.0.     In spite of the disappointment over the final document, tneBelgrade meeting nevertheless had significance and value.2-1.     First, the preparation for the meeting during 1977 concen-trated the minds of participating States on the need to shovwillingness to honour some at least of the commitments madeHelsinki   Some progress was made in carrying out these commitments before the Belgrade meeting began and while it was in session.   A start has been made with confidence-buildinr, mn.&apos;iL&apos;&quot;reSon both sides of the line of division in Europe; many famH;?reunions and marriages have been permitted and other personalproblems of acute concern to individuals have been solved invarious Eastern European States; some progress has been made i11 ^relaxing regulations for entry visas; the Soviet Union has Krilthe cost of the fees which it charges to its citizens for ex&apos;1,visas; some Eastern European countries have abolished the req&quot;.ment for visitors to purchase a minimum amount of foreign cur1 *for each day they spend there; and small increases have bccu mby some Eastern&quot; European countries in the numbers of Westernnewspapers imported.   These are modest gains, but they bring ^benefit to a large number of individuals and they are a promistart.M^% .    Second, as explained in paragraph      above, the right ofparticipating States to freely criticise one another&apos;s/performance
performance in areas covered by the Final Act has been frimly established.   Soviet attempts to argue that such criticismsconstitute interference in the internal affairs of the criticisedcountries.have been rejected as contrary to the provisions of theFinal Act itself.Third, the new ideas put forward at the Belgrade meeting in the form of new proposals for better implementation of theHelsinki Final Act have focussed attention on the areas whereimprovement is most needed, and will remain on the agenda for future discussion, even though no agreement could be reached onany of them at Belgrade.2-4-,   Finally, the decision to hold a further meeting in Madridin 1980 has set a target for a second checkpoint in the CSCEprocess.   This should serve as a stimulus for all participatingStates to make fresh efforts to carry out their commitment,reaffirmed at Belgrade, to implement in full the provisions ofthe Helsinki Final Act.    In other words, all concerned haveagreed to leave the door open to the process of criticism endbargaining for improvement.The British Government, together with the other Governmentsof Western Europe an  North America, will continue to monitorcarefully the way in which the Final Act is implemented evory-where in Europe.    They will be guided by its provisions in all their bilateral and multilateral contacts with other signatoryStates between now and the Madrid meeting.    The Government willcontinue to promote the ideas for improving implementation whichthey put forward 491 supported during the Belgrade meeting. Inparticular, they will continue to insist that the provisions ofthe Final Act which relate to the rights of the individual endhuman contr&quot;ts should be fully implemented in all participating countries.   Without this detente cannot command popular support.This view has been made unequivocally clear to the SovietGovernment in the speeches and debates at Belgrade.   It hasalso been communicated consistently and insistently in more direct terms to Soviet representatives in London and in Moscow.

OPENING STATEMENT DELIVERED ON 6 OCTOBER 1977I am delighted to represent Her Majesty&apos;s Government at this importantmeeting May I first pay a special tribute here to our Yugoslav hosts who have undertaken the heavy role of organising the meeting and are tackling it withtheir usual vigour and efficiency.This is the first comprehensive meeting to discuss co-operation and security in Europe since the Final Act was signed at Helsinki I welcome this opportunity to describe my Governments views on the subjects under dis-cussion and to set out our attitudes to this meeting. Our policy combinesPragmatism with idealism; it is inspired by ideals which, enshrined as they arem tfie UN Charter and other international instruments, represent mankindshigher aspirations, as well as realism in their achievement.Detente is and must remain indivisible and therefore cannot be confined toturope. Our deliberations here reflect our concern to see stability and peace in Europe but their effects reach much wider, for what happens in Europe andits example and influence affect the whole world. At the same time, it *essential to see this meeting in its correct perspective. Immensely importantJit,WaS;,!, He,s,nki Conference dealt with no more than a pan of detenteand East/West relations.At this meeting we shall not be directly concerned with disarmament orarms control questions. Talks on these intensely difficult and complex prob-lems. which are of the greatest importance and in which Her Majesty&apos;*Government take the keenest interest, are continuing elsewhere. But we hopeour talks here will contribute to a better and healthier international atmosphere-pnere so that by establishing a positive, constructive and frank dialogue *ccan enhance the chances of useful progress at Geneva and Vienna. In addition the Final Act itself gives us the mandate to develop and enlarge &quot;measuresaimed at strengthening confidence&quot;.While one may not regard the Final Act as a legally binding document,it is nevertheless a firm commitment. It is a kind of charter which all itssignatories have pledged themselves to observe through a major statement oftheir political will, which all share, to overcome the problems arising fromthe division of Europe after the Second World War. Every signatory is pledged to implement every one of its provisions. Any failure to implement its pro-visions anywhere in Europe injures us all. It is important not merely mEast/West relations but in relations between every state which signed thenal Act and between every individual citizen of those states. It is relevant to all the major political problems of Europe. It also naturally applies to ^jj1.0which already benefits from the Quadripartite Agreement of 3 September 1*This meeting is therefore not just an East/West occasion. The neUl^and non-aligned countries have a vital and much valued role to play. &amp;saw at Geneva and Helsinki and indeed at the Preparatory Meeting in ^elf^3in June and July. The principle of consensus, reflecting the sovereign equipment ^of all participants, has emphasised the importance of every country andlook forward with pleasure to working closely with all of them.
Like any truly great undertaking the CSCE was never expected to achieve its objectives overnight; it was and will continue to be a long-term process.This meeting at Belgrade is the first checkpoint. But after more than twoyears, the peoples of Europe have every right to look for substantial progressw every field covered by the Final Act. Our task here is to sustain and increase its forward momentum taking due account of what has been achievedUP to now. Public opinion expects us to achieve tangible results. My delegationwill therefore be an active and thorough participant in this meeting. We shallat the same time be even-handed in our approach to the Final Act and everyaspect of the work of the meeting.It will be our first major objective to see that the meeting fulfils its commit-rnent to examine thoroughly and constructively what has been done up to now to implement the Final Act. We can only build for the future in the lightof a realistic and sober study of the present and recent past. The willingness of all participating states to implement the Final Act fully must be regardedas a touchstone of their sincerity and of their support for detente. In certain areas, there has been some progress; but I must frankly express my Govern-ment&apos;s profound disappointment at the meagre level of progress achieved in others. Mindful of the commitments entered into at Helsinki we must objec-lively review what has been achieved and what remains to be done in all theareas covered by the Final Act.Detente is not only a matter of relations between national governments.It is also designed to serve peace by encouraging co-operation and contacts between  peoples, between  non-governmental organisations and betweenuidividuals. We look essentially for an ever freer flow of information, move-ment and contact between individual human beings. It is to human beingsthat human rights belong. I am very glad that so many previous speakers have emphasised this essential aspect of our work. It is misleading, even dangerous to think of human rights only in the abstract, forgetting the individual men andvyomen involved. It is their interests which should be paramount here and weshould strive to further those interests with imagination, humanity and withrealism. We cannot emphasise too strongly that the essential role of the Finalct is to improve relations between individuals as well as between governments,ne of the most encouraging results of Helsinki was the publication and wide^semination of the Final Act among the individual citizens of the signatoryates. Individuals and non-governmental organisations have a vital role inj-nsuring the successful application of the Final Act, and in our discussions we^ust all take this fully into account. I and other Heads of Delegations here areIj CQurse representatives of governments. But in what we say we shall all. IPe. be reflecting the views of a vast range of individuals and organisations.bet^10 PurPose of &quot;human detente&quot; is to extend the margin of toleranceWeen people of goodwill. Tolerance is an essential lubricant within anya fiIel^&apos; anc* even morc so between individuals, groups and nations. It impliesand? ^P601 *or 10(1 opinions of others, even when they differ from our own,but - lr!ose wno dissent from the received wisdom. This is not always easy,p ls in our view the essential foundation for a true and lasting detente.qq !arnentary and public opinion in my own country has shown a deep andtwuing interest in the humanitarian objectives of the Final Act. The British
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Dr Owen, expressedthis in a recent speech in Chicago when he said:&quot;Our concern for human rights is .... an integral part of our foreignpolicy throughout the world; and as far as East/West relations are con-cerned, a serious and imaginative attempt to raise detente to a new and higher level&quot;.In our view all sections of the Final Act are of equal significance and our approach to the CSCE must be balanced and even-handed. My Government,are, for instance, very keen to see progress made in implementing that part ofthe Final Act which is generally known as Basket II. The development ofco-operation in the economic field is obviously essential if the detente processis to be carried forward in a truly comprehensive way. One thinks especiallyhere of the value of commercial exchanges. One of the major concerns of the uk Delegation during this meeting will be to press for progress in making areality of the Final Act&apos;s provisions covering contacts and facilities for business-men working in each others&apos; countries and the availability and exchange ofeconomic and commercial information. Another will be to continue to expressour strong support for the Economic Commission for Europe as the appro-priate forum for multilateral follow-up on the matters covered by Basket II;we have ourselves played, and will continue to play, an active part in its work.A further major and separate objective of ours at this meeting will be toconsider means of making more effective the implementation of the Final Act.But this cannot be done in a way which would undermine the Final Act itself.We must therefore seek ways of improving the application of the Final Act inthe light of experience. At the same time we must be careful not to disturb itspresent balance. My delegation intends to play a constructive and positive role in this process, as we have done from the very beginning.The United Kingdom believes that its record in the implementation of theprovisions of the Final Act is second to none. We have engaged in numerousbilateral and multilateral consultations since Helsinki and have taken every opportunity to implement the Final Act. We have given support to multilateralfollow-up in the Economic Commission for Europe and UNESCO. We have played a full part in the activities of the Council of Europe which makes aunique contribution to inter-European co-operation. We have played a positivepart as members of the European Economic Community in its contributions to East/West relations notably through the promotion of co-operation in tradematters between the e.c. and CMEA Member states. I fully endorse what has been said by previous speakers representing over governments which are members of the e.c. about the special role played hereby the distinguishedleader of the Belgian Delegation as representing also the current presidency of the e.c..It is true to say that we started from a high level in our national administra-tive practices; nevertheless, where necessary we have taken steps in order tobring them into line with the Final Act. Our attitude is not one of com-placcncy and we remain ready to listen to any comments or suggestions whichothers present may wish to make where they think proper. It may be thatthere are points in our practice where we should make further improvements.4
We shall listen to the views of others here and reply to them fairly and fullywithout rancour. I am sure that other participants will approach the meeting in the same spirit.In the United Kingdom there has been widespread interest in the Final Actamong members of the public, all kinds of groups and organisations, com-mercial firms and in Parliament. Both Houses of Parliament have held fulldebates on CSCE, and a Parliamentary Committee has carried out a lengthystudy of it. and published a full and helpful report. A distinguished group ofPrivate individuals set up on their own initiative a monitoring body, theHelsinki Review Group. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have welcomed andencouraged this interest by publishing White Papers and by organising seminarsand discussions which have made a notable contribution to the process ofinvolving the public in our increasingly open style of government. The text of the Final Act has been freely available in the United Kingdom since its publication and it has been discussed in great detail in our press and media.Mr Chairman. Fellow Delegates, the United Kingdom enters these talks ina spirit of openness and mutual respect, not of confrontation. If this Meetingis to succeed, this must be the approach of all participants.As I have already suggested, progress in our talks here can play a positivefole in arms control and disarmament talks elsewhere which in turn couldcontribute directly to securing the peace of Europe and the world.

,ij a hukber of detailed provisions, the csce process itself is croiinjed 3y the fin al act. it 13 a complex structure- cause it represents a bargain between the interestsof all the 33 countries v/ho participated. that bargain mustbj kept, and none of our governments can enjoy the benefits - , .cf one part of the 3apga1n without accepting theof the other parts,the importance of the belgrade meeting has been that it has provided the first chance to assess progress since helsinki,i set out the united kingdoms objectives in some detail,w chairman, in my opening speech, j stated them that it v/ould be -our first major objective to see that the meeting fulfilledits commitment to examine what had been done up to now to implement the final act. i stated our disappointment at lackof progress in certain areas and the importance we attach to the view that detente is a matter not just for relationsbetween governments but also between peoples and ncn-governmemtalorganisations. i stated that it was also our objective to consider in the light of experience whether ways could be found of making^re effective the implementation of the final act, withoutim any way undermining or upsetting its balance. i stated ourssltef that our own record of implementation of the final-act&apos;a&apos;as second to none but that we were not complacent and wouldInsider carefully any criticisms which were made, i stated&quot;Nat if the meeting were to succeed the talks must be conducted&amp;U spirit of openness and mutual respect rather than confront-^chairman, this was our approach to belgrade. the british-Legation come here well av:are of the dangers of polemics,- n&amp;MlNED to secure a properly balanced OOlirCiKNGC dealingWTH all aspects of the&apos;final act rather than to pick cut^rtaih FEATURES for scrutiny at the expense of others, we came,*d i must state this frankly, not without some apprehension.??jbuc OP i NIC!  Ifl THE m and els E&apos;;:-&apos;ERE 111 europe HAS become^CREASlHGUV inclined TO dou3t wIlETHER detente was being,?:&apos;terpreted Li ANYTH i NC like the sv--e WAY in THE two halvesc? europe. PiCPi-E WERE, for example, finding  it hard to understandparticularly after the signature of the final act, certain^TERil countries HAVE felt THE NEED TO build Up very rapidlySiE Er-;:ctive::ESS OF TNuJR military FORCES at A time WHEN THE^RJDITURE of western countries ON defence WAS largely static.
QTKgSS enquired WHat has happened to the vii TH principle of THfc-final act pledging signatory states to uphold hum am rightsand fundamental freedoms and whAT was happen img to the commitment in basket ill OF the FlifAL act JO the freer MOVEKEfit OF people;:;d ideas, but my hope was that this meeting would enable us &apos;to approach these last two questions rationally and cqntructively,like other delegations at this meeting, we were able to point to areas where in our view ^plementatign v/as deficiemt amdv.mere improvement v/as needed, we drew attention to shortcomingsin the areas of human rights, the facilitation! qf free?, movementof peoples amd ideas. in the military sphere we noted that someco-titrles had been considera3ly more liberal than others in theirimplementation of conf incidence-bu ild img measures, iii the economicarea we pointed out that adequate economic and commercialinformation were still not universally available, amd on a widerplane that there was still no common approach to the problemsof developing coumtri es,it was a pity that some of the countries of eastern europe persisted in regarding these criticisms aspolemical attacks on themselves amd were not willing to be ascandid in the ir replies as we would have liked. i simply dorst see how one can have amy worthwhile exchange of views onthe implementation of the provision of the final act without saying what is wrong as well as what is right. my delegationnever pretended that faults were all on one side and we soughtconsistently for a balanced approach.ifl particular, despite the importance which it is well-knownwe attach to them, we have never claimed that human rightsare the alpha and omega of the final act, it 13 however a factthat they are an integral part of it and that if these provisions are ignored then-the delicate balance of the final actis affected, and - because of the justified expect at ions ofpddlic opinion in many of our countries - detent itself is affected. v.e h&apos;five 2ee*j told by some delegations that, wheneverWE T/lK ASCOT KL&apos;MA&quot;?J rights, we are indulg iNC in propaganda,or :e; :g :-cle :sal&quot;, or trying to distract attention from otherpasts of the final act, such allegations show a lack of .under-stfjidihg of the realities. no one can get away from the fact thatthe final act contains important provisions adout human rights,and rhs leaders cr every one of cur countries have assentedTO **-e2e prov-iSftfjS.   if ?^ore attention HAS been paid here to
these thau to some other parts of the final act,  it is 3ecauseIE record of some participating states has been least sat1s-factory in this area.  it is also because,  in the eyes of publicopinion, respect for human rights is All essential element 1mDETENTE. as my foreign secretary , dr owen said last year:&quot; our concern for human rights is not a diversionary tact1c:kor a provocative campaign, nor an attempt to sabotage detente.c;i the contrary,  it is am integral part of our fore i cm fol1cyThroughout the world: and as far as east/west relations are^kerned, A serious and imaginative attempt to raise detenteA new and higher level. there is no going back on the human rights commitment.  it is here to stay. &quot;WE must all recognise that genuine public concern for humanr,ghts is A major determinant of western foreign policy.I would add TWO FURTHER POINTS ABOUT THE REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION,PlRST   TO PLEAD THE PRINCIPLE OF MON-INTERVENTION AS AM EXCUSE FOR*T TAKING ACTION OR AVOIDING CRITICISM IS MISLEADING AND ALSOSHOWS A FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE FINAL ACT. MY^OVERWENT SUPPORTS THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERVENTION, OTHERWISE.* WOULD NOT HAVE AGREED TO IT AT HELSINKI. BUT FOR ANYONE TO CLAIM^AT IT OVERRIDES COMMITMENTS IN THOSE AREAS OF THE FINAL ACT WHICHCtlE COUNTRY OR ANOTHER MAY FIND TEMPORARILY INCONVENIENT IS TOMAKE-;NOMSENSE OF THE DOCUMENT AS A WHOLE AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.S!*OND   THE FINAL ACT SPELLS OUT CLEARLY THE RELEVANT AND POSITIVE^EOF GOVERNMENTS,  INSTITUTIONS, organisations AND PERSONS IN^&quot;TRIBUTING TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF our cooperation. this^ECTS the VIEWPOINT, crucial to MY own co&apos;jntry&apos;s approach, thatDETENTE is rot just a question OF relations BETWEEN governmentse&apos;jt involves private citizens as well, the british government haswelcomed ant comments on our record of implementation put forward BYDividual- or croups, no government is perfect, and no governmentbe SURE 7--T ITS OWN record is so above criticism THAT it camsrord to DENY itself the help of its own citizens in purging itst&apos;&quot;3x OF i cement AT ION.?1* chairman   THE united kingdom made a vigorous and constructive^RIBUTioi a1 so WHEN the MEETING TURNED TO THE UORXAKG out ofv&apos;1&apos;&apos; proposals for better IMPLEMENTATION of THE FINAL act. and iv,as surprised AND disappointed at the reception which A HUfrBEF.
OF EASIER;. COUNTRIES GAVE TO 0&apos;JR PROPOSALS,  I HAVE ALREADY STATU^THE CRITERIA WE APPLIED IN PUTT 1 uG THESE FORWARD. THE 22 PROPOSALSCO-SPONSOREP BY THIS DELEGATION FORM A CAREFULLY BALANCED PACKAGEDESIGNED TO COVER ALL THE MAIN AREAS OF THE FiNAL ACT. ALL THESE. WERE PRACTICAL PROPOSALS, FULLY  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL ACTAND WITH THE AGENDA DECIDED AT THE PREPARATORY MEETING, MANY OFTHEM FOCUSED PARTICULARLY ON THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN RESPECT FORTHE RIGHTS OF  INDIVIDUALS.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVEBEEN EQUALLY WILLING TO CONSIDER SERIOUS PROPOSALS, EQUALLYwell-FOUNDED ON THE FINAL ACT, PUT FORWARD BY OTHERS.HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF EASTERN COUNTRIES WERE UNWILLING TO discuss these PROPOSALS SERIOUSLY, LET ALOME TO DRAFT on THEIR BASIS.THIS POLICY SEEMS TO US INDEFENSIBLE,   IN TERMS of OUR SHAREDOBJECTIVES HERE AT BELGRADE. DESPITE THIS, THE uk AND OTHER western countries CONSISTENTLY SHOWED THEMSELVES WILLING TO COMPROMISE ANDTO DRAFT ON THE BASIS OF PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY THE SOVIET union and OTHER EASTERN COUNTRIES. WE HAVE LOOKED in VAIN FOR any similar SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE in TEXTS PUT FORWARD BY THE soviet union. NOT A SINGLE ONE OF OUR PROPOSALS is ADEQUATELY covered in THESE.THE DOCUMENT EVENTUALLY AGREED HERE, THE END PRODUCT OF ALL THE LONGDEBATES,   IS SHORT AND THIN.  IT IS A SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT. ITREFLECTS NEITHER THE DETAILED REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION NOR THEMEASURES ADVOCATED TO  IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FUTURE.   I MUSTPLACE ON RECORD MY GOVERNMENTS DEEP REGRET THAT THE SOVIET union and OTHER EASTERN COUNTRIES RESISTED THE INCLUSION OF EVEN MILDLYCRITICAL REFERENCES TO IMPLEMENTATION AND WITHHELD CONSENSUS&apos; TOS-ECiFIC :--SASJSES proposed FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN IMPLEMENTATIONINCLUDING T-E vEETERN PROPOSALS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHT OF THEINDIVIDUAL /ND HL&apos;;AN CONTACTS.SHORTLY DEFO-E CHRISTMAS WHEN THE MEETING BEGAN TO TURN ITSATTENTION TO THE CONCLUDING PHASE, TO THE DRAFTING OF A FINALrOv-ENT, THE j . 1TED KINGDOM DELEGATION WAS,  AS YOU KNOW, AMONGTHE LEADERS IN TPYING TO ENSURE THAT YOUR DEBATES WERE CROWNED BYA FiNAL DOCUMENT Cr REAL SUBSTANCE- WE MADE CLEAR AT THAT TIME,k I. -

PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF BELGIUM,CANADA,    DENMARK,   FRANCE,   FEDERAL   REPUBLIC OFGERMANY, IRELAND, ITALY, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHER-LANDS, NORWAY AND THE UNITED KINGDOMThe member States of the European Community listed above as well asCanada and Norway propose the inclusion of the following text in the con-cluding document of the Belgrade Meeting 1977. The text is designed to fill the second section of Part III of the &quot;Outline of Concluding Document&quot;contained in the proposal submitted by the delegation of France (BM/61).Representatives of the participating States exchanged views on the imple-mentation of the provisions of the Final Act signed at Helsinki on 1 August1975, and noted the following points.Questions relating to security in EuropeDeclaration on Principles guiding relations between participating Statesmatters related to giving effect to certain of the above principles the participating States noted that certain Principles had not been fuWobserved. In this context they had a comprehensive and frank exchangeviews on the Principle concerning respect for human rights and fundamcn afreedoms including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belie -Relations between the governments of the participating States had in gen^raddeveloped in a positive manner, but institutions, organizations and persons nin some cases been prevented from playing the relevant and positive raccorded to them by the Final Act itself. The participating States recogniz jothat the exchange of differing views on the application of the Principles naitself contributed to better understanding of the Final Act and its purpose ^They emphasised that the Principles are all of primary significance aimportant for their common security and co-operation. Any failure to app yany of them causes damage to the development of normal and friendly relatioand co-operation between them and between their peoples.Document of Confidence-Building Measures and Certain Aspects of security and DisarmamentThe participating States noted that some progress had been made in strengthening of confidence among them as a result of implementation ^States of the minimum requirements set out in that section of the Finaldealing with confidence-building measures. They noted that there had ^important differences in the manner in which some of these measures had ^implemented.  In particular, they observed that a number of ^^-^gimplemented certain provisions in a liberal fashion, especially by noti ytheir smaller-scale manoeuvres, by giving observers full and adequate opP ^tunities to follow the manoeuvres to which they had been invited an ^providing ample information when notifying manoeuvres. While noting20
no major military movement had been notified, they observed that some states had reported troop movements associated with manoeuvres.In exchanging views on questions relating to disarmament and general considerations, the participating States expressed concern that greater progress towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective mlern^&quot;tional control had not been achieved in the relevant negotiations. They noted,however, the improved prospects for progress on important matters resultingfrom recent increased activity in the field of disarmament and arms control.Co-operation in the field of Economics, of Science and Technology and of the environment the participating States acknowledged that mutual trade had grown in thepast two years, but it still did not reflect its full potential. Some limited improve-ments were noted, but there was a need for a greater effort to ensure the fullunilateral implementation of the relevant provisions of the Final Act. particu-larly in the area of business contacts and facilities as well as in the furnishing ofeconomic and commercial information. The participating States discussed thegrowth of co-operation in science and technology and in the environment, andnoted the need to increase direct contacts between scientists and specialists inthese areas. They expressed appreciation for the work undertaken within the framework of the ECE related to the possible convening of a high level meetingon the environment.They noted with concern the disequilibrium currently existing withinEurope in the field of transport. They also noted with concern the repercussions-sions of the recent evolution of the world economy on the solution of a numberof economic, social, human and other problems in the field of migrant labour.They discussed the continuing co-operation between host countries andcountries of origin and recognised the need to further intensify that co-operation.Throughout their discussions of the economic provisions of the Final Act,Participating States firstly recognised the valuable role played by the economic commission for Europe as the main vehicle for multilateral implementation.They also recognised the continuing need to take fully into account not only^e differences in their levels of economic development but also the interestsof these countries among them which are developing from the economic pointof view. Furthermore in the wider international dimension, they noted theJack so far of a joint approach to help solve the problems of developing countries throughout the world.Questions relating to Security and Co-operation in the MediterraneanThe participating States exchanged views on questions relating to security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean, taking account of the contributionsJ^de by the non-participating Mediterranean States. They noted that effortsnad been made on a bilateral and multilateral basis in order to promote thedevelopment of good-neighbourly relations. They expressed, however, their concern at the persisting tension in the region. They recognised with satisfac-uon that some positive results had been achieved in contributing to theGnomic development of the non-participating Mediterranean States.
Coperation in Humanitarian and Other FieldsThe participating States noted some progress in facilitating freer movement and contacts among individuals, including cases involving family ties, familyreunification and marriage between citizens of different states. But they expressed concern at the number of cases in these areas which remainunresolved, despite expectations that the general practice would reflect the favourable, positive and humanitarian spirit of the relevant provisions of theFinal Act. They also noted that notwithstanding certain improvements in facilitating wider travel, considerable restrictions still remain on exit from certain participating States.They recognised that little progress had been made in facilitating the freerand wider dissemination of information, particularly as regards access in someparticipating States to newspapers and printed publications from others. Theynoted that efforts had been made to improve working conditions for journalists,but that much still remained to be done in this field. The participating Statesnoted some progress in the development of official cultural exchanges, butacknowledged that much remained to be done to implement specific provisionsof the Final Act in the cultural field, in particular the removal of obstacles tocontact and communication between persons engaged in cultural activities.Similar difficulties were noted in the fields of education and science. In this area there had been an increase in the volume of exchanges under bilateralcultural agreements and programmes, but this had not been matched byprogress in improving working conditions for visiting scholars and scientists,or making it easier for them to establish direct contact with one another.22

They also examined proposals concerningthe above questions and the definition of the appropriate modalities for the holding of other meetings in conformity with all the provisions of the chapterof the Final Act concerning the follow-up to the Conference.After the adoption of the present document, closing statements were madeby the representatives of the participating States in open Plenary meetings.IIThe representatives of the participating States stressed the great political significance of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, whichinitiated a new stage in the efforts of their States directed to increasing security,further developing co-operation, and bringing about a climate of confidence,mutual understanding and justice in Europe.They also stressed the fundamental importance they attach to the continua-tion and further development of dftente as well as the necessity to intensifyefforts to make it an increasingly viable and comprehensive process, of universalsignificance, reflecting their sincere desire to contribute to peace, security,justice and co-operation in Europe and the world as a whole.Noting the detente, of which the relations between participating States forman integral part, has continued since the adoption of the Final Act in spite of problems and obstacles encountered, they expressed the determination of theirStates to intensify their efforts to achieve the aims set by the Conference. Inthis respect they stressed the role of the CSCE in the process of detente, theFinal Act and its implementation being essential for the development of this process.It was recognized that the thorough exchange of views on the implementation of the provisions of the Final Act constituted in itself a valuable contribution towards the achievement of the aims set by the CSCE.Divergent views were expressed as to the degree of implementation of theFinal Act reached so far by each of the participating States; it was noted thatencouraging progress had been made in the process of implementation, while25
important shortcomings, also including cases of non-implementation, calling for further action still exist.The participating States agreed that much remains to be done in order togive full effect to the Final Act. They therefore expressed their resolve to pursue their efforts fully to implement all its provisions through unilateral,bilateral and multilateral action. They will pay due regard to the provisions,where appropriate in the application of their legislation.They also noted that governments, organizations, institutions and personsall have a relevant and positive role to play if the multiple benefits of co-opcration are to be fully secured. They recognized that institutions, organiza-tions and persons have a right to assist governments in the task of ensuring the full implementation of the provisions of the Final Act including where necessary to point out instances of non-implementation.bill the representatives of the participating States reaffirmed that their Statesremain determined to be guided in the conduct of their relations each of themwith all other participating States by strict compliance with and the applicationof the ten principles set forth in the Final Act. in all forms and activities oftheir relations and irrespective of their political, economic and social systems,thus further contributing to the strengthening of security and peace and tothe development of co-operation in Europe. They arc further determined to conduct their relations with all other States in the spirit of these principles.In view of the experience acquired, shortcomings noted and problemsfaced, they considered that it is indispensable to apply all principles in a more comprehensive and consistent manner.The participating States recognized that the human aspect of the CSCEprocess and its significance for peoples and individuals have still to be fullyrealized. They reaffirmed that the respect, by all of them, for human rightsand fundamental freedoms in all their aspects is of fundamental importance and constitutes an essential basis for substantial improvement of their mutualrelations. They expressed their resolve fully to comply with their international commitments and obligations in this field. In so doing, they will act in con-formity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United nations and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.In this respect, they recalled the right of everyone to work the equal and effective participation of women in political, economic, social and cultural life,the free exercise of the profession and practice of a religion or belief includedin the number of rights and liberties recognized by all. They also expressedthe hope that all participating States will consider the possibility of accedingto the International Covenants on Human Rights and to the Optional Protocolthereto.Haying reaffirmed the desire of their States to respect and give effect torefraining from the threat or use of force in their mutual relations as with aUStates, they have convoked, in conformity with the mandate contained26
in the Final Act and according to the proposal made to this effect by theGovernment of Switzerland to convene at Montreux on 31 October 1978 ameeting of experts charged with pursuing the examination and elaboration of a generally acceptable method for peaceful settlement of disputes aimed atcomplementing existing methods.uaCondemning all acts of terrorist violence, the participating States declaretheir intention to reinforce international collaboration aimed at elaboratingeffective measures designed to prevent the taking of hostages.They will also do their best to assure to all official representatives and persons who participate on their territories in activities within the scope of mutual co-operation between States necessary security, as well as favourable conditions for their stay and their work.iv the representatives of the participating States noted that, while there hadbeen important differences in the manner in which confidence-buildingmeasures had been implemented, there had been some progress in strengtheningconfidence as a result of the implementation by all States of the minimum requirements set out in the Final Act. They observed that a number of states had implemented certain provisions liberally, especially by notifying theirsmaller-scale manoeuvres, by giving observers ample opportunity to follow the manoeuvres to which they had been invited and by providing ampleinformation when notifying manoeuvres.To deepen and intensify implementation as well as to develop and enlargemeasures to strengthen confidence, the representatives of the participatingStates adopted the following:They will notify, in the same manner as major manoeuvres, those smaller-scale manoeuvres involving fewer than 25,000 troops and more than 10,000troops and corresponding in other respects to the parameters contained in theprovision on prior notification of major military manoeuvres.Information on manoeuvres will also include notification of the types and numbers of the participating major units, that is, at the brigatc/regiment ordivisional level and above, the estimated starting and finishing dates of the movements of the forces involved as well as the period of absence from theirregular duty stations.Observers at military manoeuvres should be offered the best opportunityof acquiring a good overall picture of the manoeuvre and of observingadequately its development by ample and continuous information. They shouldbe offered reasonable freedom of movement in the manoeuvre area, underescort; appropriate facilities such as adequate maps and binoculars; and theopportunity to follow the activities of field units taking part in the manoeuvre;and, if feasible, contact with command staffs. They should be given equaltreatment.
Prior notification will be given of major military movements taking placeinto or within the applicable area, as defined for prior notification of majormilitary manoeuvres, and covering more than 200 kilometers measured on a straight line from the point of origin. When notifying States will apply the sameprovisions as adopted for major military manoeuvres with the additional information of the direction of the movements and the place of destination.They understand that the term &quot;major military movement&quot; is also applicableto movements which take place in parts, divided in time and/or space, whether in units or not, which in the aggregate exceed a total of 25,000 troops, if thetroops involved are moving for a co-ordinated purpose and during a periodof 30 consecutive days.Appropriate, increased openness regarding military matters would con-tribute to confidence-building as well as to reducing and eliminating causes ofmisunderstanding and overreaction. The participating States will promoteopenness with regard to their military budgets. They recognize the relevanceand value of ongoing efforts to develop a satisfactory instrument for theconsistent and comprehensive measurement and reporting of military ex-penditures by States.They expressed the view that it is of the utmost importance and urgencyfor all participating States to take effective steps towards halting the armsrace throughout the world and to pursue ongoing efforts in negotiating forarelated to arms limitation and to the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Prompt actiontowards these objectives should be taken to establish more stable relations on a regional basis, in particular in Europe, where major military potentials are concentrated.The participating States therefore declare their resolve to encourage world-wide disarmament measures both in the United Nations and in other disarma-ment fora, and to give their full support to the special session of the united nations General Assembly on disarmament, to be held in the spring of1978. They transmit to those engaged in the fora indicated above the sense of urgency felt by the Belgrade Meeting concerning the need to achieveprogress in the field of arms limitation and disarmament.VIn the field of economics, of science and technology and of the environment,the representatives of the participating States acknowledged that their mutualtrade and industrial co-operation had grown in the past two years, but stilldid not reflect their full potential. Some improvements were noted, but therewas a need for greater efforts to ensure the full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Final Act, particularly in the area of business contactsand facilities and in that of economic and commercial information.Throughout their discussions, the representatives of the participating Statesrecognized the valuable work done by the ECE as the main instrument formultilateral implementation of the relevant provisions of the Final Act, andthey considered it of the greatest importance to continue the work already28
initiated there. They declared the determination of their States to take further steps to increase their co-operation in the ECE in fields of particular interestto them.The participating States stress the need for further efforts towards solving the problems of developing countries throughout the world, including thoseamong the participating countries as long as they are developing from theeconomic point of view. They express their readiness to make joint economicefforts to contribute to the process aimed at setting up a new international economic order.The participating States express their willingness to intensify their effortswith a view to ensuring a dynamic development of trade in particular throughthe diversification of its structure. They will continue their efforts, on thebasis of reciprocity, to reduce or progressively eliminate all kinds of obstacles to trade and to avoid as far as possible the introduction of new obstacles.They furthermore express their readiness to examine possible measures tofacilitate international trade in medical drugs and instruments.In the field of business contacts, the participating States declare their readiness to make further efforts to ensure wider participation of small and medium-sized firms in trade and industrial co-operation. To this end, theywill improve the financial and administrative conditions for the establishmentof joint representations by these firms. They furthermore will work towards an improvement of international telecommunications and postal services, inparticular automatic telex connexions for business representations.The participating States, when publishing economic and commercial infor-mation reflecting economic developments, will endeavour to use a nomenclaturewhich ensures continuity in the monitoring of changes.
