THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 28COPY NO OA2 March 1978CABINETEXPENDITURE ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department. On 22 February Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS) considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services recommending that as part of the Governments Spring reflationary package: -a. an extra  50 million should be allocated to the national health Service (NHS) in 1978-79;b. there should be a commitment to an average annual rateof growth for the Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS) of3 per cent in 1979-80 and thereafter (compared with 1.7 per centunder present plans).2. The burden of the Secretary of State for Social Services&apos; case wasthat the cuts over the last 2 years are beginniug to hare thair full effect onthe NHS and unless the Government provide more cash for capital and revenue purposes, we shall now see a deterioration in much of the service.In support of this he drew attention to the bleak outlook, as described in the note at Annex, and mentioned in particular the longer waiting lists, withdelay even for investigation of serious conditions such as suspected cancer;the forced closure of wards and hospitals;  and the very low morale of NHSstaff, especially the doctors.3. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, pointed out that expenditure on theHPSS - and on the PSS in particular - rose sharply in the first half of the1970s, and in recent years, apart from social security, has grown muchfaster than expenditure on any of our other social programmes and hasincreased as a proportion of national income under this Government. he also pointed to the fact that administrative costs were still thought by manyto be excessive:  in 1971 there were over 70,000 administrative staff inthe NHS, representing 10.4 per cent of all NHS staff;   the corresponding figures for 1976 were 98, 000 and 12. 5 per cent.    However, the Secretaryof State for Social Services explained that action had already been taken toreduce management costs.     These costs represented 5.7 per cent of totalNHS expenditure in March 1976 which bears comparison with other largeorganisations;   but by 1980 costs will be down to 5.25 per cent of totalexpenditure, a reduction of some 2, 750 posts.    It would be unrealistic, inhis view, to rely on savings beyond this.1
4. The Committee were seriously disturbed by the general positiondescribed in the Annex, and we shall be looking at it in more detail on thebasis of a further paper by the Secretary of State for Social Services.We accepted however that the question of the rate of growth for HPSSexpenditure after 1978-79 should be considered in the context of the 1978public expenditure survey.5. On the question of allocating an extra  50 million for the NHSin 1978-79, there was a wide measure of support in the Committee for theview that the claims of the NHS deserved high priority. This would help to meet some of the more pressing needs, to raise morale in the serviceand to make some contribution to the relief of unemployment (thought, inthe Chief Secretary&apos;s view, an expensive one at an estimated net revenuecost of  3, 500 a job).    It would also please the Party.6. I therefore invite my colleagues to consider the degree of priority to be accorded to extra expenditure on the NHS in relation to other claims on the contingency reserve in 1978-79.M RHome Office2 March 19782
THE OUTLOOK FOR HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services. In the first six years of this decade, the growth rate.for the health and social services was 4.1 per cent a year.   We are currentlyPlanning growth of only 1* per cent a year from 1976/77 to 1981/82.(See appended Tables) even though we already spend considerably less of our resources on health services than other advanced countries.2. The prospect of virtual stagnation over the next five years is made worse by the unfair way in which health resources aredistributed over the country as a whole.   After appropriate adjustmentsexpenditure per head for the North-Western Regional Health authority in 1977-78 will be  74.96; for the North-West Thames Regional health authority the figure is  101.29.   This is indefensible; but theProcess of adjustment is painful when there is no cushion ofdevelopment money for the areas which must be held back..3. As a result of the years of rapid growth, there undoubtedly*as some fat in the system.   But most of that has been used up by now.   Great efforts have been made to find economies, get better value*or money and raise productivity.   Financial control, which was always good in the NHS, has been tightened further by cash limits;*e have curbed drug prices - which compare favourably with those inother countries; management costs were frozen in 1975-76 and are nowDeing cut back in real terms to 5% below that level.   But all efforts of this kind are subject to the law of diminishing returns.^   Important needs are going unmet.   For example:(a)   Hospital waiting listsThese never rose much above 500,000 until we took office.   At the end of 1976, the figure was 600,000(England figures).   There are 40,000 people who haveto wait more than one month for urgent treatment and almost 148,000 who have to wait more than one year for non-urgent treatment.^Ak.iniMri,i*i a
Hospital out-patientsIncreasing needs (because of demography etc) oughtto have meant an increase in the number of newout-patient cases.   In fact numbers have been fallingfrom a peak of 9.4 million in 1973 to 8.9 million in 1976 andmany of these are waiting months before being seen, let alone treated.Standards of Medical CareWe compare badly with other industrial countries. Ourpoor growth rate means that we cannot take advantage ofimportant medical advances.   So, for example, only halfthe patients whose lives could be saved by kidney machinescan be offered treatment.   This compares with nearly 100 percent in the United States.Infant Mortality and Children1s Health ServicesTwenty years ago, we had one of the lowest infant mortalityrates in the world; now we have fallen behind such countries as Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Japan.And our child health services in general leave much to be desired.   Progress will be despairingly slow unless moreresources can be provided to meet needs which are particularly urgent in the Inner Cities.Mental disorderLong-term plans to reshape the services for the mentally handicapped over 20 years were published in 1971, and forthe mentally ill in 1975.   These are falling seriouslybehind and we are still plagued with damaging scandalsin the psychiatric hospitals.     Standards of treatment and care are nowhere near good enough.The ElderlyWe have done little to improve inadequate services for theold yet their numbers are increasing and some standards of provision have fallen.   For example,- to keep pace withthe growing number of elderly people, in 1976-77 Englishlocal authorities should have opened 1750 more residential
places than they did.   And 6000 places in old work houses are still having to be used.   Geriatric beds in hospitalsare not keeping pace with demographic change, and hospital services generally are coming under increasing pressure from this age group,(g) The DisabledThere is increasing evidence that many local authoritiesare not adequately carrying out their duties   under theChronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act.   This is a growing embarrassment.(h) Social Services for children the resources are simply not available to implement theChildren&apos;s Act which was passed under the present Government.There are continuing complaints from magistrates thatchildren whom they have found guilty of seriousoffences are handed over to the Local authorities who simply send them back home because they lack places in special residential homes.    Day care services for the under fives are drastically curtailed.ese problems illustrate the consequences of our poor growth rate.^u&quot;t DHSS and the local authorities&apos; are reluctant to quantify thee*tent of serious unmet need and shoddy standards because, if we haveno Prospect of doing anything effective, the results would be embarrassing and lower morale still further.The outlook for NHS buildings and equipment is also bleak. Thoughe October measures for the construction industry will help, our^nual capital programme over the next few years is still about00 million below the 1975-76 level and about  200 million0w what was achieved under the Heath Government. Overnaif o-pUI our hospital stock is more than 60 years old.3
There is a backlog of over  250 million in our building and engine ingmaintenance programme, and the position is deteriorating.   The mean ^age of our medical equipment is rising, with replacement of radio-logical equinment as the out-standing need.   We have been runninglown our capita] in order to cope with the more pressing demands ofPatient care.   This cannot continue.   Even a modest amount of capital would ease the problem of rationalising services.S. Employment.   In present circumstances, we can derive an importanteconomic and social benefit from the fact that the NHS is labour-intensive   and with more staff could make better use of existing andnewly commissioned facilities .    An additional  100 million of revenue for the health service would lead directly to the creation of about20,000 new jobs at a net cost (after allowing for tax and social security benefit offsets) of only some  70 million.   Besides this^rect boost to employment, any additional capital for the NHS wall&quot;Iso lead to extra jobs in the construction industry and in advanced technology industries which need a firm home base from which to promoteexports.   The geographical distribution of new NHS jobs is under our^ntrol.   Expenditure could be concentrated on those health regions*here the provision of services is worst, many of which include areashigh unemployment.   Extra expenditure on the NHS will create usefulJobs and benefit the nation&apos;s health at the same time.7- In last Octobers reflationary package the NHS receivedraiWmal sum -  10 million extra on a total revenue budget of  4% billionA further  50 million in 1978/79 would enable us to cope with someMediate transitional problems but we must go beyond this and providethe basis for real improvements in standards of care, for effectivesteps t0 remove the geographical inequalities and for more progressin &quot;Pgrading hospitals and other buildings.   This requires an overall^ual rate of growth for the Health and Personal Social Services ofnot less than 356 starting in 1979-80.   A Labour Government achievedthi*, and more, between 1964 and 1970 and the Heath Government did evenbet*er from 1970 to 1973.   Growth of 3* a year would mean an extra  112mlllion in 1979-80 rising to about  300 million in 1981-82, comparedVith Present plans, but as noted above the net cost would be far less.
