DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government copy no cp(78) 296 March 1978CABINETUPRATING OF CHILD BENEFITMemorandum by the Minister for Social Security!- The Secretary of State for Social Services and I were invited by Homeand Social Affairs Committee to circulate a paper showing the effect on familyincomes of increasing child benefit to  4 a week by April 1979.    This mightbe done by -Option 1:    a one- stage increase of  1. 70 in April 1979; orOption 2:   a two-stage increase adding 70p this November, and afurther  1 in April 1979.present situation- Child benefit is now  1 a week for the first child and  1. 50 for other children.    In April 1978 this becomes  2. 30 for each child.    At the same time,child tax allowances (CTAs) will be reduced.    From April 1978, assuming nochange in tax rate, the basic rate tax-payers will get -Age of childUnder 1111-1516 and overChild Benefit		Child Tax Allowance	Weekly total per child 2.30		65p	 2.95 2. 30	+	88p	 3.18 2.30	4-	 1.08p	 3.38The residual CTAs for children under 11 is due to be abolished inP*&quot;il 1979, and those for older children reduced.    It has also been suggestedit would be desirable, if possible, to abolish the residual CTAs for olderIdren and the effects cf this are shown below in relation to a  4 rate from april 1979.1
OPTION 1 - ONZ-STAGE UPRATING IN APRIL 19794. Under Option 1, child benefit would be increased to  4 in April 1979.All CTAs would be abolished     The basic rate tax-payer not on housingbenefits would then get -Net sain overAge of child Child Benefit April 1978Under 11  4  1.0511 to 15  4 82p16 and over  4 62pCost - Ml cost in 1978-79 515m in 1979-80(1977 Survey prices)OPTION 2 - TWO-STAGE UPRATING IN NOVEMBER 1978 AND APRIL 19795* Under Option 2, child benefit would be increased to  3 inNovember 2978, without any offsetting reduction in CTAs.    There would bea straight gain of /Op for each child.    The benefit would be further increasedto  4 in April 1979, and CTAs would then be abolished.    The basic ratetex-payer would then get -From April 1979a       r  u-u               ., , ^ Net gain or loss Net gain overAge of child Child Benefit -rr-----                   0  .   &quot; rrrz - i- - over November 1978 April 1978Under 11  4 35p  1.0511 to 15  4 12p 82p16 and over  4 - 8p 62pCost -  165m in 1978-79 515m in 1979-80(The extra cost, over Option 1, isthat of the 70p extra benefit from november 19/8 to April 1979plus  800, 000 administrative expenses)The effects of those options for families of different ages and statusare shown in Annex 1.    The distributional effects are shown in Annex 3.2
ONE-PARENT FAMILIES7.        A premium is paid for the first child in a one-parent family. Thisis at present 50p.    It is to be increased to  1 in April 1978.    Under theabove options it would be further increased to  2 - either in November 1978(Option 2) or April 1979 (Option 1).HOUSING BENEFITS8* Increases in child benefit (like other increases in income) lead to3- reduction in housing benefits (rent rebates and allowances and raterebates) so that families receiving these gain less.    In the worst case theincrease of child benefit by  1.70 to  4 could lead to a reduction of 56pper child in housing benefits.a. Under Option 1, the net gains in child benefit in April 1979are enough to cover this and avoid losses.b. Under Option 2, there would be losses in April 1979 (inaddition to those in respect of children over 16 - see paragraph 5above) for some 90, 00C families who have CTAs for over 11&apos;swithdrawn and housing benefits reduced.    However, taking the twobenefit increases under Option 2 together would give an overall gain.-Annex II sets out the position in more detail.S Oapartment of Health and Social SecurityMarch 19783

Families on social securityAlthough the child benefit being received by families on social securitywould gc up, there vould be a corresponding reduction in social security benefits.    Their incomes would not, therefore, go up in April 1979. Theywould, hcvrever, all gain from the November 1978 and the November 1979uprating cf social security.3. j&apos;.or?:&apos;..&apos;r one parent families, paying basic rate of tax, not receiving housing the gains would be the same as for tv/o parent families with the same number and ages of children, except that the gains v/ould be  1 more for each oneparent family, whatever its size, when the one parent family premium is increased.   Under Option 1, the increase v/ould be in April 1979; underOption 2 it would be November 1978.2

Note on numbers affected the latest estimate (1976-77) of the total numbers of families with dependent children receiving housingbenefits (and not receiving supplementary benefit) are:-Rent rebates 230,000 (virtually all receivi*r&apos;:(ie council tenants) rate rebates as welURent allowances 8,000Owner-occupiers with 200,000rate rebates &apos;About 90,000 such families (almost all of them counciltenants) would be worse off on a comparison between November1978 and April 1979 under Option 2.   Whether a family isworse off in this way depends on the ages of the children.The worst losses occur in respect of children over 16 (beca^-of the tax adjustment), but it is estimated that less than10,000 of the families under consideration have dependent children only in the over 16 category.2\
2JSTRIBUTTOMAL EFFECTS*   Under either Option 1 or 2, the distributional effects are broadly&quot;the same as those of the April 1978 increase in child benefit.2.3.Child benefit goes to 7.1 million families with 13.6 million children in Great Britain.   The broad effect of the proposals v:ould be;-(i)       Working families     Of the 6 million working families withchild benefit, all would gain.*   The gains would be lessfor those on housing benefits; and also for children over 11because of the withdrawal of the higher CTAs for thosechildren.Families on social security benefits     The 1 millionfamilies on social security benefits would gain from the november 1978 uprating of those benefits, but not fromthe increased rates of child benefit as these would be offset- against social security benefits.(*ii)   One-parent families      The one-parent family premium benefitsabout Jm one-parent families.   The other one-parent familiesare entitled to social security i^enefits and will thereforegain from the November 1978 uprating of those benefits.The benefit is designed to help working families at all income levels.About 57 per cent of the expenditure would go to the second ana third^uintiles, but only 16 per cent to the lowest quintile.   This is because families on social security benefits (generally in the lowest .uecile) do not gain from child benefit.    (In addition, some of childbenefit expenditure going to the bottom quintile is offset by reduction.?^n other means tested benefits).   But gaining families outnumber ncn-S^ining families by about 6 to 1.   Doubling the premium for the firsiCnild in one-parent families to  2 increases the share of spending onchild benefit going to such families from about 5 per cert (on the;-Prii -jq7  r?/tesj -r0 av,out      per cent.
