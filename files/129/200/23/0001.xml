ULAFT WHITE PAPERDEMOCRACY HI industry. People spend a large part of their lives at work and it is right   that they   should have   a say in the decisions that affecttheir livelihood and working conditions, just as they do in other aspectsof their lives.   Through their trade unions, employees have played an increasingly active part in the affairs of their companies. Legislationexists to protect people from unfair dismissal, &quot;bad conditions andexploitation.   But our industrial relations arc still characterised &quot;byconflict.   Some of the conflict is inevitable, even healthy.   People in industry have different interests, and differ about objectives and how they are to be achieved.   But part of tho trouble is due to poorconnunications, lack of information and lack of trust.   One way to changethis is to create a right for employees and their representatives tojoin  in those   corporate decisions that affect then and to encouragetheo to do so,   Uhcrc decisions arc mutually agreed both sides of industry must then share responsibility for then.   Such shared responsibility willinprove thc efficiency of British industry and open up a range of new andcreative ideas that can greatly benefit this country.2, Thc Govcrnncnt welcomes the debate which has taken place sincethe appointment of the committee of inquiry under thc chairmanship of Lord Bullock, and thc many constructive contributions which weremade both to thc Committee and since tho publication of itsreport.      There have been sharp divisions of view on tho1
recommendations of the report, but it has illumined the major issues and the Government wishes to express again its gratitude toLord Bullock and the members of his committee for their majorcontribution to the public debate on industrial democracy,3-     The role of employees and their representatives in decisionmaking through plant level bargaining i3 developing rapidly and hasaccelerated since 1968 when its importance was analysed in the Donovanreport.   At national and industry levels trade unions and employerswork together with government in the formulation of social andeconomic policies.   But at company level there remains a major gap in the development of the employee role.   Many of the decisions whichare taken by company boards have direct and sometimes major implications for the long term interest of employees.   The advantages of industrial democracy will not be won unless employees in companies and nationalised industries alike have the opportunity to take part in the developmentof corporate strategy, to contribute to decisions before they are taken and equally important to share in responsibility for their implementation.The Government believes that these advantages are already recognised by enlightened management and within the trade union movement.2
4. The potential banoflto of industrial flonocr^oy on n only be ichi,,vthrough co-operation &quot;between employers and employees.   Hence it isa fundamental principle of the Government1 s policy that as faras possible it should be left to those concerned to work outthe detailed arrangements for themselves.   However whereagreement proves impossible employees must be al*le to claim certainbasic statutory rights.   Accordingly, the Government proposes thatthere should be legislation which would give statutory fall-bavk rights to employees and unions.5. In setting   out   its proposals for a statutory procedure, theGovernment emphasises that it wishes - and would much prefer - to see employee participation proceed &quot;by voluntaryagreements between employers and the representatives of their employees.   It is not the intention to impose a standard pattern of participation on industry by law.   The object of participationis understanding and oo-operatif)n and it is obvious that the chances t)f success are improved where employers and employeesagree together on the procedures for involvement which suittheir wishes and circumstances.   The Government expects that thiswill be the &quot;basis on which most   developments in participation willtake place in industry and that recourse to statutory fallbackarrangements will be the exception.6. In this same spirit the Government intends to consult widelyon its proposals so as to achieve the greatest possible agreement3
on the measures finally introduced.   We hope that all engaged in industry will discuss these proposals with the same objective.As an aid to the consultative process, the sections which followdiscuss the main issues \which arise on these proposals.DISCUSSION OP COMPANY STRATEGY7. The Government believes that it is possible to build upon and develop the best practice and arrangements which have been worked out jointly between companies and their trade unions.   In manycases both in the private and public sectors employees are already-involved in the determination of corporate strategy.   Many largeprivate sector companies and public corporations have already-devised procedures for involving employees in   major policy decisions.8. In order to encourage the extension of these developments, we propose that the law should put employers in companies employingmore than 500 people in the United Kingdom under an obligation todiscuss with the representatives of employees all major proposals affecting the employees of the business before decisions are made.Thcso discussions would encompass such matters as investment plans, mergerstakeovers, expansion or contraction of establishments, and majororganisational changes.   Further guidance on tho subjects to be covered might be given in a Code of Practice akin to the existingCode on the disclosure of information for collective bargainingpurposes.   The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)would be invited to draw it up with a view to its being submittedto Parliament for approval *4
9. The Government expects that in the majority of companiesprocedures for this purpose will be set up by agreement. Thesystem should nonetheless be backed by the statutory provisionsset out below.   The disclosure of the relevant information wouldbe a natural part of the discussion process, and would fall intopi ace in that context.IJho should exercise these statutory rights?10. It would not be practicable for companies to discuss theircorporate plans separately with each recognised trade union. the issues are likely to affect all employees and it will be in theinterests of all that their organised representatives should discuss them collectively with the company.   The obligation on companies todiscuss company strategy should &quot;be initiated by a request from a collective &quot;body to which all the independent recognised tradeunions in the company are entitled to belong.   The BullockCommittee in their discussion of arrangements for employeerepresentation on the Board recommended that the shop stewardsand other lay representatives of the various trade unions in a company should form such a committee for the purpose of negotiation between the company and the unions and to decide howemployee representatives should be selected.   They proposed&apos;thatthis committee be known as the Joint Representation Committee (JRC)^Tho foTv.rnru.nt bv)livoj th vt this nppro-ich ton provi&amp;o an inpcrtr.ntbisis for intv^r-uni^n corporation -\nd r. positive; stimulus tc thodovolipnont \f participation.5
11.   We therefore propose that the right to require the board todiscuss company strategy should be vested in a JRC broadlyrepresentative of the independent recognised trade unions in thecompany which in turn uould be broadly representative of the employeesas a whole.     Ilembors of the JRC would be employees of the company.In a number of companies arrangements exist for discussion with bothrepresentatives of organised and non-organised employees.   Whore itwas agreed between the parties, nominoes of non-organised employeescould be admitted to the discussions with the JRC though there wouldbe no statutory obligation to do so.   Companies would be free to setup or to continue other arrangements if they wished.6
Should there be sanctions for companies which do not comply with their statutory obligations?12. The Government believes that it will only be in a minority ofcases that the statutory obligations will be invoked: cases where theobligations are invoked but not observed should be relatively few.There are two possible ways of dealing with cases in which unions aredissatisfied because the company fails to comply with its obligations.One v/ould be for the Joint Representation Committee (JRC) to have aright to appeal to the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) which would deal with the matter much as it now deals with complaints to discloseinformation for collective bargaining purposes under S 19 of theEmployment Protection Act 1975*     The other would be for the JRC tohave the right to refer the matter to ACAS for investigation. Afterinvestigating ACAS would draw up a report and, if appropriate, make recommendations.   The report would be published when ACAS considered this to be appropriate.How should the confidentiality of informationdisclosed be preserved?13. Arrangements for safeguarding confidentiality of informationdisclosed through these procedures is an important issue and oneupon which the Government intends to consult further with the CBIand the TUC before legislation is introduced.   The sensitivity ofinformation on company strategy varies greatly.   Some of the issues under consideration may already be public knowledge. Othersmay not be generally known, but are not so material to the company1scompetitive position that they cannot be discussed among the employeesgenerally.   Yet other decisions, for example those concerned with new product development and certain new investment intentions will7
be such that their disclosure to competitors would causesubstantial injury to the undertaking,14*     We should not, however, exaggerate the risks. union representatives often receive sensitive information in the context of their existing dealings with companies and it is thecommon experience that confidentiality is respected.   There is noreason why the representatives of the employees whose workinglives and welfare are bound up in the welfare of the company should be any more likely to betray confidentiality than directors of a company, provided that the nature and significance of theinformation is made clear when it is disclosed.15*     An appropriate course might be for companies to discussand agree with the unions the arrangements needed to preserve theconfidentiality of information to be disclosed, distinguishingcarefully between the information which may be passed on byemployee representatives to their constituents and that whichmay not.   If this is done it is unlikely that confidentiality will,in practice, present any serious difficulties.    It is alreadypossible for civil actions to be brought against those who misuseconfidential information to the detriment of the company,16,     There may however exceptionally be proposals which would notbe appropriate for discussion.   Clearly information the disclosure of which could be contrary to the national interest must be specially safeguarded.   Additionally companies may have to beallowed discretion not to discuss matters where this would involvethe disclosure of information which was given to them in confidence,8
or which was so sensitive that if it were to become known to acompetitor it would cause serious damage to the company. guidance on this subject should be included in the proposed ACAS Co.de of practice.   But the JRC should be able to refer such cases to theCAC for investigation and it would &quot;be for that body to advisewhether the company was justified in not entering into discussions.How should the rights to discussion operate ingroups of companies and multinationals?17.   The development of industrial democracy in companies is affected not only by their internal organisation cut by the inter-dependence of companies organised in groups.   If the objectives of industrial democracy are to be achieved, arrangements must bemade for workers to be involved in decisions at whatever level theyare taken.    In groups of companies it will therefore ^e necessaryfor discussions to take place between representatives of employees and companies both at subsidiary and holding company levels, and perhaps at intermediate company levels too, depending upon wheredecisions are taken.   Where a JRC is formed at group level by independent recognised unions in the group it should have a rightto discussions with the parent company on any major proposals madeat that level affecting the business of the group as a whole or ofany of the subsidiary companies.   The structure of many groups iscomplex and the levels at which decisions are taken are not alwayseasy to define.   We therefore propose to consult further on thebest practical metnod for framing legislation to give effect tothis principle.9
18,     The same requirements will apply to all companies incorporated in the UK including those controlled by a company abroad. any legislation cannot of course have effect outside the jurisdiction ofthe UK but the Government hopes that overseas companies whichcontrol UK subsidiaries will seek to operate within the spiritof its proposals,BOARD LEVEL REPRESENTATION19*     The growth of industrial democracy through the arrangements forthe discussion of company strategy described above may be seen as a natural development from the best current industrial relationspractice.   In many cases arrangements of this sort, whether agreedvoluntarily through negotiation, as the Government would prefer,or set up through the use of the proposed statutory procedures,will satisfy the aspirations and needs of employees and managementfor closer participation.   But building on their experience gainedthrough the operation of this system many may wish to add a newdimension - that of employee representation on the board,20,     The Government&apos;s consultations following publication of theBullock Report have not so far resulted in consensus on theprinciple of whether employees should be given a statutory rightto representation at board level, although there is widespreadrecognition of the desirability of board level representation where this is achieved through agreement between companies and their employees.   This lack of consensus may in part reflect different views about the role of employee directors in an industrial relationsstructure based largely on a system of collective bargaining. on one view employee directors would be a natural complement to the10
collective- bargaining process, and their principal role would beto ensure that matters of concern to the employees wore discussed with them, and that their representatives had all the relevant information for this purpose.21. An alternative view, and the approach advocated in theBullock Report, is that tho role of employee representatives onthe board is to enable employees to participate directly in themanagement of the company and to share responsibility for its decisions.22. The Government &quot;believes that it would not be satisfactory to rely entirely on voluntary progress and it remains firmlycommitted to the view that employees should have a right torepresentation on the board of their company.   The government&apos;s policy is, however, to avoid inflexible legislation which wouldrequire the adoption of one approach rather than another. we discuss in paragraphs 23-36 below what form this might take.11
23.   As in the case of discussion of company strategy, much can heachieved by agreement without the intervention of legislation. Itwill be open to companies and their employees, as it is now, tonegotiate whatever form of representation, procedures for the selection of those who are to represent their colleagues, and what-ever other arrangements seem to them appropriate to their wishes and circumstances.     Indeed it is to be expected that in the majority of companies board level representation will develop through arrangementsnegotiated voluntarily in this way.   To encourage such progress theGovernr.ont intends to introduce a two   tier board structure with separatepolicy and management boards as an option for any company.   Its study ofthis subject has convinced the Government that regardless of the questionof employee representation, the two tier board structure   can offercompanies certain advantages over a unitary board.      Its proposals on this subject form a major part of its review of company law andare discussed in detail in the Appendix to this White Paper. Whereemployees are represented on the hoard the Government believesthe two tier structure will be found to be especially appropriate. Thepolicy board will play a major part in the formulation of company policyand the taking of major decisions and employee representatives willbe able to play their full part in this sitting alongside therepresentativet&quot;of shareholders.     It will also promote participationarrangements throughout the company.     The policy board will not become involved in - or responsible for - the day-to-day running of thecompany.     This will be the task of the proiessional management andthis will be the function attributed to the management board in the
lav/.     The opportunity for employees to share in day-to-day decisionmaking will come separately through arrangements developed forparticipation below board level.24. All directors on the top board, however appointed, willshare the same legal duties and responsibilities.     as under thepresent law all directors will be required to act on their ownauthority and responsibility.     Company law prohibits themandating- of a director to vote in a particular way. TheGovernment believes, as did the Bullock Committee, that thereshould be no departure from this principle and that thereshould be no question of employee or shareholder directors beingmandated to vote in accordance with the instructions of those by whom they are appointed.     Nevertheless it is highly desirablethat they should keep in touch with the opinion of those they represent.     Employee directors in particular should be in close touch with the employees and the trade unions.     This will be important if they are to be able to reflect the views of theworkforce and to provide an effective channel of communication to them.     It will be for those in each company to devisearrangements which suit the particular circumstances of the company and the information to be reported.25. Where agreement cannot be reached, employees in companies employing2000 or more in the UK should be able if they wish to claim a statutory right to have representatives on the board. this right will be to representation on the policy board in theproposed two tier structure.     The employee directors
should &quot;bo employees of the company.   As in the case of employees&apos;rights to discussions on future company strategy exercise of thestatutory right to board level representation should bo initiated by a request from the JRC described in paragraph 11.   In the caseof board level representation the JRC would have the right to requirethe company to organise a ballot of all the company&apos;s employees todecide whether they wanted to be represented on the board.   If theresult of the ballot was in favour the company would be able toreconstitute its board so as to adopt the two tier structure(if it had. not already chosen to do so) and to admit employees to the top board.   Alternatively the company would have the option of offering representation on an existing unitary board. TheGovernment believes that a ballot is necessary in the case of boardlevel representation since the consequences of the exercise of this right could involve a major restructuring of the company.2o.   The Government proposes that there should be a period of 4 or 5 years from the passing of legislation before the statutory right to board level representation comes into operation.   This will allow for the necessary improvement of participative machinery at all levels, in particular through exercise of the right to discuss companystrategy which will come into effect as soon as legislation isenacted and Joint Representation Committees are established.27.   In its consideration and consultations on the detailed arrangements which should apply under the statutory provisions for board level representation the Government has encounteredtwo important issues on which views arc divided.
Proportion of employee directors28. The Bullock majority report is based on the principle of equal representation of shareholders and employees on the board:the composition of the board to be based on the &quot;2x -f y&quot; formulawith equal numbers of shareholders and employee representatives(2x) choosing a third section of the board (y) by agreementbetween them.29. This principle of equal representation derives from their view that the role of employee directors is to enable employees to share in the making of board decisions and to accept equalresponsibility for them.   Hence it is argued that employee directorscannot be expected to accept equal responsibility unless, throughequal representation on the board, they are to have equal influence on the decision making process; that their credibility will bereduced in the eyes of their constituents if they can always beoutvoted by the shareholder side.   It is argued too that in anycase it is no longer acceptable that in the last resort the shareholders&apos; view must prevail.30. The main argument against equal representation is that itwould lead to conflict and deadlock.   Moreover parity on thepolicy board can be seen as upsetting the balance of collective bargaining which requires, for its effective functioning trueindependence of the two parties involved, trade   unions and themanagement board.   On this view if employees have an equal say we the appointment and conduct of company boards this would result intho.tr having an unequal and greater force at the bargaining tab3,o. This15
could damago tho confidence of investors making it difficultto raise capital, and the foreign investor, in particular, wouldbo disinclined to invest furthor in the United Kingdom.31. The Government recognises the force of these oonflictingarguments, and \dll continue to sook consonsus *n the way in &quot;hichthis dilemma should be rosolvod.   It believes that a roasonablefirst step would be to give employees the right to appoint up to onethird of tho members of the policy board in the proposed two tier system.A substantial poriod of experience and further discussion would bonecessary beforo decisions should be taken on the form of any future developments.Selection of employee representatives32. The majority of tho Bullock Comnittoe proposed that the JRC wouldbe responsible for devising a satisfactory systom for the allocation of scats between tho different employee interest groups and choosingthe method of selecting employee representatives.     The decision would rest solely with tho JRC as to how this should best bo done in thecircumstances of the company.33. The complexity of the structure of 3ritish industry andtrado unions undoubtedly makes the problem of choosing a method of selcotion for employee representatives vory difficult.To bo offectivo on tho board those representatives must have16
strong links with the shop floor and clear lines of communicationwith their constituencies - and they will also need to he ableto balance the interests of the different occupational groups in the company and of enployoea. in different geographical locations. TheGovernment agrees with the Bullock majority that the circum-stances vary so greatly within British industry that no legisla-tion could be devised to cover thera all.34, Difficulties nevertheless remain.   It is argued that industrial democracy should provide for the involvement of allemployees and should not exclude some individuals *r groupsfr*)m participating in the selection *f those who are to representthem.   In particular to give unions the sole responsibility for organising this representation might be particularly damaging to the morale of certain groups of employees such as middlemanagers, whose commitment and loyalty to the company are no less important than those of any other group of employees andwho in the main are not highly unionised as a group.35. On the other hand, it is argued that board representations should not &quot;be designed in such a way as to undermine trade unions1representative capacity.   Effective collective representationbased on trade   union machinery entails collective organisation,and a structure for board level representation separate fromtrade union machinery would create tension and a potential for industrial disputes.   Representation throu^i this machinery would provide the expertise and independent strength to enable17
employee representatives to play their full part in board decisionmaking and provide an efficient and trusted channel of communication to the shop floor and to their constituents.36.   Thus there is a clear dilemma.   On the one hand industrial democracy implies that every employee should have a right to bodirectly involved in the selection of representatives on theboard.   On the other hand, there is a need for any arrangements to be consistent with the established system of collectiverepresentation of employees in British industry.   One solution might be for the method of selecting employee representatives to bo determined in the first instance by the JRC, as proposed&quot;by the Bullock majority, but with a right of appeal to ACAS/CACby any homogeneous group of 100 employees or more if they considered that their interests would not be adequately representedunder the system proposed.   The statute could set out the criteriaby which any such appeal would be judged and these could cover the geographical and occupational distribution of employees in thecompany; and in the event of a successful appeal there could also bo a requirement for elections based on nomination of candidatesby trade unions and by groups of at least 100 employees whether ornot they are members of trade unions.   There could be other criteria,if it was thought desirable.18
G-roups and Multinationals37.     The Government believes that arrangements for employeeparticipation should apply at whatever level decisions are taken and in all companies incorporated in the UK where the number employed meets the stated thresholds, irrespective of the location of their parent companies.     In relation to board levelrepresentation the Bullock Committee recommended that employeesshould have a right to board level representation in the company in which they work, and, if that company is a member of a group, in the company which ultimately controls it. the considerations here differ from those relating to arrange-ments for the discussion of company strategy.     A right torepresentation on the board at all levels in the group might well prove cumbersome, and in the long term unnecessary if thepresence of employee directors on the top holding boardleads to the development of representation at lower levels. Onthe other hand representation at subsidiary and top holdingboard level only could lead to a situation where some issues,which would otherwise be resolved at a lower level in the group will be referred to the top holding company for decision.19
38. The Government has also studied the position of british companies which employ substantial numbers of people overseaseither directly or through subsidiary companies.   It recognises,as did the Bullock Committee, the force of the conflictingarguments on the ono hand that it would be unjust for representatives of a group&apos;s British employees to sit on aboard which takes decisions affecting the unrepresentedemployees of a company^ overseas subsidiaries and that on theother hand &quot;it would clearly be unjust to exclude some employees in the United Kingiom from representation at board level justbecause they work in a group which had employees overseas&quot;.While there is no easy answer, the Government could not accept any system whereby substantial numbers of employees in largefirms in this country would be deprived of the right torepresentation which will be extended to others,39, The Government believes that further consideration and discussion will be needed on both these issues. Whateverdecisions it finally takes will be consistent with themaintenance of control over subsidiaries.   Any other coursewould not only depart from the practice in all other countriesbut would inevitably have considerable and adverse effects on future overseas investment in this country.20
POSSIBLE EXEMPTIONS FROM INDUSTRIAL DEI&amp;democracy LEGISLATION40.     It was suggested to the Bullock Committee that certain categories of companies   or certain sectors of the economy should be exempted from the requirements of any legislation on boardrepresentation.   The Committee left it to those who prepare legislation to consider in detail the case for any such exemptions, but expressedthe view that:    &quot;Generally speaking we are opposed to exemptions for particular groups or classes of companies, or particular sectors ofindustrial or commercial activity&quot;.   While the Government wishes toavoid exemptions since this would be to deny certain groups of employees rights otherwise extended generally throughout industry and commerce, it is ready to examine the arguments in the few cases wherespecial consideration may be thought to apply which might justifyexemption from the requirements of the legislation on board representa-tion.   The case for any exemptions must clearly bo considered in thelight of the decisions to be taken on the various issues discussed inthis Paper.   But the Government does not consider it likely that therewould be any exemption from tho rijht to diocuco conpany strategy.21
NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES41-     While industrial democracy is as important for the nationalised industries as for large companies in both public and private sectorsthere are differences.   In the nationalised industries there is thepublic interest to be taken into account, and there are no shareholders.Most of the nationalised industries are unionised to a much greater degreethan even the largest companies. Certain of .these industries have statutory obligations to promote industrial democracy.   Management and tho unions in these industries are already making progress in developing new arrangements for participation.   The Post Office has begun an experiment,lasting for two years, based on agreed proposals put forward by themanagement and the unions for a new Board with, in addition to theChairman, seven management and seven union members, and five independent members including two with experience in consumer affairs.   To enablethis experiment to go ahead Parliament, at the Government&apos;s request,has enacted legislation to increase tho maximum number of board members from twelve to nineteen.   The Chairman of the British Steel corporation is discussing with the unions in thc industry a reconstituted board which would include worker representatives, as well as seniorraangement and a number of part-time non-executive directors,British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders are required, under theAircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977t to promote industrial democracy.   Reports from both corporations have been laid beforeParliament and discussions are continuing.22
The proposed legislation for the reorganisation of the electricity supply industry, in England and Wales, set out in the White F&amp;per(Comnd        will include similar provisions requiring the promotion ofindustrial democracy.   Discussions are under way. in tho other nationalised industries.42.     In some of the nationalised industries the management andthe unions have chosen to put the emphasis on the development of theirexisting procedures.   For example in the energy sector the recentlyestablished national Jojnt Co-ordinating Council in the electricity industry and the Planning Liaison Committee of the British GasCorporation discuss policies over a wide range of tho industriesactivities.     Tripartite   discussions of coal industry strategyinvolving unions management and Government began in 1974*   They nowinclude provision for the National Coal Board, after consultation withthe mining unions, to submit to the Secretary of State an agreeddevelopment plan as the vehicle for a formal planning agreement to be renewed annually.   The Secretary of State for Energy has also establishedan Energy Commission which will advise him on the development of energystrategy for the UK.   The Commission includes representatives of unions and management in the energy industries, as well as representativesof other interests.   Other nationalised industries are similarlyimproving and developing their participative and oonsultativearrangements.23
45*.  The Government intends to encourage progress in developingand improving schemes of industrial democracy at all levels inthe nationalised industries.    It has asked the Chairmen of the nationalised   industries to consult with the unions in each industry, where they are not already doing so, and to make jointproposals for further improvements in consultation and participationThe Government has asked the Chairmen to put forward their proposals by August 1978.   They might range from employee representation at Board and lower levels to further developments in consultativeand participative procedures.   It is likely that any proposalswhich emerge can go ahead quickly under present legislation.However, if in any nationalised industries it is necessary toamend the statutes to allow for an experiment, or for new arrangements, the Government will introduce the necessary legis-lation, as it has already dono for the Post Office experiment.44 *   When legislation is introduced on industrial democracy thiswill give employees in the nationalised industries a right torepresentation on main &quot;boards.   This right will have to take account of tho special responsibility of the nationalised industries to Ministers, and through them to Parliament.EDUCATION AND TRAINING45.   The increase in employee participation envisaged in thisWhito Paper will give rise to now training needs.   Until now, thefunctions of employee representatives have for the most partbeen concerned with collective bargaining on terms and conditions24
of employment, with general industrial relations problems, and v/ith their duties as officials in their own unions. Direct involvonont v/ith overallcompany policies and strategy, whether as board members, in the context of planning discussions, or in joint negotiation, will demanda wider knowledge on thc part of employee representatives of subjectssuch as business finance, management and forecasting techniques,and statistics.   They v/ill also need a broad general knowledgeof the business of the organisation for which they work. Managersand shareholder representatives will need to learn more aboutlabour matters and participation techniques.It will ho essential to ensure that these requirements are met.   Training concerned with thc business of thc organisation will probably most appropriately be undertaken within theorganisation itself but thc more general education and trainingof employee representatives will need to be provided elsewhere.Much of it will fall to be funded by Government.Itf     The details of such education and training will need to beconsidered - as to content, length, location etc - in consultationwith those most directly concerned, in particular the TUC.Thc amount of special training needed by particular rcprc-sentatives will vary according to thc typo and level of participation with which they arc involved.   Representatives onboards may need between 4 and 8 weeks (depending to some extent on whether or not courses arc residential).   A variety ofinstitutions and organisations will need to co-operate25
in devising and providing appropriate courses.   These night includepublic sector colleges uith relevant experience in management andindustrial relations education, the TUC and independent trade unioncolleges,l&amp;m   Whilst the major training needs will clearly be those of employeerepresentatives, whether board *r JRC members, some of thc trainingprovided for then will also be helpful to nenbers of nanagenent and to non-executive directors.49*   The government accepts the Bullock re commendations that Governmentmoney will be needed for training enployee representatives.   It idlldiscuss with the TUC and others the best way this should bo done.INSTITUTIONS5t*   The Bullock Committee reconnendod the establishment of an industrial Democracy Connission (IDC) to provide advice and oon-ciliation, to give rulings on disputes, and to monitor and evaluate the operation of the legislation proposed in their report. though there would be a substantial overlap between the functions of an IDCas envisaged by the Bullock Committee and those *f ACAS they considered that these duties could not be satisfactorily discharged by ACAS tho aims and objectives of which are conoornod solely -,/ithindustrial relations.   An IDC would be concerned not *nly with industrial relations but olco     with company law and adninistratitB,26
51. However, ACAS is already active in the developing field of employeeparticipation below board level and competent to undertake the advisoryand other functions connected with the disclosure and discussion of companystrategy.     The Government sees the emphasis in the initial period asbeing on the development of these aspects of industrial democracy, whichare clearly within the scope of ACAS.     It is essential to provideinstitutional support and, in the Government&apos;s view, initially this might best be dealt with by ACAS rather than by setting up a new institution.The Government therefore intends to consult the Council of the ACASabout the Service expanding its existing role in the field of employeeparticipation - for example, the provision of voluntary enquiry, advisoryand conciliation services to employers and trade unions on participationprocedures and the monitoring of developments on industrial democracy.The Government also proposes to consult the ACAS and the CAC about the newroles which the Government is proposing for the Service in relation to thediscussion of company strategy.     It will decide in the light of subsequentexperience whether there is any need to set up a new independent body.CONCLUSIONS52. The Government believes that its proposals will provide practicalassistance and encouragement for the development of democracy in Britishindustry.    They will help to create an atmosphere in which those amongthe workforce and in management who are most closely concerned withachieving real co-operation in industry can come together to plan theway ahead.     It is above all for the people who work in industry to makeindustrial democracy succeed so that it may make the contribution we look for to improving the efficiency of our industries and the prosperity of our country.27
53*   At the sr.no tino thore is a need for a full and informoddiscussion of tho practical requirements for tho legislation whichwill be introduced on tho employers1 obligation to discuss majorproposals ;/ith employeos, and on tho representation of employeeson boards. Some of tho key points have been discussed in this paper and the Government hopos this will serve as a stimulus and focusfor a constructive dobato.   There is already a wide measure ofagreement cn the need for change.   The outstanding problems outlined above are important but not insoluble.   Other countries have foundsolutions appropriate to thoir experience and traditions - wo can do the same.28
APPENDIX 1Company Board StructureI     Wo are accustomed in this country to the unitary company boardwhose members are appointed by the shareholders and, haying beenappointed, are competent to take any decision affecting theoperation of the company, save for certain important matters whichhave to be referred to the general meeting of Shareholders tordecision.     In many European countries including Germany, Denmark,Prance, Netherlands and Belgium, the two tier company boardstructure is used either as an option available to companies whichwish it or as a requirement for large companies.2     &apos;i&quot;he German example is most often quoted.    The two tier structurehaa been a requirement in Germany for large companies since the Lai.nineteenth centruy and was originally introduced for reasons whichhad nothing to do with industrial democracy but with the aim ofgiving the shareholders more effective control over the way in whit \the company was run than they could exercise through the generalmeeting.     In German law, large companies must have a supervisoryboard and a management board.     The management hoard is responsiblefor day to day management of the company and it alone has power Uobind bhe company vis a vis third parties.     The supervisory hoardappoints and can dismiss for good reason the members of the manage-ment board.     It receives regular reports from the management boardand has the power to require the management board to refer certain categories of decision to it for prior approval.     The role of bhesupervisory board is to oversee and supervise the way in which bhecompany is run, but not to get involved in running it.     Members oJthe management board cannot be members of the supervisory board ornivice versa.
vAJHFliiliiiTiALBut this rigid division of functions between the two boards,which is attacked by the opponents of two tier boards in bhiacountry as inconsistent with our flexible tradition of company law,j..-.; not; the only model.     In Denmark for example the upper board luuconsiderable powers over the determination of policy and the bakinol&quot; major decisions, and within prescribed limits it is possible for individual directors to be members of both boards.*&apos;i      Cta study of this subject has convinced the Government that thetwo tier board structure can offer certain advantages over a unitaryboard whether or not the employees are represented at board level.It helpa to clarify on the   one hand the role of directors aamanagera and on the other their function of directing the company.Many United Kingdom companies already operate in practice a two tierBystern in which the board of directors delegates executive inanage-ment functions to a committee or committees.     The Government belli uthat there would be advantage in formalising this arrangement by introducing a new legal structure for companies consisting of a mainpolicy board and a management board.5     &apos;fhe powers and dutiea of each board v/ould be specified in thelaw.     ,J-hi&apos; policy board would control strategic decisions affecting the future of the company;    it would appoint the managementboard which would be responsible in law for the day to day mahagemenlOf the company under the supervision and control of the policy board.All matters within the competence of the policy board would have tobe referred to it by the.management board for decision.
^In the case of the nationalised industries the arguments are different.     Each board is responsible to a Minister and so theappointment of a statutory two tier board would mean three formallayers of authority with some overlapping of responsibility.$his is why the proposal for a statutory two tier structure Larejected .in paragraphs 14-17 of the White Paper on the NationaliseIndustries. Cmnd 7131     .     As is noted there the nationalised industries themselves do nob want statutory two tier boards, forthese reasons our proposal for two tier boards will apply on]j to companies.6     5Phe functions and responsibilities to be allocated to the l\ oboards are set out below:I    FUNCTIONS OF THE POLICY board a   Appointment of the Management Board and fixing the- remuneration of its members,b   Setting the company&apos;s objectives and approving itsstrategic plans (including major expansion andcontraction of the company&apos;s business),c   Monitoring the performance of the management board andapproving its decisions in certain areas to be specifiedbeforehand.d   Supervising the conduct by the management board of thecompany&apos;s financial affairs, in particular through theapproval of programmes for capital investment and forthe general allocation of resources to meet the company&apos;sobjectives.
e   Determining the company18 policy on takeovers of undmergers with other companies,f   Convening general meetings of shareholders:&apos; making recommendations to the shareholders on any matters.where this is required and on other matters as appropriate.g   Setting overall guidelines for employment and personnelpolicies,II MANAGEMENT board the Management Board, appointed by the Policy Board, will normally consist of the executives of the company at themost senior level, sitting under the chairmanship of the chief executive,     This is the body to which the law will assign theresponsibility for the day-to-day management of the company.The main functions and responsibilities of the ManagementBoard will be defined in the legislation.     This willdistinguish it from the type of executive sub-committee whichmay at present be appointed by the Board, and which only hassuch powers as may from time to time be delegated to it by theBoard,     The Management Board will need to be given the powersnecessary for the purpose of fulfilling its management role,I hough still under the supervision of the policy board. Themain task to be given to this board will be to manage thebusiness of the company in the same way as Table A of theCompanies Act 19&apos;l8 ascribes this task to the directors. Thiswill mean that in general the existing duties of directorsunder the Companies Act will apply in future to the managementr
CONKIMNTIALboard except where they are specifically assigned in bhe new legislation to the policy board to enable it to perform bheJunctions set out above.     In the broadest terms the managementboard v/ill be responsible for the running of the company subjectMore specifically, it   will be responsible for acting for Lhecompany in relation to third parties.     It will    have all theduties at present imposed upon directors in the law bo keepproper accounts and prepare the annual report and accounts andwill be required to submit them to the policy board.     It will. have special responsibility towards the policy board in a numberoi&apos; areas to ensure that the latter was in a position to can,;out its functions and responsibilities.     In particular, itwill need to report regularly on prospective business policyaud other fundamental questions and on such other important matters as may be specified by the policy board.V     Members of the management board   may    also be appointed to Ihepolicy board, but; the majority of the shareholder directors on bhepolicy board should not come from the management of the company,silica bhe independent supervision of management will be an essentialfunction of the policy board.8 The Government has decided that the tv/o tier system described above should be introduced into UK company law. However, except where employees claim their statutory right to board levelto the overall supervision and control of the j^oiicy board.
representation! in which case except where agreement is reached;.) the contrary the representation will be on the policy board, thei :   structure will be available as an option.- CompaniesLo rebain their unitary board structure, or to incorporate v/i th. in ;le board, will be able to do so.
