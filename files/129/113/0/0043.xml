ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS FOR THE AIR MINISTRYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury as the Ministers directly concerned are in dispute on this matter,I am, in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s direction, bringing it before the Cabinet for decision.2,     The Air Ministry wish to buy an electronic computer to handle the pay of the Royal Air Force and their personnel records.    they require a machine that could be delivered early in 1965 and which could come into operation not later than July, 1965.    These dates are deter-mined by the need to take account of the biennial review of R. A.F. payscales which will produce changes in pay taking effect from April, 1966.3,     Tenders for the supply of a suitable computer were invited lastyear on the understanding that because of the amount of preparatoryv/ork that would have to be done before the computer was delivered adecision as to which machine was to be bought would have to be takenearly in 1963.    Eleven firms were consulted; four United kingdom firms and one United States agreed that they could not meet this time-table.    Tenders were obtained from two United Kingdom, one Frenchand three United States firms.    Examination of these showed that only three of these were really worth considering, viz. , those from the twoUnited Kingdom firms, English Electric and Ferranti, and one UnitedStates firm, Remington Rand.    Officials of all the Departments con-cerned agreed that the Remington Ran machine is technically superior to the others, and gives the best value for the money; they therefore recommended that the Remington Rand machine should be purchasedfor the Air Ministry.4.     Ministers were consulted last January,    The Secretary of Statefor Air and the President of the Board of Trade favoured the purchaseof the United States machine.    The Minister of Aviation doubted whetherthe particular proposal was technically sound and he had misgivingsabout the issue of purchasing policy underlying it.5.     At the suggestion of a meeting of Ministers over which Ipresided, meetings were held between the technical experts of theDepartments concerned (including the Treasury) and those of the twoUnited Kingdom firms.    These meetings established that --1-C.(G3) 93 COPY NO.    52^27th May, 1963CABINET
(a) English Electric could supply equipment costing 1. 08 million which could be demonstrated inJanuary, 1964 and delivered in September, 1965,and of which part could come into operation inMarch, 1966.(b) Ferranti could supply equipment costing 1. 32 million which could be demonstrated inJanuary, 1964 and delivered in June, 1965 andof which pax*t could come into operation inJanuary, 1966,6.     These findings are accepted by all concerned.    They must be compared with what Remington Rand can offer.   Their equipment would cost  0.94 million (including duty):    it has been satisfactorilydemonstrated (last November) and could be delivered in December, 1964so as to come into operation in June, 1965,7.     It is important that the machine to be purchased should havebeen demonstrated as satisfactory.     Experience has shown that inthis rapidly developing industry to purchase an undemonstratedmachine is to risk expensive delays in bringing it into operation.8.     It follows that the requirements of the Air Ministry as to timingcan be met only by an immediate decision to buy the Remington Randequipment.     In view of the discussions which have taken place, the timetable on this basis is already tight.    The question for mycolleagues is therefore whether to buy the American equipment or to defer the project, probably until 1966-67.9.     There is a further consideration.    Associated ElectricalIndustries (A. E. I,) have contracted to supply the Air Ministry with a computer for controlling their stores.    This was due to be delivered in April, 1962 but A.E.I. were unable to meet this date and the timefor delivery was extended on condition that the computer passed itsfactory trials before 31st May, 1963.    These trials were begun lastweek and the machine ha3 failed them.    Formal notice had alreadybeen given to A. E. I, that in the event of failure the contract would berescinded;  in addition legal proceedings are contemplated againstA, E. I, to recover  450, 000 already paid to them.10.     The Secretary of State for Air would like to place an order fora United States machine to replace the A, E.I. machine.    It is generally accepted that there would be advantages if both machines, i. e. the onenow in dispute and the replacement for the A, S. I. failure, should be eitherboth British or both American,   so as to allow interchange of workbetween them.    The decision, therefore, on the A. E. I. replacementfor stores accounting is dependent on the decision in respect of thepresent order for pay and personnel records.11.     The President of the Board of Trade (which is the sponsoringDepartment for that part of the electronics industry which manufacturescomputers,) favours the purchase of the United States machine.-2-
12.     The Minister of Aviation feels that to buy large United Statescomputers for the Air Ministry will be damaging to the reputation ofthe United Kingdom computer industry, and that the need to encourageand help the development of this important industry outweighs the costand inconvenience of delay in carrying through the United Statoo project.13.     The financial consequences of a delay in getting the pay and records machine into operation at the expected date are substantial.It is estimated that a quarter of a million pounds a year on administra-tive costs is involved andV-that the delay will be of the order of twoyears.    The figure in respect of the stores machine is stated to beabout two million pounds a year and the delay here will be not lessthan a year.    From the Treasury angle, therefore, the administrativesavings resulting from early delivery are far from negligible.14,     If the decision is to buy United Kingdom machines, the Board ofTrade are anxious that this decision, which in any case will bedifficult to present, should not be presented as part of a new &quot;buyBritish&quot; campaign but should be related to the facts in particular cases.15,     Some elements in the United Kingdom industry are aware of andfeel strongly about the proposal to buy American.    Guch a proposal would cause a political row.16.     The questions for decision are:-(i)  whether to purchase Remington Rand equipment forthe Air Ministry pay and records and similar equip-ment (for the reasons given in paragraph 10 above)for their stores accounting, and to withstand anycomplaints from the computer industry and any political reactions; or(ii)  whether to defer both these projects and to invitefresh tenders with a view to being able to acceptUnited Kingdom equipment for them both, withthe delay and cost which it is accepted thiswould involve.J.
