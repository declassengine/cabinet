Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1963C. (63) 77 Copy No.     526th May, 1963CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and the Chancellorof the Duchy of LancasterOn 28th March both Houses of Parliament debated Government motions totake note of the Report of the Joint Select Committee on House of Lords Reformas agreed at Cabinet on 24th January, 1963 (C.C. (63) 6th Conclusions, Minute 6).The Report is summarised in C. (63) 6. It is clear that, subject to a few points of secondary importance, the recommendations of the Committee are acceptable tothe great majority of Government supporters and of the Opposition in bothHouses.2. In the course of the debates Ministers in both Houses undertook, if parliament should show itself ready to accept the recommendations of theCommittee, that the Government would make a statement of their legislativeintentions before Whitsun and would introduce a Bill during the lifetime of this parliament in time to be effective at the next General Election. It would be as well to introduce the Bill as soon as possible although the state of the programme make sit doubtful whether the Bill can be enacted during the current Session.3. We recommend that the Government should announce that thelegislation will give general effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations as they stand. There are only three points on which we recommend a departure:(a) Verification by Returning Officer. The Committee recommended that apeer who had surrendered should, as a condition of being nominatedas a Parliamentary candidate, be required to exhibit to the returning,officer a certificate that he had surrendered his peerage. This isunworkable. A returning officer does not in other ways attempt to verify the qualifications of a candidate, and in particular has no meansof determining whether a candidate is a peer. The recommendationcan simply be omitted.(b) Succession during an Election. The Committee recommended that a candidate for election to Parliament should, by accepting nomination,be deemed to have entered into an irrevocable undertaking to surrender any peerage he might inherit before the declaration of the poll.This is perhaps an unlikely event but it seems wrong to deny toa candidate who succeeds during an election at least the same period(one month) in which to decide as would be available to a sittingMember of Parliament. lib both Houses Opposition spokesmenaccepted the need for reconsideration. We recommend that theelection should be allowed to proceed in such a case and that the candidate, if successful, should be given the same time as any othersitting Member of Parliament in which to come to a decision.(c) Succession  by  a Sitting Member  of Parliament. The  committee recommended that a sitting Member of the House of Commons should only have one month from succession in which to surrender.It was argued in debate that this period might be too short in thecase of a Member who was seriously ill at the relevant time: equally,CONFIDENTIAL2456 (
a Member who was abroad might not learn of his succession in time totake the necessary formal steps within the month. We recommendthat there should be an extension of time in the case of illness, and thatthe month should not run when Parliament was prorogued or stoodadjourned for more than a short period.4. There are certain other points that we wish to draw to the attention ofour colleagues.(a) Titles. There was general but not universal support for the Committee&apos;srecommendations that on surrender a peer and his relatives should lose their right to use titles. In our view the Government should stand by these recommendations. As to the means of enforcement on which the Committee made no recommendation legislation will berequired to deal with the titles of a peer and his wife. We do not thinkit would be practicable to control by legislation the use of courtesytitles, which are a matter of social convention.(b) Irish Peers. There was some support in both Houses for proposals thatIrish peers should, contrary to the recommendations of the Committee,have conferred on them some modified rights to membership of theHouse of Lords.We are in favour of adhering to the Committee&apos;s recommendations and making no change in the position of Irish peers beyond conferringon them, if otherwise qualified, the right to be elected for anyconstituency in the United Kingdom and an unfettered right to voteat Parliamentary elections.(c) Subsequent Ennoblement after Surrender. There was some criticism ofthe Committee&apos;s recommendation that a person who had surrenderedhis peerage should not be subsequently ennobled otherwise than bythe conferment on him of a Life Peerage. We think it better to follow the Committee&apos;s recommendation on this point, at least in the firstinstance.(d) Lord Longford. Ministers undertook to consider the special case ofLord Longford. The details of this case are explained in Annex A tothis Memorandum. As far as we have been able to ascertain there isonly one other peer in a similar position (Lord Trevethin and Oaksey),who is unlikely to wish to surrender. In spite of the sympathyexpressed for Lord Longford, we think that it would be wrong to make an exception in his case, because, if we once embarked upon a consideration of the motives which led a peer of first creation to accept this peerage, it would be difficult to refuse special consideration to otherpeers of first creation who might, for one reason or another, wish toreturn to the House of Commons.5.   A draft statement, to be made in both Houses, is attached as Annex B.HAILSHAM.I. M.2nd May, 1963.3-
Annex ALORD LONGFORD&apos;S CASELord Longford holds four peerages (a) the Irish earldom of Longford,(b) the Irish barony of Longford, (c) the United Kingdom barony of Silchester and(d) the United Kingdom barony of Pakenham. He inherited the earldom andbarony of Longford and the barony of Silchester from his brother who died in1961. He was, however, created Baron Pakenhalm in 1945 and is therefore bothan hereditary peer and a peer of first creation. Lord Longford asked that special consideration should be given to his case because he was created Baron Pakenhamin circumstances in which it wa$, virtually certain that he would one day become a member of the House of Lords as an hereditary peer (his elder brother beingunlikely to have any children). He was, therefore, in any event destined for theHouse of Lords and was not deliberately accepting a political career in the Houseof Lords in preference to one in the Commons. If the Joint Select Committee&apos;srecommendations were implemented Without any special provision being made for lord Longford, he would not be able to surrender effectively because, although he could surrender the Silchester barony and although the Irish earldom andbarony are irrelevant, he would still remain Baron Pakenham and could not divesthimself of this peerage.Lord Longford has emphasised that he has not yet decided whether or not hewould surrender should it be made possible for him.Although strictly speaking on all fours with Lord Longford&apos;s case, the caseof Lord Trevethin and Oaksey is really very different. He was created BaronOaksey in the United Kingdom peerage in 1947 when he was already a Judge ofthe Court of Appeal, in recognition of his services in presiding over the Nurembergtribunal. He was subsequently appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary andretired in 1957. He is the younger son of the first Lord Trevethin and inheritedthe Trevethin barony on the death of his elder brother in 1959. There is no possibility of his wishing to surrender so as to make himself eligible for the commons.Annex statement BY THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL ANDTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster. In the course of the debates held in both Houses on 28th March onmotions to take note of the Report of the Joint Select Committee on House ofLords Reform the Government undertook that, if the debates should show thatthe proposals of the Committee were generally acceptable to Parliament, theywould introduce the necessary legislation during the lifetime of this Parliament intime to be effective at the next General Election. The Government also undertook to make a statement of their proposals before the Whitsun recess.2. The Government have given the most careful consideration to the opinions expressed in the course of those debates both here and in another place. In their view it has been plainly established that the recommendations are generally acceptable to both Houses and I can therefore state that it is our intention tointroduce legislation to give effect to them in time to take effect at the next GeneralElection. It may not be practicable to secure the passage of the necessary Billthis Session, but it is the Governments intention to introduce it at the latest atthe beginning of the next Session.3. The Government are prepared to accept, and incorporate in the Bill theywill bring forward, all the Committee&apos;s recommendations with the followingexceptions on points of detail which I believe will command general support.First, we believe the recommendation that a peer who has surrendered shouldbe required to exhibit to the returning officer a certificate of his surrender is notworkable in practice and should be omitted.
Second, we propose to allow a candidate who succeeds to a peerage while heis standing for Parliament to proceed with the election and, if successful, to havethe same period (a month) in which to decide whether to surrender as if he were a sitting Member.Third, it is proposed that in calculating the period in which a sitting Memberof Parliament has to make up his mind whether to surrender a peerage to whichhe has succeeded, time should not run while Parliament is dissolved, proroguedor adjourned for more than three days, nor for any period during which the speaker certifies that the Member is incapacitated from acting through illness orfor some other reason.
