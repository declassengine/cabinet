copy NO.CABINETELECTRONIC COMPUTERS FOR THE AIR MINISTRYMemorandum bjy-thei President of th e Board of Tr adgThe memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury touches on two points on which I should like to comment -(i)  The commercial policy implications of deferring theAir Ministry programme in order to be able to buyBritish.(ii)  The implications for the British industry of buyingone, or possibly two, Remington Rand computersfor the Air Ministry.2.     If we can covertly give marginal benefit of the doubt in favour ofBritish equipment there need be no embarrassment internationally;  wehave in fact done it for computers in a number of cases.3.     Plowever, as the Chief Secretary points out, tenders v/ere in this case invited from British and foreign manufacturers in relation to aparticular Air Ministry timetable and there would seem to be serious difficulties in presenting a decision to defer the timetable otherwise than as a decision to buy British.    Unless, however, such a decision can be presented differently we should openly appear to be moving towards a buyBritish policy at a time when it is in our own interest to persuade theUnited States Government to moderate the extent of its own &quot;BuyAmerican&quot; policy.4.     It seems to me that the British industry cannot escape fromdamage to its prestige either way.    If the Air Ministry programme ispostponed it must become public knowledge that this has been donebecause the British industry cannot currently compete.5.     It is not the case that by postponement of the timetable we shouldbe giving British firms time to design and develop some new Britishcomputer which might be competitive in the commercial market at homeand overseas.   The British machines from which we should have to choose are all in an advanced stage of development.   The English ElectricCompany already have a good order book for the equipment which theyhave offered to the Air Ministry.    To defer the programme and buyBritish.might mean one, or two, more orders for some firm&apos;s orderbook.     It is difficult to accept the view that a Government order for one,-1-C. (63) 9828th May, 1963
or possibly two, machines is of crucial importance to the firms in building up their competitive position.    British industry cannot hope to establish its competitive strength by relying on Government orders and I doubt if modifying Government requirements so as to matchwhat British manufacturers are able to offer at any particular timereally helps to strengthen the industry.6.     Industry frequently urges that the Government should beimaginative and take the lead in adopting computers.   The Air Ministryproject represents an imaginative lead by the Government in thisrespect.    To postpone the Air Ministry timetable will delay theacquisition by Government users of advanced experience as well asdefer the savings in time and money which can be achieved and wewould end up v/ith a machine which was not so cheap and perhaps not as good for the work as the Remington Rand machine.    Thus to defer the programme v/ould seem to be a retrograde step which isnot matched by corresponding benefits either to the industry or tothe Government.F.E.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.28th May, 1963-2-
