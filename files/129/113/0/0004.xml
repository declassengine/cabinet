Office of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science,19th March, 1963cJMliJL COPY NO. m 5219th March, 1963u CABINETMEMBERS&apos; AND MINISTERS&apos; pay memorandum hy..the J^ord President,of the Counciland Minister for science have read the paper C. (63) 50 of 18th March on members&apos; and Ministers&apos; salary by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.2.      I cannot accept that paragraph 2 (under which a Commonssalary of  3, 000 should be added to existing Ministerial salaries)would, as the paper claims, &quot;do justice to Ministers&quot;.    On thecontrary it would do the grossest injustice to Ministers who are members of the House of Lords.      My colleagues will remember that I accepted the last arrangement, by which Lords. ministers were put at a  750 disadvantage only under protest.    I could inno circumstances accept it again or in this scale.    If Ministers&apos;salaries are to be raised let them be raised openly and honourablyand without discrimination between the Houses of Parliament.Otherwise let us leave them alone.HAILS HAM.
