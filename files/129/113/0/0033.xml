C.,(631.83 COPY NQ. J52^CABINET\\SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealIt has been agreed between the French and ourselves that thereshould be two conferences on satellite communications, the first atAmbassadorial or Senior Official level in Paris on 20th May and a ministerial conference in London in mid-July.2,     The Agenda for the conference in Paris has now been agreed and is as follows:-(i)   Forms of European co-operation,(ii)   Negotiations with the United States,(iii)   Other international implications.Under the first item of the Agenda the French have agreed that theywill permit a full exchange of views on how satellite communicationsshould be organised internationally.3.     It would appear from the arguments that have preceded agree-ment to the Agenda that there are fundamental differences between theFrench and ourselves over the role that Europe should play in theestablishment of satellite communications.     The United KingdomGovernment would favour the concept of a global satellite communica-tion system organised on as comprehensive an international basis aspossible on the understanding that the United Kingdom would make an appropriate contribution on technical and other aspects, to its develop-ment, provision and operation.    Such a system would be created co-operatively and gradually by a number of countries - the United Statesleading - who would wish to participate.    But it would be premature to declare too explicitly at this stage that we should in no circumstancesseek to promote a system independently of the United States.    On theother hand it appears that the French aim is co-operation with theUnited States in a limited way and for a limited period, acquiringUnited States know-how in the process and then throwing the UnitedStates over and establishing a European system under French leader-ship using French equipment as far as possible.    We do not considerthat this proposal is practicable nor that it is likely to put Europeinto an advantageous bargaining position.-1-
4.     Our tactics should be to ensure that any such basic differences between the tvvO countries are brought out in the open at the outset ofthe conference.    We should say that the best way of achieving our aim is to have a satellite communication system provided and operated on a genuinely international basis right from the start so that there isno purely United States system to contend with at a later stage.    Itwould then be difficult for any country to have a monopoly or to breakaway and to establish a competing system,    Since the transatlantictraffic accounts for 80 per cent of the intercontinental traffic of theworld a competing system that did not carry a substantial portion ofthis traffic could not be financially viable for many years, if ever.5.     There is likely to be strong pressure led by the French infavour of some form of European organisation and equally for some form of European co-operation in the provision of launchers, launchingsites and satellites.    As regards the former we think it would be a mistake to establish any form of European organisation until we knowhow satellite communications are to be developed on an internationalbasis since such an organisation should stem from specific needswhich have yet to be established.    Other considerations are that wemust at all times safeguard our Commonwealth interests;  and wewould wish to derive the maximum benefit from our membership ofthe European Launcher Development Organisation.      But there maywell be an immediate need for some form of European consultativemachinery at intergovernmental level to discuss these aspects ofsatellite communications which do not come within the province ofEuropean P St T Administrations with a view to the formulation ofan overall European policy.    It is premature to consider whether aspecial organisation to promote Europe&apos;s contribution to satellite communications is necessary.Gonclusionsr6.     (a)   We should maintain our concept of a global systemorganised on as comprehensive an international basis as possible(always provided that the terms of entry were satisfactory to us) asagainst the French concept of participation in a United States system for a strictly limited period.(b)   We should oppose the immediate formation of a formalEuropean organisation but should take a lead in proposing the creationof continuing machinery for European consultation on all aspects ofsatellite communications with a view to the formulation of policy,E. H,Foreign Office, S. W. 1.14th May, 1963.-2-
