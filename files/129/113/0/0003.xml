secret7THE RESHAPING OF BRITISH RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of transport at its meeting on 14th March (C.C. (63) 16th Conclusions, Minute 7), theCabinet invited me to submit proposals for:(a) a revised draft of the Government statement to be made on 27th March,the day of publication of the Railways&apos; Report;(b) securing the most effective public presentation of the proposals in theRailways&apos; Report;(c) ensuring the implementation of the Railways Board&apos;s proposals, whenappropriate, as rapidly as possible.Draft Government Statement2. A revised version of the Government statement is,at Annex I. This takes account of my colleagues&apos; views. It has been agreed, where appropriate, by theChairman of the British Railways Board.Public Presentation3. The arrangements now contemplated, both by the Railways Board andby the Government, are at Annex II.Implementation of Railways&apos; proposals. Under the Transport Act, 1962, the Railways Board are, broadly speaking,free to proceed with the implementation of their proposals, except where these(a) involve the closure of passenger, lines or stations;(b) require substantial new investment;(c) contemplate fare increases in the London Passenger Transport Area.5. The Board recognise that these proposals, by their scope and nature,require examination in some detail by the Government, and consultation withthe interests mainly affected.Consultations by the Railways Board6. Where the Board are concerned, a certain amount of consultation, on particular aspects of their plans, has already taken place (e.g., with the national coal Board). They will now carry this process much further. The most important of the consultations to be undertaken by the Board, however, is with the railwaytrade unions. To avoid any suggestion of failure to consult (as occurred in relationto the workshops), Dr. Beeching has decided not to give formal notice of anyof the passenger closures in Appendix II of his Report until some four weeks after its publication. This arrangement would fit in well with a Commons debate in the last week of April. It will, too, enable the Railways Board (i) to discuss their proposals with the railwaymen&apos;s national representatives, under the agreed joint consultative procedure, (ii) to get ahead with the usual local consultations, againunder the agreed procedure, about individual proposals for closure.Printed for the Cabinet.

Action by the government. An Interdepartmental Working Party, under Ministry of TransportChairmanship, is urgently examining the merits &quot;i the railways&apos; proposals. special attention is being given to their implications for(i) Government policies and plans (including employment);(ii) local government, industry, other forms of transport, &amp;c.      ,Initial responsibility for work on the various problems has been allocated amongDepartments. Also there will be consultations with the appropriate representative bodies (e.g., local authority associations, bus and road haulage interests, major industrial associations, &amp;c).Machinery for Effecting Closures8. The Transport Users&apos; Consultative Committees&apos;.-A lot depends on the speed and efficiency with which these Committees and my own Department -carry out their responsibilities in regard to passenger closures. The new procedure under Section 56 of the Transport Act, 1962, has therefore been explained to, and discussed with, the Transport Users&apos; Consultative Committee (T.U.C.C.) AreaChairmen. Special reference was made to their relationship with the traffic commissioners (in regard to bus services), and to the practicability of expeditingbusiness by dividing the Committees into panels. They have also been invited tostrengthen their secretariats, where necessary.9.   I have powers to increase the number of the T.U.C.C&apos;s.  This possibilityhas been discussed with the Area Chairmen, who think it will not be necessary:but I shall take action quickly if need be.10. Ministry of Transport.-Th.Q Railways group in my own department was recently reorganised, largely with a view to work on the Railways Board&apos;sexpected proposals, whether for closure or for new investment. arrangements have been made for consulting other interested Departments, and also for securing,via the Divisional Road Engineers, the views of Highway Authorities, on any roadproblems resulting from rail closures. I understand that similar steps are beingtaken in Scotland.11. I hope that my colleagues will feel satisfied, that all suitable preparationshave been made for dealing with the Railways Board&apos;s proposals, and that I mayhave their help, especially in the consultations that must take place between my own Department and theirs, in ensuring that decisions are reached as quickly aspossible.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,18th March, 1963.ANNEX draft PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON railways board PROPOSALS-DRAFT EThe Railways Board&apos;s proposals for reshaping the British railway system havebeen published to-day. These proposals flow from the most massive compilationand systematic analysis of information about our railways ever attempted.They offer a firm prospect of a modern railway system suited to the country&apos;future needs. The present subsidy is about  150 million per annum, and this vastsum is a measure of the railways&apos; claim on economic resources which could be betterused elsewhere.
The Board&apos;s lucid analysis and bold, proposals fully accord with theGovernments expectations. The aim, which is wholly consistent with theGovernments policy of growth, modernisation and redevelopment, is to produce an efficient and modern railway system handling those traffics technically best suited to raih The Government agree that extensive reshaping.of our railways is, nowessential.-- . -;\ ..*-,,.)     . ,,   .But the changes proposed will affect many people. Therefore further careful study and consultation by the Government will be necessary,. The Railways Board,for their part, will of course be following the agreed procedures for consultationwith their staff.I should like now to deal with three main points. First, freight services.Clearly, rationalisation here is of the greatest importance, not merely to therailways&apos; finances, but to industry and commerce. For example, by reducing railcosts and improving methods of distribution, the Railways Board believe that upto 7s. 6d. per ton could be saved on the carriage of some types of coal by rail. Onfreight as a whole the Board intend to discuss the future possibilities with their customers. They will also be discussing the implications of these proposals withother transport interests.Secondly, passenger services. The most controversial part of the plan is thewithdrawal of many passenger services. If better railway services are to be provided to meet the real needs of the nation, such measures are necessary. But I must emphasise that, in the procedures to be followed when passenger closures are proposed, Parliament has laid down very extensive safeguards. Under theTransport Act, 1962, each proposal must be published in advance. Objections canbe made to the Transport Users Consultative Committees, which will report to meon any hardship involved. No opposed closure may be carried out without myconsent. For my part, I shall take into account all important factors, includingsocial and defence considerations, the pattern of industrial development and possible effects on roads and road traffic.The Government are well aware that there will be some special problems, forexample [in the more remote parts of Scotland, Wales and indeed England, somesuburban areas, and in serving the sea-links with Northern Ireland] [some remoteareas]. I must therefore give a lot of attention to the adequacy of alternativetransport. A widespread network of bus services already exists, and my consent to closure can be made conditional on the provision and maintenance of additionalservices.I recently announced the arrangements for co-operation and co-ordinationmade between the Railways and London Transport Boards under the new transport act. The Government will closely consider those passages in the Report onsuburban commuter services in London and elsewhere.My third point is on staff.-The effect of the Board&apos;s proposals on railwayemployees must be of special concern to the Board, the unions and the Government.Our railways will require fewer men in future. At present the best estimate of thetotal reduction over the next few years in the number of jobs among the staffaffected by these proposals is of the order of 70,000. But most of this reduction would be effected by normal wastage and control of recruitment. Actual dischargesare not expected to be more than a small proportion of the total staff reduction.The number will depend largely on how far it is possible to arrange for men tomove to other work and different areas.Even so, there will be problems for those displaced. The Government will do all they can to help in re-training and placing them. We specially welcome therecent agreement between the Board and the unions representing the Conciliationgrades. This does two things: first, it facilitates transfers from one part of thesystem to another; and, second, it provides fair compensation for those for whomwork can no longer be found on the railways.The Government will proceed speedily with their consultations and discussions,so that we can soon make a fuller statement. We shall pay special regard to thelong-term requirements of particular areas [including those arising from plannedmovements of population and industry] and to the relationship of the railways toother forms of transport.
