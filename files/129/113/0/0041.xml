CHAPTERIlNTROD!.&apos;C.r:ONPermanent Representatives from several NATO nations to the North Atlantic Council, have stated a need for moreparticipation by European NATO nations, in nuclear weaponsmatters as one means for increasing the. cohesiveness andsolidarity of the Alliance.    The Supreme Allied Commander,Europe has stated a. requirement for ballistic missileswith which to neutralizes insofar as is possible, theSoviet nuclear threat; to Allied Command, Europe,    A sea-based, multilateral ballistic missile force which wouldfill a significant: portion of SACEUR:s requirement wouldalso be a. dramatic demonstration of the continuing unity of the Alliance and its ability to continue to meetchallenges to Alliance security.There are, of course, difficulties involved.in implementing the multilateral force.    The difficultiescan be overcome if the participants have the necessary will to create a cohesive political, legal and military multi-lateral entity.The concept of the multilateral force presented hereinrepresents a political., legal and military judgment, as to thepreferred manner in which an effective, mixed manned fightingforce could be initially conceived, operated and sustained.The concept will, of course, be subject to modificationand to further development and modernization as the Forceproceeds through the phases of implementation.   this might mean that, the initial mode of deployment and the initial arrangement for weapons control (a subject nottreated in this paper) could be reviewed and, if necessary,modified or supplemented as experience was gained,1-1EC RET
CHAPTERIIMILITARY PURPOSE OF THE M&apos;JL.TILAT.ERAL FORCESACEUR has stated a requirement, for approximately600 MRBMs to be used primarily against Che nuclear threat;to Allied Command Europe.   He has recommended&apos; that thesemissiles be composed of a reix of land and sea basedsystems.   A .sea-based, multilateral.force of&apos;200 MRBMswould meet a significant portion of SACEUR&apos;s requirements,and, at the. same time, would pose a credible threat to the soviets.As regards targets for this force, the following information is cogent:a. There are expected to be well over 100time-urgent targets on the ACE threatlist in the 1968 time period.   The/missiles of the MLF will be effective against these targets&apos;.b. SACEUR!s staff has suggested that missiles othe MLF could be used against these timerurgent; targets.. c.   When SACEUR3s strike plan is coordinated .;&apos;.&quot;.; -     with the strike plans of external forces,adjustments in targeting could be made so that the most suitable weapon in the alliance arsenal will be used againsteach target; in the total nuclear threat.- to the Alliance.
V; CHAPTERIII . VA wide variety of factors govern the optimum initialsize, and composition of the Multilateral Force capable ofproviding 200 weapons responsive to SACEURls require-ments.    The governing factors include availability offinancial, material and personnel resources to build andman the Force, the proper number of weapons per hull, andthe timely provision of a fully trained force to NATOcommanders.&apos;As a result of its studies of the over-all. problem theUS proposes an initial force of 2.5 surface ships, eachequipped with eight POLARIS A-3 missiles, operating froma main and possibly a satellite base.    This Force is   -sufficiently large to have, true military and political significance.    In addition, it can be developed anddeployed at a reasonable cost:, and on a timely basis.    TheForce would possess a high degree of survivability becauseof its dispersed operations over wide ocean areas, ,in theshoal waters and straits of littoral Europe and becauseof the protection it would be. afforded by the shieldo  Europe and supporting forces such as the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom barrier, and Alliance ASW andother forces.    The MT.F ships would be clearly warships,analogous to naval, auxiliary or depot ships.   Theirstatus as MLF missile ships could be determined only byvisual as distinct; from electronic observation.Force program schedules and costs are contained in chapter XII. . ^  .III-l. EC-RET
IV-1IV;THE WEAPONThe Polaris A-3 missile will have, a variable range capa-bility from about 500 nautical miles to about 2500 nauticalmiles.    Its high yield pay load coupled with its CEP accuracy of 1 mile at maximum range makes it extremely effective against a majority of SACEURcs predicted targets.    The pre-dieted reliability of the Polaris A-3, based on the largecollection of operational test data obtained from launching of missiles of the Polaris family, indicates that seven outof ten targets taken under fire will be destroyed.The Polaris A-3 solid propellant missiles, can bemaintained in a continuous 15 minute readiness state or,if conditions of world tension require, the missiles can be held,in a one minute readiness state for about 1 hour.    Themissiles can be launched at. a rate of 2 per minute.   Detailedmissile characteristics are contained in Appendix I.

The100 day endurance: requirement can be met through,use. of the , -volume assigned as dry cargo space for fuel, refrigerated anddry stores and other consumables.

CHAPTER &apos;VI  -THE BASES  &apos; .   *    .A shore base would be required in the European.&apos;area to support adequately a MLF of 25 ships.    Themain base would be the administrative and operationalhub of the MLF.    The MLF executive and command echelonsand their communications center would &quot;be located on themain base together with the facilities for weaponssystem maintenance and repair, missile assembly and stowagesubsistence, and berthing of off-patrol &apos;s&apos;hip&apos;s crews andfor Force training.If operationally necessary, a satellite base in the&apos;European area could he. used tor. the replacement of&apos; in-operative ship&apos;s missiles and would contain facilitiesfor missile stowage and minor repair and maintenance.The satellite base could enable ships operating innorthern areas to replace inoperative missiles with a.relatively short off-patrol, station time vis-a-vis thelong off-station time which would be required to returnto the main-base.   The satellite base would also inherentlyprovide, for dispersal of re-load missiles.   For operationalsimplicity, one, base might be located in the mediterranean and the other on the Atlantic-Coast. . - -Repair of MLF ships would be accomplished at existingcivilian or naval shipyards on contract to the MLF.    If,in the opinion of the participating MLF members, repairin civilian-owned shipyards was too risky because of sabotage possibilities or the possibility of delays causedby labor, strikes, a ship repair capability could be&apos;. .provided at the main base.Important, criteria to be considered in base siteselection include the time/distance to patrol station, the availability of sufficient space.to meet the explosive
distance safety requirementsi a harbor dredged to at least.40 feet, an easily accessible airfield to be used forlogistics airlifts, including missiles, and a surroundingcommunity capable of abosrbing the approximately 10,000people directly and indirectly associated with the MLF,&apos;&quot;       The main base would require! a total of about 5000acres and the satellite base a total of about 3500 acres.The bases can be divided into functional uuccSoviss t&amp; sihsre  -is insufficient land available in any one location tomeet the total acreage&apos;requirements.The main base would support&quot; approximately 430 officers,2600 enlisted personnel and 1400.civilians.    These totalsinclude the MLF executive and command staff, the off- --. .patrol ship crews and about 600 indigenous civilian, basemaintenance personnel..   The satellite - base, would - supportabout 20 officers, 200 enlisted personnel and 100 indigenouscivilian base maintenance personnel.Details of the facilities to be installed at each base,the personnel, base loading ana a general layout diagramare contained.in Appendix LIT and in Figure VI-1.VI -2

CHAPTER.   .. - . vii        !].&apos;CONCEPT OF operations the MLF surface ships, with missiles in a 15 minutereadiness for firing, would operate anywhere in the oceanarea which extends outward from the European littoral,   ...limited only by the 2500 nautical mile missile range.   MLFships could, for example, operate in the Mediterranean,..Norwegian, North and Irish Seas and in the Atlantic Ocean.Operating areas could easily be varied between close-in and deep areas as required by world tension in peacetime ;or by the condition of war which affects the area of NATOresponsibility.    The &apos;20 knot speed of the SMS, coupled withthe 100 day endurance capability, will provide an extremelymobile force.    The ships will be capable, of making frequentand rapid shifts as required by the existing situation.In order to reduce the probability of detection and attack of the MLF ships by Soviet submarines, aircraft orsurface ships, the MLF could use the shallow water areas, 1island passages or inland waterways of the. European littoral.MLF ships could also operate in the open ocean areas,steering random courses at random speeds.    Under conditionsof international tension or obvious, efforts to track,&apos; they .would use speed and ocher measures to forestall positiveidentification.   The. MLF ships would all. normally operate under conditions of electronic silence.    The ships, however,!would in all aspects be warships, similar in appearanceto auxiliary ships such as depot ships or re-supply ships.During periods of increased world tension, the MLFships could join convoys and move from one convoy, to anotheras feasible and to the extent permitted by weapons readiness.The ships could also move for-protection into areas in whichmajor NATO air and sea forces were operating.VII^lr
MLF operations will require random transits through and operation in several NATO.commanders&apos; areas.    Thesetransits and operations should be coordinated at the NATOarea commander level.. .-&apos;In order to achieve the desired coordination, but at thesame time to retain operational control, the MLF Commandershould report for duty to NATO area commanders such asCINCAFMED and CINCHAN.    The MLF Commander could facilitatecoordination&apos;by assigning a liaison officer to each of thearea commander&apos;s staffs.&apos;Targets for the MLF would be assigned by SACEUR as an integral part of his &quot;Nuclear Strike Plan&quot; and in accordancewith his targeting and target, coordination policy.    Similarly,retargeting or shifts in target assignments would be ordered by SACEUR.The MLF Commission would release MLF weapons to SACEUR.SACEUR, on receipt of the political weapons release, wouldissue the necessary launch orders direct to MLF ships at thesame time as they were issued to other components of hisnuclear retaliatory force.The MLF ships would operate on a two year overhaulcycle.   A new MLF ship, for example, would depart the main,base for a 24 to 26 day patrol.   At the end of this first . -patrol, it would return to a convenient MLF-nation portfor 4 to 5 days to replenish fuel and stores and to &quot;show the flag,&quot;   After replenishment, the ship would return toits patrol status.   After six patrol-replenishment cycles,the ship would return to the main base for ten days.During that ten day period any necessary missile replace-menc and weapons system maintenance would be accomplishedand the crew would be rotated.    Ship repair would be    &apos;accomplished at a nearby civilian or naval shipyard.VII-2
SECRET;On completion of the 10 day maintenance period at the main base, the ship would resume its patrol-replenishment cycle for another six months.   After foursix-month patrol-replenishment-maintenance-cycles, theMLF ship would, after off-loading the missile module,proceed to an available civilian or naval shipyard for a45 day overhaul.The foregoing cycle of operation would provide aminimum of 20 ships (160 missiles) continuously at sea in peacetime.   About 22 to&apos;23 ships could be kept at sea during periods of tension.   The maximum potentialfire power would be available when most needed      either as a deterrent, or if deterrence fails, as a powerful and survivable striking force.VII-3

epfppT^ jnj. iu. 11;.    CHAPTER       . -VIII   ; &apos;    -MULTILATERAL FORCE&quot;ORGANIZATIONThe MLF will be&apos; unique In having no specific govern-.merit from which to draw ulr:u&apos;:-ce political anc legalauthority, financial, macaa: ..,1 and personnel resources,and the support&apos; services which national governments givenational forces.   In addition, the ML? will require arrange--ments for the planning, conduct and support of operations in peace and wars including coordination of ship operations and integration of targeting with.NATO.    The MLF organizationtherefore must be a political,, legal and military entity, withcapabilities of its own, but dependent upon the resources and support, of member nations for its continued existence.When considering the multilateral organizational require-,ments, it is necessary to distinguish-between those functions which could be discharged by nations individually3 thosewhich would require group action by the participating nations,and those which could be carried out within the framework of nato. &apos;. - . .    &apos; *A number of functions could be. discharged by nationsindividually, but subject to mutually agreed criteria.Personnel, functions-such as recruiting^ preliminary training,discipline for certain major offensesreassignment and ;retirement could be accomplished on a national basis.. A wide range of material procurement&apos; and logistic, support, functions -e.g, , ship construction and overhaul, missile production,construction of base facilities,- and producer logistics ingeneral   could be provided under contract to Individualgovernments or government.agencies;,  - Under broader terms,the functions necessary for procurement of ships, missiles,and trained crews could be undertaken by an executive agent,probably within an individual nation which would be responsive to the policy and financial supervision of the participatingnations.    It: appears essential that the preliminary agreementVlll-l -
provide for taking the initial steps under the latter -arrangement in order to avoid unreasonable delay incommencing the MLF development,There are a substantial number of functions xtfhichwould require collective action by the participating nationssome of which are: .../( - -- (1)   Budget formulation and control, of funds.(2)   Legal macters including- establishment of-..&apos;legal entity, relationship of the MLF&quot; with NATO and with NATO nations, and claims. . -(3)    Disciplinary matters and security policies.(4)   MLF policy, doc trine,-reguia tions and-standard operating procedures..(5) . MLF composition including type and numberof ships and missiles, type and number of bases and facilities, and variations in personnel, allocations. &apos; .(6)    Political release of weapons and proceduresto be- used for weapons control. ...  -It is hoped that from the terms of. the Preliminary -Agreement an organizational framework would evolve which contained sufficient authority to create a skeletalorganization.    The detailed treaty would establish the finalForce organization, its responsibilities and the responsibilities of.the ratifying nations..It would appear necessary to establish specific  .organizational elements to perform for the MLF certain ofthe functions now performed for national forces by their
ECRE.T.respective governments. The principal organizationalcomponent could be the MLF Commission.    Subordinate tothe MLF Commission would be the military element headed by a MLF-Executive or MLF Commander.The ML? Commission would&apos;be comprised of representa-.tives of the participating nations responsible for developing Force policy and for general, including financial,supervision of the MLF Executive or MLF Commander responsiblefor the details of Force management and operation,    Initially,the functions of the MLF Commission could be carried outby a Preparatory Commission established by the PreliminaryAgreement to negotiate a. detailed agreement, on the Force&apos;for ratification by the governments. ... Over . the - long term the functions of the MLF Commission might be dischargedin a number of alt:ernac:e ways.    If the members were the nato Permanent: Representatives ,of the participating nations,this Commission membership would assure coordination withNATO, facilitate adding new nations to the MLF and make possible future transfer of functions, to the MAC if thisbecomes desirable.The Executive or MLF Commander would be designated.by the MLF Commission.    He would be responsible for the detailed management and command of the MLF subject to thepolicy, direction and general supervision of the MLF Commission.The MLF Executive should be given sufficient freedom ofaction, under Commission Policy controls, to manage and to direct the force efficiently.    The choice between a ForceCommander (one-level with staff) and a two-level executive(Force Commander under a civilian Executive, analogous,.    &apos;to a governmental ministry) would be made on the following considerations;  .    -(1)   The Force Commander would have a simplerand more direct, command chain.   He would be less conspicuouslysupra-national and staffing with qualified personnel wouldprobably be easier.    Relationship with NATO commanders wouldbe more direct. v.;.&apos;&apos;- iVIII-3
SECRET

(2) The two-level Executive-Commander relationship is analogous to the Defense organization of national governments and clearly preserves civilian control.

The one-level Force Commander arrangement seems preferable at least initially. Early designation of the MLF Commander by the Preparatory or MLF Commission should be considered to permit early assumption of responsibility for Executive functions. It would also permit necessary liaison between the commander ultimately responsible for the management and operation of the MLF with the preparatory Commission, the MLF Commission, national navies and others performing planning functions and taking implementing actions.

The MLF Executive or Commander would control day-to-day operations of the MLF ships and would coordinate their movements with other forces through designated NATO Area Commanders, responsive to SACEUR&apos;s weapons control requirements. Weapon targets would be assigned by SACEUR. Political release of MLF weapons would be made by the MLF Commission to SACEUR.

COMMUNICATIONS

Communications would be required by the MLF for: political control of weapons release by the Heads of Government participating in the MLF to their Executive Council representatives, to the NAC, and to SACEUR; military execution of the political weapons release decision from SACEUR to MLF ships at sea; day-to-day operational control of MLF ships by Major NATO Commanders through Commander MLF; and administrative and logistics support for MLF ships by the Commander MLF, the MLF Executive, Executive Commission and participating governments.

Unreliable communications can blunt the effectiveness of the MLF. The reliability of MLF operational communications, particularly those used for weapons control, must be of the highest order. Redundant circuitry and a multiplicity of stations should be provided to ensure continuous reliable communications under all foreseeable conditions of degradation. As a goal, the survivability of communications should equal the survivability afforded command.

Voice communications for political weapons control can be provided over nationally-leased military or civilian circuits which already exist among Heads of Government, the NAC and SACEUR. Extension of these circuits to include the MLF Executive Council is feasible.

SACEUR currently has access to NATO-nation maritime broadcast stations and direct radio communications to assigned surface seaborne nuclear retaliatory forces. With few exceptions, there are sufficient maritime broadcasts in the NATO communication complex to provide reliable and, within limitations, survivable communications to MLF ships in envisaged areas of operations.


SACEUR should have the capability to elicit fromassigned forces nearly instantaneous military response to the political weapons release decision.    SACEURtherefore should be able to control directly NATOmaritime broadcast stations covering the several &apos;operational areas.    This direct control will enable SACEURto deliver weapons control messages directly and nearlysimultaneously over all assigned broadcast stations.These broadcast communications would be augmented by direct, transmissions to surface seaborne forces.The MLF Organization will require communications toexercise operational, administrative and logistics functions.A modest Base Communications Center, including a MLF-ownedtransmitter site, can meet the requirements of the MLForganizational heads.    The Communications Center would bethe hub for communications with SACEUR and.other Major.NATO .Commanders, the maritime broadcasts assigned to effectoperational control of ships on&apos; patrol, ships in transit or .in training, national project officers, and to any satellitebases.The facilities of NATO and member nations should beused to the maximum extent practicable to meet MLF communi-cations requirements.    The MLF should acquire additional facilities only when national or NATO communications cannotprovide the desired service or^reliability,Procurement and installation of communications equip-ment for the Base Communications Center should be phasedinto the over-all MLF build-up.    Initially, administrativecircuits will be required for direction of the entire programOperational circuits and maritime broadcasts will be required at the latest, concurrently with the arrival of the firstship on patrol or at the base.MLF ships should be provided the necessary communica-  :,-tions equipment to enable them to receive reliably theassigned maritime broadcasts and to transmit eitherIX-2
emergency messages while on patrol or routine messages when,in transit or in local training areas.    The mode of operationof radio communications circuits should be compatible with NATO standards.Message privacy within the MLF organization may berequired for administrative and possibly for some opera-tional matters.   A cryptographic system designed for MLF use,but compatible with NATO cryptographic systems, would satisfy this requirement.    In addition to the MLF crypco-graphic systems, the MLF should request NATO to providethe necessary equipment and publications for classifiedcommunications within NATO.The MLF weapons release message should be. such asto permit verification as to authenticity by each seniornational representative in the ship; there is no questionof judgment here, merely a mechanical examination of the message received.    The method devised should not be soburdensome nor unreliable that it would preclude timely,firing of weapons.&apos;Possible MLF communications arrangements are containedin Figures IX-1 through IX-4.IX-3EGRET




CHAPTERXPERSONNEL AND training the Multilateral Force must be manned by personnel of the highest caliber.   Each ship would be manned bya homogeneous crew comprised of at least three, national-it ies, no one nationality would predominate.   member nations would be expected to provide personnel, who whentrained, would man an elite force to provide tangibleevidence of the cohesiveness of the Alliance and a high-ly, credible deterrent in the eyes of the Soviet Bloc.The concept of MLF ship operations previously dis-.cussed would suggest a need for four mixed-manned crewsfor each three ships.   The crews would be exchangedevery six months when the ships returned to the mainbase for the required weapons system maintenance.   Theoff-patrol crews would then spend one month on leave and one month in refresher training prior to embarkingfor another six months sea tour.The Force manning level would approximate 10,000personnel.   Of this number, about 600 officers and,400 enlisted personnel would be required to. man theships, 140 officers and 200 enlisted personnel, would:fill staff billets, and 120 officers, 800 enlisted and1,400 civilians would fill base billets.   Approximately.240 officers, 1350 enlisted and 260 civilians personnelwill require technical training in the weapon and navl-gation systems.It would be highly desirable for member nations toreach agreement on personnel selection criteria con-currently with signing of the preparatory agreement.This early action is required to insure availability of&apos;personnel to fill the MLF staff billets and the available-bility of fully trained personnel to man the first MLF
ship.    Staff personnel should be selected as soon aspracticable.   Personnel for the first MLF ship shouldbe selected no later than 34 months prior to completionof that ship.   Personnel could be recruited from eithernaval service as civilian life.Basic training in operation and maintenance of MLFship electronics, engineering, and deck equipment coiildbe conducted by either the MLF or the parent country.Training in the common language, English is suggested,to be used in the MLF could also be conducted by either the MLF or the parent country.    Completion of these train-ing programs by prospective MLF personnel would be necessaryto meet the expected deployment date of the first MLF ship.Weapons system and navigation training initially shouldbe conducted by the MLF in&apos;the United States.   Use of theexisting United States weapons training center, augmentedby additional MLF--supplied facilities, would enable train-ing of Force personnel to commence within four months afterthe Force has been formed.    Construction of an MLF weaponstraining center should be commenced on the MLF main baseconcurrently with construction of other base facilities.Delivery of long lead time weapons system training equipment will delay completion of the MLF training center until threeyears after the Force has been formed.    Once operational,however, all MLF training can be conducted on the MLFmain base.Details of a Force manning structure, training require-ments and time-phasing of personnel manning and traininginto the MLF are contained in Appendix III,A number of pay and promotion problems and alternativesolutions seem possible.    Some are discussed in general terms in the following paragraphs0&apos;
Equitable pay and promotion criteria would be desirableif morale problems were to be minimized.   Whatever schemeis adopted must take into account the widely divergent pay and promotion standards of the several nations and the effectabove-standard payments and accelerated promotion plans wouldhave on national navies as well as the MLF.,   The examplesfollowing are for illustrative purposes only.   Details willrequire further study by the Preparatory Commission.Pay for each rank could be set-at some fraction of the &apos;highest pay for that rank found, among participating nations.The pay scale established should be high enough to act asan incentive to volunteers, but not so high that it would affect adversely the morale of national navies.   When anynational pay scale would be less than that of the standardset. tor the MLF, that nation could supplement the MLF pay of its volunteers to preclude their suffering a.loss of payon joining the MLFCHousing allowances ofMLF personnel could be established on a local economy parity.   The housing allowance then couldbe equated to the cost of housing, in the area in which the base complexes would be located.Under any plan, many individuals on joining the force would receive a significant increase, in pay.   Pay inequalitieswhich would result from supplementary national payments toother individuals (to preclude a loss of pay upon joining the Force) would probably tend to be less resented.Establishment of an equitable promotion plan would be.more complex and more far reaching than a standard pay scale.Peronnel joining the MLF could remain in the MLF for anentire active career.    Contrarily, they could remain for but one or two tours of duty (6-12 years) and then return totheir national navies.   A MLF promotion plan therefore would necessarily have to be based on a standard derived from national plans.   MLF nations most probably would have toaccept skills developed and promotions achieved within theMLF in the same manner as if they were attained in thenational navies.   The MLF plan should include an agreement by the member nations that if an officer or enlisted man,X-3
having completed his desired tour(s) of duty with the. MLFand returns to his national navy, then that individualwould resume his status in the national navy at a rank/rating comparable to that held in the.MLF, would suffer noloss in seniority and, based on his evaluated MLF perfor-mance, would be afforded an opportunity equal to those ofhis contemporaries for national promotion.

Timely implementation of the MLF would require two broad areas of action, those related to creation of the Force and those related to creation of the organization. It would appear that these actions should be commenced concurrently.

The Preliminary Agreement would establish a Preparatory Commission charged with the responsibility of drafting a treaty for ratification by the prospective MLF treaty nations. The magnitude of the task faced by the Preparatory Commission would indicate that the members would have little time to devote to actual force development. For that reason, an Executive Agent, assigned specific responsibilities for initiating logistics planning, procurement of long lead time material and for commencing personnel training should, if possible, be established by the Preliminary Agreement. The executive Agent would be responsible to the prospective signatory powers. It would appear advantageous for these powers to designate the Preparatory Commission or their NAC Permanent Representatives as a committee or commission to provide general supervision and financial control over the Executive Agent.

In order to insure that the MLF military organization is functioning and completely ready to assume the responsibilities inherent in the operational control of the MLF ships, the prospective MLF Commander/Executive should be designated by the prospective MLF Commission as scan as practicable. The MLF Commander/Executive should be provided with the necessary staff and resources by the participating nations to permit establishment of the Force operating and logistic plans and preparation of numerous and detailed Force regulations.

CHAPTER XII ^ &quot;PROGRAM SCHEDULES AMD COSTSSince early 196l there have been a series of studies conducted on the feasibility of a NATO Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM)force.   These studies have covered various force.levels, operationalmodes and concepts and time frames for operational deployment.   The&quot;current cost considerations reflect the most recent appraisals ofall facets of the proposed program - political, military and technical.-Prior to covering the schedule and cost details for the Multi- &apos;&apos;lateral Force (MLF) (Surface Missile Ship (SMS)).there are several-significant caveats which must be presented:--1. The steadily increasing costs of nuclear delivery weaponsystems are in consonance with long acquisition leadtimes, small prod-duction volume and short operational life unless periodic moderniza-tion steps are undertaken.- : .&apos;. -- 1       2. The MLF (SMS) program is.an. add-on to the present Polaris  :    -missile production run and will utilize many common missile supportequipment; items.   The significant point to note is that much of the R&amp;D-and production start-up costs are already past.   Thus the MLF (SMS)costs presented do not represent the true:.costs, of-the normal totallife cycle of the nuclear,delivery weapon system.  ,The true costs willbe shown in Table 8, the method for sharing these costs remains to be negotiated. ^   &apos; &apos;3. If the MLF (SMS) costs appear high it is only a reflection ^of the nuclear era weapons costs.   At the. present time the U.S. has&quot;.over. thirty (30) major missile weapon systems in production and/or inventory.SECRET \ ;^
There has &quot;been only one (IJ instance where the system costs have been substantially lover than originally estimated.   Our current ability to predict&apos;the  crucial factors of a weapon system rank in this order: (a)quality or technical performance, (b) leadtime and (c) cost.K.   With the abdve caveats in mind the program costs presentedreflect the most realistic information available from the U.S. viewpoint.During the course of the pre-agreement and treaty negotiations it isquite likely that assumptions will be revised thus requiring a further examination of the schedule/cost equation.   It is important to note .that the, assumptions upon which the present costs are based are notirrevocably set.   These assumptions, subject to future negotiations,simply provide the ground rules for this set of cost data.Program Schedules .The MLF.master schedule is shown in Schedule XII-1.   A-set of :.additional schedules are provided which support the master schedule.They are numbered 1 through 10 corresponding to the numbers on the master schedule.   , ... &apos;Two plans are provided on the. master schedule: a&apos;slow plan, based&apos; ..on a lg- ship per month completion rate,, is shown by a solid line     _The. fast plan has a ship completing every month.&apos;  This is shown by. adashed line &apos;. &apos;., . &apos;The.primary consideration in these schedule plans, is to obtainmaximum production efficiency from the planned Polaris A-3 system run.It: is assumed.that the one (l) SSBN per month capacity should be able &apos;.to handle the SMS missile and support equipment quantities in the timeframe envisioned. &apos; - &quot;- SECRET
For planning purposes, it was assumed that the leadship and number  ship would &quot;be constructed in the U.S.   This procedure would facilitate- proofing the ship module design and interface plus expediting the de-- &apos; &apos;    &apos;    i&quot;bugging process.   The &quot;balance of the ships would he constructed by four(h-) participating European countries .   The number constructed by each .!country, of course, remains to be negotiated. - iThe most critical schedule item is the weapon support equipmentmodule development and test program.   The ea.r3.test  start date possible is essential for this item in order that training devices and firstmodule delivery are available on schedule.In preparing th ese schedules two major ba.sic assumptions were- made:First, that procurement of the. necessary long leadtime items could bemade in time to utilize the MLF missiles and support equipment.from theA-3 production line at its&apos; peak rate.   Second, that political decisions would not delay-the base construction schedule.Program Costs . , vThe total program costs are summarized in Table 1.   A series of supporting tables are provided to indicate the types of cost included .in each category.   At the present time a detail cost appendix is being jprepared to support each item of cost.   This appendix will be availablefor discussions during the pre-agreement and treaty negotiations.   Thecost appendix together with systems description and schedule appendiceswill be the prime change control documents&apos; for the MLF program.The total program costs are covered in Tables 1 through 5 with related -supporting tables.   Table 6 provides the comparative funding requirements for the slow and fast planSg jga^^rjp26^ides the comparative summary .
In each instance, the other costs mentioned in the opening caveatsshown for each system.   The reason for the larger - other costs in the.SSBIT case is the proration of nuclear propulsion development costs.&apos;A further elaboration of these costs is provided in Table .8/This combination of the costs -which has been included, plus the-potential costs which have not been included, provides the mostrealistic picture of true costs of the nuclear weapon system program.The treatment of these latter, costs, i.e. POTENTIAL WEAPONS[PROGRAM -COSTS not INCLUDED, is subject to negotiation.

&apos; CHAPTERMISCELLANEOUSThe establishment of the Multilateral Force as a legal entity would evidently raise, a number of national and international legal problems.   An initial examinationof these problems in the context of the development oflaw relating to multinational organizations since world war II gives promise that none of them will prove to be insuperable.    The creation of a multilateral force is consistent with the provisions and objectives of theNorth Atlantic Treaty and is in no way violative of any international law.   The details of each juridical andmaritime law application will require separate treatment and are too voluminous to be covered adequately in this paper..&apos;&apos; ::&apos;V&quot;.v,a,.;-&apos;&apos;The Multilateral Force will require intelligence,and weather support.    The information will be availableto participating nations through their own or treatysources.   The several participating nations will need toreach agreement on the degree of support each will provideto the MLF. .       \The background o  prospective Multilateral force personnel should be free of any direct or indirectconnections with contra-MLF organizations such as theCommunist Party.   The method and criteria for establishing the loyal nature of the prospective personnel should bedetermined by the Preparatory Commission.Logistics support of the MLF, including ship construction and repair, will require contracts with many industries ofparticipating nations.   Material and quality control standardsshould be established for the MLF in the same manner as those %XIII-1
standards already established for national navies.   A mlflogistics representative located in each country would facilitate handling logistics support and contractualmatters. &apos;XIII-2
