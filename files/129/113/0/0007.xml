Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1963C. (63) 57 Copy No.   5226th March, 1963\\   - :CABINETNEW REFERENCE TO THE MONOPOLIES COMMISSION-DETERGENTS AND SOAPSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 20th November, 1962 (C.C. (62) 70th Conclusions, Minute 3), my colleaguesapproved my proposal to ask the Monopolies Commission to inquire into the supplyof detergents and soaps. I am glad to say that subsequent consultations with theChairman of the Commission and with the industry about the exact form of theproposed reference have shown that I can without losing any of the value of the inquiry limit its scope to detergents. This is because it has emerged that there isa clear dividing line between the manufacture of soaps and of detergents, as these goods are understood by the housewife a point on which I could not satisfy myselfuntil a decision was taken in principle and the industry could be brought into consultation.2. The main purpose of the inquiry, namely to examine the manufacturers&apos;high pressure promotion methods (which have been much criticised) will not be impaired by concentrating on detergents. On the other hand, a great deal ofwork will be avoided both for the Commission and for the industry and perhapsmore important a large number of. small soapmakers can be spared any part atall in the inquiry.3.  I am circulating this paper for the information of my colleagues.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1,25th March, 1963.
