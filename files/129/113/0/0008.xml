[i1.1HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(63) 58 COPY NO.CABINETS^UTH;gRN,RHODE^IA,Note by the First Secretary of state the Prime Minister has suggested that it would be helpfulfor the Cabinet to have before them a memorandum whichdescribes the main features of the present Southern RhodesiaConstitution and records some of the views on it which were expressed when it was debated in the House of Commons.2.     I attach a memorandum of this kind which has beenprepared by the Central African Office.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S. W. 1.3rd April, 1963.
annex the SOUTHERN RHODESIA CONSTITUTIONBefore the 1961 Southern Rhodesia Constitution was intro-duced there was no African representation in the Southern Rhodesialegislature and the franchise was based on a common Roll with&quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; qualifications based on financial and educational considerations.    The &quot;lower&quot; qualifications gave about , 000 Africans the vote.    It was also stipulated that the numbersof person enfranchised by means of the &quot;lower&quot; qualifications couldnot exceed 20 per cent of the total number of other voters.2.     There also existed the British Government&apos;o &quot;reserved&quot;powers.    These consisted of a general power of disallowance ofany legislation within one year of its enactment, and reservationby the Governor, pending the British Government&apos;s approval, ofany legislation seeking to amend the Constitution, re-apportionland or discriminate against Africans.    These powers were neverexercised and to have done so in recent years would have precipitateda major crisis in our relations with the Southern rhodesia government.    Thus in spite of the reserved powers many dis-criminatory laws and much repressive security legislation foundits v/ay on to the Southern Rhodesia Statute Book over the years since 1923.    Most of the discriminatory legislation was, however,repealed by the last Southern Rhodesia Government.3.     At the Southern Rhodesia Constitutional Conference inFebruary, 1961, Mr. Sandys (who was then commonwealth secretary) was able to exchange the bulk of these ineffectivepowers for alternative safeguards capable of enforcement.    Theseconsist of:-(a) A,2^claratio^(^Righ^ embodied in the Constitution whichbesides safeguarding normal human rights contains special pro-visions against legislation discriminating against individuals or groups on grounds of race.    The Declaration of Rights is enforce-able in the Courts.    The right of appeal to higher Courts (includingthe Privy Council) is provided for in the Constitution.(b) A ConstitaSional Cqunci^whose task is to examine proposed legislation and advise the Legislative Assembly if they consider itinconsistent with the Declaration of Rights.If the Council gives an adverse opinion on a Bill theLegislative Assembly may still pass it but only by a two-thirds majority;  or by a simple majority after a delay of six months.Thus the Council has delaying powers but no veto overlegislation.    This is because the Constitutional Conference didnot consider that a non-political body should be able to overrulea political, elected legislature.    In fact the power of veto lies with the Courts because whatever view the Constitutional council may have taken over a piece of legislation, it will nevertheless beopen to anyone to challenge it in the Courts if it becomes law.-1-
The Coiiatitutional Council&apos;s powers relate only to new legislation.    They do not operate retrospectively.    The constitutional conference felt that to permit this would throw the legality of thewhole of the Southern Rhodesia statutes into doubt.    The Council can,however, examine existing legislation and report to the legislatureany Act which would be inconsistent with the Declaration of Rightsif the Declaration applied to it.    This they have already done in several cases.The Council is composed so as to ensure its impartiality.It consists of five Africans (including at least one who is an activenationalist), two Europeans, one Asian, one Coloured and twolawyers (European).    Thus non-Europeans are at present in amajority on the Council which is presided over by Sir Victor Robinson,a former Southern Rhodesia Attorney-General.(c) The Special Entrenchment of the Most Important Parts ofthg-Constitution (including those relating to (a) and (b) above).    Thesefeatures of the Constitution can only be amended by firstly a two-thirds majority of the Legislature and secondly by a referendum in which allfour racial groups (European, African, Asian and Coloured) voteseparately.    Each group would have to show a majority in favour ofthe amendment.    Alternatively instead of a referendum the BritishGovernment may approve the amendment but Ministers have the rightto refuse to give a decision if they consider the matter should bedecided by referendum.4.     The Constitutional Conference also decided to make special arrangements for African political advancement.    It provided for alegislature of 65 members elected on two electoral rolls.    An &apos;A&apos;roll with higher qualifications (being the same as the old Ordinary&quot;qualifications but including Chiefs and Headmen) returning 50 members and a &apos;E&apos; roll with lower qualifications (a good deal wider than theold &quot;lower&quot; qualifications) returning 15 members.    Voters on eachroll have a second vote which can be used to influence the voting onthe other roll up to 25 per cent of the total vote.    This cross-votingsystem is intended to encourage candidates to appeal to both races and to place extremists at a disadvantage.    It is a fact that had therBT roll voters (largely African) turned out in any numbers at theelection in December, 1962, the United Federal Party (U.F. P. ) wouldhave won in spite of the &quot;A1 roll (largely European) majority in favourof the Rhodesian Front.    As it was only about 2, 500 lB&apos; roll electorsvoted.    The result was Rhodesian Front 35 &apos;A&apos; roll seats, U.F.P.15 &apos;A&apos; roll seats and 14 &apos;B&apos; roll seats, Independents 1 &apos;BI roll seat.Thus although the Rhodesian Front have a majority of five, this fallsfar short of the two-thirds majority which would give them freedom to alter, for example, the non-entrenched provisions in the Constitution5.     Had also the African Nationalists not opposed the registration of voters and fought the elections they would have won at least the15 JB&apos; roll seats and possibly one or two &apos;A: roll seats and would almost certainly have held the balance between the U. F. P. and the rhodesia Front in the Legislature who would probably have shared the remainder of the 50 lA&apos; roll seats almost equally.    This would-2-
have put the Africans in a very strong position.    Thus the situation inwhich they now find themselves is not the fault o  the Constitution somuch as of their refusal to work it.    Even so it is open to the AfricanNationalists to work for this position at the next election.6.     The current voters1 roll is made up as follows:-&apos;A&apos; Roll 90, 785       (mostly Europeans but includingabout 2,500 Africans)&apos;B&apos; Roll 10,632      (mostly Africans but includingabout 600 Europeans)It is estimated that at least 50, 000 Africans are eligible for the &apos;B!roll.    This figure represents only about 4 per cent of the adultAfrican population.    At the same time however it will be observedthat only about 8 per cent of the adult African population would need to qualify for the rA&apos; roll to outnumber the European voters andcommand the elections on this roll also.    Sir Edgar Whitehead statedpublicly that he thought this would happen within fifteen years butprivately he thought that enough Africans would make sufficienteducational and/or economic progress in the next few years to qualify for the franchise in a much shorter time than this.    These assump-tions are based on the franchise qualifications remaining as they are,subject to adjustments to take a.account of changes in monetary values.The Constitution provides that any move to narrow the franchise is subject to the entrenched clause procedure (in effect the Africanshave a veto) but any measure calculated to widen the franchise requiresonly a two-thirds majority of the Legislature.-3-
Qra^ta-^ioKxg^fyorxx J^q&quot;&quot;-sq,^jf. Commons debates on the Southern Rhodesia ConstitutionMr. F.M. Bennett on 22nd Juner 1961\\&quot;My opinion is that the new safeguards do not mean any reduction inthe security of the African population.    I am convinced, other-wise I would not be speaking in support in the way I am, that thenew safeguards are, indeed, stronger than those which now exists&quot;When I read this draft Constitution for the first time I was not onlysurprised but very gratified that such a large advance had proved possible at this time, and, more important, that it had been found possible to avoid some of the political developments based on racewhich I have regretted in certain other African territories. &quot;Mr. Patrick Wall on 22nd june......1961&quot;The proposals in the White Paper represent a move forward, and I fully support it for three main reasons,&quot;First, I believe that it is the beginning of the end ox discrimination.It does not abolish it - I grant the hon. Lady that.    We cannot do that automatically and immediately, but it is the beginning ofthe end of any form of racial discrimination in Southern Rhodesia.Secondly, it leads to growing participation by Africans inParliament and in political life.    Thirdly, it means the election of Members of Parliament who are responsible to both races,and when a Member is responsible tc both races he has to con-sider the views of both.    That is one of the most importantproposals in this new Constitution. &quot;The late Mr. Jack Jones on 22nd June, 1961&quot;I cannot understand Members of this House who talk about what the africans want and, because they cannot get the lot, wonderwhether they should have part of it.    I am all for half a loafrather than no bread any time.&quot;I cannot vote against the Constitution.    I must tell my own party that on the basis of an opportunity for extra seats to be givenfor Africans, we have no right to say that, because we cannot get the lot, we should not have some.     That is the logic ofthe argument. &quot;-4-
Sir^Lionel Heald on 22nd June, 1961&quot;The guarantee of fifteen seats for the Africans can be contrasted with the position to-day, when the African has no seats.    Ibelieve that, with a Constitutional Council operating it will bepossible to make the Constitution work. &quot;M^-v-ff^^l^^J-iP11^30^0111 on,  2nd June, 1961&quot;The test is whether the Constitution, when passed, will help buildup confidence and partnership in that country.&quot;I believe it will.    It gives electoral encouragement to the moderates,It gives electoral disadvantages to the extremists.    It gives, forthe first time, a rea.son.able representation to the African in theSouthern Rhodesia Legislative Council, a representation which i hope will be speeded up over the years.    By the Declaration of rights of the Constitutional Council it safeguards the SouthernRhodesians against racial extremism. &quot;&quot;It gives the Africans something they wanted very much - an improve-ment in the franchise - the right to play a part in the Parliamentof Southern Rhodesia.    I think that it is probably a goodishbargain, considering that we had a weak negotiating hand, with only one card to play. &quot;Mr. Donald Wade on 8th November, 1961&quot;I am wholly in favour of the idea of a Declaration of Rights.    Iwould like to see a Declaration of Human Rights incorporated inevery Constitution throught the Commonwealth, &quot;Sir Lionel Heald on 8th November, 1961&quot;I suggest we should give the Constitution a fair chance. &quot;Mr. Stephen Hastings on 8th November, 1961&quot;This Constitution represents an advance.    Do not let us make it moredifficult in this House, in this debate or in the country as a wholeby heaping criticism upon it.    Let us ra.her try to understand thedifficulties that still exist and thus help those who very genuinelybelieve in it and believe that they can build a future for SouthernRhode fine as that for any other country in Africa. &quot;-5-
CONF50ENT8ALMr^ Raymond Gower ^oa^&amp;th November, 1961&quot;The alternative ... is the old position . . .   The future of the africans in the territory would be worsened.    We should have virtually no say and there would be virtually no safeguards. &quot;Mr, Patrick &quot;Wall on Oth November, 1961&quot;They (the African Nationalists) may feel that 15 seats as against50 seats for the Europeans is a poor percentage but it is agood start. 11Mr. Duncan Sandys on 8th November, 1961(a) &quot;These (reserved) powers have proved most ineffective and bothLabour and Conservative Governments have found them, inpractice, virtually impossible to use.    Some of the most keenlydiscriminating legislation on the Statute Eook of SouthernRhodesia, including the original land apportionment law, andone of the most hated, the Native Pass Law, were passed withthe approval of a Labour Government.&quot;I am not criticising the Party opposite - I make that quite clear.I only quote these examples to support my contention that, inpractice the reserved powers have proved unusable, and thatthe safeguards provided under the new Constitution will beinfinitely more effective.    Otherwise, I say it frankly, I wouldnet have looked at this, because I recognise my responsibility to see to it that the interests of the African population now, andof the European population at some future date, shall be properlysafeguarded. &quot;(b) &quot;The fact that hon. Members opposite v/ill vote against theConstitution to-night implies that, if they wanted,. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom could have put forward a constitution to provide a wider franchise and bigger representa-tion for Africans in the Legislature.    That is not the fact.    Theright hon. and learned Gentleman has made it clear that, havingnearly 40 years ago given a constitution, which is virtuallyself-government at home in Southern Rhodesia, subject only tocertain veto powers, it would be constitutionally improper andimpracticable for us, without the consent of Southern Rhodesia,to impose upon it a new constitution with a much wider representa-tion to Africans, if we thought that that was right and desirable,&quot;The outstanding feature of the new Constitution is that it providesfar-reaching advances for the Africans with the full consent ofthe Europeans. &quot;(c) &quot;I believe that it is far better to get progress and a widening ofthe franchise for the Africans by the exercise of politicalpressures through the ordinarly Parliamentary system and procedures, and the necessity to gain votes, and the necessity to maintain a majority in Parliament, than by having periodicalconferences in Lancaster House and by the British Governmentarranging it all over their heads. &quot;-6-
Mr. A. Py Co stain pn 10th November^19 6P&quot;I believe this is a grea.i e:qjeriment in multi-racial partnership . . .This Constitution must last a long time and therefore certainsafeguards have to be written into it.    I believe these safeguardshave been very adequately written in.    The Declaration of Rightsand the Constitutional Council give the needed protection. &quot;Mr. F. J. Bellenger on 30th July, 1962&quot;If it is not possible to get the whole loaf, as I do not believe it is,should not we try to get some of the loaf, as we seem to havedone in the Constitution which was agreed by the African nationalleaders and which is to form the basis on which the electionswill be fought in March.    I recognise that it may not be all thatwe desire.    I often wonder whether the ;;one man one vote&quot;principle out there is really democracy as v/e understand it. &quot;
