Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1963C. (63) 90 Copy No.    d 427th May, 1963CABINETSOUTHERN RHODESIANote by the Prime MinisterFurther to my Note of 20th May (C. (63) 86) I now circulate for theinformation of the Cabinet copies of exchanges of letters about Southern Rhodesiawhich I have recently had with Mr. Obote, the Prime Minister of Uganda, and dr. Nkrumah, the President of Ghana.. H. M,Admiralty House,27th May, 1963.
Following is text of Mr. Obote&apos;s letter of 17th May to Mr. MacmillanMy dear Prime Minister,I had been intending for some time to write to you about Southern Rhodesiaso I was interested to have through your High Commissioner in Kampala a copyof your letter in reply to President Nyerere.There seems to me to be one simple but major point of principle involvedalthough a number of practical matters follow. The point is that to grant independence to a minority Government which is not broadly representative of,or responsible to, popular opinion and which would have no constitutionalobligation to enfranchise such opinion would be morally indefensible and contraryto the basic principles of human rights. This proposition seems so self-evidentthat I cannot believe it needs argument from me. It is I think accepted by most members of the United Nations and I feel there is a pressing need for a clearacknowledgment of this point of principle by Britain in its policy in regard to southern Rhodesia.Later this week I shall be leaving for the Conference of Heads of african governments in Addis Ababa at which this matter is bound to arise. The positionof African Commonwealth countries and other friends and well wishers of Britainbecomes increasingly embarrassed by the apparently equivocal nature of yourposition and the lack of any clear declaration of the guiding principles on which britain&apos;s responsibility is to be exercised. Without some such declaration it becomes increasingly difficult for us to support Britain either in the African forumor at the United Nations or for us to prevent Britain being stigmatised andcastigated by other Powers. I do not need to emphasise to you the severe strainswhich this kind of situation, places upon Commonwealth ties, strains which will of course be reflected in the domestic policies of countries such as Uganda andwhich no political leader can afford to ignore.In your letter to President Nyerere you say that you &quot; would not dispute ingeneral terms the arguments . . . linking the grant of independence with representative Government&quot;. I am glad of this; but it seems, if I may be permitted to say so, to reflect a rather lukewarm and negative approach to amatter which we here regard as a vital and burning issue of principle. If this principle is overridden or ignored it would be an affront which african governments could not ignore; and it is the fear that your Government may not stand firm on this principle that is giving rise to such anxiety in my mind and Ibelieve in the minds of other African Commonwealth Premiers to-day. hence the need for some positive affirmation.I do not seek to minimise or to aggravate the severe practical difficulties which you face in Southern Rhodesia. But to sacrifice principle to political expediencyin a matter involving human rights like this would surely be unconscionable. Ifwe were satisfied that this principle was not to be sacrificed you could I think rely on support from Leaders of African Governments which by the influence we could bring to bear upon African Leaders in Southern Rhodesia might in itself be ableto help in some degree towards a solution. But we could not as you suggestexert pressure upon Leaders such as Nkomo to make concessions or a compromiseunless we were firmly assured that the country would not be made independentunder a non-democratic Constitution.Your letter to President Nyerere also states that &quot; the realities of power do notlie with the British Government&quot;: This seems to miss the point. The power which matters in this case is the power to grant legal and constitutionalindependence. It is to obtain a mantle of legal and constitutional independencethat Mr. Field&apos;s Government is now seeking and the power to grant this liesfully and firmly with the British Government and with nobody else, I doubt ifany Government in Southern Rhodesia would be in a hurry to claim or declareits independence without the mantle of legal and constitutional right knowingas it must that it would be an outcast from the Commonwealth and probablyfrom the United Nations as well. No country would wish to start its life under such circumstances.   And even if they did attempt to take such a drastic step
unilaterally it would surely be better that you should have adhered firmly toprinciples which are recognised and endorsed by the United Nations so that britain could commend world-wide respect and support in whatever might follow.This leads me to another point. I do not think for a moment that we shouldbe able to recognise a Government in Southern Rhodesia which claimed to be independent whether with or without Britain&apos;s blessing unless it had a democraticConstitution in which the Africans were fully enfranchised. This being sowe could clearly not agree either to their admission to the Commonwealth. i cannot of course speak for other Prime Ministers but if my view is shared thenI think this is a matter which could raise grave issues of Commonwealth unity. AndI think it as well to face these issues now. The question of the admission ofSouthern Rhodesia to the United Nations would also arise. Here again we shouldhave to vote against admission if we do not recognise the Government. I believethat many other countries would take a similar line.For these reasons therefore, Mr. Prime Minister, I do most strongly urge you to come forward with an unequivocal affirmation of principle on this matter. Toallow the further negotiations to proceed with the Southern Rhodesia Governmentin the absence of such a declaration will inevitably be taken by African governments as an indication that you are prepared to sell the pass. And if this assumption isin fact unwarranted it would place the talks with Mr. Field&apos;s Government on a false footing if you did not clearly enunciate from the start the principles on which britain would have to stand firm.In conclusion may I say that I hope very much for a happy outcome andthat I am most conscious of your difficulties and of the sincere goodwill with whichyour Government is trying to solve these problems. I hope you will take this letter as a token of my deep concern and my desire to contribute or assist in anyway which I can towards a solution.Yours sincerely,A. MILTON OBOTE(Prime Minister). ,The following is the text of the Prime Ministers reply of 22nd May to Mr. Obote&apos;sletter of 17th MayDear Prime Minister,I was most interested to receive your letter of 17th May about SouthernRhodesia. I am glad to have your views on this problem and 1 recognise how much importance you attach to it.You have seen a copy of the letter that I sent to the President of Tanganyika.Since I wrote that letter there have been further consultations between us and theSouthern Rhodesian Government and, as you will have seen from the Press, it hasnow been arranged that Mr. Field should come to London on 27th May to continuethese talks in person with the British Government.You may rest assured that I am very conscious of your interest in this question and I will keep you informed of developments.Yours sincerely,HAROLD MACMILLAN.Following is text of Dr. Nkrumaffs letter of 6th May to Mr. MacmillanMy Dear Prime Minister,You would by now have received President Nyerere&apos;s letter of 4th April aboutthe policy of the British Government with regard to Southern Rhodesia. I write to inform you that I am in complete agreement with President Nyerere and wouldappeal to you most earnestly to resist any pressures which may be brought uponthe British Government to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia or acquiesce
in any constitutional change which would give legal effect to the continueddomination of the majority of Africans in that territory by the minority governmentof White settlers.I have noted with satisfaction that Mr. Butler in his recent statement to theBritish Parliament rejected the argument that Southern Rhodesia may be grantedindependence immediately. I do hope that the British Government will maintain this stand.We on the African Continent are, however, gravely concerned about continuingthreats that the Southern Rhodesian Government may declare independence for itself. This would be a most dangerous constitutional precedent in theCommonwealth. Should the Government of Southern Rhodesia usurp power inthis way, the Government and people of Ghana would have no choice but to declare their stand behind the African majority in Southern Rhodesia. In theinterest of continued good relations between Ghana and Britain and for the peace of the African Continent, I appeal to you to use your good offices to restrain theSouthern Rhodesian Government from such precipitate and unprecedented action.Yours sincerely,KWAME NKRUMAH.Following is text of the Prime Ministers reply of 24th May to Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s letterof 6th MayMy Dear President,Your letter of 6th May, in which you associate yourself with the views PresidentNyerere expressed to me regarding Southern Rhodesia, only reached me after yourdeparture for the meeting of Heads of State in Addis Ababa. I am.very grateful to you for letting me have your thoughts.I hope that you will have seen in the meantime a copy of my reply to PresidentNyerere, which was given to your Secretariat by our High Commissioner in Accra.You will also have seen from the Press that, in furtherance of our consultations with the Southern Rhodesian Government, Mr. Field is coming to London fortalks on 27th May. I will bear constantly in mind the interest and viewpointswhich you and other Commonwealth Heads of Governments have expressed tome on this question, and will keep you informed of developments.Yours very sincerely,HAROLD MACMILLAN.
