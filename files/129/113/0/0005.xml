CABINETEXPORT OF LARGE DIAMETER OIL PIPELINE TO THE SOVIET BLOCMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and Paymaster general  was invited by the Cabinet yesterday (C.C. (63) 17th Conclusions, Minute 2)to arrange for a review of the desirability of permitting exports of large diametersteel pipe to the Soviet Union.History2. The United States first raised this question with their allies in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) more than 18 months ago, arguing that itwas in the military interests of the West that the export of large diameter pipe tothe Soviet bloc should be prohibited as this would cause significant delays incompletion of the bloc&apos;s oil pipeline system.3. Our view has always been that the pipe has no great military significanceand that we do not believe in taking measures of economic warfare against the bloc, except in the face of an imminent threat of a specific character.4. We have made it abundantly clear to all our NATO allies that we couldnot justify proposing to Parliament the procedure which would be necessary tocontrol these exports.5. Although the United Kingdom military assessment has not beencontroverted, the other NATO countries nevertheless lined up with the americans and in November 1962 the NATO Council passed the following resolution:(1) Member countries, under their own responsibility, should, to the extent possible:(i) stop deliveries of large diameter pipe (over 19 in.) to the soviet bloc under existing contracts;(ii) prevent new contracts for such deliveries;(2) The Council would keep the situation under observation and review, as appropriate.On instructions from London the United Kingdom delegation agreed not to oppose this decision, provided that it was clearly understood that the words &quot; to the extent possible &quot; in such a decision would mean, in the case of the United Kingdom, &quot; notat all &quot;. We have also resisted an American attempt to get the matter discussed inCo-ordinating Committee.6. The Americans have also tried to persuade Sweden and Japan toco-operate in the embargo, but without much success. A Swedish firm isunderstood to be carrying out a Russian order for 40,000 tons of large diameterpipe and the Swedish Government does not intend to interfere with it. TheJapanese Government has decided to impose no legal restrictions on Japanese pipeto the bloc, but only to advise their firms to be cautious.7. As regards NATO countries, the French Government has said it is continuing to prevent its firms from concluding pipe contracts which the russians are negotiating for. Italian firms have supplied the Russians with large quantitiesin the past and they have outstanding contracts which the Italian Governmentappears to be allowing to go on.Printed for the Cabinet.

8. There has been considerable activity very recently by the federal government of Germany, whose firms have exported large quantities in&quot; recentyears. The Federal Government have now introduced an export licence system for shipments of large diameter pipe to the Soviet Union. The Opposition partiescalled for the ordinance to be rescinded unless the Government undertook notto apply it to contracts already placed, but they were frustrated by a proceduraldevice,.arid present indications are that exports against existing German.contractswill be stopped, and the Russians will have to look elsewhere for about 163,000 tonsof pipe. One German newspaper has already complained in advance that theUnited Kingdom is &quot; the weakest link in the West&quot;.9. At present there is no order with British firms, but two the South DurhamIron &amp; Steel Company and Whessoe of Darlington have had discussions with theSoviet authorities. Mr. George Ball is apparently under the impression that SouthDurham have been asked to quote for 1,000 tons, which he suggests is too small tojustify a serious political divergence between the United States and ourselves. the firm have in fact been asked for up to 120,000 tons and have offered 50,000, but so far the Russian terms have proved unacceptable. The other firm Whessoe have recently been told by the Russians that although they cannot be given anorder at present they may get one later on. Other British firms may well be approached if the German orders are frustrated.Future Action10. The position was examined this morning by the Strategic ExportsCommittee. The Lord President of the Council attended the meeting; the foreign secretary, who was indisposed, was consulted by telephone by the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs (Lord Dundee) who attended on his behalf. We came to the unanimous, conclusion, mainly for the reasons given in paragraph 2 above,but also because of the state of British industry, that it would be wrong, in presentcircumstances, to interfere with the fulfilment of any orders that British firms mightsecure for the supply of large-diameter pipe to Russia, or to take powers for thatpurpose. We felt that these considerations outweighed the real probability ofadverse reactions by the Federal German Government to our appearing to takeadvantage of their greater loyalty tto a NATO decision.11. If my colleagues endorse this view, the President of the Board of Trade,who will be informed at once if a British firm is about to obtain an order, will beready to inform the Minister without Portfolio and his other colleagues of thefacts, so that timely consideration can be given to the&apos;question&apos; of public presentation.J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd March, 19.63.
