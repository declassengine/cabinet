Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1963C. (63) 76 Copy No.6th May, 1963CABINETTHE FOREIGN OFFICE building memorandum by the Minister of Public Building and works hay.e come to the conclusion that we ought to pull down the present ForeignOffice building and replace it by a new building to accommodate the whole of theForeign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office.2. Since 1960, when the Cabinet decided (C.C. (60) 19th Meeting) to abandon the plan to build a new Foreign Office behind the facade of Carlton House Terrace,we have been considering how to provide the Foreign Office with Headquartersoffices where all the staff could work under one roof in satisfactory conditions. Wehave also been working on the phased long-term plan for the use of various sitesavailable for Government offices in the Whitehall area.3. There is general agreement that we should use the present site for theForeign Office and that there would be great advantages in accommodating thewhole of the Commonwealth Relations Office there as well. We must now decide whether to modernise the existing building, with some extension or adaptation, ordemolish it and erect a modern purpose-designed building!The previous modernisation plan4. A scheme was worked out to modernise all the services of the present block(which is now occupied by the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Officeand the Home Office) and erect an additional storey which would not significantlyaffect the appearance of the block from, say, St. James&apos;s Park. This scheme was estimated to cost  l^- 2 million. The Foreign Office agreed that they would move to Queen Anne&apos;s Mansions from 1964-68 while this extensive work was carried out.5. The Home Office were willing to move in 1968 to the new ParliamentStreet-Bridge Street development. This meant that the total area which would beavailable in the enlarged Foreign Office block would, if supplemented by about50,000 sq. ft. on the Whitehall front of the New Public Offices, provide the area of offices which the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office estimatedthey needed to accommodate all their staff under one roof.6. The apparent attraction of the modernisation scheme was that it met the accommodation requirements at a capital cost far less than that of a new buildingwhile preserving a structure that although not of great architectural importance,had become a familiar feature of the London scene.7, A public announcement was made in the autumn of 1962 of the intentionto carry out this modernisation/extension work. But further consideration hasshown that there, are two substantial practical objections to a modernisationscheme:   -. (i) owing to the impracticability of partitioning old buildings to provide roomsof the exact size needed by staff, nearly 100,000 sq. ft. more space wouldbe needed by the Foreign Office than they had previously estimated; and(ii) even after the complete replacement of the existing electrical and heatingsystems and the improvement of the lifts and plumbing, the existingblock would not provide efficient working conditions for many of thestaff.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
The case for an entirely new building8. In this hew situation, I can see no point in preserving the present building.I have, therefore, in consultation with the Secretaries of State for Foreign affairs and Commonwealth Relations, considered again the alternative of demolishing the block and building a new Foreign/Commonwealth Office on the site.;&apos;- 9. A new building could provide between 430,000 and 490,000 sq. ft. net asagainst 290,000 sq. ft. in the modernised and extended existing block. Such newoffices would both house considerably more staff since modern office space can bemore easily partitioned, and provide more efficient working conditions.10. The capital cost of the new building would be at least  7 million but Iam satisfied that this capital expenditure Would represent a better economicproposition than spending  2 million on the modernisation plan, not least because it would enable this very valuable site to be more fully utilised.11. The Commonwealth Relations Office will have to overcome any legal or financial difficulties arising over the demolition of that part of the block builtas the India Office and over the rehousing of the India Office Library.12. Demolition will arouse opposition from preservationists. On the otherhand I believe a substantial section of public opinion will favour a new building.The long-term plan for Whitehall accommodation13. The decision to build a new Foreign/Commonwealth Office would form part of a long-term plan for accommodation in the Whitehall area as set out in annex A. This includes the recent decision to accommodate the new headquarters of the Ministry of Defence in the Whole of the Whitehall Gardens block, whichwill involve moving the Board of Trade to a completed office block in 1-19 VictoriaStreet, assuming an acceptable lease can be negotiated. My Ministry is nownegotiating up to an annual rent figure equivalent to 58s. per square foot.14. At a time when Sir Gilbert Flemming is making a review of the contribution which Government Departments might make to the dispersal of officesfrom London, it may seem paradoxical to announce a plan for rehousing manyDepartments in Whitehall. But I believe that, if the case is properly presented,people will realise that there is no inconsistency in dispersing away from Londonall staff who can work elsewhere without serious loss of efficiency, while at thesame time concentrating in the centre of Government those staff who clearly mustbe there, and giving&apos; them offices where they can work efficiently.Timing15. It is unlikely that demolition and rebuilding could start before 1968 andbe completed before 1971-72 if only because the Home Office move to the new parliament Street /Bridge Street building cannot be earlier than 1968 and thatmove must be made before the Whitehall end of the block is dealt with.Temporary accommodation for the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office16. Temporary accommodation would have to be available by 1966-67 sinceoccupational services will be necessary before the two Departments move in. an area of at least 200,000 sq. ft. will be needed if^the two Secretaries of State withtheir essential policy advisers are to be accommodated together.17. Under the original proposal, Queen Anne&apos;s Mansions were to be used,but the lease expires in 1968 and cannot be renewed. I propose therefore that this necessary temporary accommodation should be made available as part of theDefence reorganisation. Since the Ministry of Defence are to take over the Boardof Trade&apos;s accommodation of nearly 200,000 sq. ft. net, I suggest that, in additionto the 70,000 sq. ft. in the New Public Offices which the Ministry of Defence willvacate, it would be reasonable to plan on the basis of the Admiralty Headquarters(except the Citadel) and the War Office becoming available by, say, 1966 for use by Civil Departments. The Admiralty building would provide the minimum areaneeded by the Foreign Office /Commonwealth Relations Office during the demolitionand construction period.
Lambeth Bridge House, S.E. 1,6th May, 1963.Presentation18. I suggest that we might publish a White Paper setting out the long-term plan for Whitehall, including the proposed new building. My colleagues might alsowish to consider publishing simultaneously the results of the Flemming review ondispersal, if this seems an appropriate course when the report has been received and studied. The Government might then encourage Parliamentary debate whichwould give an opportunity for an expression of views on the issues raised. this might coincide with the publication of the White Paper on Defence Reorganisation.The design of the new building19. I do not think we should, like Lord Palmerston, decide ourselves thearchitectural idiom in which the building should be designed. This would eitherlimit us unduly in the choice of the architect or entail the risk that we did not getthe best design. I would prefer to choose at the outset the best British architect wecan find and commission him to do an outline plan. If we did not like this we could then choose another architect. But my colleagues may feel that so important acommission should not be awarded without some competition. If this view prevails,I would think it essential to limit the competition to not more than six of our leadingarchitects and, to save money and time, to let them compete only on an outline plan.Once the architect was selected on this basis he would be commissioned and thenbe asked to work up his scheme in detail.Conclusions20.   I accordingly recommend:(1) that the present Foreign Office block should be demolished and a newForeign/Commonwealth Office built on the site, by an architect to becommissioned outright, or failing that, through a limited competitionon the lines set out in paragraph 19.(2) that this proposal should be part of the long-term plan for Whitehalloffices as set out in Annex A, and be presented as such to Parliamentperhaps together with the results of the Flemming Review on the dispersal of Government Departments.G.
