Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1963C. (63) 72 Copy No.   5226th April, 1963CABINETRATES OF GROWTH OF PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor^ of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretaryto the Treasury and Paymaster general. When the Cabinet considered our joint paper (C. (62) 206) on20th December, 1962, they agreed that future major expenditure decisions shouldbe taken by reference to the prospective course of public expenditure as a whole inrelation to the resources of the national economy, as was proposed in the PlowdenReport (Cmnd. 1432) and endorsed by the Government in the Debate on the Report(24th January, 1962). The Cabinet invited us to submit detailed proposals for theestablishment accordingly of approved rates of expansion for the main services.2. For the reason given in paragraph 6 below, we are not yet ready to submitfully detailed proposals; but it seemed to us that the Cabinet would wish at thisstage to know how things stand.3. The proposal with which the Cabinet agreed was that, for each of the bigblocks of public expenditure, they should decide for planning purposes upon an approved annual rate of expansion (or an allowable limit for expenditure in a givenyear ahead), different for each service according to its needs and to the importance attached to it. These rates or limits would be fixed for three or four years ahead.4. It is suggested that in the first instance this technique should be applied to seven blocks: defence, roads, education, health and welfare, police and prisons,housing and environmental services, and national insurance benefits (excludingfamily allowances). The make-up of these proposed blocks is more preciselydescribed in the Annex.5. Moreover, each of the proposed blocks represents a coherent area to whicha policy of planned expansion can sensibly be applied. It should be emphasisedhere that the proposed limits would be adopted as the bases for planningexpenditure ahead, not necessarily for purposes of administrative control ofexpenditure. For example, some of the proposed blocks cover both current and capital expenditure. Where there is a close link between the two it seems desirableto have a single total for planning purposes; but it would, of course, be necessary,within this total, to establish separate figures for current and capital expenditure,as we have now. Again, where a block of expenditure straddles the responsibilityof more than one Department (and often where it covers separate elements of thework of some Department) the actual control procedure would, of course, be appliedto the component elements, within the overall limit of the agreed growth rate forthe block of expenditure as a whole. Yet again, it must be recognised that the concept of a planned rate of growth is less appropriate to benefits and assistancethan to the other main Mocks (though because of their ^magnitude it is vital to take them into account in an operation of this nature).6. Officials are about to embark upon this year&apos;s survey of public expenditure, on the lines recommended by the Plowden Committee. In this surveythey will be attempting to estimate what total public expenditure will be in 1967-68&quot; on present policies &quot;, and to set this against a pattern of the economy in that year(showing the prospective total resources and the likely claims on them). This willprovide (by about the end of June) an up-to-date assessment of what lies ahead overthe next four years; and until that is available, it would be impracticable to attemptto fix planning limits for public expenditure. It is accordingly suggested that therates of growth or limits to be adopted for planning purposes for the main blocks of expenditure should be determined in the light of this year&apos;s public expenditure survey.
7. It may be convenient to remind our colleagues of the purpose of this operation. For the last four years public expenditure has been rising fast andhas represented an increasing proportion of the Gross National Product. This^process cannot go on for long without serious implications for the whole economy.This year we have been able to justify a 10 per cent increase (in money terms) inthe Supply Estimates on the grounds of reflation; but (unless our economic policyfails completely) the same argument is unlikely to be available in 1964. In his speech in the Budget Debate on 8th April, 1963, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, speaking as a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, expressed the view that a regular 10 per cent increase in expenditure each year would bring inflation, and emphasised theimportance of the Plowden recommendations for control of public expenditure.We shall know more in July. But all the evidence suggests that expenditure will go on increasing at about the recent rate unless we take positive steps to bringthe increase under control. If expenditure is not to be seen to have got out of hand it is vital that we should this summer establish a system of forward control ofexpenditure. Even so, it will take time for such a system to have effect in somefields there is limited scope for adjustments even five years ahead, because of theinexorable effect of decisions which have already been taken, and for some timeexpenditure may well go on increasing faster than the Gross National Product.But at least, if a system on the lines we suggest is adopted, it would be possibleto keep the increase within bounds.8. We accordingly ask the Cabinet to take note of this outline of our proposalsfor the control of public expenditure and of the fact that we intend to makedetailed proposals in July, in the light of this year&apos;s survey of public expenditure.R.
