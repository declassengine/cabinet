Negotiation continued for a period of a month by telegram and teleprinteras well as by telephone communications directly with the President and throughthe medium of the British Ambassador in Washington, Sir David Ormsby Gore.This resulted in a final agreement on the text of the message, Annex B, to Khrushchevwhich the British and American Ambassadors in Moscow have now been instructedto deliver as soon as they can get an interview with Khrushchev himself.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. 1,18th April, 1963.
Annex a text OF THE PRIME MINISTERS LETTER TO PRESIDENT KENNEDYDATED 16th MARCH, 1963Dear Friend,I was very glad to get your message about the whole problem of the nuclearforces.The more I think of it, the more constructive I believe our Nassau declaration was. In whatever form our plans ultimately emerge, the spirit in which they were launched has undoubtedly been more and more understood as the weeks have passed. I was very glad too to have a chance of seeing an old friend, LivvyMerchant, and to hear from him some account of his journeys. I left Alec home to discuss some of the problems with him in detail.With the signature of the technical agreement between our countries arisingfrom Nassau, the foundation of one part of our work will be well and truly laid.Nor do I think it will ever be abandoned by any Government here. After long experience I have found that we are all of us apt to say things when we are notin authority which we do not feel either willing or able to carry out when wesucceed to responsibility.But thinking so much about all these matters has led me, and I expect you,to turn back to another part of this nuclear problem, far more constructive in reality; for it might open the path to something better for the world than merelybuilding vast forces which if not used are wildly expensive, if used are whollydestructive to mankind, and which at the best keep a kind of uneasy peace by a balance of horror. So, after much thought, I am impelled to write to you togive you my ideas about the question of nuclear tests and the possibility of anagreement to ban them.You and I both remember well the background of our meeting at Bermuda.Then the agreement, which had seemed in our grasp two or three years before,when we had a moratorium informal but nevertheless very welcome to the world-had been frustrated by the massive Russian tests in the previous autumn. Howfar Mr. Khrushchev made these for internal political reasons, or how far he wishedto frighten and impress the neutral and unallied world with his power, is only amatter for speculation. But it was certainly a great shock to us all. When wemet in Bermuda in December 1961 I had the feeling that you were as anxiousas I to avoid having to reply with another series of tests, American and British yours of course on a far greater scale than ours. I remember well the discussions and the difficulty of getting any very clear picture from the experts. Incidentally,
the more I discuss this problem, the more I find that we laymen talk about thetechnical aspect and the experts always tell us that it is a political problem.Perhaps there is some lesson to be drawn from this.At Bermuda, we resisted the temptation to hold a new series on political grounds as an answer to the Russians, although we were, with some difficulty,persuaded that it was necessary to do so on military grounds in order to protect the vital interests of the Western Alliance. This was the theme of our announcementat Bermuda. It was on this basis that I was able to persuade my colleagues and parliament to give their consent to the joint operation and to the use of christmas island.All the same in the Christmas atmosphere of that year I felt impelled to write to you an inexcusably long letter to set out my thoughts and feelings.After some exchange of messages, we decided to accompany our announcementof tests by a rather novel approach to the question, which made a considerableimpression, in both our countries. We sent joint letters to Mr. Khrushchev onFebruary 7, 1962, followed by two sets of letters in broadly similar terms a weekand 10 days later. The point, you will remember, was that although the Westerntests had to be made, we hoped that this series would be regarded as the end ofa definite round and that we should all try to concentrate on the DisarmamentConference about to open in Geneva to this body the subject of the Test Ban hadbeen transferred at the request of Russia. We both promised to take a personalinterest in this and to try to bring matters to a head whenever the moment seemedright. The words that I used to Mr. Khrushchev on February 25 were:&quot; As I told you in my letter of February 14, I am also very ready to take part personally in these negotiations, when it seems that the presence of Headsof Government can be of positive value. Two situations might arise in whichthis method might be fruitful. The first is if the Conference is makingsatisfactory and definite progress. In such a case a meeting of the Heads ofGovernment might well serve to consolidate what had been achieved and totake a further step towards an actual agreement.The second situation is one in which certain major and clear points of disagreement have emerged which threaten to hold up further progress. Inthat case the Heads of Government should perhaps meet in order to try tobreak the deadlock.&quot;On February 24 you sent a message to Khrushchev in which you said:&quot; The Heads of Government should meet to resolve explicit points of disagreement which might remain after the issues have been carefullyexplored and the largest possible measures of agreement have been worked out at the diplomatic level.&quot;The fact that both Dean Rusk and Alec Home went to Geneva for the openingConference to start it off was intended to underline the importance which you and I attached to the meeting.
During recent months the negotiations have made considerable progress.The Russians have now publicly accepted the principle of inspection. It is truethat they seemed to accept this three years ago, but they had afterwards verydefinitely rejected it. They have now accepted it definitely and have also acceptedthree annual inspections. The West has moved down from 20 inspections to seven.So, from the man in the streefs point of view, the two sides have come a greatdeal nearer. Indeed, to the layman, we would seem so near that it would be almost inconceivable that the gulf could not be bridged. There are, of course, anumber of other points to be settled in connexion with these inspections so asto ensure that they are a reality and not a farce. But I do not feel that the Russianrefusal to discuss them until the number is settled means that they will use these points as a way of bringing the negotiations to an end. If they were to do soafter an agreement on numbers had been reached they would be in a very badposture before the world.I have wondered in my own mind and tried to find some answer to thequestion as to why Mr. Khrushchev suddenly moved forward on the inspectionissue. So long as he stood upon the principle that any form of inspection involvedespionage he had at least a logical position. We may think it ridiculous but it isin conformity with the well-known Russian sensitiveness to contacts with the outside world and with the almost Oriental xenophobia which has been traditionalin Russia whether Tsarist or Communist. But, having abandoned this position,it is difficult to argue that three inspections do not endanger security while four,five, six or seven might. I wonder perhaps whether there was some realmisunderstanding in his mind over this, and whether he somehow got it into hishead that if he moved on the principle, you would accept a quota of two or three.Mr. Khrushchev, like an old elephant, has a very tenacious memory. For example,in conversation in Moscow in 1959 when this matter was first under discussionI casually mentioned various figures for annual inspections, from 12 down to three,as an illustration of my general argument in favour of a test agreement. Since then he has affected to regard this chance observation as a substantive proposal by theBritish Government. Of course he should know that it was not. But that is theway he has learned to think or double think. Similarly, something must have happened recently to explain Khrushchev&apos;s apparently genuine mood ofexasperation and distrust. However, whatever may be the explanation, that isthe position, and there now appears to be a deadlock based upon the questionof number.What, then, are we to do? Of course, there are very strong arguments for doing nothing. Strong logical arguments, strong political arguments. But thisis not the spirit in which you, who carry the largest responsibility, before God andman, have faced your duty, nor that in which I have tried to do the same. I havea feeling that the test ban is the most important step that we can take towardsunravelling this frightful tangle of fear and suspicion in East-West relations important in itself and all the more important for what may flow from it. All thesame, strictly it is the Russian turn to move.   They have come from nothing to
three; you have come from 20 to seven, and it is up to them to make a bid. Ifthey want a Treaty they can get one-and, it will be argued if they do not want one,why negotiate at considerable risk. Why is it that the West always have to move?Why is it that all the concessions seem to come from us? And so on. Then ofcourse there are quite strong groups of opinion who are really in favour of tests.Some scientists think it is a pity not to know all you can know. It seems almostrestrictive and reactionary not to blow things up to find out what would happenwhen they go off. Others are very fearful as to whether in some way or another important lessons might be learned by the Russians from a clandestine series ofdisconnected tests. I assume that this is the old question of yield for weight, whichmay have some bearing upon the development of the anti-missile missile in its most sophisticated form. On the other hand, there are equally strong bodies ofopinion that feel that from a purely scientific point of view on the figures we arediscussing there is not very much more danger in the small number of inspectionsthan in the larger one.I have just been reading a short account of this whole story from the beginningand I am impressed by the fact that whenever we seem to get near a solutionsomebody finds out a new scientific theory. The big hole was itself a good example of this, and in that hole are likely unless we are careful to be buried the hopes of mankind. All the same, the arguments against moving can be powerfully putforward, and I have no doubt are very strong politically with you. To these thatI have mentioned can be added that if we do sign a Test Ban the French and chinese will stand out and so in the end we may not be so very much further on.Finally, it is alleged that there is not very much pressure on either side to start a newseries of tests.However, since it seems to take a couple of years or more to evaluate one set of tests and to make the necessary preparation for the next, this lull may provevery deceptive. We may within a year or two be faced with the same situationwhich confronted us in 1961 in Bermuda. Apart from avoiding the practical difficulty that hangs over us in the near future, I am sure you will agree that wewould gain enormously if this Treaty could be made. First, it would stop thecontamination of the atmosphere. We have been thinking so much about the underground tests that we tend to forget the injury done by atmospheric testing.While it might not stop the Chinese and the French tests altogether, it wouldcertainly drive them both underground, which is a good thing from this angle.Secondly, I am quite sure that it would have a very considerable effect upon some countries which may be hesitating about what to do. For instance, Sweden, Indiaand Israel, and other countries which will be almost bound to enter the nuclear raceunless they can find an excuse not to do so. Thirdly, the effect on the worldof an agreement solemnly entered into by our two countries with Russia wouldbe enormous. It would give a tremendous new sense of hope. We could probablysucceed in giving a new impetus to the Disarmament Conference and might also give a lead on other fronts.
It would be a great gain, of course, if Sweden, India, Israel and the rest would undertake not to test; but I have a feeling that if we get the test ban agreement,there would be another prize just as important to be secured. We ought to beable simultaneously to get a non-dissemination agreement; an undertaking, thatis, from non-nuclear countries not to accept nuclear power at the gift of others,for their sole use, and from nuclear Powers not to give nuclear weapons orknowledge to non-nuclear countries. To me this seems the real key to the german problem; one which gives a good deal of anxiety both to the Russians and tous, and, to be fair, to many Germans; who are genuinely anxious lest in due course they or their successors will be forced to become a nuclear Power. It isquite true that Germany is bound by all kinds of agreements and undertakings.But these could easily be represented by a bad German in the future as the moderncounterpart of Versailles. We know only too well what might follow from allthat way of thinking. Indeed, speaking frankly, the most attractive part of clause 8 of the Nassau Agreement is that it may give the Germans a sense of participation without incurring these dangers. But I feel that a test agreementaccompanied by a non-dissemination agreement would serve to underline Clause 8if we are able to bring Clause 8 into operation, and anyway would be effective initself. No German could then say that Germany had been forced into thisabnegation in a period of weakness just after the war when the present treaties oragreements were made.On the contrary the Germans could claim with pride that, with other greatStates, Germany had entered into this undertaking as a contribution to thesolution of one of the gravest problems which confronts the world. At the sametime, this is a prospect which must appeal equally to the Russians. The countries of the West have, thank God for it, decided to rebuild their bridges with Germany.We have tried to forget about the two wars and the Hitler persecutions and all therest. This is true of your country and mine, and to be fair, of the French. all this is good. But then, without being cynical, we all have an interest, because theGermans are our Allies against the Communists. The Russians both hate andfear the Germans. They hate them, inspired by the cruel memories which we havedecided to blot out; they fear them as an efficient hard-working, brave and determined people. Nor can they fail to be conscious of the pressure which theyput continually upon German patience by the obstinacy with which they enforceto the division of Germany. For all these reasons, then, I think the tests ban,followed by adherence of other countries not to test, accompanied bya non-dissemination agreement which was reasonably well supported, would havea profound effect in removing the present state of tension in the world.Of course whatever agreement is made, the Russians might be able to evadeit and we might not be able to catch them. From our point of view, if there are some 25 unidentified events of Magnitude 4 or over annually in Russia then ofcourse with seven inspections we have nearly a one in four chance of catchingthem out; with five we have a one in five chance, and with only three we have one
in nine. Naturally, if they make a definite series, we have a better chance of finding them out. There is also the possibility that they might so arrange the testsat the end of the year that we would have exhausted our right of inspection.However, this and other difficulties might be got over in negotiation, not merely by splitting the difference between seven and three but by some arrangement tocarry over unused inspections to an agreed extent, from one year to another.Since our machines, whether operated overtly or covertly, will continue to improvewe are likely to need fewer annual inspections as time goes on, and an arrangement of this kind for carry-over of inspections might be one way of allowing ourselvesenough inspections at first without over-ensuring for the future.So much for the chances of our catching them if they cheated. However Iam bound to say that I think they would be at great risk if they did cheat aftersigning the Treaty. Although they might have no moral inhibitions in breakingtheir world, I think they would be abashed at being publicly shown up before theworld; and, what is more important, they would lose the great benefits of anon-dissemination agreement, with all that this implies in Central Europe.So we come to the problem of how we are to renew the negotiations with aview to bringing them to a satisfactory conclusion. Looking back to our declaration in 1962 I am bound to say that I feel myself under an obligation toact in acordance with what I then said. Certainly in my statement, which perhapswent further than yours, I undertook to do something about it in either of twosituations, one of which is now approaching.There are various possibilities:(a) I can see the disadvantage in merely offering five inspections through the geneva negotiators with no certainty that this would be accepted. Arejection would be very bad politically for you, although not so much for me.(b) I can see the dangers involved, although I think the advantages might welloutweigh them, in simply suggesting that we all three should meet and try to settle the matter. If the West then offered five andKhrushchev stood out, our position might not be very dignified butit would not be ignoble.(c) We could summon a conference on the understanding that the conditionsof the inspections were first brought near to a conclusion, so that weshould only have to settle the final steps to be taken on these togetherwith the question of numbers. But it would still be a risk.(d) Or, if it was better for you, I could write to you and Khrushchev eitherprivately or publicly or both, suggesting that we should all meet atGeneva. If he refused, it would be a great disappointment and weshould not get the agreement, but again it would not be discreditable.(e) Before suggesting either jointly or separately a conference of the Heads of governments, we might make some further soundings.
In this connexion, I still feel there is something queer about Khrushchev&apos;smove towards accepting the principle of inspection. There may have been somegenuine misunderstanding in his mind, or perhaps some misunderstanding ormisrepresentation by those Russians who reported to him what they picked up in geneva. Possibly therefore you could send some personal message to Khrushchevon this matter or perhaps some emissary such as Averell or even your brotherBobby who would both clear up any misunderstanding and find out whether therewas a chance of settling round about five or by some juggling with the numbers,including the conception of bisques and the limit for any one year, coupled ofcourse with what I think could be made very attractive to Khrushchev, thenon-dissemination aspect.Some of my telegrams report that he is supposed to have lost interest in the nuclear test ban but if that is so, it may weli be because he has not had thenon-dissemination aspect sufficiently impressed upon him.I am sorry to inflict so long a letter on you, but I feel this very deep personalobligation upon me and it is one which, in some form or another, I must dischargebefore it is too late. I do not, as you know, want to trouble you on the telephonebut I would be very glad to hear first from you either through David Gore orby teleprinter message, and then perhaps we could have a talk to clarify any outstanding points.I am sending this letter to you through David who is fully conversant withall our ideas and whom I know you trust as much as I do.HAROLD macmillan.
Annex BTEXT OF THE PRIME MINISTERS LETTER TO MR. KHRUSHCHEVDATED 15th APRIL, 1963Dear Mr. Chairman,You will recall that in February and March 1962, we had some correspondenceabout the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and in particular about the possibilityof reaching agreement on the text of a treaty to ban nuclear tests. Both president kennedy and I pledged ourselves to take a personal interest in the progress ofthis Conference on which so many of the hopes of mankind have been fixed. last october we both indicated in messages to you our intention to devote renewedefforts to the problem of disarmament with particular reference to the proliferationof nuclear weapons and the banning of nuclear tests.Since then the Geneva meeting has continued but it has not reached the pointof definite agreement. Nevertheless, some encouraging advance has been made.For example, your acceptance of the principle of on-the-spot verification ofunidentified events has been of great value. Equally, the Western countries havebeen able to reduce the number of annual inspections for which they felt it essentialto ask, from about 20 down to seven. The difference remaining is of course real and substantial, if only because it presents in practical form the effects of two different lines of reasoning. At the same time the actual difference between thethree inspections which you have proposed and the seven for which we are asking,important though this is, should not be impossible to resolve. As regards the automatic seismic stations, the difference between us appears to be fairly narrow.We all have a duty to consider what are the needs of security; but we also have a duty to humanity. President Kennedy and I therefore believe that we oughtto make a further serious attempt by the best available means to see if we cannotbring this matter to a conclusion with your help.We know that it is argued that a nuclear tests agreement, although valuable and welcome especially in respect of atmospheric tests, will not by itself make a decisive contribution to the peace and security of the world. There are, of course,other questions between us which are also of great importance; but the questionof nuclear tests does seem to be one on which agreement might now be reached.The mere fact of an agreement on one question will inevitably help to createconfidence and so facilitate other settlements. In addition, it is surely possiblethat we might be able to proceed rapidly to specific and fruitful discussions aboutthe non-dissemination of nuclear power leading to an agreement on this subject.
Such an agreement if it was reasonably well supported by other countries, wouldseem to us likely to have a profound effect upon the present state of tension in theworld. If it proved possible to move promptly to an agreement on nuclear weapons and on the proliferation of national nuclear capability, an advance to broaderagreements might then open up.The practical question is how best to proceed. It may be that further discussions would reveal new possibilities from both sides as regards thearrangements for the quota of inspections. But if we attempted to reach this pointby the present methods both sides may feel unable to make an advance because this would appear to be surrendering some point of substance without obtaining a final agreement on a definite treaty in exchange. It may be that we could make some progress on this question of numbers by exploring an idea which has been mentioned by the neutral nations in Geneva the idea that a quota of on-siteinspections might be agreed upon to cover a period of several years, from whichinspections could be drawn under more flexible conditions than an annual quotawould permit.But at the moment it is not only the question of numbers which holds us up,but we also have to agree on the final content of the draft treaty and in particular todecide certain important questions as to how inspections are to be carried out. you have taken the view that once the quota is agreed the other matters can easily besettled, whereas we feel that the final agreement about the number of inspectionsis unlikely to be possible unless most of the other matters have been first disposedof. Thus we have reached an impasse.We should be interested to hear your suggestions as to how we are to breakout of this. For our part we should be quite prepared now to arrange privatetripartite discussions in whatever seemed the most practical way. For example, ourchief representatives at Geneva could conduct discussions on the questions which remain to be settled. Alternatively, or at a later stage, President Kennedy and Iwould be ready to send in due course very senior representatives who would beempowered to speak for us and talk in Moscow directly with you. It would be ourhope that either in Geneva or through such senior representatives in Moscow we might bring the matter close enough to a final decision so that it might then be proper to think in terms of a meeting of the three of us at which a definite agreement on a test ban could be made final. It is of course obvious that a meeting of thethree of us which resulted in a test ban treaty would open a new chapter in ourrelations as well as providing an opportunity for wider discussions.We sincerely trust that you will give serious consideration to this proposal.We believe that the nuclear tests agreement and what may follow from it is the mosthopeful area in which to try for agreement between us. The procedure which wehave suggested seems to us the most practical way of achieving a result which wouldbe welcomed all over the world.TOP SECRET
