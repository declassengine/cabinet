IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)GV(63X.85 COPY NO. ......20th May, 1963CABINETSOUTHERN RHODESIAMy colleagues will realise that the elaborate exchanges which wehave been having with the Southern Rhodesia Government and Sir roy welensky have cost us two valuable months of delay in proceeding towind up the Federation. \ , 1)2,        The exchanges and the delay have in fact been inevitable since our objective has been to summon a Conference on dissolution and futurelinks.    The Southern Rhodesia and Federal Governments have refused toattend unless Southern Rhodesia gets the assurances she wants aboutindependence.   Without their attendance there could not be a Conferencesince there would be nobody there except Northern Rhodesia.    On theother hand, if we go too far in meeting Southern Rhodesia and theFederation, Northern Rhodesia will not attend.    Ii we try to dissolvethe Federation unilaterally we are in for a period of non co-operation andobstruction for which I would not like to be responsible.3.        We have therefore been trying to seek a via media and we havemade some progress.    The Southern Rhodesia Government have agreedthat their independence should coincide with the dissolution of theFederation.    They have also agreed that talks prior to independenceshould be held to settle the terms of independence.    We have agreedthat these talks should take place at an early date starting on 27th Mayprovided the invitations go out for a Dissolution Conference.4.        We are therefore in sight of an orderly Dissolution Conferenceprovided we can get through at any rate the first round of the pre-independence talks.    I say the first round because v/e have deliberatelywarned the Southern Rhodesia Government that we may have to resume the talks at a later date.    Mr, Field on his side has warned us that hisGovernment may have to break and not attend the Dissolution Conference,if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the pre-independence talks.5.        The purpose of this paper is to describe how best to get through this next immediate round.    I should be deluding my colleagues if I gave the impression that we could get out of Mr. Field a promise of futurerepresentative government such as could satisfy the Pan-African move-ment.    The Rhodesian Front was elected on a definite ma.ndate and theyare unlikely to wish or to be able to depart widely from it.    All we can hope to obtain is an indication of progress - and the more immediate and effective it can be made, the better - along the lines of greater representa-tion for the Africans and of a wider degree of non-discrimination, such as would appeal to the majority of our Party in the House and to the more moderate members of the Commonwealth.
6.        Let me take first greater representation of the Africans.There are two methods :-Fijrst. by enlarging the &apos;A&apos; (i. e. Higher) Roll franchiseSecond by increasing the number of &apos;B&apos; Roll (Africancontrolled) seats.(i)    Enlarging the &apos; A&apos; Roll franchise.At present the &apos;A&apos; Roll consists of 87,500 Europeans,1, 100 Asian, 1, 300 Coloured and ?., 600 Africans.    Sir EdgarY/hitehead estimated that it would take fifteen years for enoughAfricans to qualify for the &apos;A&apos; Roll to enable them to command itselections.   We might now propose that the qualifications be loweredto include more Africans.   This could not operate before anotherelection but it might then have a material result in returning african members, while others would depend on African votes for election,thus reducing the gap between the pro-European and pro-Africanelement in the Legislature,(&quot;)     Increasing the number of &apos;6&apos; Roll seats and/or widening thefoajn^h^^f^r^hese seats.What public opinion would welcome would be an increase ofthese seats to a &quot;blocking third&quot; that is twenty-two out of the presentsixty-five, but, if this is not to be done at the expense of the &apos;A&apos; Roll seats the size of the Assembly would have to be increased.   importance is attached to this since certain constitutional amendments can becarried and the delaying powers of the Constitutional Council set aside by a two-thirds majority.    But a major difficulty in getting the Southern Rhodesia Government to agree is that they have a majorityof only five and this increase combined with the Whitehead Party&apos;svotes would defeat them.    Mr. Field is said to be ready to widen the franchise for the &apos;B&apos; Roll seats so this can be discussed.7.        Mr. Field has also suggested abolishing the cross-voting bywhich electors on each roll influence elections of candidates for seatson the other roll.    This system was intended to encourage all candidateto broaden the basis of their appeal in order to attract votes from bothrolls.    Candidates campaigning on a non-racial platform thus have an advantage over those seeking support on purely racial lines.   Had, forexample, the Africans participated in the last elections it is likely that Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s non-racial party would have attractedsufficient African votes to have swung the result away from the lessliberal Rhodesia Front party.    It is not perhaps surprising therefore that Mr. Winston Field should favour the abolition of cross-voting.The elimination of the cross-voting system would be contrary to thespirit of the new Constitution since it was intended to be a means of ensuring an increasingly non-racial approach in Southern Rhodesianlife and politics.    It would mean the end of the built-in advantage atpresent given to moderate political parties and might well result inthe death of Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s broadly-based party and themulti-racial ideal.-2-
8.        In addition to political representation and the franchise thereis another consideration which might be taken into account in negotiating an acceptable settlement.   That is the future policy of theSouthern Rhodesia Government.    If Mr. Winston Field were preparedto make a helpful declaration of intention in regard to such matters asracial discrimination, the Constitutional Council and the Constitutionitself, it would be unreasonable to expect this to do more than assist us to dress up a deal based on some franchise concession.9.        We may have great difficulty in these negotiations, but it isat any rate worth trying to make some progress along the lines of this paper since the stakes are high.    I cannot at present guarantee howfar we shall get.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S. V/. 1.20th May, 1963-3-
