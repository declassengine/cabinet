W. 1.12th June, 1963
PRIME MINISTERJust &quot;before the Parliamentary recess you asked me toexamine the security reports and other documents you had received in relation to vdiat I may call the Stephen Ward case, to make such enquiries as I thought necessary of the security authoritiesand of the police and to advise you whether in my opinion anyfurther action is necessary.2.     I have now completed my investigations and the following-are my conclusions.(a) There is no ground for supposing that any breach of security occurred.(b) The Security Service did not know of Mr. Profumo&apos;s association with Miss Christine Keeler until January,1963- when he told them of his acquaintanceship with her but did not disclose the nature of thatassociation.(c) No information about Mr. Profumo!s relationship andvisits to Miss Christine Keeler was ever   given byMr. Ward to the Security Service.(d) The Security Service after they had learned ofMr. Ward&apos;s friendship with Capt. Ivanov warned Mr. Ward,and after they had learned that Mr. Profumofsacquaintanceship with Mr. Ward was more than just ameeting at Cliveden they took steps to see that hewas warned about Mr. Ward.   He was not warned inrelation to Miss Christine Keeler, for the security service had no information of Miss Christine Keeler&apos;s association with Mr. Ward or with Capt. Ivanov, orof her association with Mr. Profumo.(e) The warning was given to Mr. Profumo bySir Norman Brook, then Secretary of the cabinet.He did not    give any warning about Miss Christine Keelerand nothing was said by him or by Mr. Profumo on the9th August, 1961, when the warning was given, aboutMiss Christine Keeler.   Sir Norman Brook knewnothing about Miss Christine Keeler at the timeand he did not report to the Prime Minister that hehad warned Mr. Profumo about Mr. Ward.(f) If it be the fact that the effect of giving the warning on 9th August, 1961, to Mr. Profumo was thetermination by him of his association both withMiss Christine Keeler and with Mr. Ward, as he has stated to me, then it may be said that an earlierwarning would or might have prevented Mr. Profumo fromgetting so involved.   The knowledge the security service then possessed did not suggest to them thai-there was any immediate urgency and apart from possiblecriticism on this I myself do not see that there is anyvalid ground for criticism of the Security Service.They did not put a v/atch upon Mr. Ward&apos;s flat either before or after the A 2th July.   They had information which led them to suppose both from their assessment of his character and his close friendship withCapt. Ivanov that Mr. Ward was unreliable but they hadnot at that time any grounds for supposing that awatch upon Mr. Ward&apos;s flat would be productive ofany useful information.
(g)    Mr. Ward acted for and on behalf c : Capt. Ivanov for thepurpose of obtaining information from the ForeignOffice and introduced Capt. Ivanov to a number of people he might not otherwise have met.   Whether he isto be regarded as a dupe of Capt. Ivanov^ or as an active collaborator, I cannot say.   He admitted to theForeign Office that he knew that anything he saidto Capt, Ivanov which was of interest to the soviet authorities would be communicated to them.So that you may see on what my conclusions are based, Ipropose to set out in detail and so far as possible inchronological order the facts as they appear as a result of the examination and enquiries I have made.3.   Mr. Stephen Ward practises as an osteopath in London.In recent years he has also practised as an artist.   He wascommissioned by the Illustrated London News to do a series ofpencil drawings of prominent people including Ministers for thepaper.h.   In the late 19h0&apos;s Sir Godfrey Nicholson, M,P., becameone of his patients.   Since then Sir Godfrey has been treated by Mm on a number of occasions.    Sir Godfrey found thetreatment so satisfactory that he recommended Mr. Ward to manyof his friends and acquaintances.   He has also endeavoured to helpMr. Ward by getting prominent people to sit for him.   Sir Godfreynever went to any of Mr. Ward&apos;s parties or to his cottage atCliveden,5.   One of the persons introduced by Sir Godfrey to Mr. Ward for treatment was Sir Colin Coote, the Editor of the Daily Telegraph.Mr. Ward told Sir Colin several times that he would like to go to moscow and sketch some of the personalities there.    Sir Colinthought that such a visit might be useful for his paper.   Hehad met Capt, Ivanov, the Soviet Assistant Naval Attache when a party of Attaches had visited the Daily Telegraph building inFleet Street,Sir Colin had invited Capt. Ivanov to lunch with him at theGarrick Club to meet the Daily Telegraph Special Correspondenton Communist affairs and in view of Mr. Ward&apos;s desire to go toRussia to make sketches, he invited Mr. Ward to join them.The luncheon party took place on the 20th January, 1961.It was in this way that Mr. Ward made the acquaintance ofCapt. Ivanov.6,    Thereafter Mr. Ward became very friendly with Capt. Ivanov,This came to the notice of the Security Service and on the8th June, 1961 they warned Mr. Ward about Capt. Ivanov.7,   On Friday the 7th July, 1961 Mr. and Mrs. Profumo werestaying with Lord Astor at Cliveden.   Mr. Ward was at hiscottage  on the estate.   He was allowed to use Lord Aster&apos;sbathing pool.   That evening he was at the bathing poolaccompanied by four or five girls, one of whom wasMiss Christine Keeler, and Capt. Ivanov.   The Profumos went withother guests of Lord Astor to the( bathing pool and there met mr., Ward, Capt. Ivanov and the girls who were with Mr. Ward.It was on this occasion that Mr. Profumo first metMiss Christine Keeler,-2.-*TOP SECRET
80   Three days later on Monday the 10th July Mr, Wardtelephoned a Security Officer and said that he had some information to give him.   They agreed to meet for lunch onWednesday the 12th July,   Mr. Ward then said that Capt. Ivanovhad told him a few days before that the Russians knew as a factthat the American Government had taken a decision to arm western germany with atomic weapons and that Capt. Ivanov had asked himto find out through his influential friends when this decision was to he implemented.   Capt0 Ivanov, according to Mr.; Ward,implied that if Mr. Ward secured this information, the tripwhich Mr. Ward wished to make to Moscow would be facilitated.Mr. Ward was very keen to go to Moscow and to draw Mr. Khrushchev.Mr. Ward was most anxious that no action should he taken against Capt, Ivanov on this information and asked what he should do about Capt. Ivanov&apos;s request.   He suggested that this was perhaps an opportunity for him to assist the Security Service.When asked whether he meant by this that deception materialshould he passed through him to Capt. Ivanov, he said he wouldnot like to he used as a channel for deceiving Capt. Ivanovand asked whether it was not possible for him to be given sometrue information for passing to Ivanov to ensure that theRussians would not take political decisions on false information,,Mr, Ward was warned that he must make no attempt to complywith Capt, Ivanov1s request.9.    It would seem probable that this conversation between mr. Ward and Capt, Ivanov took place during the course of the weekend commencing the 7th July.   It was on that weekend thatMr, Profumo first met Capt. Ivanov.   I have questionedMr. Profumo about this and asked him whether Mr., Ward orCap to Ivanov said anything to him that weekend on this or anyother political issue of that character,   I am satisfiedthat no conversation took place between Mr. Profumo andCapt. Ivanov that weekend on any such matters and thatMr. Profumo did not disclose to him anything he should havekept secret. It is indeed inherently improbable thatCapt. Ivanov should have raised such a question on his firstmeeting with Mr. Profumo.So far as I can ascertain, Mr. Ward has never asserted thatduring this weekend he had any political discussion withMr. Profumo.   Mr. Profumo has told me that he has no recollectionof having had one with Mr. Ward.10.   At the meeting on the 12th July, 1961 with the SecurityOfficer, Mr. Ward revealed that he had met Mr. Profumo duringthe weekend of the 7th July.   When the Security Officer was later questioned by his superior on his r eport of the interviewof the 12th July, he supplemented his report by stating thatMr. Ward had said that the weekend of the 7th July was not theonly occasion on which he had met Mr. Profumo, that Mr. Wardclaimed that he and Mr. Profumo were quite close friends andMr. Profumo had visited him at his London home.In view of these allegations the Security Service thoughtit desirable to report the matter to Sir Norman Brook, theSecretary of the Cabinet.   The Security Service would not have thought it necessary or advisable to do so if the meeting between Mr. Ward and Mr. Profumo had been the only.meeting andthe only acquaintanceship of Mr. Profumo with Mr. Ward.
Sir Norman Brook did not think it necessary to reportthe matter to the Prime Minister but warned Mr. Profumo about Mr. Tferd on the 9th August, 1961.It is right to point out that apart from knowledge oftheir meeting at the bathing pool at Cliveden on the 7th July,the Security Service did not at this time know anything about any association between Mr. Profumo and Miss Christine Keeler,and consequently Sir Norman Brook at the time he warnedMr. Profumo had no knowledge of that.Mr. Profumo has told me that he met Mr. Ward a long time before 1961, that he was introduced to him by Lord Astor andthat he had on occasions been to parties at Mr. Ward&apos;s home.The Security Officer who interviewed Mr. Ward on the12th July did not report to his superior that Mr. Ward had told him of any visit by Mr. Profumo to Mr. Ward&apos;s flatbetween the 7th and 12th July.    \He has no recollection of having been told that, and if he had been told that byMr. Ward, he is confident that he would have mentioned it inhis report.I therefore conclude that Mr. Ward&apos;s reference on the12th July to Mr. Profumo&apos;s visit to his home related tovisits made before Mr. Profumo met Miss Christine Keeler.11.    Mr. Profumo told me that he terminated his association with Moss Christine Keeler on receipt of this warning on the9th August, 1961, and that he has not seen her since then.In his statement to the House of Commons on the 22nd March,1963 he said that he last saw Miss Christine Keeler inDecember, 1961.Mr. Profumo has told me that he was mistaken about this.He knew he had received the warning about Mr. Ward in thecourse of a Parliamentary recess and he was under theimpression that it was the Christmas recess.     He knew thathe had written to Miss Keeler the same day.There i s no doubt that the warning was in fact given tohim on the 9th August, 1961 and I have seen a photostaticcopy of a letter written by him to Miss Christine Keeler datedthe 9th August, 1961.After he had received the warning Mr. Profumo has told me that he did not see or speak to Mr. Ward until January,1963 when he had occasion to speak to him with regard to the events which were then occurring.     Between the weekend ofthe 7th July and the 9th August, he said he saw Mr. Ward fora few minutes on one or two of the occasions when he: visitedMiss Christine Keeler at Mr. Ward&apos;s flat.     After the weekendof 7th July he did not see Capt. Ivanov on any occasionexcept at a reception given in honour of Gagarin when he hada few words of polite conversation with him.12.   On the 2nd August, 1961 Lord Astor wrote to the ForeignOffice saying that his friend Mr. Stephen Ward had become a friend of Capt. Ivanov who was always asking him questions aboutthe general political intentions of the British.     He saidthat Mr. Ward was struck by how hard they (the Russians)seem to find it to assess British opinion and intentions &apos;accurately.
Lord Astor said he had met Capt. Ivanov who was, according toMr. Ward, &quot;an absolutely dedicated Communist and also a niceperson&quot;.Lord Astor said that it had occurred to him after talkingto Mr. Ward that if the Foreign Office wished to ensure atany particular moment that the: Russian Embassy was absolutely correctly informed as to Western intentions,Capt.  Ivanov might be useful.  He said Mr. Ward would pass on information himself or could very easily arrange forCapt. Ivanov to meet at a meal anyone the Foreign Office wished.13*    In consequence of this letter, Mr. Ward was seen on the18th September, 1961 by a member of the Foreign Office.Mr. Ward said he was no Communist but sympathetic in many respects with Soviet policy, that he saw a good deal ofCapt. Ivanov, that in fact Capt. Ivanov spent most weekendswith him at Cliveden, that they sometimes avoided politicsbut often discussed them, that Mr. Ward&apos;s impression was thatCapt. Ivanov was very interested to learn of any opinions which mr. Ward might have and even more of opinions which Mr, Wardmight pass on from his numerous influential acquaintances.Mr. Ward said that he hoped he might be able to turn hisfriendship with Capt. Ivanov to useful account and that if at any time there was anything which the British government might wish to get across to the Russians he would be verypleased to act as an intermediary.     Mr. Ward said he was sure that anything he let slip would be immediately recorded byCapt. Ivanov and suitable attention taken of it by theSoviet authorities.He was told that the Foreign Office would not be wantingto avail themselves of this offer.lk*   On the 21st February, 1962 Sir Godfrey Nicholson, M.P.,who had been introduced by Mr. Ward to Capt. Ivanov, spoke to the Foreign Office about a conversation he had had withCapt. Ivanov.   As a result of that conversation the foreign secretary had a note sent to him about the liritishGovernment&apos;s views on disarmament and said that he had noobjection to Sir Godfrey giving Capt. Ivanov a copy of thepaper.     Sir Godfrey did not send him this note but senthim a letter dated the 28th February, 1962, the terms ofwhich were first approved by the Foreign Office.15*   On the 6th March, 1962 Sir Godfrey Nicholson saw theForeign Secretary and told him that Capt. Ivanov was pressing him for a statement on the British position over berlin which he could communicate to the Russian authorities.The Foreign Secretary warned him in strong terms thatCapt. Ivanov must be regarded as working for the RussianIntelligence Service and advised Sir Godfrey to have nothing-more to do with him.     Sir Godfrey maintained that as anM.P. he must be allowed to talk to members of any foreignembassy he chose.     The Foreign Secretary said that he couldnot risk Sir Godfrey giving a wrong impression of theGovernment&apos;s policy and would therefore supply him with anote on the official British line on Berlin.Sir Godfrey drafted a letter to Capt. Ivanov, submittedit to the Foreign Office for approval and, after approval,of its terms by the Foreign Office, sent it to Capt. Ivanov.-5-
16.   On the 13th March Sir Godfrey again saw Capt. Ivanov who asked him a question ahout the British attitude to the Oder-NeisseLine.     Sir Godfrey wrote him a further letter on this, theterms of which were also first approved by the foreign Office.17.   On the 5th April, 1962 Sir Godfrey invited Sir HaroldCaccia to lunch with him.     One of the other guests was mr. Ward, who spoke about his contacts with Capt. Ivanov and suggested it might be useful if he could put Sir Harold Cacciain touch with Capt. Ivanov direct.     That invitation wasdeclined.   Sir Harold subsequently met Capt. Ivanov at the RussianEmbassy at the celebration of the Russian National Day inNovember, 1962.     He met Mr. Ward on one other occasion.   Heand Lady Caccia were staying the weekend of the 13th May,1962 at Cliveden with Lord Astor.     Mr., Ward came in oneevening for a drink before dinner.     Sir Harold had noconversation of substance with him.18.    On the 21+th October, 1962 (the time of the Cuban crisis)Mr. Ward telephoned the Resident Clerk at the Foreign Officeand said that he had been recommended to contact Sir HaroldCaccia by Lord Astor.     He gave the Resident Clerk an accountof a conversation he had just had with Capt. Ivanov who Mr. Wardsaid had called on him at his own (Capt. Ivanov&apos;s) request.Among other things he said that capt. Ivanov had stated thatthe Americans had created a situation in which there was absolutely no opportunity for either the Russians or the americans to compromise and that the Soviet Government looked to the United Kingdom for their one hope of conciliation.The Resident Clerk thanked Mr. Ward for the information.Mr. Ward then said that he would be seeing Capt. Ivanov againwithin the next two days and offered to speak to.him on anyline the Foreign Office might suggest.19.   On the next day, the 25th October, 1962,Sir Godfrey Nicholson went to the Foreign Office and sawSir Hugh Stephenson, then Deputy Under-Secretary.   He saidthat Capt. Ivanov had been to see him earlier that day andhad told him that the whole Russian Embassy was in a &quot;flatspin&quot; and that they must have, to restore the balance, some indication that the British Government were considering workingtowards negotiations at the summit.     capt. Ivanov toldSir Godfrey that the whole Russian Embassy knew that he was approaching him.Sir Hugh Stephenson told Sir Godfrey that this was amatter of high policy on which he could not possibly give an answer.     Sir Godfrey however insisted on some sort of answersince failure to answer in some way would be taken by theRussians to mean that a summit meeting was rejected, jSir Hugh Stephenson then told Sir Godfrey that theRussian Charge d&apos;Affaires had seen the Foreign Secretary onthe same afternoon.     Sir Godfrey immediately seized on this,as an opportunity, as he expressed it, of getting off thehook and volunteered that these unofficial channels were notat all satisfactory.     He then tried to telephone Mr. Wardand Capt. Ivanov from Sir Hugh Stephenson&apos;s room but did notsuceed in getting in touch with them.-6-
I should I think make it clear that the Foreign Officedo not use &quot;unofficial channels&quot; for conveying official information about Government policy and that on the occasions on which information was given to Sir Godfrey for communica-tion to Capt. Ivanov, it was to avoid all possibility ofmisrepresentation of British policy of which the foreign secretary considered there was a real danger.20.   Later the same afternoon Mr.&apos; Ward spoke on the telephoneto Sir Harold Caccia&apos;s Private Secretary, and told him thesame story about Capt. Ivanov as Sir Godfrey Nicholson had toldSir^Hugh Stephenson.     The Private Secretary said that theofficial channel was open to the Russians if they wished to use it and that the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires had seen theSecretary of State earlier that day.21.    The same day, Thursday, 25th October, 1962, Lord Astortold Lord Arran that there was a Russian official who was seeking to pass information of an urgent nature to the BritishGovernment.On the following day, 26th October, 1962, Mr. Wardtelephoned Lord Arran and said that he v/ould like to bringCapt. Ivanov to his house for discussions the next morning.Lord Arran agreed to this and Capt. Ivanov and Mr. Ward came to see him on the 27th October.     Capt. Ivanov stated&apos; that hispurpose was to get a message to the British Government byindirect means, asking them to call a summit conference inLondon forthwith.     He said that Mr. Khrushchev would acceptthe invitation with alacrity and that by doing this GreatBritain would break the deadlock over Cuba.     Lord Arran saidthat it appeared to him that what was being attempted by theRussians was to drive a wedge between Great Britain and the americans.     A full report of this interview was sent byLord Arran to the Foreign Office and to Admiralty House.22.    On the Sunday following, the 28th October, 1962,Lord Arran dined with Lord Astor at Cliveden.     He found his fellow guests were Mr. Ward and Capto Ivanov.     At this timeMr. Khrushchev&apos;s agreement to take the missiles out of Cubahad become known.23&quot;    On the 31 st October, Mr. Iain Macleod&apos;s daughter gave a party in his flat-.     A guest to the party brought Mr. Ward and&quot;someone from the Russian Embassy&quot;, presumably Capt. Ivanovsto the party.     It may be safely presumed that the intention wasto press on Mr. Macleod the same points in relation to Cuba ashad been put to the Foreign Secretary.     In fact Mr. Macleod wasnot present and has never met Mr. Ward or Capt. Ivanov.Mr. Macleod reported the incident both orally and in writing tothe Foreign secretar/&quot;.     No further attempt was made to contactMr. Macleod nor any member of his family.2k&apos;    On the 7th November Mr. Ward wrote to Mr. Harold Wilsontelling him that on Friday, 26th October, an offer was made bythe Russians to the Foreign Office in relation to Cuba, namely the proposal that this country should call a summit conference which the Russians would attend.     He asserted that he could&quot;vouch for authenticity of this since I was the intermediary&quot;.He asserted too that this offer was laid before Mr. Macmillanpersonally.-7-
25&apos;   Apart from the telephone calls referred to inparagraphs 18 and 20 above;, there is no shred of evidenceof any personal approach by Mr. Ward.     That he acted as an intermediary for Capt. Ivanov in getting 8ir Godfrey Nicholsonto visit and communicate with the Foreign Office and inapproaching Lord Arran is clear.26o    On the 1hth December, 1962 the shooting incident occurredoutside Mr. Ward&apos;s flat in Wimpole Mews.     Miss Christine Keelerwas in the flat.\\27&quot;    On the 26th December, 1962 Mr. Tomkins, then Head of theCentral Department of the Foreign Office, with his wife dinedwith Lord Ednam.     Mr. Ward, and Capt. Ivanov were also guestsat the dinner party.     At the beginning of the eveningMr. Tomkins got involved in a discussion about the Nassauagreement and the possibility of the Germans acquiring nuclearweaponso     The Nassau meeting had only just taken place and allMr. Tomkins knew about it was what he had read in the newspapers.28.    In a statement she made to the police on the30th January, 1963 Miss Christine Keeler said that only a month or so ago, she was asked by Mr. Ward to obtain if possible cer-tain secret information from Mr. Profumo regarding the transferof documents (sic) from America to Western Germany.I have also seen a report that she said to a friend,Miss Marshall, that Mr. Ward had asked her to ask Mr. Profumowhen the Germans were going to get the bomb and had said thathe wanted this information for Capt. Ivanov, and that whenMiss Christine Keeler refused to ask Mr. Profumo this he calledher &quot;a very foolish girl&quot;.The reference to &quot;documents&quot; in the statement of the30th January was presumably meant to be a reference to bombs.The request referred to in the statement of the30th January, 1963s must, if the statement is accurate, havebeen made long after the association between Mr. Profumo and miss Christine Keeler had ended if Mr. Profumo1s statements tome about this are correct.I have questioned Mr. Profumo on this matter.     He ispositive that at no time did Miss Keeler or Capt. Ivanov or mr. Ward ask him any such question.29-    On the 29th January, 1963 Capt. Ivanov left the UnitedKingdom.I30,   On the 22nd March Mr. Profumo made his statement in theHouse of Commons.31.    On the 26th March Colonel Wigg, M.P. received at theHouse of Commons a telephone message asking him to telephoneMr. Ward.     He did so.     Mr. Ward told him that three ofColonel Wigg&apos;s statements made on television on the nightbefore about Capt. Ivanov were incorrect.     He saidCapto Ivanov did not drive a sports car, wear Savile Row suitsor visit night spots.     Asked what his interest was, Mr. Wardreplied that Capt. Ivanov was a friend of his and was not hereto defend himself.     Mr. Ward agreed to come to the House ofCommons to see Colonel Wigg and did so that evening.-8-
Mr. Ward asserted to Colonel Wigg that on at least two occasions his friendship with Capt. Ivanov had been used inthe interests of this country.,     The first occasion was at thetime of the Berlin crisis.     Captc Ivanov had used him to informSir Harold Caccia and other senior Foreign Office people thatthe Soviet Union were prepared to adopt a conciliatory attitude over Berlin in return for Western guarantees of theOder-Neisse line.     When asked whether he had conveyed theinformation personally, he hedged and asserted that many important people in the Conservative Party including M.P.&apos;shad been involved in these matters.The second occasion was, he said, over Cuba.Capt. Ivanov, Mr. Ward said, on the Friday 27th October, 1962had asked him to pass on the view of the Russian Governmentthat the British Government should take the initiative insummoning a conference in London.     This information Mr. Wardsaid was conveyed personally to Lord Home and the PrimeMinister.     Mr..Ward would not say that he had given theinformation personally but said that very important people were involved. \\32.   These statements by Mr. Ward clearly refer to the matters dealt with in paragraphs 1 hr to 20 above.     I can find no indication that any M.P. other than Sir Godfrey Nicholson was involved in these approaches.33&quot;   At the same interview with Colonel Wigg Mr. Ward statedthat as far as he knew nothing improper took place between mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler.     He said that the intelligence service knew all about Mr. Profumo&apos;s visits, that he had keptrecords and had supplied the Intelligence Service with full particulars of the visits.According to reports I have seen in the Press, Mr. Wardhas repeatedly asserted that he informed M.I.5 of Mr. Profumo&apos;svisits to Miss Keeler.I have seen every report of every conversation v/hich tookplace between Mr. Ward and members of the Security Service.Mr. Ward did not on any occasion mention Mr. Profumo&apos;s associa-tion with Miss Keeler.     He did not report Mr. Profumo&apos;s visitsnor did he supply anyone in the Security Service with full, or indeed any details of them.I am satisfied that these statements made by Mr. Ward arenot true.     I do not propose to speculate on Mr. Ward&apos;smotives in giving the widest publicity to a story which ispatently false.3I4.0    Mr. Ward told Colonel Wigg that he had made considerableefforts to suppress publication in a newspaper of Miss ChristineKeeler&apos;s &quot;story&quot; and that he did a deal which involved publica-tion of his story and the suppression of her story and for whichhe received nothing except certain legal costs.     He alleged that Miss Christine Keeler had received payment for her storyand he complained that Miss Christine Keeler and another personhad got considerable sums from the Press which should right-fully be his.35. Colonel Wigg gave a full account of his conversation that evening to Mr. Harold Wilson who on the 9th April, 1963 sent acopy to the Prime Minister.-9-
36.     On the 7th May 1963 Mr. Ward telephoned thePrime Minister&apos;s Principal Private Secretary and asked tosee him.     He saw him at 9 o&apos;clock that evening.     ThePrime Minister had been informed and agreed, to the meeting.Mr. Ward complained that enquiries the police were making of his patients and others were ruining his practice, thathis only hope of redress was to bring a libel action andto call Mr. Profumo and Lord Astor as witnesses.     He saidthat the attachment between Mr. Profumo and Miss Christine Keelewas deeper than had been represented, but apart from this statement he produced no facts or evidence in support ofthis allegation.     He asserted that he had made a considerablesacrifice for Mr. Profumo, &quot;the biggest sacrifice he had made in his life&quot;, in that in exchange for an article written by Miss Keeler and for a letter, he had written or allowedan article to be written under his own name and published.He asked whether there was any action which could be takento clear his name and so allow him to drop his libel action.He was told there was not.37.     On the 19th May Mr. Ward wrote a letter to theHome Secretary.     In view of the publicity that has been directed to this letter, I think I had better state its contentsIt ran as follows:-&quot;Dear Sir,It has come to my attention that theMarylebone Police are questioning my patients andfriends in a line however tactful which is extremely damaging to me both professionally andsocially.     This enquiry has been going on day after day for weeks.The instructions to do this must have comefrom the Home Office.Over the past few weeks I have done what i could to shield Mr. Profumo from his indiscre-tion ahout which I complained to the security services at the time.When he made a statement in Parliament Ibacked it up although I knew it to be untrue.Possibly my efforts to conceal his part and to return to him a letter which Miss Keelerhad sold to the Sunday Pictorial might make it appear that I had something to conceal myself.I have not.The allegations which appear to be the causeof the investigation and which I only know throughthe line of questioning repeated to me aremalicious and entirely false.     It is an inventionof the Press that Miss Keeler knew a lot ofimportant people.It was by accident that she met Mr. Profumoand through Lord Astor that she met him again.I intend to take the blame no longer.-10-
That I was against this liaison is amatter of record in the Home Office.Sir Godfrey Nicholson, who has been a friend for twenty-five years, is in possessionof most of the facts since I consulted him atan early stage.May I ask that the person who has lodgedthe false information against me should be prosecuted,  \\Yours sincerely,STEPHEN WARD&quot;38.   In fact no complaint and no information by Mr. Wardabout Mr. Profumors relationship with Miss Christine Keelerwas ever received by the Security Service or the War Office.It will be seen that although Mr. Ward referred toMr. Profumo&apos;s &quot;indiscretion&quot; and &quot;liaison&quot; and to his efforts to conceal Mr. Profumo&apos;s part, he did not in this letterstate any facts in support of his allegations.39a   On the 20th May a letter vra.s sent to him from the HomeOffice telling him that the police, In making whateverenquiries they thought proper, do not act under the HomeSecretaryf s- direction.hO.   The same day, the 20th May, Mr, Ward wrote letters toSir Wavell Wakefield, M.P. and to Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P.His letter to Sir Wavell Wakefield was substantially to thesame effect as that which he had written to the Home Secretary.He complained of the police enquiries.    He said that a minister had not told the truth in Parliament, but again he did not give any grounds for that statement.   He said he wasnot present when Mr. Profumo met Miss Christine Keeler except on the weekend of the 7th July I96I and he asked that thosewho had given false and malicious information about himshould be prosecuted.   He ended his letter by saying &quot;I willnot endure this persecution any longer.    I intend further tomake a statement to the Press about this a  a later date.&quot;His letter to Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P. was substantially tothe same effect,I have now stated what appear to me to be the relevant facts in relation to this matter.   There is one minor matter which for the sake of completeness I should mention.Mr. Hugh Fraser, M.P., at one time was preparing to take acottage on the Cliveden estate.   About four years ago, whenhe was having tea at Cliveden he met Mr. Ward.   He also methim in March 1962, at lunch at Cliveden.    So far as he canrecollect the conversation was entirely general.   He nevervisited Mr. Ward&apos;s cottage at Cliveden and, apart from saying&quot;hello&quot; to him on one occasion on the river bank, had noother conversation with him.-11-
i+2.    I have not sought to interview those who were treated by Mr. Ward as an osteopath or those who sat to be drawn byhim, either for publication in the Illustrated London Newsor for commissioned drawings. Ministers, M.P!s and civilservants have of course always to be on their guard and itwould appear most improbable that any of those who sat for him or were treated by him would have disclosed to him any-thing which should have been kept secret.I have not in the course of my enquiries found anything which points to the communication to Mr. Ward or toCapt. Ivanov of any matter which should not have been disclosed.h3.    I heard a report that it was being said that theinstitution of criminal proceedings, against Mr. Ward wasbeing delayed at the instance of the Government.    I have thought it right to make enquiries about this though it seemed to me inconceivable that;there could be any substance in this suggestion.    I have seen the Director of public prosecutions and the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police andthey have assured me that such delay as has occurred has been due to the need to complete their enquiries and to considerthe case.   They have both assured me that no attempt has beenmade by anyone to delay the institution of proceedings.hh. The only evidence that I have seen of any attempt to useMiss Christine Keeler for the purpose of securing information is that set out in paragraph 28,1+5.   As you know, Sir Godfrey Nicholson is my wife&apos;s brother-in-law.   Despite the embarrassment I have questioned himsearchingly upon these matters.    I am satisfied that in seeking to communicate and in communicating to Capt. Ivanovinformation approved by the Foreign Office, he was inspired by the hope that his actions might help to alleviate thesituation,h6.    I have made as thorough an investigation as I can of allthe matters which appear to me relevant from the securityangle.    I have not seen Miss Christine Keeler nor have I seen mr. Ward but I have read the statements they have made.I do not think that any further investigation of whattook place between Capt. Ivanov&apos;s arrival in this country on the27th March, i960, and his departure on the 29th January, 19^39would serve any useful purpose nor do I consider that an oralexamination of either Mr. Ward or Miss Christine Keeler would throw any further light on the security question.It is for these reasons that I myself feel that nofurther enquiry is necessary or could be useful from thesecurity angle.House of Lords, S.W.1,11th June, I963.
