CABINETSTRUCTURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i invite my colleagues to agree that we should publish a White Paper on the modernisation of Local Government in Scotland at a convenient time beforethe Summer Recess.2. At their meeting on 22nd March the Home Affairs Committee wereprepared to commend in general principle the reorganisation scheme outlined tothem, but asked me to consider various points raised in discussion. The attached draft of the White Paper has been revised in the light of suggestions made.3. The Home Affairs Committee were concerned at the possibility that some local authorities might be hostile to the proposals, especially the smaller burghswhose identity would be lost. There will of course be a certain amount of criticism,but it is important not to over-estimate this. Dealing with the existing types of authority seriatim, no alteration is proposed in the functions exercised by the fourcities; the revised draft makes it clear that we will be prepared to discuss proposalsfor boundary extensions as part of the reorganisation; thus there is no reason to expect opposition from the cities.4. The county councils (33) are aware of the trend towards larger units;they have already conceded in part the argument for amalgamations, by formingjoint boards for a variety of functions. They may reasonably be expected toaccept the proposition that the whole council should be directly elected (thuseliminating the local pressure groups and voting complexities which arise fromburghal representation on the county council). They may also find the proposal that they should be responsible only for major services and these throughout their whole areas attractive. The President of the County Councils Associationsaid recently that the counties were prepared to take part in a review of structure.This attracted strong support in the Press.5. The large burghs (20) will, with two exceptions, be the headquarters ofnew burgh councils; in practice this gives them appreciable extensions of boundarieswhich will be welcome. The recognition of the large burghs as in effect the capitalsof their surrounding areas will offset the variations in functions proposed.6. There are 174 small burghs; 40 of those will be promoted and gain instatus as the headquarters of new burgh or rural councils. They will also be givenadditional functions. There remain the small burghs which will be amalgamatedwith neighbouring authorities. Many of them will, of course, be anxious not to lose their existing identity but this problem should be kept in its proper perspective,i.e., only 8 per cent of the population of Scotland live in small burghs whoseindividual status will not be enhanced under the reorganisation. The district councils (199) have only a few minor functions; they want more powers and mightsee a future in our proposals for rural councils. They are active only in some parts of the central belt and in a number of isolated areas.7. As regards the timetable, it has been suggested that we should not publishnow because a period of uncertainty would follow publication and there is no possibility of legislation this session. But consultations will be required wheneverwe publish and these will last for at least a year. The fact that we cannot legislateC. (63) 7429th April, 1963Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1963Copy No.   52
in the present Parliament is accordingly irrelevant to the decision when to publish.It is becoming fairly widely known that we have been carrying out an enquiry;this by itself makes for increasing uncertainty; and there are already signs that local authorities are holding back plans until they know the likely outcome.8. The Home Affairs Committee were also concerned about the arrangementsfor consultation. The traditional method of consultation on local governmentissues in Scotland is for Ministers to meet representatives of the local authority associations and seek their agreement to the establishment of working parties toexamine the details. Proposals are then referred back to Ministers and the associations. This is accepted as practical and equitable. I appreciate that itwill be necessary to allow for representations from individual authorities, but inmost cases I expect them to come through the associations. We will also considerviews expressed by responsible public bodies. I should emphasise, however, thatthere is no expectation in Scotland that the English procedure of setting up aLocal Government Commission, advertising proposals, and holding enquiries intoindividual objections will be followed. There is no precedent for this; theprocedure which we have in mind is more expeditious, and more in keeping withthe Scottish pattern of administration.9. One of the merits of our proposals is that they prescribe which type of authority should be responsible for particular functions. Delegation; may on occasion be required, but I hope that this would take place only because of individual circumstances and not as a general practice. The division of planning functions between the two tiers will require careful examination, but I see noreason why a solution on the lines recently adopted for the Greater London council should not prove equally advantageous for Scotland.10. We will get credit in many responsible quartets for having the politicalcourage to put forward a reorganisation which is widely reeognised to be overdue.I do not think that we need be unduly alarmed at the possibility of criticism whichmay come from some of the smaller local authorities, particularly since at thisstage we are only setting out general principles and emphasising that there Willbe some give-and-take before the final picture is settled. I11. We have a chance to start a very worthwhile reorganisation; the draft white Paper has been improved in the light of the Home Affairs Committee&apos;discussion; and in my view the balance of advantage lies in publishing before the summer Recess. I ask my colleagues to agree to this course.M. N.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,26th April, 1963.
DRAFT WHITE paper the MODERNISATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSCOTLANDI. introductory. The Government have been examining the present structure of localgovernment in Scotland in order to see how far it matches up to the needs ofthe expanding Scotland of to-day and tomorrow. There have been manychanges in the social and economic life of the country since the present system was introduced in 1929. There will be further changes as a result of the government&apos;s policy for strengthening and stimulating the Scottish economy.Local authorities have a vital part to play if this policy is to succeed.2. This Paper accordingly sets out the general background against whichproposals for reform must be considered and puts forward a number of suggestions. The Government will welcome constructive comments on them.It is intended that they should be the subject of full consultation with the localauthority associations, with local authorities, and with other interests concerned. Legislation would be required to give effect to any proposalswhich are ultimately decided on and this will not be in the lifetime of thepresent Parliament.M. The Present Structure3. The present system of local government in Scotland was established bythe Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, which had two principal aims.These were, first, to simplify local government by reducing the number ofdifferent kinds of authority; and, secondly, to replace authorities exercisingsingle functions by multi-purpose authorities covering a defined area andelected by the inhabitants of that area.4. The powers of the various types of authority are as follows: In thefour counties of cities the town council is responsible for administering all local government services in its area. In the large burghs (broadly speaking,burghs with a population of more than 20,000) the town council is responsiblefor most functions; the main exceptions are education, valuation for rating,and in some cases police, which are administered by the county council. Inthe small burghs the town council is responsible for a number of importantfunctions including housing, water, sewerage, lighting and cleansing; butanother large group of functions is performed within the burgh by the countycouncil the general principle being that the county council should undertakethose functions which require greater resources or are more efficientlydischarged over a wide area. In the landward area of the county the county
council is responsible for all the main work of local government. Thelandward area is also divided into districts. The district council carries out certain minor duties in its own right, mostly concerned with local amenities,and may also exercise powers which are delegated to it by the county council.5. There are 33 counties (two pairs of which Perth and Kinross, andMoray and Nairn are combined for certain purposes): 20 large burghs; 174small burghs; and 199 districts.6. Town councils in the cities and burghs are directly elected. Countycouncils are directly elected as regards the landward area, but the burghswithin the county nominate members to serve on the county council. Burghalrepresentatives on the county council can exercise a deliberative vote only on matters affecting functions which the county council exercises in the burgh.County councillors for the landward area are ex officio members of theappropriate district councils; members of the district council are otherwisedirectly elected.7. Town councils are rating authorities in the cities and the burghs. Thecounty councils are rating authorities only in the landward areas, andrequisition on the town councils to meet the cost of services which theydischarge in the burghs. District councils requisition on the county council for their expenditure, but the relative rate levied in each district is thatneeded to meet the requisition of the particular district council.III. The Present Review8. The present system is supported by long established habits ofadministration, and by local traditions and loyalties, and has stood up well to many of the tests which it has had to meet. It is, however, necessary toconsider whether the existing structure requires modification to take account of changes in the last thirty years, and of likely developments in the future.9. Since the passing of the 1929 Act there have been marked changes inthe location of population and in the role which local authorities are calledupon to play. While some services, e.g., national assistance, have now beentaken over by the central government, other functions of developingimportance, e.g., town and country planning, are entrusted to local authorities.There has been a steady development of the social services; ratepayers nowexpect to be provided with a more comprehensive range of services; and publicopinion increasingly requires higher and more uniform standards.10. One of the most significant trends in the role of local government since 1929 has been the increasing extent to which the economic developmentof their areas depends upon the activities of local authorities. For example,the rate of industrial development frequently depends on the ability of the localauthority to provide the basic services of housing, roads and water withefficiency and dispatch.11. It now seems clear that a new structure is required to deal with problems which have been and are being identified in studies of populationmovement, urban redevelopment, and the growth and decUne of particular
communities. Reorganisation should accordingly be designed to enable localgovernment to play the fullest possible part in future economic and socialdevelopments.12. Any modifications must be designed to ensure that each authority is initself an effective and convenient unit of local government. Each authority should administer a sufficient range of services to make membershipinteresting and attractive; it should have the resources to exercise its ownfunctions directly, to employ an adequately trained staff, and to provide a standard of services in keeping with national trends and acceptable to publicopinion. The system should foster the local consciousness of civic duty and responsibility without which no local authority can work satisfactorily; and itshould be possible for each authority to arrange its work so that it does not make unreasonable demands on the time of the elected members, thus allowingthem to concentrate on the making of policy and to leave its execution to an efficient and adequate staff.Existing Areas and Boundaries13. It is not surprising that after thirty years many boundaries are nowout of date. While area and size of population are not the only criteria in determining local authority boundaries it is also necessary to have regard tosuch matters as community of interest, and physical features, including naturalboundaries they can have an important bearing on the efficiency of theauthority. For example, when the area and the resources of the authority are too small in relation to the services which it has to administer, the authority may have difficulty in meeting the cost of an adequate complement of full-timequalified staff and may have to rely on part-time personnel. In some cases itmay be uneconomic to maintain buildings and equipment for use by a singlesmall authority. A larger authority can operate more economically in suchmatters as tendering, purchase, etc. A multiplicity of local boundaries the corollary to a large number of small authorities may also affect adversely therate at which a desirable development affecting more than one authority can be planned and executed.14. Many authorities appreciate that they are too small in themselves to administer certain services. As a result they have frequently to resort to theuse of joint committees whose existence is by itself a signpost to wider areas.Burghs from time to time find it necessary to apply for boundary extensions applications which are often resisted by the county councils which are unwilling to lose part of their rateable value. Certain centres of populationhave been dissatisfied with their status as part of the landward area, and have sought to acquire burghal status in order to achieve a separate identity. Thegrowth of population in the New Towns also presents special problems.15. In short, the evolution of local government in Scotland has now reached a stage where boundaries are becoming increasingly artificial and whereareas of many individual authorities are too small. The problem is to continuethe process of evolution and provide a structure which will allow localauthorities to cope at one level with truly local services, and on a wider planewith those services which need a broader basis for the most effectiveadministration. It is against this background that the challenge of providing the best structure for modern Scotland must be faced.
IV. Suggestions for Reform16. The Government appreciate that an acceptable, modern system canbe devised only in consultation with the local authorities. The purpose of this white Paper is therefore to set out the factors which appear to justify a reform of local government structure in Scotland, to indicate the general lines whichthe reform might take, and to invite the local authorities and their representative associations to co-operate in working out a practicable scheme.The suggestions in the following paragraphs which are open to full examination and discussion with all concerned are put forward on this basis.17. In order to build a modern structure on the foundations of the presentsystem, it would appear necessary both to regroup areas and to reallocatefunctions. The areas of existing authorities could be enlarged, by combinationas necessary, to enable them to administer their services more effectively.First, the counties could be regrouped so that their councils could exercisecertain major functions throughout a wider area. Secondly, within the enlargedcounties, new authorities could be created to be responsible for areas formed by combining existing burghs with neighbouring landward areas.18. The amalgamation of the burghs with the landward areas centred on them which would be a new feature of local government would recognisetheir common interest. It would also take account of improvements incommunications and changes in the habits of life of communities. In somecases the area surrounding a burgh can form a coherent unit with the burghitself; in others the new authority might comprise several (usually small)burghs with the contiguous landward area; and in relatively few instances alandward area might itself, for particular reasons, provide the basis of a newauthority.19. The result of the regrouping would be a simple two-tier system underwhich the new county councils would be responsible for major servicesthroughout the enlarged area of their jurisdiction. The new authorities formed by the combination of burghs and surrounding landward areas would beresponsible for essentially local services. The clear division of functions between the two kinds of authority should produce a more businesslikesystem. It should also make a more direct appeal to candidates for electionwho are particularly interested in the type of work to be discharged by eitherauthority. The fact that counties could in future concentrate on a restrictedrange of major services and the new authorities on functions applicable totheir immediate areas would also reduce the time which councillors have to spend in council or committee meetings. The effect of these various factorsshould, in sum, be to strengthen interest in local government and attractcandidates from a wider field.Counties20. These authorities, regrouped as suggested above, would in future beresponsible only for the major services which are not readily susceptible tolocal lines of demarcation. The need for joint committees (except to meet thespecial cases of water supplies and river purification) would largely disappear.The growth of joint committees (which frequently involve burghs as well asneighbouring counties) has in the past led to complications the combined
areas being different for different purposes. These difficulties could be removedunder the new system.21. The new county councils could with advantage be directly elected inorder to provide a more direct link between the authority and the electorate.The present system of burghal representation on the county council (and onjoint committees) is subject to the disadvantage that the burghal representativesmay tend to regard themselves primarily as delegates from their parentauthority rather than councillors for the county as a whole. The votingprocedure in the county council has also given rise to difficulties in practice.22. Where there were greater resources represented by a larger area of jurisdiction, the new county council would be better able to employ fullyexpert and highly qualified staff and to make use of the latest technicalequipment. Since it would no longer be necessary for the burghs to be directlyrepresented on the county council the size of the council could if necessary bereduced in order to make it a less unwieldy unit.Burgh and Rural Councils23. The regrouping could logically extend to provide for the reorganisedcounties to comprise a number of enclaves formed, as a rule, by the amalgamation of burghs and landward areas. A new authority would beresponsible for each enclave and could administer throughout its area a defined range of services where total control is the prime essential. It could in fact undertake services which are at present discharged by three differentauthorities, i.e., the town council, the county council (as regards the landwardarea) and the district council. A title would have to be found for the new authorities. They might appropriately be designated &quot; burgh councils &quot; or&quot; rural councils &quot; depending on the circumstances of each area. There would,however, be no distinction between the powers and functions of burgh councils and rural councils.24. It is suggested that the area of the new councils might appropriatelyhave a population of at least 40,000. But there is nothing sacrosanct in this figure. The population in certain urban and industrial areas, which have astrong local identity, would in many cases be appreciably larger, with theaccompanying advantage that the number of local authority boundaries inconurbations would be substantially reduced. Any new structure must be suffiently flexible to allow for the problems of remote areas where, becauseof sparsity and difficulties of communication, the council area might have anappreciably smaller population.General25. A reorganisation of the structure of local government would have tobe enacted by statute. Legislation will not, however, be introduced untildiscussion with all interest:ts affected has been brought to a conclusion. Thelegislation would prescribe the areas to be administered by each of the new authorities, and would empower the Secretary of State,to submit orders, for parliamentary approval, for the variation of boundaries to take account of changes in circumstances. The legislation would also transfer, theresponsibility for individual function to specified authorities.  This procedure
would ensure first, that all those concerned were thoroughly consulted whileplans were being prepared and, secondly, that these plans were fully debated in Parliament.26. Any scheme of reorganisation such as described above must try to preserve local traditions of administration in the wider sphere provided bythe amalgamations. If it were found that some local and historic functions and privileges had to go or be modified, these losses would have to be measured against the gains of a modern and more efficient local governmentstructure. The discussions with the local authority associations must include an examination of how local dignitaries, etc, could best be adapted to fit in with the new structure.Functions27. It is an essential feature of any reorganisation that functions shouldbe allocated in such a way that they can be discharged with the greatestefficiency and economy. If a scheme such as has been outlined above were tobe adopted it would be important to preserve a reasonable balance betweenthe two types of authority, having regard both to the national interest andto local requirements. The final pattern could be settled only after discussion.Meanwhile a tentative allocation on the following lines appears logical.28. The new enlarged counties could be responsible for the followingservices:EducationRoads (except unclassified roads)Major Town and Country Plan-ningWater Supply and SewerageRiver PurificationChild CareRemand HomesValuation29. The functions to be reservedcould include the following:Unclassified RoadsPublic Ways and FootpathsTown and Country Planning (day-to-day administration)HousingPublic RegulationsScavengingClean AirCoast ProtectionFlood PreventionSlaughterhousesCivil Defence (except as allocated to counties)PoliceFireCivil Defence Corps and other civil Defence mattersLocal Health and Welfare Ser-vicesFood and Milk AdministrationFood and Drugs RegulationsLibrariesto the new burgh and rural councilsRegistration of Births, Deaths andMarriagesBurial and CremationPublic ParksPhysical Training and RecreationEntertainmentsProvision of AllotmentsFactory RegulationsWeights and MeasuresTaxicab LicensingCinema Licensing
30. As regards Town and Country Planning, the county council couldbe responsible for determining the main framework of the development planparticularly as regards such functions as the communications patterns, thescheduling of land for industrial development, population growth and movement, etc. The burgh and rural councils could handle individualapplications for planning permission, subject to a power enabling theSecretary of State to define cases of development, either on a specified scaleor in specified areas, where applications would be dealt with by the county.A broad division on these lines appears practicable but the detailedimplications would require close examination.31. The county council could be responsible for the Civil Defence Corpsand major civil defence matters, while the remaining functions, e.g., billeting,emergency feeding and welfare could be allocated to the burgh and ruralcouncils.32. The responsibility for water supplies and river purification couldrest on the counties. In many cases, however, operating boundaries wouldbe determined by physical considerations and would need to be settledad hoc.Staff33. Any reorganisation is bound to result in the redeployment of, staff.To meet this problem a Staff Commission would be appointed to safeguard the interests of local government staff affected. The scope of theCommission^ work would be a matter for discussion with representatives ofthe local authority and staff associations.Cities34. The town councils of the four counties of cities are for all practical purposes autonomous local authorities and exercise all the powers which areconferred on local authorities by statute or which they have themselvessought by private legislation. Proposals for adjusting the boundaries of the cities would, however, be considered in the course of the reorganisationdiscussions.Rating35. Under a new two-tier system both types of authority would be directly elected and could exercise entirely separate functions. This suggeststhat both county, and burgh and rural councils, as regards their respectiveservices, should be rating authorities in their own right. As a matter of convenience, however, the burgh and rural councils should collect thecounty rates on an agency basis at the same time as they collected theirown rates. The rate demand should make clear the services and the authorityfor whom the rate payment is required.Courts of Law and Licensing Courts36. The effect of a reorganisation scheme on local courts of summary jurisdiction would be the subject of a separate review. Further consideration would have to be given to licensing courts in the light of recommendationsof the Committee on Scottish Licensing Law.
Conclusion37. It is the duty of the Government to present these problems and apossible basis for their solution. If Scotland is to build new foundationsfor permanent prosperity, these problems have to be faced with boldness andforesight and the right solutions have to be found.Scottish Office,25th April, 1963.
