ANNEXINTERIM REPORT ON FUTURE AGRICULTURAL policy note by the Chairman of the Economic Steering (General) CommitteeThe Committee have considered the Interim Report on Future agricultural policy which has been circulated to the Cabinet as C. (63) 65.2. All Departments are agreed that it is essential to contain home production at its present overall level and that the introduction of standard quantities for cereals and meat, and changes in the methods of paying the guaranteed prices for meat, would be useful measures to this end. They are devices within the agriculture Acts, which, once introduced, make the necessary changes lessdependent on positive decisions at the Annual Reviews. But the agricultural departments feel that these changes will be strongly resisted by farmers and thatsome equivalent measure to control imports is necessary; standard quantities canbe represented as limiting the Exchequer liability from excessive home production;but the further liability which arises from the effect of excessive imports uponprices can, they argue, only be limited by import control. The other Departments,who regard the containment of home production as the basic objective, do not accept this need for this linkage, and emphasise the potential damage to our balanceof payments and to our commercial relations from the measures of import controlproposed.3. It is expected that some at least of our overseas suppliers will ask in international negotiations for minimum price or other arrangements which would raise the prices they obtain in the British market. The Agricultural Departmentsthink that such arrangements would be to our advantage for the reason given above and that we should seek to negotiate them. They also consider that suchan attitude would be essential if we are to be sufficiently constructive in theagricultural negotiations that form part of the Kennedy Round and that therewould be negotiating advantages to be gained therefrom. The other Departmentsconsider that concessions in this field should be made only in return for substantial offsetting advantages, the value of which could only be discoveredduring negotiations. They feel that the risks of increasing the balance of paymentscost of our food imports are serious, both at the present time and for the future.4. Most Departments agree that changes both.in the percentages and the structure of the Agriculture Acts may be required in the longer term, and that nothing should be done by way of renewing existing pledges which would excludethis. Fundamental amendment of the Acts, however, raises big political issues and the Agricultural Departments consider that much can be done within theirframework.5. As regards horticulture, all are agreed that a new policy of rendering theindustry more competitive is required and that this can best be achieved by a combination of Exchequer assistance and a progressive reduction of tariffs. Thereis, however, difference of view as to how far immediate decisions should be takenabout the scope and speed of tariff reduction on one side and of the Exchequerassistance to be offered on the other.6. In the light of the above, the Committee make the following recommendations on the detailed points for decision which are put to ministers in paragraph XXX of the Foreword of the Report:A (i). The Committee suggest that Ministers should avoid renewingtheir pledge to retain the percentages in the 1957 Act. AH agree that theundertaking to leave farmers with some share of the industry&apos;s gain from increasing efficiency should be reconsidered, but the Agricultural departments are impressed by the political difficulty of withdrawing it.
A (ii). The Committee suggest that, if it were politically feasible, itwould be desirable that nothing should be done to rule out, as a longer term objective, more radical changes which might involve substantial alterations of the structure of the Agriculture Acts.A (iii). The Committee regard this as a separate issue with serious economic implications which ought to be considered in the light of taxation and income policy generally. The Agricultural Departments see advantages in the introduction of a levy/subsidy for wheat.A (iv).: The Committee agree that encouragement; should be given to along-term policy of amalgamation of holdings. They also recommend thatthe possibilities of giving separate treatment to the small farmer should befurther studied. ,B(v). The Committee recommend the introduction of a standard quantity arrangement for cereals, with a flexible guarantee.B (vi). Most Departments recommend that such an arrangement shouldbe introduced in any case, but the Agricultural Departments recommend it only in association with a minimum import price scheme.B(vii). Most Departments feel that, if the need to accept a minimum import price scheme should emerge in international negotiations, we should accept the extension of the present International Wheat Agreement minimumto coarse grains, but should go as little beyond that as possible. TheAgricultural Departments recommend that the introduction of an effectiveminimum price scheme for both wheat and coarse grains at a rather higher level should, as a necessary part of such arrangements, be made an objectof policy from the first.C (viii) and C (ix). The Committee agree in recommending that theAgricultural Departments should press ahead with the revision of theguarantee arrangements for fatstock and should work out arrangements which would include standard quantities for cattle and sheep. MostDepartments recommend that this should be done in any case, but theAgricultural Departments recommend that restriction by standard quantitiesshould be conditional on effective regulation of imports.C(x) and C(xi). Most Departments are strongly opposed to a policyof quantitative import restrictions by country quotas for meat. They agree in recommending that we should continue to impress on our overseas suppliersthe desirability of more orderly marketing of their supplies in the british market, but they think we should not seek to explore possibilities of marketsharing agreements, which would probably require formal or informal countryquotas to implement. The Agricultural Departments, however, maintain thatorderly marketing cannot be achieved without regulation of the quantity tobe imported from each country, and recommend that we should take theinitiative in suggesting such arrangements.D (xii). All Departments agree in recommending that a policy for horticulture involving the progressive reduction of tariffs, with some schemesfor temporary Exchequer assistance, should be adopted as desirable in itself and as necessary for our negotiating position in the Kennedy Round. once a Ministerial decision to this effect had been announced, there would be pressure from the industry to be told the scope and speed of the withdrawalof tariff protection envisaged and the timing, scope and duration of themeasures of assistance. We should probably have to declare our position onhorticulture at the GATT meeting on 16th May, and well before then ministers would have to decide what they would be prepared to say there and to theindustry. If, therefore, Ministers accept the principle, officials will work outfurther detailed proposals. There are certain Commonwealth and Colonialinterests involved in a reduction of preferential tariffs which will also require futher study.(Signed)     W.
