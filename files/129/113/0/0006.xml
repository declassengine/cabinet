CABINETSATELLITE COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal aAs requested by the Cabinet on 21st February, 1963 (C,C. (63) 12th Conclusions,Minute 4), I have arranged for further consideration to be given to the desirabilityof convening a conference of European and Commonwealth countries in order -toconsider the development of international satellite communication systems inconjunction with the United States or independently.2. Since the Cabinefs last discussion an ad hoc meeting of a group ofEuropean communication experts, drawn from the Postal and Telegraph authoritiesin the countries concerned, has been held in Paris to discuss this subject, theUnited Kingdom being represented by the Post Office. The experts accepted thatthe United States are further advanced in communication satellite technology than any other country and will probably be able to establish a commercial satellite communications system by 1965-66. Since European countries have not yetdeveloped a communications satellite and will not have a European launcher for at least four or five years, they cannot themselves establish a commercial satellite communications system or sub-system until 1968-69. The experts did not feel,however, that these facts required the European countries to leave the initiativeentirely to the United States; and they compiled a list of questions directed to ascertaining the terms on which Europe would hope to participate with the UnitedStates in a genuinely joint system of satellite communications. They also agreedthat European countries should seek to make a real contribution in kind to the later phase of the development of satellite communications both in terms of design and perhaps by way of providing a sub-system contributing to the developmentof a single global satellite system. The next meeting of this ad hoc group is planned for early June, probably in London.3. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Aviation have begun work on the satellitedesign study which the Cabinet authorised. They hope that this study may be complete by the autumn; and they expect to be able to make an interim report on it by July. In addition, the Ministry of Defence are about to begin discussions with the United States military authorities on the defence implications of satellite communications systems, including the possibility that we might share with theUnited States a purely defence system of this kind.4. Against this background it is arguable that, at least until the report on ourdesign study is available, we should not formally abandon the concept of a systemindependent of the United States, if only because this might weaken our bargaining position. Indeed, my colleagues may feel that, while we should make it clearthat we plan to develop our own communications satellites in the hope andexpectation that it will be possible for both these satellites and the EuropeanLauncher Development Organisation launcher to be used in the construction, by stages, of a single internationally-owned, world-wide system, we should also makeit clear that if, after the multilateral negotiations which will be necessary, we arenot satisfied that this objective can be achieved, then we shall seek the widest possible support for a separate system, independent of an American one.Printed for the Cabinet.

5. On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly clear that, so far as it ispossible to foresee at this stage the main implications of so novel an enterprise,our own interests are likely to be best served by participating in a single world-widesystem rather than by trying to develop and produce a separate system independent of the United States; and that, for this purpose, we should join with interestedEuropean countries in seeking to participate with the United States in the control-and ownership of a system which would be initially provided by them.J 6. If so, it remains to consider how we should concert v/ith the european countries the common attitude to be adopted towards the approach from theUnited States which we must expect before the end of the year. The conferenceof experts, all of whom were authorised representatives of their respective governments, were anxious that joint consultation should continue to go forwardthrough Postal and Telegraph channels; and they showed no great enthusiasm fora conference at governmental level. But the issues involved are more than merelytechnical and financial; and I believe, therefore, that our wisest course would beto suggest to the European Governments that, following the further technical discussions to be held in June, there might be advantage in arranging an Inter-Governmental Conference in July, at which the wider implications of a satellite communications system could be discussed. If we indicated, more or lessimmediately, that this was our intention, it should suffice to prevent the initiativefrom being taken by any other European Government, while deferring theconference itself until we had received at least the interim report on the designstudy for our own satellite and had a rather clearer idea of the scope and natureof the contribution which we ourselves might make to an eventual joint system.7. The Commonwealth countries would be kept fully informed of our actionin this field; but, with the possible exception of Australia, there would be no need to invite them to attend the conference.E. H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,25th March, 1963.
