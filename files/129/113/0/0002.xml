Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1963C (63) 52 Copy No.   5 218th March, 1963CABINETLONDON TALKS ON CENTRAL africa memorandum by the First Secretary of StateMy colleagues will be aware that I have arranged for representatives of theFederal Government, and of the Governments of Northern and Southern Rhodesia,to meet me in London for preparatory talks. I shall be starting with the SouthernRhodesians on the 21st, and my talks with the Northern Rhodesia and the federal governments will begin on 25th March and 27th March respectively.2. The Federal Government will be represented by Sir Roy Welensky andthe Federal Ministers for Home Affairs and for Finance, Mr. Greenfield andMr. Caldicott. Mr. Winston Field and his Minister of Justice, Mr. Dupont, will represent Southern Rhodesia. The Northern Rhodesia team will consist of theGovernor, Mr. Kaunda and Mr. Nkumbula (the leaders of the two parties in the coalition Government), and six other elected Ministers.3. The object of these talks is to find an agreed basis on which a formalconference on the future association of the Territories might later be held. Sucha conference is desirable in order that if the Federation is to come to an end,this should clearly be seen to have occurred through pressure from Northern and southern Rhodesia, and not simply through a unilateral act of policy on the partof Her Majesty&apos;s Government.4. The main difficulty will be to find a basis for a conference which will be acceptable both to the Federal Government and elected Ministers in northern rhodesia. I shall have to try and induce both of them to modify the rigidity oftheir present attitudes, basing myself on the position that we want a conferenceat which all will be free to express their views without pre-conditions beingattached which would be unacceptable to the other parties.5. This is not going to be at all easy, and if we fail to achieve the objectivestated in paragraph 3 above we may be faced with a difficult situation, whichperhaps I might explain to my colleagues orally.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W.1,18th March, 1963.
