H DOCUMENT 13 THS PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.J63X9JL COPY NO. JlJLCABINETTRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT 1,921Memorandum by the Seeretary of State for the Home Departmentaj^jhejj^crej^As was expected, during the debates in both Houses on the Reportof the E.adcliffe Tribunal criticisms were made of the procedure underthe Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.     The Leader of theOpposition said there was a good deal of disquiet about the working ofthe Tribunal machinery, and suggested that the Government should consider appointing a Select Committee to consider the whole workingof the Act, including questions such as costs, press secrecy, and the disclosure of sources,    A similar suggestion wa3 made by Lord Silkinin the House of Lords,;it::&apos;:.&apos;2.      Apart from the matter of the disclosure of sources, the criticisms were of a kind that have been made before.    There weresimilar requests for an inquiry into the procedure under the Act afterthe Waters Inquiry in 1959.    Some preliminary examination of theworking of the Act was then undertaken in the light of the criticisms,but when Parliamentary and public interest waned the matter was notpursued.3.       The main criticisms that have been made are as follows:-(i)  That the inquisitorial nature of the procedure necessarilyadopted by most Tribunals established under the Act is unfair - an individual has no benefit of the presumption of innocence, is protected by no rules of evidence, and may be forced to answer charges (and tosubmit to cross-examination on them) without precise notice of the allegations made against him.In the debates ia both Houses there was fairly general recognition that these defects were inherent in the Tribunal procedure, but thatit was nevertheless necessary to retain the procedure j and thatTribunals should be set up only when absolutely necessary, and should then be given terms of reference as precise as possible.(ii)  That wholly innocent and respectable people may become involved.This is probably the most unsatisfactory feature of the Tribunalprocedure.    Allegations are made and suspicions are aroused and given wide publicity during the proceedings, and may not be properlydisposed of until the Tribunal reports.    This difficulty might be over-come if, even though the proceedings were held in public, a ban were-1-CONFIDENTIAL
to be placed on press reports of them until after the report of theTribunal had been published.    But we doubt whether there would bemuch public or Parliamentary support for such a restriction;   in thecircumstances in which Tribunals are set up the paramount need is for public inquiry, and to avoid the impression of secrecy where secrecyis not essential.(iii) That innocent people may become involved in heavy expenditurein being legally represented before the Tribunal.The Act makes no provision for the payment of expenses, but inthe case of the 1959 Tribunal an ex gratia payment was made to theWaters1 family to meet their costs, and in the recent case arrangements have been made for ex^ratia contributions towards costs to be paid onthe advice of the Tribunal.    &quot;When a suitable opportunity occurs theAct might be amended to provide for the payment of costs, but thematter does not seem urgent-.(iv) That the actual procedure before the Tribunal, including suchmatters as the leading of evidence by counsel, the cross-examinationof witnesses and the part played by the Attorney-General is open to criticism.After the earlier Tribunals there were many criticisms of thiskind.    The procedure adopted by the Radcliffe Tribunal went far tomeet them, and itself attracted little criticism.    Tribunals have todeal with different types of case.    It is appropriate that the attorney-General should appear as counsel for the Tribunal in themost important cases, and it would be unwise to attempt to lay downrules of procedure applicable to all cases.It may be noted that in the Scottish case in 1959 the lord advocate played no part in the proceedings and the Tribunal appointedtheir own counsel and solicitor.    There were special reasons for this,and normally a Scottish law officer would probably play the same partas the Attorney-General does in England and Wales; but it demonstrated that the procedure is flexible.(v) That the Tribunal ought not to have power to refer direct tothe High Court cases of alleged refusal to answer questions.The Leader of the Opposition said that if a Tribunal wasfrustrated in its work by a refusal to disclose sources it should report back to Parliament, who would decide on the action to be taken.    but sir Frank Soskice, when winding up for the Opposition, expresseddisagreement;  and most speakers recognised that the powers conferred by the 1921 Act must be retained and must be enforceable (this is, indeed,the essence of the Tribunal procedure), and that there should be noexemption from their operations for journalists.The Attorney-General, in reply to a Question on 4th April,said that by the provisions of the 1921 Act a person appearing beforethe Tribunal is under the same duty to answer/er lawful questions as ifhe were a witness in the ordinary courts; he did not intend to seekeither to alter the general rules of evidence, or to provide special-2-
exception under the Act, in relation to the duty to tell the wholetruth about sources of information on those occasions when this is relevant and necessary (Cfficial Report, Cols. 60-61).4.     In discussions which we had with our colleagues principally concerned, before the recent debates, we reached the conclusionsthat although an inquiry into procedure under the 1921 Act might help to allay criticism, it rnight imply that there were grounds for complaintagainst the procedure adopted by the Radcliffe Tribunal?-  and thatthe balance of advantage was against volunteering such an inquiry.    Noarguments were adduced during the course of the debates whichconvince us that an Inquiry is either necessary or would serve any useful purpose.    We invite our colleagues to agree that no suchinquiry should be instituted.5,     The Home Secretary has already, since the debates, had to answer a Question about our proposals in this matter.    Other questions will no doubt be asked.    We propose, if our colleagues agree, to say we reply that after considering all that was said in the debates theGovernment have reached the conclusion that, in view of the generalrecognition that the Tribunal machinery must be retained for use inappropriate cases, and since the procedure adopted by the RadcliffeTribunal went far to meet the criticisms made after earlier Tribunals,no inquiry is necessary.H.E.M.N.27th May, 1963-3-
