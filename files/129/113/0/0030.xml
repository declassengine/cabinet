Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1963C. (63) 80 Copy No.   5 210th May, 1963CABINETWHITE PAPER ON HOUSING policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh AffairsAnnexed is the draft of a joint White Paper on Housing in Great Britain.It sets out the broad lines on which a comprehensive housing policy should be developed over the next few years.2. The basic proposals contained in the White Paper have already beenapproved as general objectives of housing policy (C.C. (62) 59th Conclusions,Minute 2). They fall under three main heads future housing programme;development of a housing society movement to undertake building to let and forco-ownership; and improvement of existing houses. Detailed proposals in respectof the second and third subjects have been discussed with our colleagues in theHome Affairs Committee, and certain modifications have been made to take accountof their views.3.  In the following paragraphs we set out the major issues for decision.Future Housing programme. New building is the key to progress on the housing front. At a building rateof 300,000 houses a year, we are not making progress: we are barely keeping pace.Overtaken as we are by rising population, houses are wearing out quicker than weare replacing them.5. What we really need to overcome the shortages, to get rid of the slums,to keep up with growth and movement, and to maintain a steady rate of replacementwould be a building rate of something like 450,000 houses a year; and for this tobe maintained for some years. If one assumes an 80-year life for a house, 16 millionhouses should be replaced at the rate of 200,000 a year. We need 350,000 thereforemerely to keep up with growth, movement and replacement. Meanwhile we still have a shortage of the order of \ to 1 million houses to overcome; and over \ million of the existing houses are classed as unfit for human habitation.6. We realise that 450,000 houses a year is out of reach. Our aim is to get upto 350,000 houses a year just as soon as we can, without overstraining resources.The Cabinet have already agreed (C.C. (62) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2) that weshould reach 325,000 by 1964-65-&quot;-so as to allow for the increasing pace of slum clearance, and assuming that building for owner occupation keeps up as at present.We must have elbow room if building for owner occupation is to grow, and we areto provide for a modest though rising programme of building by housing societies(below).7. The Minister of Public Building and Works agrees that 350,000 houses should be within the capacity of the industry over the next few years. To achieve this over a period of three to four years would call for a growth in productivityat a rate of 4-5 per cent per annum. This would be roughly equivalent to the rateof growth actually achieved by the industry up to mid-1961, and which it is expectedto achieve again over the next few years. Within a year or so, greater output shouldbe helped by a wider use of industrialised building methods.
8. We recognise that to announce any specific figure could involve certain risks.It might expose us to criticism of failure if the target were not achieved withina reasonable period. On the other hand, in view of the plain need for many morehouses to be built, any announcement which failed to give a firm indication that theGovernment intended to go for a bigger programme would be a lost opportunity;it would bring us no credit and be likely to be used against us.w &quot; 9. We believe that the right course is to come out boldly for an eventual target of at least 350,000 houses a year, and we hope that our colleagues will agree.Building to Let and for Co-ownership10. Our broad proposals under this head are set out in paragraphs 34 to 42of the White Paper. We have secured the agreement of the Building SocietiesAssociation to the support of a housing society movement which will build to letand for co-ownership. Building societies will be prepared to put up two-thirds ofthe cost of such building over a 40-year loan period if the Government will raisethe remaining third.11. We propose, with the agreement of the Chancellor, to establish a housing corporation with the specific function of developing housing societies, andempowered to borrow from the Government at a current rate of interest for thepurpose of lending the balance required to approved housing societies. We envisagea programme starting with perhaps 5,000 houses in 1965 and rising to 15,000 over -4 years.12.  Two main points arise:(1) Doubt has been expressed whether it is consistent with our principles toset up a body of this kind for this purpose. If there is a need for the provisionof rented housing, ought we not to look to private enterprise to satisfy it throughthe operation of the market?The answer to this is that there is little or no prospect of any generalresumption of private building to let in the foreseeable future. The main reasonfor this is the Opposition^ declared intention to reimpose rent control. Thishas done much to undermine confidence, and to stifle investment in residential accommodation apart from expensive flats. Given this situation, either we haveto accept it, thus letting our policy be dictated by the Opposition, or find some means of remedying it.  And that is what our proposals do.There is a further important issue at stake. Ownership of rented housesrequires responsible management. Not all landlords, especially the smaller ones,have the capacity to supply this; and some simply exploit the poor. In this sense the Opposition have some case for their belief in public ownership ofrented houses. We believe that the ever-increasing municipalisation is a bad thing;but we must provide our alternative. The development of a strong housing societymovement is a good alternative, and has been proved so in other countries (whereit is often helped by Government loans at favourable rates of interest). In ourview the development of housing societies, unsubsidised but Governmentsupported, should be a plank of Conservative policy.(2) Paragraph 41 indicates that the Housing Corporation, in addition to being empowered to acquire land by agreement, may also need to be given areserve power to buy land compulsorily, subject to adequate safeguards. Theidea is to use this power only where a local authority might properly have helpeda housing society by compulsory acquisition, but will not. Land will be a problem for the housing societies, and it seems reasonable that the Corporation shouldbe able to help if a society is being held to ransom.Improvement of Existing Houses13. The major point here is our proposal that there should be a measure of compulsion to force house improvements up to a defined standard in appropriate cases, subject to appeal. This is a new principle; but we believe that it is justifiedand there is considerable support for this view among our colleagues. We already have such vast numbers of old and outworn houses that must in any event beknocked down and replaced, that we simply cannot afford to let old housesdeteriorate which, if improved, would make adequate homes capable of lastingfor many years. If we cannot get the older houses improved, where they are worth it, there will be no end to the demand for new houses.
14. Our original proposal contemplated that the initiative to oblige owners to improve would come only from the local authorities who would declareimprovement areas for this purpose. Some of our colleagues felt that tenantsshould also be able to take the initiative. We have therefore widened our proposals to enable immediate improvement to be insisted on, in any rented house, whether in an improvement area or not, where the sitting tenant wants it.15. The question has also been raised whether the obligation to improveon change of occupancy should extend to owner-occupiers as well as to landlords.We think that it should. It is true that owner-occupiers can in general be relied upon to improve their houses in their own interests, and that the main need isto get many more rented houses improved. Nevertheless, it is difficult to limit the obligation to improve to the house that happens to be rented. The case forinsisting on improvement, and for giving Government grant, rests on the argument that every house ought to have, if it can, hot water, a bath, a lavatory, etc. this applies however the house is occupied; and, provided that we do not force theoccupant, is it objectionable to take the opportunity of a change of occupancyto get the improvement done, even in an owner occupied house? The obligationto improve an owner occupied house will apply only in an improvement area whichis being tackled as a whole. The sanction will not be that the local authority would take the house over, except as in paragraph 16 below, but that the localauthority would carry out the improvement, recovering the cost from the owner.16. Attention is particularly drawn to paragraphs 60 to 64 of the white paper, on tenement blocks. It will be noted that acquisition and improvementby the local authority is suggested in some cases. There are objections to thison grounds of municipalisation, but in Scotland especially the problem of improving tenements is fundamental; and acquisition by the authority, if necessary by compulsion, is the only practicable course.Cost of Housing: Rents and Subsidies17. These matters are discussed in paragraphs 74 to 81. Politically this isthe most difficult part of the White Paper for it carries the implication that rents,both private and municipal, must rise. Indeed, a sentence has been inserted In brackets, for consideration, explaining that in due course the rents of controlledhouses must rise though no further block decontrol is envisaged.18. The Opposition will of course make great play with this. On theother hand, we can hardly say nothing at all. What housing costs, and who paysfor it, are fundamental issues which have to be faced if housing in this countryis ever to be got on to a sensible and healthy footing. To ignore them in a statementof future policies would not only undermine the sense of those policies, but wouldplainly be seen as an omission. We shall be asked what we intend when we cometo the Election, if not before. Many of our own people will in any case be looking fora willingness to grapple with the finance of council housing, and will be stronglycritical if we are silent. But we cannot imply that municipal rents will rise and say nothing about the rents, in many cases as low or lower, of the private housesremaining in control. We have got to face this; it is critical to the success of thehousing society movement among other things. It seems to us best to face it when we are presenting a forward housing policy.Conclusion19. We invite our colleagues to approve generally the proposals outlined inthe draft White Paper and to authorise publication at an early date.M. N.K. J.9th May, 1963.
DRAFT WHITE PAPERHOUSINGThe housing position. Over 4  million new houses have been provided in Great Britain sincethe end of the war, over 3 million of them in the past 10 years.2. Since the slum clearance campaign was resumed at the beginning of1956, more than 480,000 unfit houses have been cleared and the families living in them re-housed.3. In 1951 there were 750,000 less houses than householders, and severeshortages almost everywhere. Since then the population has risen by   million resulting in the formation of an additional 1 million households.Yet the high level of building maintained over the last 10 years has made good the overall deficiency of houses, kept pace with the new households and replaced   million houses which have had to be cleared because they wereslums or because they were in the way of needed re-development. The 1961census showed houses and households just about in balance overall thoughunevenly distributed.4. In addition to the new building, 670,000 houses have been improvedwith the aid of grant and many more without grant.5. Thus, over the past decade the housing position has greatly improved.But there are still not enough houses, especially in and around the maincentres of employment, where severe shortages persist. Meanwhile thepopulation is increasing and with it the demand. There are still slums heavilyconcentrated in the north of England and on Clydeside; and many of the older residential areas are run down and in need of renewal. A still biggereffort is required.6. Shortage. The census figures actually show that there are now, takingthe whole of Great Britain, slightly more houses than households, butallowance has to be made for voids and for mal-distribution including thenew demands made by new employment growth. It is not possible to calculatethe local shortages with any accuracy at present, though the full census figures,will help when they are available. Nor can the census in any case provide acomplete picture; the figures can never be quite up to date.7. Information about housing conditions is not as complete as it nowneeds to be, and the Government intend to improve it. It has always been regarded as the responsibility of local authorities to keep themselves informed about local housing conditions, the Government relying on the 10-yearlycensus for the national picture. Since the war the need for additional houseshas been so universal that there has not been cause to analyse the make-up of demand or the quality of housing, apart from the slum surveys. Localauthorities keep housing lists but these are based on widely differing criteria.The Government now intend to collect more comprehensive information byregular and systematic sample surveys, and arrangements are being made tothis end.
8. Meanwhile, the best estimate that can be made of the total shortageof houses (including in this the need to allow for voids) is that it is somewherebetween \ million and a million, the worst areas being Greater London, the birmingham conurbation and central Clydeside.: 9. Population growth. During the last 10 years, the population has gone up by 2,796,000, and the number of households by 1,722,000. Over the next20 years both are expected to increase still more sharply: the population byabout 8 million, and the number of separate households by at least 2\ million.10. So over the next 20 years 125,000 new houses a year will be needed to keep up with the growth of households.11. Slums. According to the estimates of local authorities made in and since 1956, there are still 600,000 slums 1o be cleared. The aim is to clearthese within the next 10 years in all but the largest concentrations; and evenhere to break the back of the job within the 10 years.12. Other old houses. -2-8 million houses in Great Britain were builtbefore 1862; 4-8 million between 1862 and 1919. This is not far short of half the total housing stock. An old house is not necessarily a bad house.Many old houses which have been well looked after and modernised providegood homes, and will continue to do so for a long time. Many others,probably between 2 and 3 million, which at present lack hot water, abathroom, a lavatory, an adequate kitchen and food store, and are often in poor repair, could be made into good homes if improved and as necessaryrepaired. Some of the bigger houses could, by conversion, provide morethan one home. The aim is to secure the improvement of a large proportionof the older houses worth improvement within the next 10 years.13. But there are large numbers of the oldest houses, over and above those identified as slums, which can never be made into good homes bypresent-day standards. Some are too worn out to be worth improvement, oiare too small and cramped. Most are badly laid out, crowded, airless, indrab and depressing streets. They cannot be described as technically &quot; unfit&quot;,though some of them could soon become so. But they ought to be replacedand the opportunity taken to build a new environment as well as new houses.14. No estimate can be made of the rate at which replacement will be practicable. Priority must be given to overcoming the remaining shortages,Clearing the slums, meeting the needs of the growing population and ofworkers moving to new jobs. But the Government want to see a major drivelaunched for the re-development of the blighted residential areas just as soonas each town has cleared the worst of its slum clearance and overtaken itspresent housing shortage.The target for building15. What this brief summary of the housing position means is that,despite all that has been done during the past 10 years much of which isbring inevitably absorbed by the rapidly rising population-the need for additional houses and for better houses is still formidable. The Governmentwill set themselves during the next 10 years to cure the remaining shortages,\.tp. clear nearly all of the remaining slums, to provide for growth and for 
workers moving to new jobs, to improve large numbers of the houses worthimprovement, and to make a start on the renewal of the blighted areas.16. The pace at which all this can be done depends on land; on the ability of local authorities to tackle their part; on money; and on the capacity of thebuilding industry. The first three (discussed later in the Paper) can be madeto match the fourth. It is the capacity of the building industry which mustgovern the target to be set.17. The industry already faces huge tasks outside housing. There arerising programmes for. schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, power stations and other sections of public investment. Private investment imposesits own large though more fluctuating demands in addition. Yet it is clearthat the housing programme too must rise.18. In 1960 and 1961 new building, private and public, was running at about 300,000 completions a year. Last year 305,000 were completed and324,000 started. This year the figure for completions should be higher though the exceptionally severe weather of the first two months has giventhe year a bad start.   Next year it should be higher still.19. What matters is not the level of achievement of a:single year, butthe level of production that can be reached and maintained. It is only bythe high average performance over the last 10 years just about 300,000 ayear that so much has been done. Now we must seek to move to a newlevel of output. The Governmenfs aim is to reach the figure of 350,000houses a year and to sustain at least that. A continuing programme of that order would not be excessive to keep up with growth and to provide fora steady rate of replacement: indeed, judged only by the needs an evenbigger programme would be warranted until the existing deficiencies havebeen made good. But it is not realistic to envisage a higher rate than350,000 at present. It is no use loading the industry with more than it candigest. The National Economic Development Council have estimated that given an average annual rate of growth in gross domestic product over  years of 4 per cent the output of houses could increase from 300,000 to350,000. The Government think that that should be the target for the timebeing.20. When a 350,000 programme will be possible depends on growth ofthe economy and increased productivity in the building industry. Otherbuilding programmes are also to increase, and this target can be achievedfor housing only if there is both growth and greater productivity.21. The Government cannot pledge themselves to reach the 350,000target by any given year. But it is their intention that the new level shouldbe attained just as soon as that is possible without over-straining the buildingindustry, having regard to the other demands made on it.Increasing output22. Much depends on the industry. But the Government can andwill help in a number of ways.23. They are encouraging local authorities with heavy housing programmes to plan them at least 5 years ahead, and to work together in
groups where that will enable them to let big forward contracts. Formalconsortia of housing authorities have been set up in Yorkshire (3 authorities)and the Midlands (9 authorities). In many parts of the country including north-east England, Glasgow and the London area, informal consultationsare in progress between authorities which, without formal organisation, canresult in the common use of plan types and building systems.24. A number of building contractors and specialist pre-cast concretemanufacturers can now offer systems for multi-storey flats, which give bothquicker construction times and savings in total man-hours as compared withtraditional building. Costs in most cases are competitive, subject to large-scale orders.25. Increasing use is being made of high flats; but the bulk of housingwill continue to be in 2, 3 and 4 storeys. In this field the technical problemsof system building, involving as it does a large measure of standardisation,are more complicated, because of the greater variety in size and internal roomarrangements of the separate units. So far it has proved difficult in house-building to produce satisfactory buildings systems which, while offering theadvantages of factory production and quick erection on site, are flexible in design and lay-out and competitive in cost with traditional methods. Anumber of firms, in collaboration with local authorities and new towncorporations, are experimenting with systems for house construction, intimber and steel and in various forms of concrete. The public authorities will be encouraged to use systems which promise good results, which arecompetitive in cost, and which can usefully supplement existing local labourand contracting resources.   Private enterprise will be able to follow suit.26. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government have developed a system of light steel and timber construction, with a variety of claddingmaterials, which is suitable for ordinary house-building. It is called 5Mbecause it is based on a planning grid of I ft. 8 ins. five times the basicmodule of 4 ins. Four experimental houses have been built, in collaboration with the Sheffield Corporation, and it is expected that several hundred ofthese houses will be started by authorities in Yorkshire and elsewhere later this year. A further 370 are also to be built to provide married quarters forsoldiers at Catterick. Larger orders should be placed in 1964 in various parts of the country..27. To secure the full development of industrialised techniques, theremust be co-ordination in selecting the size of building components used in new building systems, and some interchangeability in their use. The variousMinistries concerned with building operations in their different fields havenow agreed on a common approach to dimensional co-ordination, and thishas been set out in a statement (D.C.1) issued by the Ministry of public building and Works in February this year. It will be followed up, inrelation to housing, by a detailed bulletin to be issued shortly.28. In encouraging the development of system-building, both for houses and flats, the Government is concerned not to repeat the uniformity of someof the early post-war prefabricated houses. Industrialised building techniquesshould aim, not at producing a standard house or flat, but at a system whichcan be used to build a variety of dwelling types capable of being groupedtogether on flat or sloping sites, with some degree of architectural unity,, andwith a range of acceptable external cladding materials.4
Land29. A bigger housing programme depends also on getting more landmade available both for private and for public housing. This is in the firstplace the responsibility of local planning authorities; and they have beenasked to ensure that more land is forthcoming.30. The crux of the land problem lies in the great city regions. InEngland and Wales these are London, West Midlands, Merseyside andSouth-east Lancashire; in Scotland, central Clydeside including Glasgow.The Government have already assessed the land needs in these regions, both for public and private housing, until the early seventies, and have announcedmeasures which should provide sufficient land for substantially increasedbuilding programmes over the next 10 years. For Birmingham, liverpool and Manchester, the Minister of Housing and Local Governmenfs statement in the House of Commons on 19th February included proposals for new towns; for better progress with selected town expansions; for intensifiedre-development of cleared areas inside the cities; and for provision of some extra land, if necessary, on their outskirts. For Glasgow, the Scottish new towns and other overspill schemes will continue to play their part; withinthe period the Livingston new town will make a substantial contribution.For London, the measures in hand were explained in the White Paper on london (Cmd. 1952).31. For the longer term up to about 1980-regional studies are beingmade by the two Planning Departments. That for the south-east region iswell advanced and provisional conclusions should be published later thisyear as a basis for consultation with the local planning authorities. those for the midlands and north-west will follow. These together with the study of the north-east under the Lord President of the Council, and that of central Scotland being carried out under the direction of the Secretary ofState will result in regional plans, taking into account employmentprospects, transport needs and other relevant requirements, and makingspecific proposals for the localities where large-scale development, public and private, will be encouraged.Owner occupation32. Building for owner occupation climbed from 22,000 in 1951 to175,500 in 1961. Although 1962 saw a small drop to 173,000, the totalof lending for owner occupation, including the acquisition of existing houses,was higher in that year than ever before. Within a rising programme of house-building the Government aim at maintaining the growth of building for owner occupation.33. The Government have had discussions with representatives of theBuilding Societies Association about the possible need for giving morehelp to people in a sound financial position for example young people with good prospects who are anxious to buy a house but find it difficultto put down a deposit of more than 5 per cent of valuation and to makerepayments on a 20-year basis. Until recently building societies have haddifficulty in meeting all demands for mortgages for house purchase. funds available to them for lending are now more plentiful, and most societiesto-day are prepared to make advances of up to 95 per cent of valuation;
repayable over 25 years. Some will lend for 30 years, particularly toyounger people. The representatives of the Association have agreed torecommend to their members that they should make every effort to putowner occupation within the reach of everybody who wants to own a house and who is in a position to shoulder the cost if reasonably spread. Theyhave also agreed to encourage member societies to support the improve-ment of older houses by lending to owners their share of the cost ofimprovement works carried out with the aid of grant.New housing to let and for co-ownership34. Post-war building has almost all been either for owner occupationor for letting by public authorities. Hardly any provision has been madefor those the younger salaried people and the higher wage-earners who may not be able to buy a house on the ordinary mortgage terms, or who mayprefer to rent, though neither wanting nor needing a council house. Lackof modern houses to rent has also made it harder for workers to move fromone part of the country to another.35. Even allowing for easier mortgage terms, there will still be many people who want to rent a modern house and who are able to pay what it costs, but who are not attracted by ownership. Since the war there hasbeen almost no building to let other than by public authorities. Fear of rent control, and of the problems associated with management, maintenance and repair, has discouraged private investment. The result is a gap in housingprovision; and this the Government intend to see filled.36. Housing societies. They believe that for this purpose the rightthing is to encourage the development of trust ownership, under whichhouses can be provided at cost and properly managed. The possibilitieshave already been demonstrated. In the Housing Act, 1961, and in theHousing (Scotland) Act, 1962, the Government provided funds of  25 million and  3 million respectively to be used for advances to be made to housingsocieties which would provide houses to let; and at the same time reinforcedthe National Federation of Housing Societies so that they could advise and help societies taking advantage of the scheme. Good progress has beenmade. By the end of April projects involving a total commitment of 5 million had been approved, and proposals entailing a further  3 million were under consideration. Other projects are known to be in preparation.Houses built with money advanced under the scheme can be let at rentsbetween  4 and  7 a week, exclusive of rates. These rents are cost-rents:that is, there is neither profit nor subsidy. It is already clear that thereis a demand for houses at such rents, and the Government have decidedto encourage an expansion of the housing society movement.37. The building societies can play a major part in this new development.A few societies have indeed already shown willingness to lend money to housing societies building to let, and the Government now want to enlist the support of the whole building society movement. Discussions havetakeriJplace with representatives of the Association, and they have agreedto recommend that societies should co-operate in the following scheme.38. The Government propose to establish a Housing Corporation withthe function of stimulating the development of housing societies which will6
provide and manage rented houses, or houses on a co-ownership basis.The aim will be to secure the formation of strongly organised societiesoperating (with paid staff) in the main centres of population, each capableof undertaking a series of building schemes and managing a substantial number of dwellings.39. For ordinary letting schemes, housing societies will usually need to borrow the full cost, and in order to keep the rents within the reach oftheir clients they will need to spread repayment over at least 40 years.They will charge rents sufficient to cover loan service, and costs ofmaintenance and management. In co-ownership schemes, intending occupiersform their own separate society and take shares in it. Individually they makea small initial contribution, say 5 per cent of the cost, and collectivelyborrow up to 95 per cent. Again they must be able to borrow for at least40 years. They are collectively responsible for repayment, maintenance and management. The individual householder is thus something between a tenant and an owner-occupier; his shares confer a right to occupy which istransferable with the shares; and if he wants to move he can assign hisshares to a new occupant or surrender them to the housing society. provision is made in the Finance Bill for giving members of approved co-ownershipsocieties tax relief on mortgage interest payments in the same way asowner-occupiers.40. The housing societies will raise loans on mortgage from the building societies, as do owner-occupiers but repayable over a longer period. TheBuilding Societies Association believe that many of their members wouldbe ready to lend two-thirds of the money needed by a housing society fora building scheme if the remaining third can be found; and agree that40-year loans would be reasonable to housing societies. The government propose to make money available to the Housing Corporation, by way of loans at current rates of interest, so that they can lend to approved housingsocieties the balance needed, taking a second mortgage. Sufficient moneywill be provided to allow for a steadily rising programme over several years ahead. The Corporation will be empowered to lend more than a third of themoney if satisfied&apos; that there is a case for doing so; but the expectation isthat the greater part of the money required by the housing societies will come from the building societies and other private sources.41. It is proposed that the Corporation be given power to acquire landby agreement in order to make it available to housing societies. They will been abled to lay out land in readiness for development. It may also be thoughtright to give the Corporation a reserve power to buy land compulsorily,subject to adequate safeguards.42. The Government believe (hat there could be a great future for a housing society movement in this country. Housing associations have donemuch for housing in the past, but mainly by way of philanthropy for the poor,or for particular groups, or for those who are handicapped in some way.What is proposed here is the development of a housing society movementwhich will build and manage houses for people at large who are able to meetthe cost. Once societies have been established they might well extend their activities to taking over and managing existing rented houses wheremanagement by a trust would be appropriate. -7
43. With all that may be done by way of maintaining the growth of owner-occupation and encouraging the development of housing societies, therewill still be a need for a larger local authority programme, building for thosewho cannot meet the full cost of housing, and tackling the comprehensivere-development of slums or blighted areas.44. The public authority share of the housing programme has been increased, and will be further increased, to enable the authorities with slums; to speed up the rate of clearance. In 1962 local authorities and new towncorporations completed 124,000 houses, and started 140,000. In 1963 theywill do more. No restraint oh the number of starts is being placed on theauthorities with large numbers of slums to clear, though plainly they shouldriot start more than the building industry can deal with efficiently.45. Slum clearance: England and Wales. When slum clearance was resumed in the mid-fifties, there were slums in all the older industrial townsand in many urban and rural districts as well. Most of the local authorities with relatively few slums are by now in sight of clearing the lot, some having already done so.46. It is in the great slum concentrations of the congested industrialtowns of the midlands and the north that the real difficulties still remain.Towards the middle of 1962, the Ministry of Housing and Local Governmentbegan a drive to secure a much accelerated rate of clearance in these towns.A Northern Housing Office was opened in October in Manchester to helpseleoted towns in the north, while help for midland and other authorities isbeing given direct from the Ministry&apos;s headquarters. Nearly all the authorities concerned have now agreed that they can and will go much faster. to achieve this they will have to step up their output of houses both byrationalisation of traditional building methods and by making use ofindustrial systems. This will mean v/orking together in the placing of orders,and groups are being formed for this purpose. The Manchester HousingOffice is in close touch with the local authorities, advising them on technicalmethods, settling proposals, and giving a lead in the formation of groups. Asecond office will shortly be established in the north-east to take over responsibility for accelerating both slum clearance and general house-building in that region. Special action has also been taken by the Welsh Office of theMinistry to speed up slum clearance and new house-building in the Principality.The pace of both is rising and will rise still further.47. In order to assure continuity of work the Department have agreedfive-year building programmes with the local authorities, many of whom willmore than double or treble their rate of house-building. In total the northernauthorities concerned are aiming at an annual output double their average annual output for the three years 1960-62. The programme will be reviewed in the light of progress and those who can do so will be encouraged to go stillfaster. In the next 10 years most English and Welsh authorities, except for afew big cities with an overwhelming proportion of slums, will have cleared allthe houses identified as unfit in 1956 and will have started to tackle the houses which, have been found to be unfit since then. . . &apos;48. Slum clearance: Scotland.-No restriction has been or will be placedon the number of houses which local authorities can build each year for
housing families from unlit houses and the Government will continue to give every encouragement to stepping up the rate of slum clearance. The main object is to speed up the rate of house-building on which in turn depends therate at which unfit houses can be cleared and replaced. A special effort hasbeen made to increase housing output, by encouraging co-operation amonghousing authorities and the use of new building techniques.48a. Since the beginning of 1955 when the Scottish slum clearanceprogramme was resumed following the passing of the Housing (Repairs andRents) (Scotland) Act, 1954, Scottish local authorities have taken out of useabout 91,500 unfit houses. In their current programme for the three years1962 to 1964 they propose to deal with about 40,000 houses. The Governmentwill seek to secure a still faster rate of progress in subsequent years.49. The elderly. Authorities are also being encouraged to increase therate of building for the very many elderly people who look to them for housing. In 1962 local authorities and new town development corporationsbuilt about 32,000 houses and flats of the one-bedroom type more than a quarter of all the dwellings they completed and, by the end of the year,,they had at their disposal about 380,000 dwellings of this type of which about 233,000 have been built over the last ten years.50. This is still not enough. Many more houses for the elderly will haveto be built, and in greater variety than now to meet their special needs.Many old people find it difficult to live without help in bungalows or flatsof the orthodox kind. They may be better suited by grouped flatlets:small places which are easier to work and in which, whilst still living behind their own front door with their own belongings, they can enjoy the benefit ofsome communal services maintained by a warden for the whole block.51. This is a field of activity in which close collaboration between theauthorities, whether central or local, who deal with housing and with the health and welfare services \&quot; indispensable. This is not simply because the elderly are by their nature likely to need help from the health and welfare services provided for people in their homes. Properly designed housing notably the special flatlets described above not only enables many of the elderly to retain a measure of the independence which they value so highly,but reduces the demand for places in residential homes provided by welfareauthorities. The accommodation provided under the two programmes mustbe planned and kept in proper balance. Housing authorities will, therefore,need to work in close association with the other bodies who are concernedwith the provision of accommodation and other services for the elderly.52. The Government will continue to encourage local authorities and housing associations to keep up a large and diversified housing programme for the elderly. But, as the recent White Paper* on the health and welfare services said, &quot; the right provision of residential accommodation will onlybe attained if the whole range of housing, health and welfare services on theone hand, and the hospital service on the other, make their proper contri-bution, in co-operation with each other&quot;. To make this possible more information is required on the physical and social condition of old people* Cmnd. 1973, presented, to Parliament by the Minister of Health in April 1963.9
and the assembly of such information will be a major feature of the long-term planning which is being undertaken by the Health and HousingMinistries.Improvement, maintenance and repairImprovement53. When in 1960 the Government succeeded in raising the rate ofimprovement with grant aid to 135,000 houses a year, they hoped that progress upwards would continue. In fact the rate has not been maintained.In 1962 only 115,000 houses were improved with grant. The government intend to secure better results; they will aim at stepping up the rate to between 150,000 and 200,000 houses a year, thus securing the improvementof a further \\ to 2 million houses over the next 10 years.54. In August 1962 the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentasked local authorities to try a more systematic approach to the problem,tackling improvement street by street, or area by area (Circular No. 42/62).Two or three authorities had already found that this produced better results.Many authorities are now adopting this approach, coupled with increasedpublicity. It is too soon yet to say what success may be attained by a drivefor area improvements; but the Association of Municipal Corporations have represented that for real progress a measure of compulsion is needed.55. The Government propose to provide for this. It seems to them rightto insist that every house with a reasonable life still ahead, and capable ofbeing so improved, should have at least hot water, a fixed bath or shower,a wash hand basin, a lavatory, a proper food store the five &quot; standardamenities&quot;.56. Half the cost of installing these, within a maximum figure, willcontinue as at present to be contributed from public funds; and the Govern-ment will discuss with the representatives of local authorities the proposal that authorities should be required to lend to owners, if they need it, their share of the capital cost including the cost of repairs. Given these con-ditions, and with the right to charge additional rent up to 12] per cent oftheir half of the cost of the improvements, it does not seem that any hardshipwould be entailed in requiring owners to carry out improvements.57. The Government intend, however, that the obligation to improveshould take effect only on a change of occupation or, in the case of arented house, when the tenant asks for it They recognise that some people,particularly older people, who may have lived in their houses for many years,do not want to be disturbed, perhaps do not want to give up a room for abathroom, are content with their house in the way they have always known it.But there can be no reason why, on a change of occupation, every housecapable of taking them should not be. provided with the minimum amenitiesnow generally accepted as necessary to proper living conditions.58. It cannot all be done at once; but, in addition to individual improve-ments undertaken at the request of the sitting tenant, the Government willask local authorities to tackle suitable areas or streets as a whole, declaringthose to which the obligation to improve would apply.  It would be open to10
owners, whether the initiative is taken by the tenant or by the local authority,to object that a particular house was not capable of improvement within themaximum cost, or was not worth improvement; and a right of appeal to theCourts would be provided. If the house is worth improvement but for some reason the owner does not feel able to carry it out, the authority would beempowered to do it on his behalf and recover the cost from him. Encourage-ment would of course continue to be given to all owners to apply for grantswhether their house is included in an &quot; improvement&quot; area or not.59. Partial improvement. There are some houses which are notphysically capable of full-scale improvement, but which will continue to be occupied for at least another 15 years. For many of these something couldbe done to make them more comfortable: hot water could be provided; a proper food store; possibly a shower-bath. Relatively small expenditure could, in many cases, make a big difference. Partial improvement is not however at present statutorily eligible for grant aid under the existing statutory provisions. The Government propose to amend the law so as to enableowners, in appropriate cases, to obtain proportionate grant for less than fullimprovement; i.e., for improvement falling short of the five standard amenities.They would not propose that partial improvement of individual blocks shouldbe made compulsory.60. Tenement blocks. Then there is the special problem of tenementblocks. These in Scotland comprise the majority of houses in need ofimprovement, and in England provide accommodation,1 although of a lowstandard, for a large number of people close to their work in areas where,because of the existing high density and land difficulties, there is little prospectof early rehousing. Many of them though far from satisfactory are not slums in the sense that they are unhealthy to live in. They are still structurallysound and are likely to remain in use for a good while. Improvement, evenif full-scale improvement is not practicable, and good management, could make living conditions in these blocks much better than they are at thepresent time.61. To get improvement of these tenement blocks will call for a variety of action. In some cases, though not often, full-scale improvement may bepossible within the existing dwellings. On the other hand, it may not be reasonable or practicable to improve some of the dwellings without doing all of them, e.g., because of interference with common services. In this event the Government would think it right to provide for compulsory improvementin suitable cases, e.g., where the majority of tenants in a block in singleownership are in favour.62. There will be many cases where full improvement is impossible for physical reasons and the most that can be done will be partial improvement.But often this will be well worth doing and where the tenants, or a majority ofthem, in a block in single ownership want this, the Government think it wouldbe right for owners to be required to make such minimal improvements as are reasonable.63. In many cases full improvement is practicable with a reduction in thenumber of dwellings and the rehousing of some of the tenants elsewhere.This is particularly the case in Scotland, where there is the additional11
complication of multiple ownership of the tenement blocks. Few ownersare in a position to provide alternative accommodation unless they can gethelp from the local authority. In these special circumstances, where rehousingis involved, or where multiple ownership prevents progress even on partialimprovements, the only effective course may well be for the local authority totake over the property and do the improvement themselves or, in Scotland,arrange with the Scottish Special Housing Association to do so.64. Management and repair of these blocks is no less important than their improvement. Many private owners of the tenement blocks managethem with proper consideration for their tenants. But not all tenementowners are doing this; and the Government now propose to requireobservance of a code of good management on lines similar to those laid downin the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations,1962.65. Slums not for early clearance. Finally, there are the slum housessome of which, in the biggest concentrations, must still continue to be livedin for some years, despite the increased rate of clearance. Only the localauthorities can deal with these; but they can make life more tolerable for the tenants, pending re-housing, if they will buy the houses before they are readyto clear, do whatever is necessary to make them dry, weather-proof and clean,and provide them with whatever is practicable in the way of basic amenities.In the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, the Government provided agrant towards the cost of work of this kind, but the grant is now inadequate and it will be increased.66. A major drive on improvements will throw a good deal of work onto some local authorities. The Government believe that the authorities are fully capable of undertaking this provided that they plan a forwardprogramme. The whole subject will, however, be discussed with therepresentatives of authorities before legislation is formulated. There will alsobe discussions with the representatives of owners.Repair and maintenance: rented houses67. The problem of ensuring a proper standard of repair and maintenanceof rented houses is a general one. Unless houses are kept in a proper stateof repair they may quickly degenerate into slums and have to be replaced at public expense.68. Owner-occupiers in general look after their houses well. So do manylandlords but not all. If suitable means can be devised, the government believe that it would be right to insist that all piivately rented houses shouldbe kept in a proper state of repair, having regard to their age and condition and to what can be done at reasonable cost. There are obvious difficultiesin the way, both legal and administrative, and various possibilities are underconsideration. These will be discussed with the representatives both of thelocal authorities and of the property owners.Urban renewal69. Urban renewal involves most of the tasks discussed above: slum clearance; improvement; a proper standard of repair.   It also involves the12
enormous tasks of replacing the older and more depressed residential areas;of accommodating the immense traffic increase expected, and of reconcilingthis with a good living environment. These all combine to form the biggestChallenge urban planning has to meet: much of it is outside the scope of this paper.70. But housing plans for the next few years must provide for an earlystart to be made on replacement of the worst of the older decayed or blightedhouses. These houses could well decline over the years into a secondgeneration of slums. For them, clearance and replacement is the onlysolution.71. Clearance and replacement of houses that are not slums is boundto be a long-term process. It cannot take precedence over the clearance of, houses that are already slums, or claim resources which at this stage mustgo into relieving housing shortages. Towns that are faced with the heavytasks of slum clearance and building lor current needs cannot yet start tomake inroads into the replacement of obsolescent houses thai are not unfit.But the authorities need to start now to make plans for re-development many indeed have done so so that as in each town these more urgent needsbegin to be met, it will be possible to start immediately on the replacement ofthe older houses and the creation of a new environment.72. Renewal of these blighted areas is a task for private enterprise andlocal authorities in partnership. The balance of public and privateparticipation has yet to be worked out, but the job is so vast and complexthat it is clear that it cannot be left to either agency alone. Before privateenterprise can make an effective start it will often need help in assemblinga sufficient area of land to do a worthwhile job. The private developer maysometimes want help in the re-housing of tenants who have been living inlow rented houses and who may need assistance towards the rent of a newhouse. The cost of acquiring and clearing the land may be heavy, especiallywhere there are existing industrial or commercial premises which impedeproper re-development.73. The technical difficulties are formidable; and the Ministry of housing and Local Government have begun a study of them. To assist inthe study arrangements have been made for some pilot schemes to beprepared jointly by local authorities and private developers. The aim ineach case will be to try to produce a re-development scheme likely to be acceptable to both the authorities and the developers, and to provide modernhousing and neighbourhood conditions. On these studies will be foundedproposals for practical solutions; and the Ministry intend to produce advice and, if necessary, proposals for altering the law which will enableret-development to go ahead as soon as each town has mastered its shortageand cleared most of its slums. There is no sense in deliberately pullingdown houses, other than those which are slums or which stand in the wayof necessary re-development, while there remains in the town a shortage ofhouses. But as soon as that shortage is overtaken then resources can beswitched to the parallel tasks of building for a rising population andreplacing the twilight areas, while the final stages of slum clearance arestill being completed. The difficulties must be surmounted since these areascannot be left to decay still further until they have to be condemned as nolonger fit to live in.13
The cost of housing74. Housing has to be paid for. Standards are rising; and as theproposals in this Paper are implemented they will rise much more as indeed they need to do. In 1962 a sub-committee of the Housing AdvisoryCommittee (the Parker Morris Committee) recommended that new houses,whether public or private, should be built to higher standards, especiallyin floor space and in heating; and there is no doubt that many people wantbetter houses. They will cost more. If old houses are to be repaired,properly maintained and improved, that will cost money. The cost has tobe met.75. Years of rent control, years of subsidy too often indiscriminatelyused, have obscured to many people the real cost of housing. Unless thereal cost is faced the country will never achieve a healthy housing position.Sufficient new houses will never be built if people are led to expect thathouses can be had at less than their cost, regardless of ability to pay.76. In a free country the householder must be prepared to meet thecost of his house where he is able to do so. Otherwise he will have littlefreedom of choice. The Government believe that most householders are willing to meet the cost witness the growth of owner occupation providedthat they get a good house. Public funds should be made available wherethat is necessary to get houses improved or to get new houses built; indeed, theGovernment have accepted and will continue to accept that some assistancefrom public funds should be given to all who will undertake improvementor conversion of suitable houses but generally people must be prepared topay the cost.   Only those who genuinely cannot do so should be helped.77. The growth of owner occupation has done a very great deal tosecure better housing standards. Owners of rented houses cannot keep themin proper condition, still less replace them, unless adequate rents are paid.The relaxation of rent control, though it has created problems, has donemuch to improve the standard of houses. The difficulty is that unless anduntil there are enough houses to give the tenant some freedom of choice,some owners may neglect their obligations and some may drive the rentshigher than is reasonable. The only complete answer to this is to have enough houses for a free market. Freezing rents by control freezes themarket, and simply discourages both letting and good maintenance.Nevertheless until supply does match demand there is here a very difficultdilemma; and the Government will consider this further when they havethe results of the survey which is to be made of London housing(paragraphs 48 and 49 of White Paper on London: Cmnd. 1952).78. One thing is clear. If the rents of private houses are held downbelow a reasonable level the houses will not be maintained, and they willnot be replaced.^ [In due course the rents of houses remaining in controly^wst-be^low^d-to-^ise-to-a-level-which will enable the owners to keep/ 4hem-in-good repair:-] If the rents of municipal houses are held downbelow a reasonable level, regardless of the tenanfs ability to pay, the driveto raise the standard of housing all round will never make the headwaywhich everybody wants. The many who shoulder the cost of their houses,whether as owners or tenants, cannot be expected to continue indefinitely142^The Government do not envisage any further block decontrol;but in due course when obligations come to be placed on owners to keep their houses in good repair, the rents must be allowedto rise to a level which will enable them to do this^
subsidising all the rest, whether they need it or not, and without regardto the extent of their need. Moreover, too wide a gap between municipalrents and the economic cost of comparable private property removesthe incentive to stand on one&apos;s own feet. The Government believe that thepeople of this country will willingly meet whatever cost has to be met in providing a good house for every family; but only if the cost is fairly shared.Subsidies79. The Minister of Housing and Local Government [has invited][proposes to invite] the representatives of local authorities in England andWales to join with him in a complete overhaul of housing subsidies. He[has proposed] [will suggest] that this should start with a thorough examination of the finance of local authority housing: the cost to arepresentative selection of authorities both of the houses they own and ofthose which they must build over the next several years; the level of earnings in the different areas against which the rent-paying capacity of tenants can be judged; and what, having regard to this, the different authorities require byway of subsidy to enable them to build what houses they need to build and still to let their houses to tenants at rents which they can afford. The Secretaryof State also proposes to initiate discussions with the representatives of localauthorities in Scotland to examine the workings of the Housing (Scotland)Act, 1962, and to review the whole subsidy situation on similar lines.80. The Government adhere to their declared policy that while no one in genuine need of a house should be asked to pay more rent than he can reasonably afford, subsidies ought not to be given to those who do not needthem. It follows that in considering what subsidy is required the government must assume that local authorities will charge rents properly related on theone hand to the cost of the housing, on the other to the ability of the tenantsto pay. Hundreds of authorities have shown that rent rebate schemes can be worked fairly and without difficulty; and nothing is more unfair whether total or rate-payer, than that he should be compelled to subsidise the rent ofa tenant who does not need it or to an extent that he does.not need whilehimself often no better off and in many cases having to pay a higher rent orto meet mortgage payments.81. But given the assumption that proper rents are charged, subject torebates for those who need them, the Government will be prspared to see that local authorities receive whatever subsidy they need to carry through their housing responsibilities and to plan ahead with confidence.Conclusion82. Here then in outline are the Governments proposals for expanding the provision of housing in this country and raising it to a higher all-roundstandard than ever before. Collectively they will give a new impetus to ourhousing effort.83. The pace of new building will quicken. More and better houses willbe built and in greater variety. Sufficient land will be made available so that local shortages can be overcome. The growth of owner-occupation will befostered. Local authorities with remodelled subsidies based on proper rentpolicies will be helped to clear the remaining slums much more quickly and15
to provide for the elderly and others who need to look to them. The range and rate of improvement will increase. An attack on the older blightedresidential areas will be prepared, and launched as each town gets rid of itsslums and masters any shortage. Finally a new arm of housing housingsocieties supported by the building society movement and by a Governmentfinanced Housing Corporation will be brought into action to provide homeswithout subsidy and without profit for letting and for co-ownership.84. Legislation needed to implement the Government^ proposals will.beintroduced as soon as practicable.16
