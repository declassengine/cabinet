C.(63) 7126th April, 1963CABINETFASCIST ACTIVITIES AND PUBLIC order memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i refer to the Home Secretary^ memorandum (C. (63) 70). In my view weshould not simply rest on a strengthening of the penalties (to which we are in anycase committed) and a declaration that no new law or amendment of the present-law is required. I feel we should enact or at the least encourage Mr. Iremonger&apos;bill.2. I do not argue the legal side of it although personally I do not find theobjections in paragraph p of the Home Secretary&apos;s paper convincing. But this isnot only a question of legal construction any more than the case of Chief Enahorois. And as in the case of Chief Enahoro other although perhaps less eminent lawyers will take a different view. As far as the House of Commons is concernedall members of the Opposition parties and a good many Government supporterswill not be content to leave matters as they are. Nor will the Communists whomatter little. Nor will the Jewish community who matter a great deal. TheHome Secretary was clearly right in his earlier paper C. (62) 156 of 19th October,1962, in saying (paragraph 13): &quot; If this (violence) persists and the Government arenot seen to be doing anything to stop it, the whole Jewish population, and many others too, will turn against us.&quot; Meetings will start again and I have little doubtthat the appeal to non-violence with which the Home Secretary&apos;s proposed statement ends will fall on deaf ears.3. Nor do I feel that we need be too anxious that Mr. Iremonger&apos;amendment includes the word &quot; racial &quot;. The significant change since 1936 is thatwe now have large coloured communities, and that we have even had small racialriots.4. What then apart from increasing the penalties should we do? Thereare three approaches. To say as the Home Secretary suggests that the law hasbeen shown to be adequate: I have tried to set out some of the objections to thiscourse. To have a sweeping measure against all forms of racial discrimination asproposed in the Fenner Brockway Bill (which the Opposition are pledged to enact):but this is political sky-writing. Or to find some moderate amendment of the type that Mr. Iremonger suggests though not of course necessarily in his exactwords. I hope the Cabinet will decide for the third approach.I.
