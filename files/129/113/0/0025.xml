Revised Draft Reply to Mr. Fields letter of April 20thThank you for your letter of April 20 to which mycolleagues and I have given the closest consideration.I much appreciate the care which you have taken to setout your views so fully and so frankly.     This has been of great assistance to us, and I know that you would wishme to reply to your letter in the same spirit.2.     You were kind enough to say that I would be in aposition to appreciate the achievements of SouthernRhodesia over the past ho years.     I am glad to have this opportunity of affirming our recognition 1 of what has been achieved by the people of Southern Rhodesia in thedevelopment of their country, and of acknowledging the contribution made by Southern Rhodesia in men and moneyto the defence of the Commonwealth.   ^In framing this reply, we have, of course, taken into account the achievements of the different races to which you referas well as the special characteristics of the relation-ship between Southern Rhodesia and the United Kingdom^3.     In my letter of April 9 I affirmed the Government&apos;acceptance in principle that Southern Rhodesia will proceed through the normal processes to independence andwe have never suggested that a conference was necessaryto agree the principle of independence.     Neverthelessbefore independence is granted in practice to any country there are inevitably a number of matters of mutual interest which have to be considered and discussedif the transfer of sovereignty on the grant of independence is to be effected in an orderly and propermanner.     In the case of Southern Rhodesia this is what i had in mind when I referred to normal processes,h.     These considerations apart, your letter, with allrespect, seems to us still to underrate the/constitutional1
constitutional difficulty of granting full independence to Southern Rhodesia while she still remains a memberof the Federation,     While the Federation is still inexistence none of the members of it can become fully-independent states, for the Federation is not independent and so while it remains in being none of its members canbe fully independent either.     Moreover, the Federationis not brought to an end by the recognition of a right ofits members to secede from it nor is it necessarilybrought to an end by the passage of an Act of parliament which takes one of its members out of the Federation.It can be brought to an end only by the passage ofUnited Kingdom legislation enacting that the Federationshall cease to exist.     It is important that these factsshould be recognised for Southern Rhodesia&apos;s membership of the Federation is a complicating factor in relationto the grant of independence to Southern Rhodesia.5.     In my letter I certainly had not overlooked thejoint declaration of April 28, 1957.     You will howevernote that the Convention is limited to not initiatingany legislation to amend or repeal any Federal Act or todeal with any matter included within the competence ofthe Federal Legislature except at the request of theFederal Government.6.      I am glad to know that you recognise thedesirability of discussions between the territories bothon the broad lines of a future relationship and on the transitional arrangements required for the orderlydissolution of the Federation.     While it is true thatthe independence of Southern Rhodesia (after the dissolution of the Federation) has no logical connectionwith the establishment of economic links between theterritoriess yet it has been and remains our view thatif the territories are to move from their present Federal/association
association into a new and. fruitful relationship, itwould he necessary to hold a Conference or Conferenceson these two subjects which are closely interrelated,that is how to bring the Federation to an end and how to establish a future association on acceptable lines.7.     We fully recognise that any form of futureassociation must be one which is freely entered into bythe territories.     In proposing a conference to discussa future relationship between the territories and the transitional arrangements which will be necessary, itwas not, of course, the intention of the BritishGovernment to attempt to impose any form of association.Naturally, we did not contemplate any discussion at sucha conference of the internal affairs of any of theconstituent territories.8.      In response to your view that a Conference oneconomic links has no valid connection with the grant of independence I am, however, authorised to say that wewould be ready to hold the Conference we had in mind intwo stages.     The first stage would bo confined to considering the problems involved in an orderlydissolution of the Federation.     These, I am sure youwill agree, are of vital importance to Southern RhodesiaUntil this has been done it is not possible to knowprecisely what will be the date when the Federation willbe formally brought to an end and therefore SouthernRhodesia cease to be a member of it.     This is in factand in law a condition precedent to Southern Rhodesiabecoming fully independent.     Therefore we think that ifthe Conference is held in this form and starts with thediscussion of the ending of the Federation this will bethe first step towards the objective which you desire./9. Thus
9.     Thus, in our view the time that it will take &quot;beforeSouthern Rhodesia &quot;becomes independent rests largely withthe Southern Rhodesia Government.      If your Government isprepared to co-operate and to discuss with us the matters which must be resolved before independence can begranted we see no reason why the process should be longdelayed.     If co-operation in relation to these mattersis forthcoming, the British Government will undertake toenter into negotiations on her independence with southern Rhodesia not later than the date on which negotiations for the independence of either of the other territories are initiated by us.     We cannot regard it asunreasonable nor incompatible with Southern Rhodesia&apos;sstatus and record as a self-governing colony that she should be asked to participate in the discussionsnecessary to secure the orderly dissolution of theFederation and the orderly achievement of independence.I should at this point say that I am sorry if anymisunderstanding has arisen over my reference to&quot;self-governing dependencies&quot;.     I used this expressionas indicating territories which, though self-governing,had not become independent.10.    In your letter you ma is a number of references tothe Southern Rhodesian Constitution of 1961, which as yousay, itself confers wide powers of amendment.    I wouldlike to make it clear that we do not envisage anotherConstitutional Conference such as took place in 1961 andwe agree that in the light of the recognised conventionit would not be right for the United Kingdom themselvesto enact any changes in the Constitution.   Nonetheless,before independence is granted our Government would wishto discuss with yours whether and in what respects thepowers of amendment to which you refer could or should beexercised./II.   Youk
11.   You conclude your letter &quot;by asking that there shouldbe no further delay.     We agree.     We have set out theposition in paragraphs 8 and 9 and as soon as we hearfrom you that you are ready to co-operate in carryingmatters forward along the lines I have described we will immediately consult with the Government of the federation and the Government of ^Northern Rhodesia with a view toarranging the first stage of the Conference - that is theone concerned with the orderly dissolution of theFederation to which I have referred.     This is the firstpractical step to take.12.    If, however, , you feel any further doubts, perhaps you would like to come to London for further talks.   We could then spend a little time discussing this problem and related matters.     Such discussions need not precludeputting in hand preliminary arrangements for the first stage of the Conference.29th April. 19631
