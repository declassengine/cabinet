PRIME MINISTER HTw.l!   ^ ^On 30th May, 1963, just &quot;before the Parliamentary recessyou asked me to examine the security reports and other documents you had received in relation to what I may call theStephen Ward case, to make such enquiries as I thought necessary of the security authorities and of the police andto advise you whether in my opinion any further action isnecessary. U2.     I have now completed my investigations and the following are my conclusions.(a) There is no ground for supposing that any breach of security in fact occurredo(b) The Security Service did not know of Mr. Profumo&apos;s association with Miss Keeler until the evening ofthe 28th January 1963 when Mr. Profumo told them ofit.     He did not tell them of its true nature butasserted that it was innocent.(c) Prom the time when he first saw the Law Officers onthis matter until the date of his resignation,Mr. Profumo, when seen by Ministers and officials,consistently alleged that he was being victimised andthat his relationship with Miss Keeler was without anyimpropriety.(d) No information about Mr. Profumo&apos;s relationship withand visits to Miss Keeler was ever given by Mr. Wardto the Security Service.(e) The Security Service after they had.learned of Mr. Ward&apos;sfriendship with Captain Ivanov in the summer of 1961warned Mr. Ward, and after they had learned thatMr. Profumo&apos;s acquaintanceship with Mr. Ward was morethan just a meeting at Cliveden they took steps to seethat Mr. Profumo was warned about Mr. Ward.   He was notwarned in relation to Miss Keeler, for the security service had no information of Miss Keeler1s associationv/ith Mr. Ward or v/ith Capt. Ivanov, or of her association with Mr. Profumo.(f) The warning was given to Mr. Profumo by Sir Norman Brook,then Secretary of the Cabinet.     He did not give anywarning about Miss Keeler and nothing was said by himor by Mr. Profumo on the 9th August, 1961, when the warning was given, about Miss Keeler.     Sir Norman Brookknew nothing about Miss Keeler at the time and he didnot report to the Prime Minister that he had warnedMr. Profumo about Mr. Ward.;&apos; VOv&apos;v-: -;v&apos;;:: -.-f-&apos;r;y\:.&apos;-:ASyf.&apos;\&apos;&apos;:&apos;y^Mh^&apos;-^&apos;^&apos;..^ ^-7:&apos;y\-y-\:;y^A?^yy&apos;yy.yy; - :&apos;\V:.^.:;--:,;-; -V&apos;&apos;1&apos;&apos;&quot;(g) If it be the fact that the effect of giving the warningon 9th August, 196l, to Mr. Profumo was the terminationby him of his association both with Miss Keeler andwith Mr. Ward, as he has stated to me, then it may besaid that an immediate warning would or might have prevented Mr. Profumo from getting so involved.     Theknowledge the Security Service then possessed did not suggest to them that there was any immediate urgency.-1-
They did not put a watch upon Mr. Ward&apos;s flat either&quot;Their assessment of Mr. Ward&apos;s character and his closefriendship with Capt. Ivanov led them to suppose thatMr. &quot;Ward was unreliable but they had not at that timeany grounds for supposing that a watch upon Mr. Ward&apos;sflat would be productive of any useful information, &quot;(h) In failing to inform any Minister of the informationthey received on the 7th February, 196.3 to the effectthat Mr. Ward had attempted to induce Miss Keeler toobtain certain information from Mr. Profumo, when theyhad been called to Admiralty House on the1st February, 1963s and informed of the information given that day by the General Director of a Sundaynewspaper, the Security Service committed an error of judgment.(i) Mr. Ward acted for and on behalf of Capt. Ivanov for thepurpose of obtaining information from the Foreign Officeand introduced Capt. Ivanov to a number of people he might not otherwise have met.     Whether he is to beregarded as a dupe of Capt. Ivanov&apos;s or as an activecollaborator, I cannot say.     He admitted to theForeign Office that he knew that anything he said toCapt. Ivanov which was of interest to the soviet authorities would be communicated to them.With his patients including many in prominent positions and with the acquaintances he was able to make throughliving on the Cliveden estate and. through, his artisticactivities, he was in a position should any of hispatients, sitters or acquaintances be guilty of anindiscretion, of rendering services to the Russians.But I can find no indication that any such indiscretionoccurred.I am satisfied that he knew of and connived at mr. Profumo&apos;s association with Miss Christine Keeler.It was not until May, 1963 when Mr. Ward saw thePrime Minister&apos;s Principal Private Secretary and whenhe wrote to Mr. Harold Wilson, to the home secretary and to his M,P., and when he knew that the police were making enquiries about him.that he alleged thatMr. Profumo&apos;s statement in&apos;the House of Commons wasfalse, and he repeatedly asserted what he must haveknown to be untrue, namely, that he had reported tothe Security Service Mr. Profumo&apos;s association withMiss Christine Keeler and his visits to her at theWimpole Mews flat at the time they took place.(j)    In the light of the information contained in thisreport it is not possible to determine when theassociation between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler infact terminated..-2
So that you may see on what my conclusions are based, Ipropose to set out in detail and so far as possible inchronological order the facts as they appear as a result of the examination and enquiries I have made.3.   Mr. Stephen Ward practises as an osteopath in London.In recent years he has also practised as an artist.   He wascommissioned by the Illustrated London News to do a series ofpencil drawings of prominent people including Ministers for thepaper.km   In the late 19^0&apos;s Sir Godfrey Nicholson, M.P., becameone of his patients.   Since then Sir Godfrey has been treated by him on a number of occasions.   Sir Godfrey found thetreatment so satisfactory that he recommended Mr. Ward to manyof his friends and acquaintances.   He has also endeavoured to helpMr. Ward by getting prominent people to sit for him.   Sir Godfreynever went to any of Mr. Ward&apos;s parties or to his cottage atCliveden.5.   One of the persons introduced by Sir Godfrey to Mr. Ward for treatment was Sir Colin Coote, the Editor of the Daily Telegraph.Mr. Ward told Sir Colin several times that he would like to go to moscow and sketch some of the personalities there.    Sir Colinthought that such a visit might be useful for his paper.   Hehad met Capt. Ivanov, the Soviet Assistant Naval Attache when a party of Attaches had visited the Daily Telegraph building inFleet Street.Sir Colin had invited Capt. Ivanov to lunch with him at theGarrick Club to meet the Daily Telegraph Special Correspondenton Communist affairs and in view of Mr. Ward&apos;s desire to go toRussia to make sketches, he invited Mr. Ward to join them.The luncheon party took place on the 20th January, 1 961 .iIt was in this way that Mr. Ward made the acquaintance ofCapt. Ivanov.6.   Thereafter Mr. Ward became very friendly with Capt, Ivanov*This came to the notice of the Security Service and on the8th June, 1961 they warned Mr, Ward about Capt. Ivanov.7.   On Friday the 7th July, 1961 Mr. and Mrs. Profumo werestaying with Lord Astor at Cliveden.   Mr. Ward was at hiscottage   on the estate.   He was allowed to use Lord Astor&apos;sbathing pool.   That evening he was at the bathing poolaccompanied by four or five girls, one of whom wasMiss Christine Keeler, and Capt. Ivanov.    The Profumos went withother guests of Lord Astor to the bathing pool,and there met mr.. Ward, Capt. Ivanov and the girls who were with Mr. Ward,It was on this occasion that Mr. Profumo first metMiss Christine Keelero-3-
8.    Three days later on Monday the 10th July Mr. Wardtelephoned a Security Officer and said that he had some information to give him.   They agreed to meet for lunch onWednesday the 12th July.     Mr. Ward then said that Capt. Ivanovhad told him a few days before that the Russians knew as a factthat the American Government had taken a decision to arm western germany with atomic weapons and that Capt. Ivanov had asked himto find out through his influential friends when this decision was to be implemented.   Capt. Ivanov, according to Mr, Ward,implied that if Mr, Ward secured this information, the tripwhich Mr, Ward wished to make to Moscow would be facilitated,,Mr. Ward was very keen&apos;to go to Moscow and to draw Mr, KhrushchevMr, Ward was most anxious that no action should be taken against Capt. Ivanov on this information and asked what he should do about Capt. Ivanovfs request.   He suggested that this was perhaps an opportunity for him to assist the Security Serviceand asked whether it was not possible for him to be given some information for passing to Ivanov to ensure that the russians would not take political decisions on false Information,Mr. Ward was warned that he must make no attempt to complywith Capt. Ivanov*s request.9.   It would seem probable that this conversation between mr. Ward and Capt. Ivanov took   place during the course of the weekend commencing the 7th July.   It was on that weekend that&apos;Mr, Profumo first met Capt. Ivanov.   I have questionedMr. Profumo about this and asked him whether Mr. Ward orCapt. Ivanov said anything to him that weekend on this or anyother political issue of that character,   Mr. Profumo assured methat no conversation took place between him and Capt. Ivanovthat weekend on any such matters and that he did not discloseto him anything he should have kept secret.   It is indeedinherently improbable that Capt. Ivanov should have raised sucha question on his first meeting with Mr. Profumo.So far as I can ascertain, Mr. Ward has never asserted thatduring this weekend he had any political discussion withMr. Prcfumo,   Mr. Profumo has told me that he has no recollectionof having had one with Mr. Ward.10.   At the meeting on the 12th July, 1961 with the SecurityOfficer, Mr, Ward revealed that he had met Mr. Profumo duringthe weekend of the 7th July.   When the Security Officer was later questioned by his superior on his report of the interviewof the 12th July, he supplemented his report by stating thatMr. Ward had said that the weekend of the 7th July was not theonly occasion on which he had met Mr. Profumo, that Mr. Wardclaimed that he and Mr. Profumo were quite close friends andMr. Profumo had visited him at his London home.In view of these allegations the Security Service thoughtit desirable to report the matter to Sir Norman Brook, theSecretary of the Cabinet.   The Security Service would not have thought it necessary or advisable to do so if the meeting atCliveden between Mr. Ward and Mr. Profumo had been the onlymeeting and the only acquaintanceship of Mr. Profumo withMr. Ward. \\
Sir Norman Brook did not think it necessary to reportthe matter to the Prime Minister hut warned Mr, Profumo about Mr. Ward on the 9th August, 1961,It is right to point out that apart from knowledge oftheir meeting at the bathing pool at Cliveden on the 7th July,the Security Service did not at this time know anything about any association between Mr. Profumo and Miss Christine Keeler,and consequently Sir Norman Brook at the time he warnedMr. Profumo had no knowledge of that.Mr. Profumo has told me that he met Mr,, Ward a long time before 1961, that he was^introduced to him by Lord Astor andthat he had on oocasions been to parties at Mr. Ward&apos;s home.The Security Officer who interviewed Mr. Ward on the12th July did not report to his superior that Mr. Ward had told him of any visit by Mr. Profumo to Mr. Ward&apos;s flatbetween the 7th and 12th July.   He has no recollection of having been told that, and if he had been told that byMr, Ward,.he is confident that he would&apos;have mentioned it inhis report.I therefore conclude that Mr. Ward&apos;s reference on &quot;the12th July to Mr, Profumo&apos;s visiUto his home related tovisits made before Mr. Profumo. met Miss Christine Keeler,11,   Mr,Profumo told me when I saw him on 7th June, 1963,that he terminated his association with Miss Christine Keeleron receipt of this warning on the 9th August, 1961, and thathe has not seen her since then.   In his statement to the Houseof Commons on the 22nd March, 1963 he said that he last sawMiss Christine Keeler in December, JiS6\.Mr, Profumo told me that he was mistaken about this.He knew he had received the warning about Mr. Ward in thecourse of a Parliamentary recess and he was under theimpression that it was the Christmas recess.   He knew thathe had written to Miss Keeler the same day.There is no doubt that the warning was in fact given tohim on the 9th August, 1961 and I have now seen a photostaticcopy of a letter written by him to Miss Christine Keeler datedthe 9th August, 1961.After he had received the warning Mr. Profumo told methat he did not see or speak to Mr. Ward until January, 1963when he had occasion t-o speak to him with regard to the events which were - then occurring.   Between the weekend ofthe 7th July and the 9th August, 1961, he said he saw Mr. Wardfor a few minutes- on one or two of the occasions when hevisited Miss Christine Keeler at Mr. Ward!s flat.   After the weekend of 7th July, 1961, he did not see Capt. Ivanov on.any occasion except at a reception given in honour of Gagarin whenhe had a few words of polite conversation with him.12,   On the 2nd August, 1961 Lord Astor wrote to the ForeignOffice saying that his friend Mr, Stephen Ward had become a friend of Capt. Ivanov who was always asking him questions aboutthe General political intentions of the British.   He saidthat^Mr, Ward was struck by how hard they (the Russians) seemto find it to assess British opinion and intentions accurately.-5&apos;
Lord Astor said he had met Capt. Ivanov who vitas, according toMr. Ward, &quot;an absolutely dedicated Communist and also a niceperson&quot;.Lord Astor said that it had occurred to him after talkiijgto Mr. Ward that if the Foreign Office wished to ensure atany particular moment that the Russian Embassy was absolutely correctly informed as to Western intentions,Capt.  Ivanov might be useful.  He said Mr. Ward would pass on information himself or could very easily arrange forCapt. Ivanov to meet at a meal anyone the Foreign Office wished.13*   In consequence of this letter, Mr. Ward was seen on the18th September, 1961 by a member of the Foreign Office.Mr, Ward said he was no Communist but sympathetic in many respects with Soviet policy, that he saw a good deal ofCapt. Ivanov, that in fact Capt. Ivanov spent most weekendswith him at Cliveden, that they sometimes,avoided politicsbut often discussed them, that Mr. Ward&apos;s impression was thatCapt. Ivanov was very interested to learn of any opinions which mr. &quot;Ward might have and even more of opinions which Mr, Wardmight pass on from his numerous influential acquaintances.Mr, Ward said that he hoped he might be able to turn hisfriendship with Capt. Ivanov to useful account and that if at any time there was anything which the British government might wish to get across to the Russians he would be verypleased to act as an intermediary.     Mr. Ward said he was sure that anything he let slip would be immediately recorded byCapt. Ivanov and suitable attention taken of it by theSoviet authorities.He was told that the Foreign Office would not be wantingto avail themselves of this offer.Ik,   On the 21st February, 1962 Sir Godfrey Nicholson, M.P.,who had been introduced by Mr. Ward to Capt. Ivanov, spoke to the Foreign Office about a conversation he had had withCapt. Ivanov.   As a result of that conversation the foreign secretary had a note sent to Sir Godfrey about the BritishGovernmenfs views on disarmament and said that he had noobjection to Sir Godfrey giving Capt. Ivanov a copy of thepaper.     Sir Godfrey did not send him this note but senthim a letter dated the 28th February, 1962, the terms ofwhich were first approved by the Foreign Office.15.   On the 6th March, 1962 Sir Godfrey Nicholson saw theForeign Secretary and told him that Capt. Ivanov was pressing him for a statement on the British position over berlin which he could communicate to the Russian authorities.The Foreign Secretary warned him in strong terms thatCapt. Ivanov must be regarded as working for the RussianIntelligence Service ,and advised Sir Godfrey to have nothing more to do with him.   &apos; Sir Godfrey maintained that as anM.P. he must be allowed to talk to members of any foreignembassy he choke.     The Foreign Secretary said that he couldnot risk .Sir Godfrey giving a wrong impression of the government&apos;s policy and would therefore supply him with anote on the official British line on Berlin.Sir Godfrey drafted a letter to Capt. Ivanov, submittedit to the Foreign Office for approval and, after approvalof its terms by the Foreign Office, sent it to Capt. Ivanovon 8th March, 1962.-6-
16U    On the 13th March Sir Godfrey again saw Capto Ivanovwho asked him a question about the Britinh attitude to theOdor-Hoiaae Line.     Sir Godfrey wrote him on ihth March, 1962,a further letter on this, the terms of which were also firstapproved by the Foreign Office.17.    On the 5th April, 1962 Sir Godfrey invited Sir HaroldCaccia to lunch with him.     One of the other guests was mr. Ward, who spoke about his contacts with Capt. Ivanov and suggested it might be useful if he could put Sir Harold Cacciain touch with Capt. Ivanov direct.     That invitation wasdeclined.   Sir Harold subsequently met Capt. Ivanov at the Russian.Embassy at the celebration of the Russian National Day inNovember, 1962.     He met Mr. Ward on one other occasion.   Heand Lady Caccia were staying the weekend of the 13th May,1962 at Cliveden with Lord Astor.     Mr. Ward came in oneevening for a drink before dinner.     Sir Harold had noconversation of substance with him.18.    On the 21+th October, 1962 (the time of the Cuban crisis)Mr. Ward telephoned the Resident Clerk at the Foreign Officeand said that he had been recommended to contact Sir HaroldCaccia by Lord Astor.     He gave the Resident Clerk an accountof a conversation he had just had with Capt. Ivanov who Mr. Wardsaid had called on him at his own (Capt. Ivanov&apos;s) request.Among other things he said that Capt. Ivanov had stated thatthe Americans had created a situation in which there was absolutely no opportunity for either the Russians or the americans to compromise and that the Soviet Government looked to the United Kingdom for their one hope of conciliation.The Resident Clerk thanked Mr. Ward for the information.Mr. Ward then said that he would be seeing Capt. Ivanov againwithin the next two days and offered to speak to him on anyline the Foreign Office might suggest.19.   On the next day, the 25th October, 1962,Sir Godfrey Nicholson went to the Foreign Office and sawSir Hugh Stephenson, then Deputy Under-Secretary.   He saidthat Capt. Ivanov had been to see him earlier tha&quot;&apos;  day andhad told him that the whole Russian Embassy was in j. &quot;flatspin&quot; and that they must have, to restore the balance, some indication that the British Government were considering workingtowards negotiations at the summit.     Capt. Ivanov toldSir Godfrey that the whole Russian Embassy knew that he was approaching him.Sir Hugh Stephenson told Sir Godfrey that this was amatter of high policy on which he could not possibly give an answer.     Sir Godfrey however insisted on some sort of answersince failure to answer in some way would be taken by theRussians to mean that a summit meeting was rejected.Sir Hugh Stephenson then told Sir Godfrey that theRussian Charge d&apos;Affaires had seen the Foreign Secretary onthe same afternoon.     Sir Godfrey immediately seized on this,as an opportunity, as he expressed it, of getting off thehook and volunteered that these unofficial channels were notat all satisfactory.     He then tried to telephone Mr. Wardand Capt. Ivanov from Sir Hugh Stephenson&apos;s room but did notsuceed in getting in touch with them.
I should, I think, make it clear that the Foreign Officedo not use &quot;unofficial channels&quot; for conveying official information about Government policy and that on the occasions on which information was given to Sir Godfrey for communica-tion to Capt. Ivanov, it was to avoid all possibility ofmisrepresentation of British policy of which the foreign secretary considered there was a real danger.20o   Later the same afternoon Mr. Ward spoke on the telephoneto Sir Harold Caccia&apos; s. Private Secretary, and told him thesame story about Capt. Ivanov as Sir Godfrey Nicholson had toldSir Hugh Stephenson.     The Private Secretary said that theofficial channel was open to the Russians if they wished to use it and that the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaires had seen theSecretary of State earlier that day.21.   The same day, Thursday, 25th October, 1962, Lord Astortold Lord Arran that there was a Russian official who was seeking to pass information of an urgent nature to the BritishGovernment.On the following day, 26th&quot; October, 1962, Mr. Wardtelephoned Lord Arran and said&apos;that he would like to bringCapto Ivanov to his house for discussions the next morning.Lord Arran agreed to this and Capt. Ivanov and Mr. Ward came to see him on the 27th October.     Capt. Ivanov stated that hispurpose was to get a message to the British Government byindirect means, asking them to call a summit conference inLondon forthwith.     He said that Mr. Khrushchev would acceptthe invitation with alacrity and that by doing this GreatBritain would break the deadlock over Cuba.     Lord Arran saidthat it appeared to him that what was being attempted by theRussians was to drive a wedge between Great Britain and the americans.     A full report of this interview was sent byLord Arran to the Foreign Office and to Admiralty House.22.    On the Sunday following, the 28th October, 1962,Lord Arran dined v/ith Lord Astor at Cliveden.     He found his fellow guests were Mr. Ward and Capt. Ivanov.     At this timeMr. Khrushchev&apos;s agreement to take the missiles out of Cubahad become known.23.    On the 31st October, Mr. Iain Macleod&apos;s daughter gave a party in his flat.     A guest to the party brought Mr. Ward and&quot;someone from the Russian Embassy&quot;, presumably Capt. Ivanov,to the party.     It-may bo safely propumod that the intention wasto prcs-s&quot;on Mr. ftfcrelcod the same points in relation to- Cuba-a-s-had boon put bo tire&quot;&quot;FoTirirgrr-Gocretary.     In fact Mr. Macleod wasnot present and has never met Mr. Ward or Capt. Ivanov.Mr. Macleod reported the incident both orally and in writing tothe Foreign Secretary.     No further attempt was made to contactMr. Macleod nor any member of his family.2h.   On the 7th November Mr. Ward wrote to Mr. Harold Wilson M.P.telling him that on Friday, 26th October, an offer was made bythe Russians to the Foreign Office in relation to Cuba, namely the proposal that this country should call a summit conference which the Russians would attend.     He asserted that he could&quot;vouch fortiuthenticity of this since I was the intermediary&quot;.He asserted too that this offer was laid before Mr. Macmillanpersonally.      The letter of 7th November, 1962S was handed tothe Prime Minister by Mr. Harold Wilson, on 27th March, 1963.-8-
25.   Apart from the telephone calls referred to inparagraphs 18 and 20 above, there is no shred of evidence ofany personal appicachly Mr. Ward  to any Minister *   That he acted as &quot;an intermediary for Capt. Ivanov in getting Sir Godfrey Nicholsonto visit and communicate with the Foreign Office and inapproaching Lord Arran is clear.26.    On the lhth December, 1962 the shooting incident occurredoutside Mr. Ward&apos;s flat in Wimpole Mews.     Miss ChristineKeeler was in the flat.27o   On the 26th December, 1962 Mr. Tomkins, then Head of theCentral Department of the Foreign Office, with his wife dinedwith Lord Ednam.     Mr. Ward and Capt. Ivanov were also guestsat the dinner party.     At the beginning of the eveningMr. Tomkins got involved in a discussion about the Nassauagreement and the possibility of the Germans acquiring nuclear weapons.     The Nassau meeting had&apos; only just taken place and allMr, Tomkins knew about it was what he had read in the newspapers,28.    Mr. Profumo told me that at the end of JanuaryLord Astor asked to see him urgently and told him thatMiss Keeler had been deteriorating rapidly and that she hadsold her story to the Sunday Pictorial and had mentionedCapt. Ivanov as one of her friends in high places.Mr. Profumo told me that he had immediately asked theHead of the Security Service to see him.     The Head of theSecurity Service saw him on the 28th January, 1963 in hisroom at the War Office.     He told the Head of the security service how he had come to meet Miss Keeler and Capt. Ivanovat Cliveden.     He said that he had visited Mr. Ward&apos;s flatin Wimpole Mews on a number of occasions, generally when there had been parties there but once or twice he had foundMiss Keeler there alone.He said he had been warned that the Sunday Pictorialand the News of the World had got a story from Miss Keelerin which she alleged an association v/ith him. He said thatthere was nothing in it or words to that effect. He said he had written a number of notes to her but that they wereharmless ones simply regretting that he was unable to cometo parties and such like.Although Mr. Profumo did not ask it directly, the Headof the Security Service gained the impression that he wasbeing invited to take some action to stop publication of miss Keeler&apos;s story.29,   On the 29th January, 1963, Capt. Ivanov left theUnited Kingdom,-9-
30.    On Friday the 1st February, 1 9&amp;3 the General Directorof a Sunday newspaper went to Admiralty House and saw one ofthe Prime Minister1s Secretarieso     He said that he had come ona security matter.     He said that he had heard that Mr. Profumohad compromised himself with a girl who was involved with anegro in a shooting case;   that the girlTs story had &quot;been sold to the Press and that it included passages in which she v/asinvolved with Mr, Profumo and also the Russian Naval Attachesthat Mr. Profumo was, among other things alleged to have net the  girl through Lord Astor at &quot;Cliveden and that the girl had got into this company through a Mr. Ward;    that Mr. Profumovisiting her at Ward&apos;s house had passed in the passage theRussian Naval attache on his way out and that the girl had twoletters on War Office paper signed J. although.it was not suggested that these letters were anything more than ones ofassignation.31.   On receipt of this information, the Security Service were communicated with and a member of the Service went that eveningto Admiralty House,     He was told what the General Director ofthe newspaper had said.I have seen the note made by the Security Officer of thatinterview.     This was not meant to be a full record of whatwas said and was more or less in the nature of an aide memoire.In the note the Security Officer recorded that he had said thatthe Head of the Security Service had had a confidential talk with Mr. Profumo in which the latter had recounted a story whichwas substantially in accordance with what the General Directorof the newspaper had said.I have seen the Security Officer concerned and he has told me that by this he meant that the General Director^ story wasrecognizahly about the same matter as had been Mr. Profumo&apos;sconversation with the Head of the Security Service.     He did not mean by the words &quot;substantially in accordance&quot; etc. that he understood Mr. Profumo to have made any admission of misconduct.I have also seen a note of the meeting &quot;between Mr. Profumoand the Head of the Security Service.     This completely confirms the statements made to me by the Security Officer for whereas the clear implication of the General Director of the newspaper&apos;sstatement is that a guilty association had existed, the note ofan interview between Mr. Profumo and the Head of the security service does not convey that implication, and indeed Mr. Profumothen asserted to the Head of the Security Service that therehad been nothing wrong in his association with Miss Keeler.32.   Following the interview with the Security Officer, thePrime Minister&apos;s Principal Private Secretary called on mr. Profumo on the. evening of the same day.The Principal Private Secretary told Mr. Profumo that hehad a story about an article which might appear in the press and which would show him in a bad light:    that normally thematter would have been reported to the Prime Minister but he was out of the country.Mr, Profumo said that he had been in continuous touch withthe Law Officers during the past week and that he was also beingadvised by his own solicitors.     I have seen both the Law Officersand they have told me that from their first meeting withMr. Profumo until the date of his resignation, Mr. Profumo had consistently and firmly asserted that there had been only aninnocent association &quot;between him and Miss Keeler and that therewas no truth in the allegations of an improper association.Mr. Profumo also said that pressure was &quot;being put &quot;by him onthe newspaper concerned not to publish &quot;smear&quot; articles.-1 0-TOP SECRET
TOE8 SECRETMr, Profumo suggested that the Principal Private Secretaryneed not bother the Prime Minister at this stage.   He was told that he should see the Chief Whip without delay.    This was arranged for Monday the hth February,Mr, Profumo did not reveal that he had seen the Head ofthe Security Service on the 28th January,33*   On Monday, hth February, Mr, Profumo saw the Chief Whip,He said the events referred to had all taken place between july and December 1961,   He gave an account of how he had metMiss Keeler,   He said there had been a letter which started&quot;My Darling&quot; - in fact it started &quot;Darling&quot; - but that it hadbeen quite harmless.   He admitted giving her a small present,a cigarette lighter.   He said his lawyers had seen Miss Keeleron the Saturday, 2nd February, when she had stated that themoney the newspapers were offering her for her story was not enough and she wanted more,Mr, Profumo said that his lawyers had advised him to do nothing but to wait and see what if anything was published.   Ifthis was libellous he could then issue a writ,Mr, Profumo asserted throughout this interview that hehad done nothing improper with Miss Keeler,   He asked whether he should resign on account of the rumours about him.   TheChief Whip said that if they were true, of course he shouldresign, but if untrue it would be a great mistake.The Chief Whip reported this to the Prime Minister that evening.3h*   I have seen a report to a Divisional Detective Superintendentof the Metropolitan Police dated the 5th February, 1963.   Thisreport inter alia states that when seen by Sgt. Burrows of theMetropolitan&quot;Police on the 26th January, 1963 for the purpose of serving upon her notice to attend the trial at the CentralCriminal Court, Miss Keeler stated that -&quot;on one occasion when she was going to meet mr, Profumo, Ward had asked her to discover from him thedate on Y/hich certain atomic secrets were to be handed to west Germany by the Americans;    that this was at the timeof the Cuban crisis,&quot;This information was given to the Security Service on the7th February,35.    I have also seen a report dated the 30th January, 1963from an Inspector of the Special Branch of the MetropolitanPolice.    It stated that information had been received that&quot;only a month or so ago, Miss Keeler had said, she was asked byMr. Ward to obtain If possible certain secret information fromMr. ProfunC) regarding the transfer of documents from america to Western Germany,&quot;The reference to &quot;documents&quot; would appear to,,have been anerror and it would seem should have been to uombs .This report was received by the Security Service on the7th February.36.   On the 25th March, 1963 the Security Service received information that a Miss Paula Marshall whose address was given as 38, Devonshire Street, London, (the address of Mr. Ward*sconsulting Rooms) had been told by Miss Keeler that Mr. Wardhad asked her to ask Mr. Profumo, in the course of one of theirsocial meetings when exactly the Germans were likely to get&quot;the bomb&quot; 1 that Mr. Ward had told Miss Keeler that he wanted the information for Capt. Ivanov and that when Miss Keelerdeclined the suggestion, Mr. Ward said &quot;she was a very foolishgirl&quot;. --M-
37.   In a statement made to the police on the 1+th April, 1963,Miss Keeler said &quot;Ward has asked me to get information from Jack about the Americans giving the Germans the bomb.     I did not get this information because it was ridiculous and could have been made in a joke.&quot;38.   The Security Service did not inform any Minister of theinformation they had received set out in paragraphs 3h and 35hereof at this time.   Bearing in mind the fact that they were sent for to Admiralty House to be told the information set outin paragraph 30 on the 1st February. I must express my opinionthat in failing to communicate the information received by them on the 7th February, to a Minister or to one of thePrime Minister&apos;s Secretaries, they committed an error of judgment.39.    On the 27th March, 1963, the Home Secretary, who had not previously been connected v/ith any part of this case, asked the Head of the Security Service to come to see him in orderto put him in the picture.     The Head of the Security Servicegave the Home Secretary a resume and said that the security service&apos;s interest in the matter was in the association between mr. Profumo and Capt. Ivanov and that when following the arrest of Bdgecombe Capt. Ivanov had left the country, their interest had ceased.He also told the Home Secretary of statements that Wardhad urged Miss Keeler to ask Mr. Profumo for information aboutAmerican intentions to provide the West Germans with the bombbut said that they thought that the witnesses in any prosecutionin relation to this would prove unreliable and that they werenot inclined to pursue the matter.He expressed the view that the Security Service interestin the whole case was limited to Capt. Ivanov and hiscontacts and that it was no part of their business to concern themselves with what Ward was up to in connection with thegirls with whom he associated.The Home Secretary was under the mistaken impression thatthis information was already known to those dealing with theProfumo case and that was why he took no personal action on it.In fact it is clear that those then dealing with theProfumo case were not aware of this.1+0.    It will be noted that in the statement made on the26th January referred to in paragraph 3k Miss Keeler statesthat the request was made when she was going to meet Mr. Profumoat the time of the Cuban crisis (i.e. the autumn of 1962) andthat in the statement in the report dated the 30th January, 1963referred to in paragraph 35 she is stated to have said that therequest was made &quot;only a month or so ago&quot;.If these&apos; statements are true, then both Mr. Profumo&apos;sstatement in the House of Commons on the 22nd March, 1963 andhis statement to me as to the date of termination of hisassociation with Miss Keeler are false.1+1.    I have questioned Mr, Profumo on whether he was everasked any such question by Miss Keeler.     He is positive thatat no time did Miss Keeler or Capt, Ivanov or Mr. Ward ask him any such question,-1 2-
1+2.    On the 22nd March Mr. Profumo made his statement in the House of Commons.1+3.    On the 26th March Colonel Wigg, M.P. received at theHouse of Commons a telephone message asking him to tele-phone Mr. Ward.     He did so.      Mr. Ward told him that three of Colonel Wigg&apos;s statements made on televisionon the night before about Capt. Ivanov were incorrect.He said Capt. Ivanov did not drive a sports car, wearSavile Row suits or visit night spots.     Asked what his interest was, Mr. Ward, replied that Capt. Ivanov was a friend of his and was not here to defend himself.Mr. Ward agreed to come to the House of Commons to seeColonel Wigg and did so that evening.Mr. Ward asserted to Colonel Wigg that on at least two occasions his friendship with,Capt. Ivanov had been used in the interests of this country.     The first occasion was at the time of the Berlin crisis.Capt. Ivanov had used him to inform Sir Harold Caccia andother senior Foreign Office people that the Soviet union were prepared to adopt a conciliatory attitude over Berlinin return for Western guarantees of the Oder-Neisse line.When asked, whether he had conveyed the informationpersonally, he hedged and asserted, that many importantpeople in the Conservative Party including M.P.&apos;s hadbeen involved in these matters..The second occasion was, he said, over Cuba.Capt. Ivanov, Mr, V/ard said, on the Friday,27th October, 1962 had asked him to pass on the view ofthe Russian Government that the British Government shouldtake the initiative in summoning a conference in London,This information Mr, Ward said was conveyed personally to Lord Home and the Prime Minister.      Mr, Ward would not say that he had given the information personally but saidthat very important people were involved.hi)..    These statements by Mr. Ward clearly refer to thematters dealt with in paragraphs 1k to 20 above.      I can find no indication that any M.P. other thanSir Godfrey Nicholson was involved in these approaches.1+5.    At the same interview with Colonel Wigg Mr. Wardstated that as far as he knew nothing improper took place between Mr. Profumo and Miss Keeler.     He said that the intelligence Service knew all about Mr. Profumo&apos;s visits,that he had kept records and had supplied the intelligence service with full particulars of the visits.According to reports I have seen in the Press,Mr. Ward has repeatedly asserted that he informed. M.I.5of Mr. Profumo&apos;s visits to Miss Keeler.-13-
I have seen every report of every conversation which took place &quot;between Mr. Ward and members of theSecurity Service.     Mr, Ward did not on any occasionmention Mr. Profumo&apos;s association with Miss Keeler.He did not report Mr. Profumo&apos;s visits nor did he supplyanyone in the Security Service with full, or indeed, anydetails of them.I am satisfied that these statements made byMr. Ward are not true.     I do not propose to speculateon Mr. Ward&apos;s motives in giving the widest publicity toa story which is patently false.U6.    Mr. Ward told Colonel Wigg that he had made consider-able efforts to suppress publication in a newspaper of miss Christine Keeler&apos;s &quot;story&quot; and that he did a dealwhich involved publication of his story and the suppression of her story and for which he received nothing exceptcertain legal costs.     He alleged that Miss Christine Keelerhad received payment for her story and he complained thatMiss Christine Keeler and. another person had got consider-able sums from the Press which should rightfully be his.hfl,    Colonel Wigg gave a full account of his conversationof 26th March with Mr. Ward to Mr, Harold Wilson who on the9th April, 1963 sent a copy to tfcha Prime Minister,U8.    The copy was sent to the Security Service and. ina letter dated the 25th April -to the Prime Minister&apos;principal Private Secretary, the Security Service, havingreferred to the warning given to Mr. Profumo in 1961,stated &quot;there is no truth in the story that the security service was informed of the, dates or of anything elsein connection with Mr. Profumo&apos;s alleged visits to Wardor Miss Keeler&quot;.-lh-
k9c    On the 7th May, 1963 Mr. Ward telephoned thePrime Minister&apos;s Principal Private Secretary and asked to0ce hinu     Ho saw him at 9 o&apos;clock that evening.     ThePrime Minister had boon informed enffl agreed to the mooting,subject to a member of the Security Service being present.Mr. Ward complained that enquiries the police were making of his patients and others were ruining his practice, thathis only hope of redress was to bring a libel action andto call Mr. Profumo and Lord Astor as witnesses.     He saidthat the attachment between Mr. Profumo and Miss Christine Keelewas deeper than had been represented, but apart from this statement he produced no facts or evidence In support ofthis allegation.     He asserted that he had made a considerablesacrifice for Mr. Profumo, &quot;the biggest sacrifice he had made in his life&quot;, in that in exchange for an article written by Miss Keeler and for.a letter, he had written or allowedan article to be written under his own name and published.He asked ^whether there-was any action which could be takenby the &apos;&amp;mf^ to clear his name and so allow him to drop hislibel-action.       Ho was told there was not,.50.     On the 19th May, 1963* Mr. Ward wrote a letter to theHome Secretary.     In view of the publicity that has been directed to this letter, I think I had better state its contentsIt ran as follows&quot;Dear Sir,It has come to my attention that theMarylebone Police are questioning my patients andfriends in a line however tactful which is extremely damaging to me both professionally andsocially.     This enquiry has been going on day after day for weeks.The instructions to do this must have comefrom the Home Office.Over the past few weeks I have done what i could to shield Mr. Profumo from his indiscre-tion about which I complained to the security services at the time.When he made a statement in Parliament Ibacked it up although I knew it to be untrue.Possibly my efforts to conceal his part and to return to&quot;him a letter which Miss Keelerhad sold to the Sunday Pictorial might make it appear that I had something to conceal myself.I have not.The allegations which appear to be the causeof the investigation and which I only know throughthe line of questioning repeated to me aremalicious and entirely false.     It is an inventionof the Press that Miss Keeler knew a lot ofimportant people.It was by accident that she met Mr. Profumoand through Lord Astor that she met him again.I intend to take the blame no longer.
TOP SECRETThat I was against this liaison is amatter of record in the Home Office.Sir Godfrey Nicholson, who has been a friend for twenty-five years, is in possessionof most of the facts since I consulted him atan early stage.May I ask that the person who has lodgedthe false information against me should be prosecuted.Yours sincerely,STEPHEN WARD &quot;51*   In fact no complaint and no information by Mr. Ward about Mr. Profumo&apos;s relationship with Miss Christine Keeler wasever received by the Security Service or the War Office.     Itwill be seen that although Mr. Ward referred to Mr. Profumo&apos;s&quot;indiscretion&quot; and &quot;liaison&quot; and to his efforts to concealMr. Profumo&apos;s part, he did not in this letter state any facts in support of his allegations.52.   On the 20th May a letter was sent to him from the HomeOffice telling him that the police, in making whateverenquiries they thought proper, do not act under the HomeSecretary&apos;s direction.53*   The same day, the 20th May, Mr. Ward wrote letters toSir Wavell Wakefield, M.P. and to Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P.His letter to Sir Wavell Wakefield was substantially to thesame effect as that which he had written to the HomeSecretary.     He complained of the police enquiries.     He saidthat a Minister had not told the truth in Parliament, butagain he did not give any grounds for that statement,,     Hesaid he was not present vii en Mr. Profumo met .Miss Christine Keeler except on the weekend of the 7th July,1961 and he asked that those who had given false and maliciousinformation about him should be prosecuted.     He ended his letter by saying &quot;I will not endure this persecution any longer.     I intend further to make a statement to the Pressabout this at a later date.&quot;     His letter toMr. Harold Wilson, M.P. was substantially to the same effect.5h.   After Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P. had seen the Prime minister on the 27th May, the Security Service were asked to advise thePrime Minister as to the position.     They reported to him byletter dated the 29th May, 1963 and in this letter they statedthat Miss Keeler had said that on one occasion Mr....Ward had asked her to discover the date on which certain atomic secretswere to be handed to West Germany by the Americans and thatit was understood that Miss Keeler denied having ever put sucha question to Mr. Profumo.This was the first occasion on which the Prime minister was notified of this.55.   On 30th May, 1963. you asked me to undertake thisinvestigation.56.    I have now stated what appear to me to be the relevant facts in relation to this matter.     There is one.minor matter which for the sake of completeness I should mention.Mr. Hugh Eraser, M.P., at one time was preparing to take acottage on the Cliveden estate.     About four years ago, whenhe was having tea at Cliveden he met Mr. Ward.     He also methim in March 1962, at lunch at Cliveden.     So ,far as he canrecollect the conversation was entirely general.     He nevervisited Mr. Ward&apos;s cottage at Cliveden and, apart from saying&quot;hello&quot; to him on one occasion on the river bank, had noother conversation with him.-16-
57*   I have not sought to interview those who were treated by Mr. Ward as an osteopath or those who sat to be drawn byhim, either for publication in the Illustrated London Newsor for commissioned drawings. Ministers, M.P&apos;s and civilservants have of course always to be on their guard and itwould appear most improbable that any of those who sat for him or were treated by him would,have disclosed to him any-thing which should have been kept secret.I have not in the course of my enquiries found anything which points to the communication to Mr. Ward or toCapt. Ivanov of any matter which should not have been disclosed.58*   I heard a report that it was being said that theinstitution of criminal proceedings against Mr. Ward wasbeing delayed at the instance of the Government.    I have thought it right to make enquiries about this though it seemed to me inconceivable that there could be any substance in this suggestion.    I have seen the Director of public prosecutions and the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police andthey have assured me that such delay as has occurred has been due to the need to complete their enquiries and to considerthe case.   They have both assured me that no attempt has beenmade by anyone to delay the institution of proceedings.59. The only evidence that I have seen of any attempt to useMiss Christine Keeler for the purpose of securing information is that set out in paragraphi58^3  &amp; 57.SC.   As you know, Sir Godfrey Nicholson is my wife&apos;s brother-in-law.   Despite the embarrassment I have questioned himsearchingly upon these matters.    I am satisfied that in&apos;seeking to communicate and in communicating to Capt. Ivanovinformation approved by the Foreign Office, he was inspired by the hope that his actions might help to alleviate thesituation.6l*    I have made as thorough an investigation as I can of allthe matters which appear to me relevant from the securityangle.    I have not seen Miss Christine Keeler nor have I seen mr. Ward but I have read the statements they have made.I do not think that any further investigation of whattook place between Capt. Ivanov&apos;s arrival in this country on the27th March, i960, and his departure on the 29th January, 1963?would serve any useful purpose nor do I consider that an oralexamination of either Mr. Ward or Miss Christine Keeler would throw any further light on the security question.It is for these reasons that I myself feel that nofurther enquiry is necessary or could be useful from thesecurity angle.D.House of Lords, S.W.1.33th June, I963.t17-
House of Lords,S.W.1.PRIME MINISTERSince I made my report to you on the Ward case, I havereceived information that on Sunday the following will hepublished in the News of the World as a statement byMiss Keeler:-&quot;Stephen Ward asked me to find out from JackProfumo when Germany was going to be armed withatomic weapons.     He told me he wanted to tell Ivanov,He asked me this back in 1961,     I didn&apos;t quitecotton on to what this was all about and I said toStephen:  &apos;What gives?     How can I ask him a thinglike that?&apos; \He said &apos;Don&apos;t you worry my little darling.Just do as I ask you.     There is a lot of money in this!&apos;I didn&apos;t answer him,     I didn&apos;t know how tograsp   what he wanted.     I knew instinctively,and deep down, that this was spying.But I also knew that even if I was capable,which I wasn&apos;t&apos;t, I couldn&apos;t&apos;t do it.     Jack and Iwere just not that way.     He never talked to meabout business or affairs of State, as I suppose the correct term is.I made up my mind that I would never ask him.And I never did.     And I never told Ivanov whatStephen had asked me to do,&quot;This statement conflicts with her statements as recorded in paragraphs 3k and 35 of my first report as to the timewhen this request was made to her by Mr. Ward.2.    .1 have seen a report from the Buckinghamshire policedated the 2kth March, 1963. which was passed to the security service,     This report states that Miss Keeler&apos;s mother and her step-father called at Colnbrook Police Station on the evening of Saturday, 23rd March, 1963, and that they statedthat a Mr. Eddowes had called on them earlier that evening and had told them that the tale she (Miss Keeler) must tellconcerning her knowledge of Mr. Profumo and Captain Ivanovwas that she was deeply in love with Ivanov and that sheobtained information from Mr. Profumo v/hich she passed onto Ivanov only as a jokej    and also that it was essentialthat Miss Keeler. stuck to this account as this story wouldprotect her at any future enquiry and that by sticking toit she would get, anything between  5,000 and , 10,000.They said that Mr. Eddowes did not in fact feaoffi where this money was coming from, but they assumed that the national press were concerned.     On the 23rd March, Miss Keeler wasnot in this country.     It is not clear to me what partMr. Eddowes was playing in this matter, but having regardto the fact.that he was saying what statements Miss Keelershould make, I do not think it possible to place anyreliance on any statements that he, Mr, Eddowes, makes about what Miss Keeler may or may not have said to him.

3. I have now received from the Police a copy of the statement made by Mr. Eddowes which was received by the Police on the 29th March, 1963. I understand the Police told Mr. Eddowes that his statement would be passed to the proper authorities.

4. The statement said that after the shooting incident on the 14th December, 1962, Miss Keeler told Mr. Eddowes that she often met Capt. Ivanov at Dr. Ward&apos;s flat and that she also met there Mr. Profumo. She said they visited her there fairly regularly.

Also she said that Capt. Ivanov had asked her to obtain from Mr. Profumo the date of delivery of nuclear warheads to Western Germany. She said she had not obtained this information. When asked if she had passed any other information to Capt. Ivanov which she obtained from Mr. Profumo, she said "Nothing important really" and went on to say that Mr. Profumo had told her that we nearly had a nuclear explosion in England when a rat had nearly gnawed through a cable.

Mr. Eddowes says he told her she was behaving in a dangerous way and that if she did not stop her association with Mr. Profumo and Capt. Ivanov she would land herself in gaol on a charge of treason, and that then Miss Keeler said she did not think she would be seeing Mr. Profumo again.
