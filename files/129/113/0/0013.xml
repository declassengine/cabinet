THE LOCA^L EMPLOYMENT ACT AND. THE NORTH-east the Lord President urges that it is essential for a proper plan for the North East that the benefits of the Local Employment Actshould be extended to the relatively prosperous and promising areasaround Newcastle and Durham.    I have said I would consider whetherthis could be done consistently with the policy embodied in the Act.We cannot deal with the North East in isolation, but must recognise the implications for the country as a whole of any action that we takethere.    Moreover, the real question at issue is not one of legal powers, but of the policy which the Act expresses.Scope and purpose of the Local Employment Act2.     My colleagues will remember that in 1959 and I960 v/e madea clean break with the past.    The last Act of 1958, was a makeshifteffort to break out of the thraldom of the old concept.    At that time we repealed the whole corpus of the Distribution of Industry Acts of1945 to 1958, based as they were on the concept of the development area, marked out by statute for special treatment.    We substitutedinstead the concept of the flexible, administratively determined listof small development districts covering only about 10-12 per cent ofthe total number of insured employees in the country.    As the coverage of the Development Areas had been about 20 per cent thenew policy represented a deliberate concentration of effort to dealwith local unemployment by encouraging the growth of new industryin or near black spots of high unemployment, rather than by encouraging the transfer of workers from these localities to places of fuller employment.3.     Our experience under the earlier legislation had shown thatin practice concentration of effort was needed.    It had provedpolitically impossible to d.j-schedule development areas, yet thesewide areas included many prosperous localities.    It became necessaryto exclude these, by administrative action, from the financialbenefits.    The object of the I960 Act was to make overt thediscrimination that in practice we exercised, so far as was possible,under the previous legislation, in favour of the areas of highestunemployment.    It is an essential feature of the new policy that thedevelopment districts shall be limited in number and in size in orderto concentrate effort on the really difficult places and to prevent thetotal cost of financial assistance from becoming excessive.COPY NO.18th April, 1963CABINET-1-
4.      The Act defines a development district as a locality in which,in the opinion of the Board of Trade, the rate of unemployment, actual or prospective, is both high and persistent.   (&quot;High&quot; was clearly intendedto be a relative term, i. e. high in comparison with the national average. )In determining what is to be treated as a locality for the purposes ofthe Act, the Board of Trade are not bound to adopt any particularformula provided the one used is objective and applied uniformly overthe country as a whole.    In practice, to enable effect to be given tothe announced policy of concentrating assistance on the places withthe worst unemployment, the formula adopted was the employment exchange area or, where there is a well developed pattern of dailytravel to work covering more than one such area, the group of exchangeareas.    These are the smallest units of living and working communities in respect of which the Ministry of Labour publish monthly figtires andpercentage rates of unemployment.    These units make up the pattern of employment (and therefore of unemployment) throughout the country as a whole.I:V5.     It has been argued that the diagnosis of unemployment on whichthe Act was based was faulty, and that, as the problem has not proved to be one of dealing with a relatively few isolated pockets ofunemployment the Act is now inappropriate.    I think that any errorsin the diagnosis were in the assumptions about the economy as a whole.We all thought that the labour shortage in the country as a whole fromwhich we had suffered since the war was bound to continue.    We had tried many times, in our general economic policies, to cause a shakeoutof labour but had never achieved it.    Specifically, we did not allowenough for the effects on employment of our attempts to get the nationalised industries to pay their way;  nor for the beginnings of technological unemployment.     But none of these developments hasaffected the conclusion we reached that there would be wide disparitiesbetween unemployment in various places, and that concentration of effort would be needed.Steering industry.      The amount of industry which can be steered to the moredifficult parts of the country is always limited.    The amount variesaccording to whether the economy is buoyant or not and whether firms are seeking expansion.    The general measures which the chancellor has taken to stimulate the economy, and to a lesser extent the regionaltax concessions and the proposed new benefits under the Act, should be helpful.   But it must be recognised that if firms have a choice betweenrelatively attractive areas and relatively less attractive areas they will always choose the former.    Therefore, if it is our objective to help the places with the most serious unemployment, the regional benefits must continue to cover only a small part of the total insured population.Our aim hitherto has been to keep the coverage at about 10-12 per cent.Indeed such a percentage was specified in one of the early drafts of theI960 Bill.    Currently the percentage is 13 per cent.   If the coverage iswidened appreciably beyond this the chances of helping the worst areasmust be much diminished.

The places in which, as I understand, the Lord President is most interested are T-am Valley (in the Gateshead group) andKillingworth (in the Tyne North West group).    On any basis Tyne NorthWest would not qualify even on the March figures as they stand.    Butin considering the case for scheduling a district I must look at morethan a single month&apos;s figures.    It is quite clear from the comparisonsin the first column that neither on average, nor individually, does anyof these three groups qualify.9.      I must emphasise that the figures alone are an insufficient guide.If I schedule a district I must be satisfied that unemployment will persist.    Comparison with Tees-side to which the Lord President hasreferred shows how different the situation was there, when Ischeduled it, from the situation on Tyneside today.    Tees-side hadan average annual rate of 4. 4 per cent in 1962 and a rate of 6. 5 per centin March, 1963.    Of the jobs nominally in prospect, more than halfdepended on a Furness shipbuilding project and this firm had recentlydeclared 700 redundancies.    200 more redundancies were expected from Head Wrightson, and I. C. I. had told us that they expected their employment to fall by 2, 000 over the next few years.    By contrast7.      It is against this background that I must consider the case forscheduling Tyneside and Durham.    In E. A. (63) 54 the Lord Presidenthas compared the figure of wholly unemployed in Tyneside in March(5.1 per cent) with the figure (4. 5 per cent) which has in the past been used by the Board of Trade when considering a district forscheduling.    The figure of 4. 5 per cent has no significance in presentcircumstances.   It never was a fixed yardstick, and it was devised ata time when the national level of the wholly unemployed was lessthan 2 per cent.    Our objective is to keep the coverage of development districts at about 12 per cent or less;  obviously some higher figurethan 4. 5 per cent must be used when the national average of the whollyunemployed is nearly 3 per cent.    The following table compares thefigures for the three Tyneside areas covered by the Lord Presidentsproposals with the level of unemployment in the development districts and in the country as a whole. Vl;Wholly unemployed: per cent^annual^ayer age; March 1963
the only prospective redundancies on Tyneside of which we are awareare about 200 in coalmining, while there are nearly 3, 000 jobs in prospect, of which 1, 200 are in Gateshead.    Nearly a quarter of theunemployed are construction workers who are expected to bereabsorbed easily.10.    Since I listed Tees-side the position there has worsened becauseDorman Long have announced the closure of their Acklan works,involving about 1,600 redundancies.    To list Tyneside or Durhammust prejudice the chances of improving the situation on Tees-side.Consequences of scheduling^Tyjneside^11,     I am under constant pressure to schedule more development districts.    The pressure will naturally be more intense now thatthe new free depreciation arrangements are tied to development districts.    If I were to schedule Tyneside I should certainly have toconsider many claims of equal merit from other parts of the country.It is impossible to say what other areas would have comparable claimswithout considering the figures for all the employment exchange areasin the country, and also looking at the prospects in each case.    Eutsome obvious examples are Barrow and Whitehaven (which, however,in my view qualify for listing on their merits) Blackpool, Fleetwood,St. Helen&apos;s, Falkirk, Ayr, Skegness, Sheerness, Thanet, Wrexham andSwansea.    Mersey side, which caused my colleagues so muchhesitation had, of course, a far higher rate of unemployment than anything in question here.12.    If I were to go further and schedule Durham the consequences would be still more far-reaching.   I should have for example to considerthe whole County of Cornwall together with Plymouth, and such places as Wigan and other cotton belt towns.    In Scotland, I should have toconsider Edinburgh and other intermediate towns such as Stirlingand Kilmarnock.    In South Wales, for example, I should have toconsider Cardiff and Aberdare, and in North Wales, Llandudno andColwyn Bay.    As a result of all this, the coverage of development districts would probably represent 25 per cent or more of the insured population.    Apart from other considerations, this would involve avery large increase in Government expenditure, given the levels ofthe proposed new standard benefits and free depreciation.    given that industry in many of the places added to the list would in any case be relatively prosperous and expanding, the increase in expenditure would be more than proportionate to that now contemplated for theexisting Development District.SS^cljasion^13.    My conclusion is that I could not, consistently with our present policies, schedule Tyneside and Durham.    I fully recognise that weshall need to reconsider our policy when the results of the variousregional studies are available.    These will, of course, cover a wide number of questions, of which the provision of industry will be only one.    If we decide, in the light of these studies, to make financial
inducements available on some other basis than a high and persistentlevel of unemployment - we should do so overtly and by legislation.We shall have to face the fact that the cost will be greatly increased and that the places most seriously affected by unemployment will suffer.This might be a sensible course to pursue on economic grounds, butit would be a hard course politically.14.    My own belief is that it will not be thought right to revert to the old and unsuccessful policy of scheduling large areas of thecountry, and that if there is a change it will be in the direction ofdesignating a few carefully selected places as growth points, to be built up to an agreed level of population and provided with theappropriate amount of industry.    Even this will of course divertindustry from the more difficult places but it may be right to accept this.15. But I do not prejudge these questions. Indeed, I do not think we can take a view until we are in a position to discuss our regional policies as a whole.16.    Meanwhile it would be wrong to tinker with the list ofdevelopment districts for the benefit of the North East alone, nor could the extensions in other parts of the country, which wouldlogically follow, be accepted without destroying the whole basis ofthe present policy.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.18th April, 1963
