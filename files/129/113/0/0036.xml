COPY NO.Admiralty House, S. W. 1.20th May, 1963C. (63) 8620th May, 1963l\CABINETSOUTHERN RHODESIANote by the Prime minister circulate for the information of the Cabinet copies of exchanges of letters about Southern Rhodesia which I have recently had with president Nyerere of Tanganyika and Sir Milton Margai, Prime Ministerof Sierra Leone.    A letter on similar lines has just reached me fromthe Prime Minister of Uganda.H.M.
The following is the text of Dr. Nyerere&apos;s letter of 4th april to the prime Minister.Dear Mr. Macrnillan,Yesterday I had the opportunity to talk with your High commissioner in Dar es Salaam, and I explained to him our attitude on certain matters affecting the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    As you will realise,we feel very concerned about events in the countries to the South of us;quite apart from the sentiment of African Unity, the complete absence of natural boundaries between African States and the historical interchange of populations means that Tanganyika is vitally concerned in developmentsthere.    I have therefore decided to write directly to you in addition to the   report which you will be receiving from Sir Neil.First, I would like to say how pleasedwe are that your Governmenthas conceded to Northern Rhodesia the right to opt out of the Federation.I think you know that I myself am very much in favour of building closeeconomic and political ties between all African States, so that my pleasuredoes not come from opposition in principle to the idea of Federation.   ButI am convinced that African Unity -  of any kind -. - can only bring happinessand prosperity to the people of this continent when it is based on the will of the people directly concerned.    The Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland did not start with this support, and unfortunately it has never been able to win it.    Therefore I believe that the power to dissolve thisFederation is a necessary precondition to the establishment of viablelinks between those countries, and between any or all of them and the restof Africa.    In other words I look upon this decision as the precursor of a real march forward in the direction of economic, and possibly political,unity in East and Central Africa.There is, however, one further step in relation to Northern Rhodesiawhich is necessary before we shall be able to make much progress.    Thatis a new constitution.    I am, of course, aware just how recently thepresent constitution has come into operation; but it is so unstable an affairthat all concerned are inevitably looking over their shoulders at the masses,unable to take the political risks - or give the leadership in unpopularmatters - which is necessary for effective government.    I hope that yourMinister for Central Africa will therefore take full advantage of the new situation he has created, and lead discussions designed to bring into existence a Government in Northern P.hodesia which is more firmlybased on pop*alar support.The main purpose of my letter, however, is to explain otir pointof view in relation to the Southern Rhodesian Governments demand for independence for that country.    First I must say that I fully realise howdifficult an issue this is for the British Government.    You face conflictingexternal and internal pressures, and an apparent conflict of principle aswell.    Yet I believe that this matter can be solved in accordance with the declared principles of the existing - and past - British Governments, andin accordance with the consistent practice of Britain over the last seven years of converting an Empire into a Commonwealth./There
There is surely little controversy about the fact that the case forthe independence of Southern Rhodesia is unanswerable.    The people ofthai; country are quite as &quot;ready for independence&apos; as the rest of us -indeed it can with justice be argued that their general level of education is higher than that which exists in Tanganyika.    Economically thecountry is developed;  certainly the national economy is unbalanced incertain directions, but they are considerably better off than countrieslike Somalia, Nyasaland or - again - Tanganyika.    Then too theterritory has enjoyed the status of a self- governing colony for almostforty years.    And finally, it is the declared policy of Britain to prepareall their   dependencies) for self-government,Britian&apos;s policy in this respect, however, has always beenqualified.    It has been independence under conditions which secure forthe people freedom from oppression for any quarter;  indeed, I believethat this was once printed in a Government declaration of policy on colonial freedom.    And certainly, up to now the British Government hasalways gone to great lengths to ensure that at independence the Governmentwas really representative of the people of the country.    In fact we have often criticised Britain for being unrealistic on this issue and insisting on special procedures which give a voice to tiny minority groups.It is hardly necessary for me to enlarge on this point.    The longand difficult negotiations in Kenya have been designed to ensure thatminorities as well as the majority of the people shall have an effectivepart to play in the government of that  country at independence.    Allprogress has been held up while your Government has tried to satisfyitself on this point.    There are many other examples;  in 1956 Britaininsisted that a new election be held in Ghana before independence was granted because a small but vocal minority was claiming that the electedGovernment there was unrepresentative.    This was done despite theopposition of the Gold Coast Government.    In Nigeria independencewas delayed for three years in order to ensure that the people of theNorth were properly represented.    In fact, the only exception to thispolicy which I can think of occurred in 1910, in South Africa.    I donot think any of us feel that this is a precedent which should befollowed.What I am suggesting is therefore that the answer to theSouthern Rhodesian demand should be &apos;Yes, your country can haveindependence on the same conditions as have applied to all other colonial territories. &apos;    This would mean that independence would begranted only to a Government which is represenative of the people.Obviously therefore there would have to be a new constitution and newelections on a democratic basis before independence takes effect.Ideally such elections should be on the basis of universal adult suffrage,but this is not so important as that they give expression to the majorityfeeling in the country.     I am, of course, aware that attempts havebeen made to get more Africans on to the electoral rolls in SouthernRhodesia, and that the nationalist movement there has rejected theoffer.    But we all realise that this was because the purpose of the offer was not to get an expression of the people&apos;s will, only to get a few spokes-men for a selected group of the Africans.    I believe that a new constitu-tion which accepts the necessity for the Government to have the realsupport of the majority of the people would call forth a different reaction from the nationalist leaders./I do
I clo realise that a decision along these lines would cause your government considerable political difficulties.    But I see no alternative,On many occasions you and your Government have stated that youcompletely reject doctrines of negro or African inferiority;  and I accept these as sincere statements of belief.    Yet I am sure you will see theconnotation if the British Government, in this one case, abandoned herconsistent policy, and gave independence to Southern Rhodesia withoutrequiring that the majority of the people (regardless of race) hadconfidence in the authority which would inherit the legal functions of sovereignty.    We in Africa should have difficulty in giving this decisiona non-racial interpretation.There is no doubt that in following the consistent policy you would meet with bitter  opposition from the recently elected Government ofSouthemRhodesia, and from the majority of the White population in thatcountry.    I do not under-estimate this problem, nor the amount of support this group would be able to rally within the United Kingdom itself.But what is the alternative?    And who else can take this decision?    Thelegal sovereignty over Southern Rhodesia rests in the hands of theUnited Kingdom Government.    Certainly, we in Africa have claimed thatit ought to belong to the people of Southern Rhodesia, but neithe r of us have ever suggested that it belongs to the present Government of theColony of SouthemRhodesia!It may be that in reading this letter you feel that I am avoiding themain issue, and that this is the possibility that the Government of SouthernRhodesia will take the law into its own hands and declare itself independent;if you try to follow the normal procedure.    I agree that this is a risk.But this is Africa, in the year 1963;  there is an equal possibility that ifyou do not act in a manner similar to previous occasions there will bean outbreak of lawlessness from the other side - from the Africans.   not because it will be organised by the nationalist movement but simply because the people will feel that their last hope of justice has gone andtherefore give way to a spontaneous destructive urge.This problem of violence presents a real dilemma to Britain.    Butagain I refer to past policies of your Government.    You suppressed MauMau, saying that it was not a nationalist revolt, but an attempt by a minority to impose their will by force.    You fought against the uprisingin Malaya on the same grounds.    Afterwards in both cases you introducedsystems of elected governments, representative of the people.    Surelytherefore, it is not possible for the British Government now to give wayto the threat of force from an acknowledged minority, however well armedthat minority may be ?Mr. Prime Minister, this is a very long letter, but it has seemedto me that the interests of Britain and Tanganyika do not conflict at any point on this question of the future of Southern Rhodesia.    My purposehas thus been twofold;  firstly to make clear the attitude of Tanganyika,and secondly to analyse the problem which faces your Government.   Ivery much hope that you will consider these points in the same friendlyspirit in which they are made to you.In conclusion may I take this opportunity of sending my warmpersonal greetings to you.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)  J. K. NYERERE
The following is the text of the Prime Minister&apos;s letterof 7th May to Dr. Nyerer&apos;s letter of 4th April.Dear President,Thank you for your letter of 4th April about the BritishGovernmenfs policy in Central Africa.    I know that developmentsthere are of importance to Tanganyika, and it is most valuable tous to have such a frank and full expression of your views.    It isalso heartening to know that you appreciate the problem facing us.I know you, like us, attach importance to the preservation of the economic benefits of the Federation of Rhodesia anc^Nyasaland.It was thus with reluctance that we felt obliged to recognise theright of the constituent territories tOi secede from the Federationbefore there had been a conference to decide on a new relationshipacceptable to the territories themselves.    But during the talks inLondon at the end of March it became clear that, unless this was done, there could be little hope of progress.I note what you say about the Northern Rhodesia Constitution.The First Secretary of State had a talk about this with northern rhodesia elected Ministers when they were in London, and it wasagreed to hold further discussions later in the year.    I think theNorthern Rhodesian Ministers accepted that we could not do every-thing at once and that the most pressing issue was the question of future relationships between the territories, which is causing so muchuncertainty in the area.Southern Rhodesia is altogether a different matter.    We hadhigh hopes that the Africans would take full advantage of the outlet for their legitimate political aspirations provided under the 1961Constitution, (in your comment upon this I fear you do my government an injustice), and that through the normal democratic processesSouthern Rhodesia would be travelling the road along which so manyEritish colonial territories have travelled.    It would have takenlonger, of course, because the adjustments in racial and socialrelationships would have been more difficvilt to make.    Accordingto our calculations the Africans with at least 15 seats in thelegislature would have been in a position of considerable influence,because the participation of a large number of Africans in the cross-voting system in the elections would have done much to even thebalance between the two main parties.    Thus, either Sir EdgarWhitehead or Mr. Winston Field would have had to reply on Africansupport for their majority in the legislature.    I regret that the african leaders did not make use of this opportunity.    The Europeans,not unnaturally perhaps, take the view that the Africans missed theirchance.    Although the present Southern Rhodesian Government havepledged themselves not to introduce constitutional changes beforethe next elections, there can be no changes in the franchise detrimental to the Africans because of the safeguards in the Constitution.    At theleast therefore they will have another chance at the next elections,/What
What is important meanwhile is that the African leaders shouldnot feel themselves driven to extreme courses, which could only havethe effect of widening the gap between the races and encouraging the europeans to adopt a more inflexible position.I believe it is your instinct that a &quot;Government-in-Exile&quot; shouldnot be set up in Tanganyika.    Such a move could, I believe, do no realgood, and indeed it might damage irreparably any chance of reconcilia-tion.    The immediate need is for both sides to abandon their extremepositions and start thinking in terms of a compromise solution.    Suchan attitude could in itself create increasingly stable conditions in theterritory.    This would in turn have an important effect on the economic prosperity on which the progressive enfranchisement of the Africandepends.    In the end, as I am sure you will agree, the solution to theproblem of Southern 3:lhodesia lies with the people themselves and inthe ability of the two sides toget together.    Unless they do so therewill be permanent deadlock, because the present Government in southern Rhodesia have all the physical means to contain the situation for some time.    I know you have been working behind the scenes to persuade Mr. Nkomo to make some contact with Mr. Field,    We wouldhave been glad to have enabled them to meet, when they were both inLondon recently, but as you know Mr. Nkomo refused.    We will con-tinue to use such influence as we have to try to help matters and I am confident that you will do likewise, but neither of us is in a positionto enforce our will.I now come to the independence issue.    You have referred tosome of the conflicting difficulties which beset the British government over this controversial question.    The immediate problem is that theSouthern Rhodesia Government have declared that they will not take part in talks on a future relationship between the territories or (v/with the Federal Government) co-operate in the complicated task of dis-solving the Federation, unless they have satisfactory assurance onindependence.    I understand our High Commissioner has given you the text of the British Governments reply of 9th April.     .The SouthernRhodesia Governments reactions have been received and the correspondence is continuing.While I would not dispute in general terms the arguments youput forward linking the grant of independence with representative government, the parallels you draw v/ith Kenya, Malaya, Nigeria andGhana are not wholly relevant in as far as, in these instances, theBritish Government was the administering aiithority and could insist upon, or take steps to ensure, that acceptable conditions obtained before independence was granted.    In Southern Rhodesia the realities of power do not lie with the British Government.In considering this question and indeed the British Government&apos;relations generally with the Southern Rhodesia Government, we are much concerned to try to avoid taking any steps which would effectivelydrive Southern Rhodesia into the orbit of the Republic of South Africa.This is the grave risk involved in attaching to independence terms which the Southern Rhodesia Government might consider whollyunacceptable.    It is also a factor which critics of the British Government,particularly at the United Nations, seem to ignore in demanding that pressure should be bought to bear on the Southern Rhodesia Government,/The
The British Government, nevertheless, take the view that anindependence conference should be held before independence is granted,and at this they would feel free to raise any matter they thought fit.In any decision, they may take I would assure you, Mr. President, thatthey will be guided by what they feel, in all circumstances, is best forthe people of Southern Rhodesia as a whole.With warm regards,Yours sincerely,(Sgd. )    HAROLD MACMILLAN
Text of a letter from Sir Milton Margai to the Prime minister dated 29th April, 1963.My dear Prime Minister,In another two weeks I shall be leaving Sierra Leone toattend an Assembly of Heads of African States and governments in Addis Ababa.    I am quite certain that at this importantConference among the matters which will be discussed will bethe problems  created in Central Africa by the secession of nyasaland, the approaching secession of N: northern Rhodesia andthe demands for independence by the present Government ofSouthern Rhodesia.    As I do not want to say anything at this conference without having first of all communicated my views toyou, I am writing to let you know that I am very much concernedover anything happening in that part of Africa which will do harm to the excellent reputation of Her Majesty&apos;s  Government in theUnited Kingdom for guiding colonial peoples towards full independ-ence with proper safeguards of the rights of all citizens.    I amconcerned that the African people of Southern Rhodesia have up tillnow not had the opportunity of democratic representation in their government.    It would be a pity if any step is taken towardsindepdendence for Southern Rhodesia until constitutional changes have been put into effect which will enlarge the franchise of the african population.I know how much you have the interests of Her Majesty&apos;sterritories in Africa at heart and so I hope that you will not yieldto the heavy pressures which are undoubtedly being put upon you bythe present Government of Southern Rhodesia.    I can assure you that anything you do to grant the African people in SouthernRhodesia their full democratic rights as a majority will be strongly supported by me and by my Government.I want to take this opportunity of sending you my warmpersonal regards and good wishes.Yours sincerely,(Sgd. ) MILTON MARGAIPrime Minister
Following is the text of the Prime Minister&apos;s reply of16th May to Sir Milton Margai&apos;s letter of 29th April.Dear Prime Minister,Thank you for your letter of 29th April about Central Africa.I am very grateful to you for giving me an opportunity to comment on your views before the discussion at the Heads of African StatesMeeting at Addis Ababa.    This is, if I might say so, very much inthe true spirit of Commonwealth co-operation.PresidentNyerere wrote to me on 4th April on this subject and I xmderstand he sent you a copy of his letter.    I have asked our high Commissioner to let you have a copy of my reply, which sets 1out very fully the views of my Government on this question and, inparticular, on Southern Rhodesia which I know is a matter of realconcern to you.For the last forty years Southern Rhodesia has been self-governing and, as I said in my letter to Mr. Nyerere, the realities of power do not lie with the British Government and we are not in aposition to enforce our will.     It would be quite unrealistic for any-one to suppose that the case were otherwise.    Nevertheless, I can say that we will do what we can, given our limited responsibility and influence, to promote the legitimate interests and well-being of allthe people of Southern Rhodesia.    My Government have stated many times publicly and the Southern Rhodesia Government, I am sure,accept that African majority rule must come in Southern PJiodesia,as it has come elsewhere in Africa.    Indeed the 1961 Constitutioncontains within itself the means by which this can be brought about.Nevertheless, in my letter to President Nysrere I felt obliged topoint to some of the difficulties, not least the uncompromisingattitude of the African Nationalist leaders themselves, which farfrom advancing their cause is, I believe, retarding it.    There isa danger, I suggest, in talking in absolute terms and adoptingextreme attitudes, when the need is to take a practical line of approach to a problem in which none of us has the power to enforce a solution.    I am therefore glad to see that you refer simply to anenlargement of the franchise in connection with the independenceissue.    I hope I am not misinterpreting you if I take this to mean that you appreciate that progress towards majority government in southern Rhodesia must be by stages, given the social and racialproblems involved.    Frankly, I do not think it would help matters to take any other view.This is a time for restraint and wise counsel, if the parties concerned are to be aided to seek compromise solutions.    I there-fore hope, Mr. Prime Minister, that, appreciating, as I know youdo, our problems and our aims, you will use your influence at theAddis Ababa meeting to help the chances of a solution in SouthernRhodesia.Yours very sincerely,(Sgd.)      HAROLD MACMILLAN
