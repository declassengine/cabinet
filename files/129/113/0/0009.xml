Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1963C. (63) 59 Copy No.   5229th March, 1963CABINETSOUTH AFRICA AND THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Lord Privy Sealw : VII\\There is reason to believe that South Africa&apos;s relations with the United nations will come under still greater strain this year. Pressure is likely to be exerted uponSouth Africa both over apartheid and over the status of South-West Africa. Mycolleagues may therefore wish to be aware of possible future developments.Apartheid2. At the last General Assembly an extreme resolution was adopted whichrecommended, inter alia, the imposition of total sanctions on trade and arms supplies, and the rupture of diplomatic relations. There can clearly be no questionof our agreeing to the imposition of economic sanctions. It would seriously damage our economic interests and the position of the High Commission Territories. Wemust also take account of our defence arrangements, the Simonstown agreement and air communications: we may need this route to the Gulf and the Far East.My view is that we must continue to resist the application of such sanctions. if my colleagues agree with that, we must be prepared if necessary to use our vetoin the Security Council. But first we can see if it is possible to organise so manyabstentions on an extreme resolution that we should not be put in the exposedposition of using our veto. To that end I would like to consult further with the americans and other friendly countries. Such an operation has a reasonable chance of success, but should it fail I am sure it is better to use the veto than toput ourselves in breach of the Charter by refusing to carry out a MandatoryResolution.South-West africa. The International Court has recently decided that it has jurisdiction ina case in which South Africa is accused of breach of the mandate originally granted by the League of Nations. The Court is likely to give a decision on the meritsearly next year, and if it finds South Africa in breach of the mandate we shall be under strong pressure to support action to enforce the judgment. I have instructedHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cape Town to warn the South African Governmentthat if they flouted an adverse decision by the International Court it would create a new situation; and to leave them in no doubt that they could not rely on us tosupport them in such circumstances. The Americans have already spoken to theSouth Africans in somewhat similar terms. These conversations would not commitus to any particular course of action. It would put us in an extremely awkwardsituation if the Court does bring an adverse decision. It would reinforce thosewho feel strongly about the export of arms and give a new boost to those whofavour sanctions.I will bring a further paper to Cabinet when we know the Courfs judgment.E. H.Foreign Office, S.W.1.28th March, 1963.
