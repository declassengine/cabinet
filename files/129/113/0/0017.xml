INQUIRY INTO THE VASSALL CASE AND RELATED MATTERSREPORT OF THE TRIBUNAL APPOINTED UNDER the tribunals OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT, 1921To: The Right Honourable Henry Brooke, M.P., Principal Secretary ofy&amp;     State for the Home Department.introduction. On the fourteenth day of November, 1962, resolutions were passed in both Houses of Parliament declaring that it was expedient that a tribunalbe established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public import-ance, viz., the circumstances in which offences under the Official secrets acts were committed by William John Christopher Vassall, and inparticular:(1) the allegations made that the presence of another spy inside theAdmiralty was known to the First Lord and his Service chiefsafter the Portland case eighteen months ago ;(2) any other allegations which have been or may be brought to their attention, reflecting similarly on the honour and integrity of personswho, as Ministers, naval officers and civil servants, were concernedin the case;(3) any breaches of security arrangements which took place ; and(4) any neglect of duty by persons directly responsible for VassalFsemployment and conduct, and for his being treated as suitable for employment on secret work.2. In pursuance of those resolutions a warrant was issued on the fifteenthday of November, 1962, over the hand of the Home Secretary, which, afterreciting the terms of the resolutions set out above, proceeded as follows:&quot; Now I, The Right Honourable Henry Brooke, one of Her Majesty&apos;principal Secretaries of State, do hereby appoint The Right HonourableViscount Radcliffe, G.B.E., a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, Sir PatrickRedmond Joseph Barry, M.C., one of Her Majesty&apos;s Judges of the HighCourt of Justice, and Sir Edward Milner Holland, C.B.E., Q.C., to bea Tribunal for the purposes of the said Inquiry.And I further appoint Viscount Radcliffe to be Chairman of thesaid Tribunal.In virtue of Section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,1921, I hereby declare that that Act shall apply to the Tribunal andthat the said Tribunal is constituted as a Tribunal within the meaning of the said Section of the said Act.&quot;3. We have understood these resolutions of the two Houses of Parliamentto amount to a declaration that it was in a high degree in the public interest that an inquiry should be conducted by us for the purpose of eliciting the&apos;true facts and circumstances relevant to the matters set out in our termsof reference ; and that for that purpose we should exercise the powers con-ferred upon us by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as by
summoning before us and examining witnesses, administering oaths, com-pelling the production of documents and requiring such answers to questions as the law might permit. In dealing with such matters in the conduct ofour inquiry we were directed by the Act (see Section 1 (3)) to allow to awitness before us the same immunities and privileges as if he were a witnessbefore the High Court, but we did not regard ourselves as entitled to concede any further immunities and privileges in any case where an answef;to a question appeared to us to be necessary for the furtherance of ourinvestigation.4. Acting under our Warrant and in accordance with the principles setout above we have conducted the inquiry called for by our terms of refer-ence and now present the Report which we have drawn up in order to embody our findings consequent upon that inquiry. In the course of itwe have held numerous meetings, both by way of formal meetings for the taking of evidence and by way of informal meetings for discussion between ourselves. In all we have had 142 witnesses under oral examination beforeus, and in addition to them we have obtained a number of reports, studieda considerable volume of documentary material and heard representations from the Attorney-General on behalf of the public interest and from counselrepresenting a number of interested parties.5. The nature of the matter that we had to inquire into was such thatit appeared to us to be expedient in the public interest that the public shouldnot be allowed to be present at a considerable portion of our proceedings.Much of them involved detailed examination of such subjects as the securityprocedures in force in the Admiralty and in our Embassy at Moscow, our knowledge of Russian attempts to obtain secret information of importanceto the State, despite the protection of those procedures, and our counter-measures for the detection of enemy agents. Accordingly we decided to sit in camera for the purpose of hearing all evidence of this kind and excludedthe public from those hearings. In the result we sat in camera on 16 days and 6 half-days, and in public on 7 days and 7 half-days.6. We are satisfied at the end of pur inquiry that a division of sittingson these lines was unavoidable. An inquiry such as that which we wereto conduct is not like the hearing of an action or a criminal trial. It is not susceptible of being confined within precisely defined limits of relevance laiddown in advance and, if examination and cross-examination are to beuninhibited, there must be freedom to explore possible lines of inquirywithout the embarrassment of continual reference to security considerations.Moreover a large proportion of our Departmental witnesses was called to speak on points of which some were obviously affected by security require-ments and others were very much less directly so affected: yet it wouldhave been impossible in practice to conduct a hearing in a public hallwhich had to be cleared seven or eight times in the course of one day in order to allow what was strictly secret to be heard in camera, and whatwas only questionably so to be heard in public. While therefore we can see, looking back, that we possibly erred too much in the direction ofhearing our evidence behind closed doors, we do not see how at the time,finding our way through the inquiry day by day, we could well have followed any different course.
7. The Act (Section 2 (d)) gave us power to authorise the representationbefore us by counsel or solicitor or otherwise of any person appearing tous to be interested, or to refuse to allow such representation. The word&quot; interested&quot; has not, so far as we know, any precise meaning in this context. We adopted however a construction which covered any person who in the event might be subject to adverse reflection, direct or indirect,f/^m anything said in our Report, and, on application, granted or refusednumber of persons was legally represented when before us, and we set outin the Appendix a list of those persons and of their counsel or solicitors.We did not think it right, when not sitting in public, to admit legal repre-sentatives to attend at our proceedings except when any evidence that wasbeing taken there appeared likely to have a direct bearing on their clients&apos;position.8. We were aware of the danger that in the course of an inquiry underthe Act a person may become the subject of adverse charges or findingswithout having had any fair opportunity of knowing what they were or of meeting them by his own answer or by tendering other evidence. We werenot convinced that such dangers were an inescapable element of an effectiveinquiry, and we made it at any rate our aim to elminate them by soconducting our proceedings as to give persons time for reflection and on occasion, the opportunity of recall and the production of further evidence.9. When we came to consider them we found that our terms of referencerequired of us two main lines of investigation. One was to learn everything that we could about the circumstances in which Mr. William JohnChristopher Vassall (whom we shall hereafter refer to throughout as Vassall,for the sake of brevity) committed the offences under the Official secrets acts which involved his acting as an agent for the Russian Secret Service,and to ascertain whether, having regard to those circumstances, there hadbeen breaches of security arrangements or any other neglect of duty onthe part of persons who had official responsibility for him. The otherwas to ascertain and test the truth of certain allegations arising out of theVassall case the nature of which is indicated in the first two sub-heads of our terms of reference.10. It seemed to us fairly plain that these two main lines of inquiry would not be likely to run on courses quite distinct from each other, for,without setting ourselves to construe too closely the wording of those twofirst sub-heads, we thought that in this context it could safely be taken thatany allegation which attributed to an individual in an official position,Minister, naval officer or civil servant, a gross neglect of duty in a matteraffecting the security of his country would be reflecting on his honour orintegrity and ought therefore to be the subject of our investigation andupheld or rejected accordingly.  We have proceeded on this basis.11. Apart from what our own observation and experience might suggest,we had two obvious sources of reference to draw upon for the purpose of finding out what was being said or suggested about the matters revealedby the Vassall case and as such constituted allegations or charges that we ought to notice.   These sources were Parliamentary criticism and press in the result a considerable
criticism. While each was materially conditioned by the fact that the com-ments made were formed without anything approaching the range of informa-tion that became available to us in the, course of our inquiry, we thoughtit right to make a careful study of them, both for the purpose of suggestingto ourselves lines upon which our inquiry should proceed and for thepurpose of cross-checking the tentative conclusions to which our owninvestigation of the facts might be leading us. ^12. We propose at a later stage of our Report (Part II) to set down alist of the main issues which, within our terms of reference, appear to usto require findings on our part, having regard to the considerations we have mentioned above. Those issues which relate to the First Lord of theAdmiralty (Lord Carrington) and the Hon. T. G. D. Galbraith, M.P., willbe considered and dealt with in separate Parts (Parts III and IV). before doing so, however, we shall give a connected account of the character and conduct of Vassall himself, the individual whose treacherous operations have involved a number of other people in imputations of neglect or breach of duty, and of the conditions, both in Moscow and in London, underwhich these operations were carried out. Without such an account it isvery difficult, we have found, to bring a critical intelligence to bear upon these questions of responsibility which are in the end the main subject ofour inquiry.13. Although vassalls conviction for offences under the Official secrets acts was the occasion of a large volume of published material appearing in our national Press (we read and analysed in all some 250 separate articles),it was plain to us from the first that in the nature of things it was not tobe expected that a great deal of what was said would be derived fromindependent sources of information, distinct from the official sources whichit was open to us to draw upon on our own initiative. Yet, with allallowance for expressions of criticism and comment, we found in severalplaces what would appear to any reader to be positive statements of factbearing upon Vassall&apos;s alleged activities or the alleged acts or defaults ofother persons in relation to him. It was to these statements that we resolved to direct our attention and to endeavour by questioning the makers as tothe basis and source of their information to measure for ourselves the validity of what was said and to assess its possible implications.14. Most of these statements, it turned out, were either pure commentexpressed in the form of assertion of fact or else inferences put togetherfrom other readily accessible sources, such as matters already published inother newspapers or elsewhere or general public knowledge. Once wehad satisfied ourselves as to the provenance, it was our duty to make up our minds whether, in the light of all that we knew from all sources, we agreed with the comment or would ourselves support the validity of theinference. We think it desirable to make plain that at no time have we regarded it as part of our function to express judgments as to whetherthis or that newspaper ought or ought not to have published any particularstatement on the basis of the information before it or the deductions it feltqualified to make. Newspapers have their own methods of operation andthey cannot always be expected to proceed on the kind of factual basis
that justifies an assertion before a court of law or a tribunal of inquiry.If their comments or deductions led them beyond what the law will permit,the law of libel is open to the injured individual: where, as here, it isan institution or a Department that has been the main object of criticism,and wounding, though unwarranted, assertions of fact have been made,which must reflect, though indirectly, on responsible individuals, it is to bef(^ped that the public itself will make up its mind as to the rights orwrongs of particular publications. Our only function, as we have seen it,is to try to report on the facts coming before us in the course of our inquiry,and for this purpose to examine and to accept or to reject any relevantallegations or assertions that have been brought to our attention.15. There remained, however, certain statements of fact that had appeared in Press publications, which proved on inquiry to have been based on materialsupplied to reporters by their own independent sources. As to these someobstacles were presented to the full prosecution of our inquiry by the factthat, as a general rule, the journalists to whom the reports were traced objected to identifying their informants on the ground that todo so would be contrary to the dictates of their professional conscience.Since, without being able to know who these informants were and thus toexamine them for ourselves, we were unable to obtain direct information andso to satisfy ourselves as to the truth or falsity of the statements made,we could not accept these claims to professional privilege except so far asthe law governing the proceedings of our Tribunal would itself admit them,and this, as we understood the matter, it did not do. Consequently wewere obliged to require witnesses to answer questions on these points whereverit appeared to us necessary for the purposes of our inquiry that an answer should be given.16. We did not, however, think that we were called upon to requireanswers unless the situation we were faced with satisfied this test. thus in a few cases we felt confident that the information we had already obtainedfrom other reliable sources was such as to make further inquiry of no value;in others, the source which the witness was anxious to conceal appeared,when his statement was scrutinised, to have contributed nothing that couldbe described as information of any substance at all; or again, in one ortwo cases, the subject dealt with appeared to be beyond the fringe of whatwas relevant to the scope of our inquiry. We did not require answers inany of these cases, thinking it a proper exercise of our discretion not to do so.17. There were in the result three journalist witnesses only who refusedto give the names of their informants or, alternatively, to answer questions as to the type of source that they represented and from whom we decidedthat it was necessary to require answers. To be precise, one (Mr. Foster)told us that he did not know and never had known the names of the persons of whom, he said, he had made inquiries, but he refused to answer questionsdirected to ascertaining what type of informant they were. One (Mr.Mulholland) refused to give the names of, as we understood, two differentpersons of whom, he said he had obtained information. The third (Mr.Clough) similarly refused to name the person from whom, he said, he hadreceived material for his story.
. 18. All three of these gentlemen persisted in their refusal. In the case ofthe third (Mr. Clough), however, after proceedings in the High Court forpunishment of the offence constituted by the refusal, he later identified for us the person whom he had spoken of as his informant. This was after theman in question had come forward voluntarily and been examined beforeus. He proved&quot; to be one of the officers employed in the InformationDepartment of the Admiralty. We were unable to conclude from wha he told us that he had in fact given Mr. Clough any confirmation of orcontribution to the story we were inquiring into.19. We have received no answers from either of the other two. Ourinvestigation has been brought to a close therefore without exhaustion ofthe lines of inquiry to which the questions put to them were directed andto that extent remains incomplete. We must record that the allegationsinvolved which we desired to follow up were not supported by any otheracceptable evidence which came into our possession and some of them were in fact contradicted by other evidence that we did obtain and areprepared to accept. Although, therefore, everything that we know of points to the conclusion that the allegations were not true, it is just because theyconflict with what we have learnt that it remains of some importance toprobe them and try to measure what weight, if any, can be attributed tothem.I.-GENERAL SURVEY20. Vassall was engaged in working as an agent for the Russian secret service for over 7 years. During a large part of that time he was abstractingofficial documents from the Departmental offices in which he was employed and either passing them to his Russian controllers for photographing, as atfirst, or, as later, photographing them himself at his home. He was a man,as is known, who regularly indulged in homosexual practices, and, as isalso known, the Russians began to pay him intermittent sums of money from December 1955, so that he had and spent a good deal more money on living expenses than was ever available from his official salary. It isplain that, when these are the basic elements of a story which first becomesknown to the public on Vassall&apos;s arrest and conviction in the autumn of1962, public comment and criticism are bound to centre round two main questions : How can it have been possible for him to conduct espionageactivities for so long without detection? and, How was it that a homo-sexual, living well above his apparent means, was not for those reasonsalone regarded as an object of suspicion, unfitted to be employed on work that brought him into contact with secret matter important to the State?21. These questions have indeed proved to be the central ones for theconduct of our inquiry, although they have naturally broken down into anumber of separate and more complicated issues as our inquiry progressedand we were enabled through our access to official records and officialwitnesses to get a more comprehensive view of the story as a whole than could be taken without protracted inquiry. A very large proportion of theserecords and witnesses had in our judgment to be treated as secret in the sense that they could not safely be examined and commented upon in the
presence of the general public. We have, thought it convenient therefore,,for the understanding of the more detailed issues which arise out of this story and which we shall examine later, if we first give a short connected,account of vassalls employment and activities in the Civil Service, fromentry to dismissal, and relate these to his own character and way of life and to the general conditions which bore upon them both in Moscow andijSthe Admiralty. To do so may involve some duplication of material andthe expression in advance of some conclusions which will have to be analysedin detail later: but we do not think that it is possible to evaluate fairlythe kind of problems that the Vassall case throws up without an introductionof this kind.22. Vassall then was born of British parents in September 1924, his fatherbeing a clergyman of the Church of England. On his father&apos;s side his family was connected with the scholastic profession, one great uncle havingbeen a master at Repton and another Senior Housemaster at Harrow. Bothwere well-known in their day as amateur athletes. He himself got hissecondary education at Monmouth Grammar School, which he left in April1941 at the age of 16J. Later acquaintances seem to have been madeconscious of the fact that he came of a family of some social standing, andVassall was evidently extremely sensitive as to his social position. A numberof people, even among those who liked and felt friendly towards him, thoughthim a snob. His readiness to give the impression of &quot; good family &quot; arose from his own character and situation and was not due to any plan of self-protection ; but it was probably one of the influences that supported a wide-spread, if vague, idea among his colleagues that he enjoyed some privatemeans.23. His school record was undistinguished, though reported on in the most satisfactory term by the then headmaster in 1948, when Vassall became an established civil servant in the Admiralty. It was war-time when he leftschool and he spent a few months as temporary employee in the MidlandBank in London and a little more than a year as a temporary clerk Grade IIIin the Victualling Department of the Admiralty. He was called up for theRoyal Air Force in January 1943 and demobilised in March 1947, leavingwith the record of &quot; V.G. conduct throughout service &quot;. He returned to theAdmiralty in May of the same year, being employed as a temporary clerkin the Air Equipment Division and accepted for establishment as clericalofficer as from 1st January, 1948.24. None of these details is of any importance to the consideration of anyquestion relating to responsibility for vassall&apos;s immunity from detectionduring his later years as an agent of the Russians. There was no reason why the Admiralty should not have admitted him as an established civil servant nor any reason why they should have made any more inquiries thanthey did. His record was twice checked with the Security Service in theperiod before he was established, and on both occasions is was found that nothing was recorded against him. But Security Service records are keptfor the purpose of tracing subversive activities and they are not intendedto be a guide on the much wider issues raised by the conception of &quot; a security risk&quot;. And Vassall, whatever else he was, was not a subversiveand showed at no time any interest in alien ideologies.  We know enough
about him now to say that he was already committed to homosexual practices,but this was a private matter and in any event information about homo-sexuals in general is not collected and recorded by the Security Service.25. From now on vassall&apos;s rank was to be that of a clerical officer in theCivil Service, whose three main divisions in order of rank are the administra-tive, the executive and the clerical. In his successive employments, whichwill be mentioned later, he never held any other rank than that of clericalofficer, and, though he was twice before a Promotions Board with a viewto being recommended for promotion to executive officer in 1958 and in1961 he was not found to be fit for promotion on either occasion. Thegeneral judgment of his capacity, which is recorded in numerous annual reports and was expressed to us by many colleagues under whom or with whom he had worked, was that he was defective in the power of judgmentand of limited intellectual capacity. On the other hand nearly everyonefound him pleasant to work with, a discreet, reserved, and obliging man,well-spoken and in appearance neat and well-dressed.26. The duty of a clerical officer is to perform simple clerical duties andin addition (to quote the words of the Civil Service constitutional manualEstacode, see Section B (j), paragraph 9) those of &quot;dealing with particular cases in accordance with well-defined regulations, instructions or general prac-tice; scrutinising, checking and cross-checking accounts, claims, returns, etc.,under well-defined instructions ; preparation of material for returns, accounts and statistics in prescribed form ; simple drafting and precis work ; collectionof material on which judgment can be formed . . .&quot;. There is no evidencethat Vassall was ever given more responsible work than this to do at anystage, if indeed some of it would not have been beyond his grasp anyway.He was on occasions correctly described as acting as &quot; personal assistant&quot;to some senior officer in the branch in which he was then working, but inthis context such a phrase does not denote any measure of increasedresponsibility. It means no more than that the clerical officer concerned is specially attached to render individual clerical services to that senior officer. It may well have the incidental effect, when a branch that dealswith classified material is concerned, that documents of high classificationpass through the hands of such an assistant in the normal course of hiswork that would not otherwise be likely to reach him or to reach him in as great a volume. But that is a consequence of the office organisationof branches that deal with secret material and has no bearing upon the natureof the duties themselves that a clerical officer is required to perform.27. The Civil Service system does not recognise that there is any functionaldistinction to be admitted in the grading of or the reward for its various postsaccording to the relative secrecy or non-secrecy of the material dealt with. Thework to be done in either case is the same, although security may require the observance of special procedures in the handling of secret matter. Also, withinrecent years, it has come to be explicitly recognised that not all members ofthe Service, even though otherwise capable of performing all necessary duties,can be safely allowed to have regular access to very secret information. Thatis what the procedure of Positive Vetting is intended to enforce. But, con-sistently with the general idea, it has never been supposed that junior staffsuch as, say, typists or clerks, could for practical reasons or should for
theoretical reasons be excluded from access to, dealing with or handling secretdocuments or secret information within the range of their proper duties.Nor is it accepted that such employment should carry a distinguishingpremium in the way of higher pay. This would be an attempt to buy what should be a natural loyalty without the likelihood of removing temptations to/disloyalty.28. We do not see how these things can be otherwise, nor do we think the system deserving of adverse criticism. Such protection as can be obtainedlies in the most careful&apos; selection of personnel at all levels for the occupationof these sensitive posts and in the vigilant employment of the PositiveVetting procedure to do what it can to cross-check the proposed selection.We shall have to discuss in detail under separate headings the issues whetherVassall&apos;s selection for his Moscow appointment was an adequate and responsible decision and whether his Positive Vetting clearance, which wasgiven on his attachment to the Naval Intelligence Division in 1956 after his return from Moscow, was carried out with proper care: but for the momentwhat we are concerned to say is that we see nothing that calls for censureor criticism in the fact that Vassall, a clerical officer on a salary scale whichhad reached about  700 per annum net by 1962, should have been employedin a succession of posts which gave him access to highly secret material, inthe sense that documents of that kind passed through his hands for such purposes as noting, filing and distributing to and collecting from the superiorofficers concerned.29. To return now to vassall&apos;s employments. He left Air Equipment inNovember, 1949, and was transferred to Naval Law. In June, 1952, he wentover to War Registry (the Admiralty&apos;s central communications centre) andit was while he was serving there that he saw a general Admiralty circularand Fleet Order inviting applications for volunteers for (inter alia) the post of clerk to the Naval Attache in Moscow. He applied and was selected outof some 40 volunteers on a short list of 8. It is obvious now, with hindsight,that he was a very bad choice for service in a sensitive post behind the iron curtain. He must always have been a weak character, with little sense ofresponsibility, little power of resistance to pressure and susceptible to appealsto his vanity. But how far these refinements or any of them could havebeen detected by his selectors under the existing procedure or whether some more rigorous method of selection could reasonably have been adopted arequestions which, as we have said, we shall examine later. For the moment itis enough to say that, so far as we can see, nothing short of active policedetective work would have offered any clue to the fact that he was apractising homosexual; and at any rate all the procedures required at thatdate for making the selection were carried out by responsible Admiraltyofficials of proper seniority.30. In the result Vassall was selected and almost at once despatched to moscow to serve as clerk to the Naval Attache there on a two-year termof duty. A Service Attached job in a foreign capital must include intelligencework and, although the amount of material of a high security classificationpassing through the Naval office is not large, and some that does is seenonly by the eye of the Attache himself, his clerk inevitably comes into contact with a regular run of papers of some security rating. This circumstance?
alone means that junior staff in the offices of Service attaches are naturaltargets for attempted subversion by hostile agencies, when the country towhich such staff are posted regards our own as an espionage target.31. It is necessary to say something about the local conditions prevailing in Moscow in order to appreciate how and why Vassall became such an easy prey for the Russians. He did not, of course, offer his services to ]them: they captured him. The capture was effected through a deliberatelycontrived compromise plan, under which Vassall was first introduced toand then cultivated by Russian agents and his vanity flattered, then enticedto a party and photographed in indecent homosexual positions, and finallysurprised in a homosexual assignment with a Russian officer. He wasthreatened with prosecution and exposure and by, say, the early summer of 1955 had been brought into subjection to the control of the hostile secret service by a mixture of menaces, criminal and social, and skilful persuasion.Monetary inducement was not held out at the time but, in accordance withthe usual technique of compromise, money was passed to him later, and payments continued thereafter at irregular intervals so long as he was aservant of. the Russians.32. The manufacture of compromising situations of this kind must beregarded as one of the regular instruments by which the Russian secret service seeks to suborn and enlist British agents who can furnish it with information as to our State secrets. It has been attempted again and again in various forms, through black-market operations, through currency offences,through involving men with women, women with men and, as in VassalFscase, men witb:;men. The Embassy in Moscow and our other Embassiesbehind the Iron Curtain can only be seen therefore as, in some sort,beleagured&apos; forces under a constant and insidious attack, carried out notonly by the skilful development of seemingly innocent contacts with Russiancitizens but also by the insertion within the Embassy premises of the mostingenious listening and, sometimes, photographic devices and the conscriptionas regular informers and reporters of the locally-engaged staff working forthe embassy for example, cooks, housemaids and chauffeurs. The prevalence of this danger to our security was perfectly well-known to Vassall&apos;s superiorsat the Embassy in the years 1954-56 and in greater or less degree to the junior staff, to whose attention it was brought from time to time with appropriate warnings. The sufficiency of this procedure must be consideredlater when we come to deal in detail with the Moscow period. We cannothowever fail to notice at the outset how difficult it must have been to ensurethat everyone on the staff, however clearly warned, was always sufficientlyprudent and self-controlled to avoid the trap of a contrived incident. It is,of course, one thing to fall into a trap that has been carefully set: it isvery much another thing to be so overwhelmed by the consequences as toundertake to serve as a traitor rather than accept the possibility of exposureor confession. What secured the Russian success in vassall&apos;s case wasthat he did refuse to face this possibility and so did not, as has been donein other cases, report his situation at once to his superiors at the Embassy andappeal for their protection.33. He thus drifted into acting as an agent for the Russians without anyvisible indication that anything compromising had happened at all. No one
observed any change in his demeanour. He played a very full part in thesocial life that was open to members of the diplomatic colony in Moscow,mixing freely in contacts with other Embassies. It is impossible not to seethat he was thoroughly enjoying himself and for that reason alone the less the object of any suspicion. &quot; I certainly think it is my metier to travel toforeign countries &quot;, he wrote to Mr. Pennells, Civil Assistant to the DirectorY*f Naval Intelligence at the Admiralty, towards the end of his Moscow(service and long after he had begun his work for the Russians, &quot; as Ithoroughly enjoy all there is to see as well as meeting so many differentnationalities. It is all immensely interesting. ... I shall never forget the many unusual and extraordinary happenings that go on here which must come to few people.&quot;34. The Russians indeed had caught him through his homosexual proclivity,but the volume of evidence that we received convinced us that at that timejust as in the later years in London, there was nothing either in VassafTsconduct or conversation that indicated even to a sharp observer a manaddicted to homosexual practices. He was in fact entirely discreet, and whatever homosexual partners he may have had in Moscow and we have reason to think that he had some -his affairs were private affairs conductedoutside the Embassy and in no sense before the public eye. People workedand lived at close quarters in the various buildings occupied by the Embassystaff, and a number of them regarded him as effeminate or even &quot; a bitpansy&quot;, just as others got no such impression, but no one, it seems clear,thought him a practising homosexual. We shall have to consider this pointin more detail later, when we deal with the question of responsibilities in moscow, but we feel no doubt as to the general impression of harmlesspropriety that Vassall succeeded in conveying. The idea that in Moscowhe was generally known in diplomatic or any other circles as a homosexualis a false one.35. Yet by November, 1954, only about eight months after his arrival in Moscow, the Russian Secret Service outside the Embassy had detectedin Vassall an approachable homosexual ready for homosexual practices andhad so worked upon him as to get the photographs they wanted at theircompromise party. How could they see so quickly what not one in the embassy perceived at all? The dilemma is not in any case fairly presented,since the Russians were in the position of someone about to arrange aclinical experiment; but the fact is that they were placed in a position ofadvantage in approaching Vassall by having under their control as informerand go-between a member of the Embassy&apos;s locally-engaged staff, oneSigmund Mikhailski, who indulged at least intermittently in homosexualacts. What we say here is partly oonjecture rather than demonstrablefact; but it is known of Mikhailski that he was implicated in more thanone other attempted compromise of Embassy staff in connexion withblack market operations, that he was a close friend of a diplomat in anotherEmbassy, a friend of Vassall, who is reported to have been sent home from moscow because of his homosexual leanings, and that he was concernedin yet another case of homosexual compromise affecting a third Embassy.This man, who was supplied to the British Embassy as a junior interpreterand administrative officer by the Russian agency through whom local staff
had to be engaged, seems to have joined them early in 1954. He was aplausible and insinuating man, and it is evident that he cultivated Vassallfrom the first. Although Vassall admitted to us only one homosexualincident between Mikibailski and himself, there was evidently a closefriendship between them. Mikhailski with his special opportunities forobservation and, no doubt, a special sensitivity in this field, must havedetected and reported Vassall&apos;s vulnerability at quite an early date. He 1then became the agent to lure Vassall into contacts with other Russiansby introducing them as casual acquaintances in Moscow restaurants and,the contacts made, was able himself to drop out of the picture until the compromise had been successfully effected.36. The Embassy&apos;s employment and retention &apos;Of Mikhailski gave riseto several difficult questions to which we shall address ourselves. Theyare important questions, because we have no doubt that it was the presenceof Mikhailski within the Embassy and the comparative freedom of access to the home-based staff that was allowed to him that were the cause ofthe subornation of Vassall which actually took place. But the Embassyauthorities were by no means free agents in this matter of engaging orcontrolling locally-engaged staff and, although we consider that they cannotbe treated as wholly free from blame for their handling of the situation created by Mikhailski&apos;s presence, we appreciate that in effect it was impos-sible for them in the conditions under which they were living to find andenforce an altogether satisfactory line of action.37. There is only one other point to notice in this general review of the moscow period and that is to say what it was that Vassall did for theRussians in the way of providing information. Here we have to followVassall&apos;s own account as we have obtained it in examination of him. It isimpossible to cross-check it by outside evidence, but we have taken hisaccount as trustworthy, both because he gave it to us in a convincing manner and because we could see no reason why he should not tell us the truth onthis point. Also his description of his method of operation seems in itssimplicity and a certain haphazardness to tally with his comparatively limitedmental grasp, which might have made more complicated systems difficult for him to work and, perhaps, in the end easier of detection.38. At first what he gave his Russian interrogators was oral information inreply to detailed questions about the various persons employed in the embassy and their respective activities. It may or may not have been of any importance to them: more likely the questioning was designed to test the truth of his replies by checking them against what they knew already. Butby about September 1955 he had begun to operate a system of abstractingdocuments from the Naval Attache office which in all essentials remained,we believe, the method he employed throughout the years of his service asespionage agent. His Russian controllers would give him an appointment atsome rendezvous in Moscow for a date some three weeks or a month ahead.It was his duty to keep that appointment and bring with him from the office a document or documents of value to them, which they at once photographedand then returned to him. He does not seem at that time to have workedunder any detailed instructions as to what particular matters he was to try to fasten upon, but the Russians would indicate to him whether they were
dissatisfied with any particular ithing that he had brought on the groundthat it contained nothing of value to them, and he had, of course, the securityclassification marked on his documents to guide him as to the level of theirsignificance. Later, in England, he was certainly given some general cate-gories and priorities to guide him.( 39. Vassall&apos;s system had its limitations. While the actual abstraction ofa document presented little difficulty for a confidential clerk who was handling the office material, the danger of the absence of a document being detectedincreased the longer it was out of the office. He therefore kept to an over-night plan which minimised his risk. The paper he was going to pass to theRussians was taken out of a tray or off his table in the course of the dayon which he was going to meet them, slipped into an envelope or, in early days, a despatch case, carried out of the office with his coat or otherbelongings at the end of the day and put back the next morning when theRussians had done with it. A clerk who chose his documents with sufficientcare to see that he was not taking something that would be called for byhis superiors in the brief interval of its absence was operating a system which only an exceptional accident would be likely to expose: on the other handhe was limited to a choice from such documents as came into his hands inthe ordinary course of his duties and to such of them as came to him onthe actual day of his appointment with his controllers.40. Since this method was the one employed by Vassall, not only as clerkin Moscow but in all his subsequent posts in the Admiralty, it is convenient to say here that we have not found it right to hold anyone, colleague orsuperior, to blame for the fact that he was not detected in these acts ofabstraction. The civil servant who is admitted to access to secrets in thecourse of his duty, however senior or junior his rank, is admitted within thebarrier that is erected in order to guard them from unauthorised intrusion.If the methods of selection and screening have not been successful to identifyand reject the potential traitor as they may well not be, howeverscrupulously and rigorously applied it is likely that, so long as he keepsto what comes into his head or hands in the ordinary way of his work and does not attract suspicion by trying to operate outside it, his betrayals willescape detection. Even the most elaborate procedure of documentary security,while they   will protect material from the access of all but those who in the strict sense need to handle it, will not prevent a man who has legitimate accessfrom putting a paper in his pocket if he knows enough about the business toknow that he can smuggle it back again unobserved. Such procedures, evenif imperfectly implemented, will aid, as they did in Vassall&apos;s case, to facilitate the tracing of a spy, once there is some concrete information as to whatdocuments or material he has been passing out, because they help to identify the range of persons who, in the normal way, would have had access tothe material. But that is a detective, not a preventive process, and, againas in this case, the first impetus to set detection on foot must come froma different and independent source.41. When Vassall came back to work in the Admiralty he continued to operate the same methods. At no time, except in a few short periods when,during his service in the Civil Lord&apos;s office, the latter&apos;s private secretary wasaway on leave or on tour, did he ever work in a room by himself or without
two or three colleagues at work at other desks. Nevertheless no one seemson any occasion to have noticed his acts of smuggling. The Russians, he told us, discouraged the use of a brief or despatch case: presumably they feared that he might be caught out in a snap check at the Admiralty doors. his instructions were to bring newspapers or magazines in with him in the morning, as many other civil servants would be doing, and to carry out;the purloined documents concealed in the folds of these papers. The docu-ments themselves were slipped into a large envelope of which he was sup-plied with a stock by the Russians. His practice was to note a single paper or docket which seemed to him of value to ithe Russians and which was not likely to be called for at short notice, usually one which had come to him from higher up after being dealt with and was therefore waiting to be putaway or filed or one which for some other reason was for the time beingsafely in suspense, and ito transfer this from his desk or tray to the envelope,either directly or by keeping it in a drawer until a convenient momentarrived. He was always careful not to keep a paper out of the office longer than overnight.42. It is surprising that no one is known to have observed him at this work, or that, if he ever was seen, no suspicion was aroused. It went onintermittently through six years of employment in the Admiralty. But the explanation is, we think, that, though rooms are shared by three or fourpeople or more, each individual is concentrated on his own work ait his desk,and the man who wishes surreptitiously to slip a paper away in the courseof the day has only to watch for his chance and then to aot unobtrusively.43. In our view no precaution short of a strict personal search either of all persons leaving the building or of persons selected for snap checksfrom time to time would offer any security means of countering the methodof operation adopted by Vassall. Precautions of this severity have not hitherto been regarded as practicable measures to be introduced into Govern-ment Departments, even those dealing with a considerable volume of secretmatter, and we do not make any criticism of the fact that they were not employed by the Admiralty, for indeed in the context they are unacceptableand therefore unworkable.44. At Christmas 1957, his Russian controllers decided that Vassall shouldhave a camera in order to be able to photograph his documents himself inhis own home instead of, as hitherto, handing them over to them to bephotographed and returned to him while he waited. Accordingly he wasgiven the money with which to buy one, and in fact made the purchase inHamburg while passing through on the way to holiday in Switzerland. There-after he was never without one or more cameras, Exakta or Minox; and thechange involved in doing his own photographing much extended the range of his service to the Russians, since, although he continued to keep documentsout of the office for one night only, useful documents could be taken andphotographed on any day that they came to him without regard to the dateof his next Russian appointment. He was able to keep the films in hisroom at home or in his flat, when he moved there, and to hand them overin due course when his next meeting fell due. This change was capable of producing important results, because while Vassall&apos;s ordinary work when hewas moved to Military Branch probably did not give him regular access to
such really significant material, there were occasions during 1962, one onlyshortly before his arrest, when the temporary absence of the clerical officer who normally assisted the Head of his Section placed Vassall as her deputyin a position to handle a volume of documentary matter which carried avery high security classification.   The undelivered films which he took ofCrate of these papers and which were fortunately recovered from his flathen he was detected do not suggest that he was either slow to seize hisopportunities when they came or that by that time he was reluctant to obtainfor his masters the richest spoil that he could put into their hands.45. The course of VassafTs service in the Admiralty, after he came back from Moscow, can be shortly stated. He was first put into the NavalIntelligence Division and posted to it on 25th July, 1956. Between taking up his work there and leaving Moscow he had been allowed special leave,a period which, unknown, apparently, to anyone in the Admiralty, he occupiedby passing through Sweden and Norway, visiting the United States and canada and then returning via Stockholm to England. The funds for this,as for a number of vassall&apos;s other foreign trips, must be ascribed to a combination of sayings from his ample foreign service allowances for the moscow period, Russian money, and the hospitality or generosity of friends in different parts of the world who can be described as belonging to his&quot;circle&quot;.46. The decision to place him in the Intelligence Division, which is essentially a repository of secret matter, was primarily due to a policy of employing for a time in that Division returning clerks who had served NavalAttaches abroad in a country in which the Intelligence Division was interested.Russia was obviously within this category. It was thought that such clerkswould be able to make some contribution to the work of the Division bytheir recent familiarity with the local conditions of the country in whichthey had served ; and the more serious alternative of attaching the naval attache himself for a period after his return had been found very difficultto operate because of the interruption that it involved to the normal pro-progression of his postings. The wisdom of such a policy can be, and indeedhas for long been, a matter of debate. On the one side is the quantumof advantage that it brings to intelligence work and the undesirability ofconnecting a sometimes unpopular foreign service post with a subsequentprohibition of entry to interesting and important work. On the other isthe enhanced risk to security in placing in a branch dealing with peculiarlysecret matter a man who has just returned from a sensitive post in whichhe has been exposed to the special strains and temptations that surroundsuch a post in an Iron Curtain country.47. We make no criticism of the decision to employ Vassall in NavalIntelligence Division. We are satisfied that the policy that admitted him was a decision taken by the then Director of Naval Intelligence with hiseyes open and with an awareness of the various issues involved ; and evenif we ourselves were to conclude that the balance of advantage inclined theother way and the Admiralty were now to change its policy on this point,we should not think that there was anything blameworthy or careless insomeone who has taken the opposite view.
48. On taking.up his post in Naval Intelligence Vassall was for the first time put up for clearance under Positive Vetting. The reason for requiringit in his case was not that he was going to work in this Division as such,but that the clerical officer whose place he was taking had been assigned to special responsibility as the clerk in the Division authorised to handleAtomic secret material and, as such, an officer obliged to have had PositiveVetting clearance. By the end of 1956 Vassall had been put through allJstages of the Positive Vetting procedure and had received his clearance.It is, of course, a disquieting thought that a young man of no great strengthof character and only recently recruited through intimidation by the RussianSecret Service should have passed successfully through this investigationwithout arousing suspicion. But the whole question of the adequacy ofVassall&apos;s Positive Vetting clearance is a difficult one which we proposedto consider fully at a later stage of our Report. If we do not think it right to find matter for censure in what was then done or omitted to be done,it is because of the inherent speculativeness of the judgments involved in a positive Vetting assessment and the provisional nature of any of its conclusions.49. In respect of the Positive Vetting system the Admiralty was in 1956applying the requirement that all Positive Vetting clearances should auto-matically come up for review after five years. Vassall was therefore due for review by the end of 1961. Owing to the heavy back-log which had thenaccumulated in obtaining clearances, partly owing to the constant increasein the number of Positive Vetting posts, it was decided that for the timebeing review cases should be deferred to the business of clearing cases ofthose who had not yet obtained their first clearance. VassaH&apos;s review wastherefore among those deferred, and, as he had not been authorised to dealwith Atomic material since he left the Intelligence Division, there was nodeparture from any general security instructions in his deferment. We cannot see any ground for thinking that, had the review taken place when due, itwould have produced any compromising material on Vassall, unless theDolphin Square flat itself had led to a line of inquiry that related his livingexpenses to his only avowable means.50. Vassall did not like work in the Intelligence Division. He tookadvantage of a chance meeting with the then Principal Establishment Officer,Mr. Synnott, who had put in a word for him once before when he was in naval Law, and asked if he could not have a change. The details ofVassalFs various appointments and the circumstances in which they cameabout are best set out separately in a later chapter, in which we deal withthe question, which has excited some attention, were his appointments andthe opportunities which, in some cases, they afforded him for the abstractionof secret material attributable to some unusual or even sinister influence?It is a question that has to be answered, since it has been raised: but wecan say at once that, after the most careful examination, we are satisfiedthat no such influence was ever present. Indeed, we do not take the viewthat Vassall was given any special or indulgent treatment at all in the courseof his various appointments. With one exception, which will come up later,his Annual Reports were never very encouraging and the problem seemsto have been rather to find work that he could do than to find attractivework for him.
51. In June, 1957, Vassall was therefore transferred to the private officeof the Civil Lord who was at that time Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith, M.P.It was intended that he should work as clerical officer assisting the CivilLord&apos;s private secretary and it was realised that a substantial part of his duties would consist of looking after the personal arrangements of the CivilAord on his official side, the kind of duty for which it was thought thatVassall might Have special aptitude. It will be found that in Part III, whichsurveys allegations or stories brought to our notice about the generalrelationship that prevailed between Mr. Galbraith and Vassall, we have given some account of vassalls duties and the manner in which he dischargedthem, and it is unnecessary to deal here with that topic. The duties ofa Civil Lord are not such that any volume of highly classified material islikely to pass through his office. What there is is chiefly related to mattersof general board policy, and VassaH&apos;s Russian controllers seem to have been less interested in policy papers than in those dealing with technical detail.In fact they were not pleased with his assignment to this office and, althoughVassall continued his abstractions during the 2\ years that he was in theoffice in fact it was after he had been there about six months that he gothis first camera it was probably not an important&apos; period from the pointof view of his spying activities.52. He came up before his first Promotion Board at the end of 1958 andthe Board, while not thinking him qualified for promotion to Executiverank, recommended a transfer to a branch in which he would see moreadministrative work. Accordingly, when the offices of the parliamentary and the Civil Lord were amalgamated in 1959, Vassall was posted to military Branch II.53. Military Branch, despite its unilluminating title, is in fact the secre-tariat which serves the Naval Staff in the Admiralty, and it is therefore a branch of the Department through which passes a large volume of highlyclassified material. It was in this branch that Vassall served from October,1959, until his arrest in September, 1962, and, although it is not to beassumed that his clerical work in the Fleet Section (one of the three Sectionsinto which Military Branch II is divided) would necessarily give him access to a great deal of Top Secret material, there can be no doubt that he was placed at the centre of one of the Admiralty&apos;s most sensitive branches and,as we have already explained, in a position to take full advantage of any temporary change in staffing arrangements which might bring material of exceptional importance on to his desk. Generally speaking, his clericalduties brought him into touch with such categories of &quot; staff technical matters &quot; as radar, communications, torpedo and anti-submarine, gunnerytrials, Allied Tactical Publications, Allied Exercise Publications, FleetOperational and Tactical Instructions and also with general matters con-cerning naval liaison with Commonwealth countries. The sort of thing that he had to do was to refer incoming correspondence and reports onthese matters to the appropriate Admiralty departments for their commentsand then to draft submissions to the Board or replies to incoming lettersbased on these comments.54. His course of abstraction and photographing did not last through this period without interruption.  The arrests in the Portland spying case
.,weje made ion. January, 1961, and Vassal! was at once told by his Russiancontroller that though he was not himself compromised, he was to stopall espionage work until further notice that it was safe to resume. Thisnotice was not given to him until some time early in 1962, over a yearlater, it seems, but from that time on until his own arrest he was activelyat work. for the Russians on the same lines as before. i ^: 55. His detection came about through information from intelligencesources which only began to reach the Security Service in March, 1962.It was a considerable task to check it, analyse its implications and thenfollow up in turn the various lines of inquiry which might lead to the identification of the actual spy.56. We do not think that there would be any advantage in our giving any detailed account of the investigations which, after several false trails,were to lead to the detection and arrest of Vassall. By June he was undersuspicion as the possible offender and by August certainly began to turnon him. It is sufficient if we say that nothing of what we have learntof this matter suggests to us that any criticism could be made of tardinessor delay in what was done between March and September of last year.On the contrary the story seems to us to be one of a laborious and verycapable piece of counter-espionage.57. What we have said above gives a brief account of two of the sectors of Vassall&apos;s somewhat complicated existence his life as an ordinary civil servant of junior rank, quiet obliging and moderately efficient, and his lifeas an agent of the Russian Secret Service, who had made his official duties and opportunities subservient to their requirements. For success in this it was, of course, essential that the two sectors should never overlap. Butit is noticeable how in other sectors too Vassall succeeded in keepingseparate activities from impinging on each other and his long immunity from suspicion on account of them can only be understood in the lightof the impression of himself that he was able to create among his officecolleagues.58. Their general impression was that he was a man of good familywith some private means. It was known that he lived something of an active social life went to theatres, restaurants and concerts, went away forweekends, took holidays abroad and was always smartly dressed. Buthe had no close friends of his own in the Admiralty, and it was evidentto us that, while a number of the many witnesses who testified before usknew something of one or other or some of these activities, there was no single person sufficiently far in his confidence to have any comprehensivepicture of his social and personal life as a whole. And without suchknowledge no concrete idea would have emerged as to the level of his general expenditure. Moreover, without independent cause of suspicion,such activities are as much indicative of private means as of somecriminal source of profit.59. It was not his habit to be specific when speaking of such matters in the Department. Though he liked to build up the impression of goodsocial contacts, he seems hardly ever to have said anything more detailedabout his week-end visits than that he had been in this country or that,
or this or that part of the country. He spoke to different persons of holidays abroad, in Italy or Capri or Switzerland, but, perhaps significantly,no one in the office was ever told that he had actually flown to theUnited States for a holiday at Christmas, 1961, nor do any of his colleaguesrecollect his mentioning his Cairo visit of 1959. Evidently, he presentedhimself as the entertained rather than as the entertainer, referring to^elderly ladies with whom, it was thought, he stayed at week-ends. Again, without being specific he let it be known or thought that he had receivedmoney by way of legacies from relations or friends, sometimes described as.,his &quot; aunts &quot;. This was true at any rate to the extent that he got a  200legacy from one such friend, which he used principally in buying furniturefrom the estate for his flat: but he received no financial support from his family at any time, and his mother&apos;s death in 1960 brought him only alegacy of some  100. He was to many people, though by no means toall who knew him, something of a joke, for they thought him a socialclimber and a hanger-on of rich old ladies, with an eye to the mainchance. Whatever the truth of this may have been, it was a part of theimpression conveyed by his general conversation.60. It was not unknown in the office that he lived in Dolphin Square or,more vaguely, in the West End. But such a piece of knowledge by itself would have been, in our judgment, quite insufficient to rouse misgivingor suspicion. He might have been living with his parents, or sharingwith a friend, or helped by a family allowance, or using some privatemeans of his own. In fact to the ordinary acquaintance the Dolphin Squareaddress probably contributed to the attribution of private means.61. Of the witnesses from the Admiralty whom we examined on thispoint four had visited the flat itself. None, apparently, was struck by itas being in any way significant: but, of course this absence of reactionmust be set against the general impression of Vassall that we have beendescribing. Had they been faced at the time with the knowledge thathe had no other legitimate resources than those we have mentioned, theymight well have found something suspicious in his surroundings. As itwas, they did not: and we do not think that any reflection rests on themfor not doing so.62. vassall&apos;s homosexual activities, something which many critics have said should have put his official superiors on the alert were again keptentirely away from his official and ordinary social contacts. We are notin a position to give any exhaustive account of what these activitiesamounted to. First, it would have been impossible without a set ofelaborate separate investigations, which would probably have been incon-clusive, to categorise them without saying either too much or too little ;and, secondly, we did not think it our business to enquire into them exceptso far as they might lead to something within our terms of reference.This meant in the context something which indicated carelessness or breach of duty on the part of a person in authority. Vassall&apos;s general homosexuallife and contacts with persons not holding official positions would notcontribute to this.63. We ascertained enough, however, to show us that Vassall had beenaddicted to homosexual practice from youth and that in the years we were
speaking of he had many homosexual friends. His trips abroad, whichwere many and far-ranging, so far as legitimate Admiralty leave permitted,seem to have been mainly concerned with these friendships, and friends of similar outlook visited him when in London from their own countries.Moreover, judging by his address book, he had a very wide circle of maleacquaintances in many parts of the United Kingdom, although we have no right or wish to say that all his friendships ought to be regarded as carryingimplications of sexual impropriety.64. The upshot of it is, however, that vassall&apos;s homosexual activities were, in our judgment, essentially private ones. He was discreet in his conduct of them and we never found any evidence that we could at allaccept to the effect that he operated as a male prostitute on the streets orin public places or in any other way that oould possibly bring his proclivitiesto the notice of authority. There were no convictions recorded against him.Even the modicum of evidence that we obtained to the effect that hefrequented clubs and bars patronised by homosexuals proved to be hope-lessly unreliable and would not, we think, in any event have led us to any useful conclusion. Similarly, vague and unsupported suggestions that itwas his practice to wear women&apos;s clothing in the West End remained whollywithout substantiation.65. We think that it can safely be taken therefore that no one in theAdmiralty who could be charged with any responsibility for concern withVassal&apos;1&apos;s security knew or ought to have realised that in fact he was apractising homosexual. To ascertain that it would have been necessary to employ ordinary detective inquiries for the purpose. In saying this we areexcluding the question of the adequacy of the investigation carried out onhis Positive Vetting, which we shall consider separately: and we areexcluding also the possibility that during the years 1948-62 he may have entered into a homosexual affair with one or more persons who were alsoserving in the Admiralty. We did receive a suggestion that at any rateone affair of this sort had existed in the past and we made such inquiriesas were open to us with regard to such a question. This affair in fact wasdenied and we were in any event satisfied with respect to it that, even ifthe suggestion had been true, the relationship could have had no bearing on the issue before us, that of responsibility in respect of VassaiTs spyingactivities.66. Was Vassall then to be identified in the Admiralty as a homosexual,and therefore a security risk, by virtue of his appearance, dress, manner and speech alone, without contributory evidence of fact? We have readquite a volume of public comment on this point, which seems to assume that he bore some visible brand which it was blindness not to observe.To us, who heard some 30 witnesses from the Department, seniors orcolleagues who had worked with Vassal! at one stage or another, thecomment came to seem far-fetched indeed. We are convinced that Vassallhad no office reputation of homosexuality. For one person who had evenheard a suggestion that he might be, there were 20 who had never heardit mentioned and denied having entertained any suspicion that it was so.No one had heard him called &quot; Auntie &quot; or referred to by a giri&apos;s name.What the general assessment was was put before us in varying terms but
with almost complete concordance in the result. He was effeminate, notmanly (&quot; a bit of a miss &quot;, as one fellow clerk said), well bait not at allostentatiously dressed (though one observer did go so far as to say&quot; foppish &quot;), very polite and anxious to please. That was all it came to.Most people found him reticent about his own private life, though a bit. of a gossip, and in fact very few people knew anything at all of substancelabout his outside life. To our minds it is impossible to build up out ofthis body of impressions the idea that &quot; the Admiralty &quot; (meaning anyonethere having responsibility in this field) ought to have detected in Vassalla vulnerable homosexual and taken protective measures accordingly.II.-PARTICULAR ASPECTSThe Questions to be Answered67. Such then is our account of VassaWs character and activities andof the circumstances in which he carried out his work as a Russian agent.They raise a number of questions which call for answer within our termsof reference and we propose now to outline what we believe those questions to be and to indicate in what parts of our Report our findings upon the mare to be found.68. In identifying these questions we have drawn upon reports of Parlia-mentary criticism and upon the material of Press reports, as well as uponthe volume of evidence that we obtained through our own resources. Wehave not thought it required of us, however, to set out a categorised listof all the various allegations or comments which we came across in ouranalysis of the Press material. Generally speaking, we have thought itsufficient to record our own findings upon relevant facts and our ownconclusions upon them, without seeking specifically to correct or reject the detailed allegations to which our attention has been directed. Only in afew cases has it been necessary, for the purpose of explaining our findings,to make reference to some actual passage of a newspaper report.69. Our list of questions is as follows:1. Was Vassairs selection as clerical officer in the Naval Attachedoffice in Mosoow carried out with adequate care and responsibility?Part I (paragraph 29)Part 11, Chapter A2. Was it careless or blameworthy on anyone&apos;s part to allow aclerical officer of vassall&apos;s standing to be employed in regular contact with classified material?Part I (paragraphs 25-28)3. Were the staff of the British Embassy in Moscow, particularlyjunior staff temporarily attached to the Embassy, sufficiently forewarnedof the dangers of Russian subversion? Was there any lack of care in those responsible for security in the Embassy in supervising theRussian contacts of such staff?Part I (paragraphs 31-32)Part II, Chapter B (paragraphs 93-99, 133-143)
4.

Selection for Moscow70. The selection of Vassal], a weak, vain individual and a practisinghomosexual, for appointment as Naval Attached clerk in Moscow can nowbe seen to be the decisive mistake in the history of this case. It exposedhim to the attention of the Russian Intelligence Services in conditions inwhich they were most readily able to identify him for what he was and to compromise him. This is not to say that his selection was a mistake forwhich there must necessarily be blame. His weaknesses were not readilyapparent and the Admiralty method of selection of staff for appointment as Naval Attaches&apos; clerks, which we describe in the paragraphs immediately following, was ill-adapted for assessing strength of character and freedom from those defects which the Russians might exploit.71. There was and is no uniformity of practice among the service departments as to the type of staff employed as clerks to Service Attaches.It has been the Admiralty practice to employ civilians, normally clericalofficers, as clerks to Naval Attaches and to rely for this purpose on volunteers.The responsibility for selecting the most suitable candidate from among thevolunteers and for making appointments rested with the Admiralty Branchknown as Civil Establishments I (C.E.I.), but great weight was attached in the selection to the views of the Naval Intelligence Division (N.I.D.)as the division to whom Naval Attaches and their staffs reported and for whom, in the main, they worked. Thus C.E.I. would not appoint NavalAttaches&apos; clerks to whom N.I.D. objected ; and N.I.D.&apos;s association withtheir selection was so close that the Civil Assistant to the Director of NavalIntelligence, Mr. H. V. Pennells, acted as chairman of the selection panelwhich interviewed applicants and made recommendations of appointment tothe Head of C.E.I.72. In view of the major role which Mr. Pennells played in Vassall&apos;sselection and of the dealings which he had at a later stage with the naval attache in Moscow about Vassall, his position in N.I.D. requires someexplanation.   As Civil Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence he
was regarded as having equal rank in the divisional structure with the DeputyDirectors of Intelligence and he reported directly to the Director. He had a wide range of responsibilities within the Division, one of which was tomaintain a general oversight of the civilian staff. This responsibility wasdefined in N.I.D. Standing Orders, Chapter II, paragraphs 0204 (1953 edition)as follows:&quot; He is in general administrative and disciplinary charge of all civilia. ;[jin N.I.D., subject to the understanding that officers having civiliansdirectly under them may assume, with his consent, such supervisorycontrol as is essential for the proper performance of their duties. his duties in respect of civilians cover the following :(a) Annual reports on efficiency and conduct.(b) Civilian staff selections, changes and replacements.(c) Conditions of service, including hours of work, leave, pay, etc.(d) Recommendations for Honours and Awards.He is also responsible for advising as necessary on similar questionswhich may arise concerning other civilian staffs within the NavalIntelligence Organisation which are not under his direct administrativecontrol, e.g., office, staffs of Naval Attaches and Staff Officers(Intelligence).&quot;It was in the discharge of this responsibility that Mr. Pannells participated inthe selection of Naval Attaches clerks.73. In December 1953 it was foreseen that six vacancies for clerks to naval Attaches and to Staff Officers (Intelligence) would arise during thefirst nine months of 1954, one of which vacancies was in Moscow. Inconsultation with Mr. Pennells, Mr. A. V. Dammarell of C.E.I. preparedan Office Memorandum announcing the forthcoming vacancies and calling for applications from clerical officers, aged 23 or over. Despite representa-tions by Mr. Pennells that the field of choice ought not to be restricted by the discouragement of married men, considerations of economy dictatedthat preference should be offered to applicants who were single. The Moscowpost was open to male and female clerical officers and, unlike the otherappointments, it was for a period of two years only a recognition of the strain which service behind the Iron Curtain imposed on Embassy staff.74. In response to the Office Memorandum there were 40 applications forthe Moscow post. However, many of these were from candidates who werenot really suitable and the field of selection for the post was a relativelypoor one. By studying the recent Annual Reports that had been made uponeach applicant by his or her senior officer and such other records as wereavailable to him, Mr. Dammarell reduced the list of applicants to the eightwho were most likely to be suitable. They were all single ; one of them wasVassall. These eight candidates were invited to appear before a selectionpanel for interviews of 20-30 minutes&apos; duration, the panel consisting ofMr. Pennells, as chairman, Mr. Dammarell and an Admiralty Welfare Officer,Miss Jennings. One of the reasons for including Miss Jennings was thatsome of the candidates appearing before the panel were women and it was thought that the presence of a woman on the panel would be fairer to thesecandidates and also be an advantage to the panel in assessing them.
75. When the candidates appeared before the panel on 4th January, 1954,one withdrew her application for family reasons, one was found to be underthe advertised age, and one was ruled out because she had White Russiangrandparents and connexions with Russian emigres and it was thoughtinadvisable to send her to Russia. Of the remainder, Vassall was thoughtA \o be the most suitable, and the panel recommended his appointment toSvlr. R. Millar, the Head of C.E.I. The panel, in submitting his name forapproval, stated that they considered &quot; Mr. W. J. C. Vassall, a CO. aged 29,in War Registry, to be the most suitable candidate for this post&quot;. Theirreport went on to say that vassall&apos;s typing ability had been the only point about which any reserve had been felt; and that D.N.I. had been able toarrange informally for him to&apos; be tested by the C.C.B. typing tutor andthat he had done well on test. The report stated that Vassall was a smart,well-spoken and pleasing personality; and that he was a Roman Catholicwho had made intelligent enquiries and had confirmed the availability of an american Roman Catholic priest to provide religious ministrations at the embassy. He &quot; should therefore prove a politically reliable clerk andsteady character&quot;. The report concluded by saying that vassall&apos;s applica-tion, which was attached, &quot; has an individuality, the applicant is anenthusiastic volunteer, and it is felt that he should prove a good choice &quot;.76. Mr. Millar did not approve this recommendation automatically butput certain questions to Mr. Dammarell. ,He was concerned to establishwhether Vassall&apos;s seniority as a clerical officer was such that appointing himto Moscow would mean that he would be absent when his promotion wasconsidered ; and he also asked: &quot; Has he been vetted as necessary for this special post? &quot; Mr. Millar thus drew attention to the special nature of thepost and sought to ensure that appropriate security inquiries were made,although he in fact had no responsibility for the inquiries and no knowledgeof what they entailed. In reply Mr. Dammarell assured Mr. Millar thatVassall would not enter the promotion field during the term of the Moscowappointment and that, as regards security, &quot; Particulars are taken by D.N.I.and he will be re-vetted before he goes &quot;. Mr. Millar then approved VassalFsappointment on 12th January, 1954. Vassall was notified on 20th Januaryof his appointment, subject to a medical examination, was assigned to N.I.D.as from 22nd February and then departed for Moscow just over a weeklater on 2nd March.77. The security &quot; re-vetting &quot; of Vassall prior to his Moscow appointment,of which Mr. Dammarell wrote, consisted simply of a check of his nameagainst Security Service records to ascertain whether they contained any information about him indicating that he held subversive beliefs. Thischeck was all that was formally required by the current security regulations.The more searching security investigation into a person&apos;s background and character, known as Positive Vetting, was at that time only applied toholders of posts which gave access to classified atomic energy information or which made the holder &quot; privy to the whole of a vital secret process,equipment, policy or broad strategic plan, or to the whole of an importantsection of that process, equipment, policy or plan, where disclosure would beof crucial value to an enemy or potential enemy strategically or politically &quot;.On 31st March, 1954, by which time Vassall was in Moscow, the field to
which Positive Vetting was to apply was extended to include all postsgiving &quot; regular and constant access &quot; to Top Secret defence information.But even as Naval Attached clerk Vassall was not considered to be likelyto have regular and constant access to Top Secret defence information andthe Admiralty did not designate his post as one requiring Positive Vetting.It was in fact not until March, 1958, that the post was so designated, &apos; iresponse to a request by the Foreign Office that all Service Attaches aijytheir staffs should be Positively Vetted in order to conform to the standards which the Foreign Office had adopted for the Foreign Service as a whole.78. However, even before Vassall&apos;s appointment, the Foreign Office had for some time been strongly of the view that a check by the Security service was by itself an insufficient check upon staff selected for service in Embassiesbehind the Iron Curtain. They had sought to persuade the Service Depart-ments to supplement it by adopting some more rigorous method of regulatingselections. The scale and nature of the attempted subversion of Embassystaff behind the Iron Curtain was well-known and came up many times fordiscussion between the Foreign Office and the Service Departments in theappropriate inter-departmental Committee and its Sub-Committees. One suchoccasion is of particular relevance to the question of vassall&apos;s selection.79. On 28th August, 1952, Mr. E. G. Willan of the Foreign Office wrote to Captain D. C. Ingram, one of the Deputy Directors of Naval Intelligence,and to the other Service Departments about the measures the Foreign office had adopted in addition to a Security Service check to try to ensure that persons sent to posts behind the Iron Curtain were reliable; and invited theService Departments to confirm that they also took particular care in selectingService Attaches and their subordinate staff. Captain Ingram replied on 3rd October that &quot;... personnel are always hand-picked for such posts,careful attention being given to general character and reliability. . . .You can, I think, therefore rest assured that all reasonable precautions arebeing taken to ensure that Admiralty appointments to Missions behind theIron Curtain are not filled by personnel who may be likely to prove unsuitable,as special care is always taken when considering these posts.&quot;80. Mr. Willan&apos;s letter was subsequently discussed at a meeting of the relevant inter-departmental Committee dealing with Service Attaches on10th October, which Captain Ingram and Mr. Pennells attended on behalfof the Admiralty. Mr., Willan is recorded as saying that in the ForeignOffice view it was necessary, in addition to normal methods of selection,to take special measures to ensure that individuals were suitable to meetthe strains to which they would be subjected in countries behind the iron curtain ; and as offering to supply the Service Departments with material for briefing staff selected for service in these countries.81. This material, in the form of a lengthy memorandum, was sent to departments on 16th April, 1953. It described the nature of the risks towhich staff in our Embassies behind the Iron Curtain were subjected ; gaveexamples of the ways in which compromising situations had been createdwith the object of blackmailing individuals into undertaking espionage;emphasised that careful selection for these dangerous posts was therefore essential, bearing in mind that bachelors and young girls were the most
vulnerable; and emphasised the need for proper instruction of staff selected for these posts in security principles and in the methods of attack to whichthey might be subjected. This memorandum was studied in N.I.D. by,among others, the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence (Security), whowas responsible for giving security instruction to Naval Attaches taking up1^ appointments behind the Iron Curtain, and by Mr. Pennells. Mr. Pennellsendorsed the memorandum on 15th May: &quot;Noted. I will see that clerks,etc., for Moscow and Warsaw are duly briefed.&quot; (Moscow and Warsaw werethe only two Embassies behind the Iron Curtain at which there were NavalAttaches and subordinate staff.) The papers appear then to have been filedaway.82. We find it difficult to understand how it was that Mr. Pennells, whohad a responsibility to the Director of Naval Intelligence for the selection ofNaval Attaches&apos; clerks, and who knew that selection was made in the verysuperficial way we have described, should have supposed that briefing wasall that was needed to meet the point and should not have felt requiredby these serious warnings to suggest that the selection system itself shouldbe reviewed. Vassall&apos;s selection was based upon a study of some annual reports, which are not intended to give any assessment of an officerscharacter except in so far as it affects the performance of his duties, andone of which showed that Vassall&apos;s judgment was suspect; an interviewof 20-30 minutes&apos; duration; incidental surveillance of him during his attach-ment to N.I.D. of about one week, most of which he spent receiving typinginstruction; and a Security Service check. It must be assumed that Mr.Pennells was aware, from the papers he had seen and the discussion hehad attended, of the need for careful selection. The wording of the submission to Mr. Millar recommending Vassall&apos;s appointment shows that the panelwere alive to security considerations. And Mr. Pennells must also havebeen aware, if he reflected upon the matter at all, that the very sketchyselection system which was followed was inadequate to meet the needs ofthe situation. He was apparently the one person in the Admiralty who knewboth of these aspects of the matter, yet there is no evidence that he soughtany strengthening of the system or the support of D.N.I. or C.E.I. in doing so.83. Admittedly it would have been difficult to devise a really satisfactorysystem for filling these posts, but there are measures which ought to havebeen considered. For example, servicemen might have been employed insteadof civilians. There is nothing intrinsically more reliable about a servicemanthan a civil servant, but the field of selection would have been wider, asit would not be necessary to rely on volunteers, more is probably known about a serviceman&apos;s conduct outside &quot; office hours &quot;, and he is subject to service discipline. Another possibility would be to insist on selection beingmade sufficiently early for the selected clerk to spend a relatively long period in N.I.D. under discreet surveillance. There are obvious objections to carryingsupernumerary staff in this way and it is quite possible that longer surveillancewould not have shown up Vassall&apos;s weakness and unreliability ; but with sometypes of individuals it could have been of value and have prevented unsuitableand potentially dangerous appointments. A third possibility would have been to give preference on security grounds to married clerical officers, in viewof the Foreign Office advice that bachelors and young girls had proved to
foe the most vulnerable to compromise operations. We do not say that anyof these possibilities should necessarily have been adopted, nor do we criticise the Admiralty for their long-standing practice of employing civilians asNaval Attaches&apos; clerks and for preferring to appoint single persons on grounds of economy. But we are strongly of the view that the Director of NavalIntelligence should have been warned that the existing system of selectic Awas not adequate in the new situation that emerged, so that at the appropriate/level an informed decision could have been made as to the changes, if any,that were called for.84. Mr. Pennells is dead and we cannot know his side of the story.His reputation is that of a keen and hard-working officer who was a littlelacking in imagination, an officer to whom N.I.D. owed much. But wecannot escape the conclusion that, although he was efficient and con-scientious and served the Admiralty well, he failed among his otherpressing duties to give this matter the attention it deserved. It wouldbe unjust to conclude that such a man had been negligent of his publicduty. We think it sufficient to say that he was undoubtedly remiss andlacking in judgment in not taking any effective action to have the systemof selection reviewed within the Admiralty.85. Given the system of selection which existed, we find no grounds forcriticism in the fact that it resulted in the choice of Vassall. The composi-tion of the selection panel was well suited to the task, Mr. Pennells andMr. Dammarell both being experienced Senior Executive Officers. Amore senior board would have been too remote from the grade of staffbeing interviewed and would have been less rather than more likely tomake a knowledgeable assessment of them and their work. It is evidentfrom the terms of the paneFs submission recommending Vassall&apos;s appoint-ment that they had security considerations well in mind ; and they cannotbe held blameworthy for failing, in the course of a short interview, toarrive at a true assessment of character. Mr. Millar, in approving theappointment, relied almost wholly on the advice of the selection panel,as he was entitled to, but showed by his questions to Mr. Dammarellthat his approval was a considered one, not given without due thoughtor sense of responsibility.86. We turn now to the related question of the security warnings andinstruction which Vassall received in the Admiralty before his departure forMoscow. We had difficulty in ascertaining what security briefing he wasgiven, because Mr. Pennells, who was responsible for ensuring that he wasproperly briefed, is dead, other members of N.I.D. who might possibly have contributed to his security briefing have now no recollection of doing so, and Vassall&apos;s own evidence on this point is not to be relied upon.He certainly saw a Foreign Office note about the dangers of contractinga marriage with a Soviet citizen, which ended with a reminder of thestanding rule for Embassy staff that any except chance contacts with soviet citizens should be reported without delay, but it is doubtful how much of it he would have taken in. According to him something was said to him in a general way about looking out and taking care of himself in Moscow, but nothing specific. The truth of the matter seems to us to bethat at that period everyone was looking to Mr. Pennells to carry out
the necessary briefing on all such points, and in view of the fact thatMr. Pennells has left no record and Vassall is vague about the whole subject, we cannot say what was the range or detail of his securitybriefing except that we have formed the general impression, aided by what we learnt of the briefing of a girl typist who left for Moscow inNovember 1955, that it was very general and rather hurried.87. Such a briefing is much more limited than the Foreign Officeenvisaged in their memorandum of 16th April, 1953, to which we have referred. We have to recognise that the evidence that has survived doesnot allow us to make any definite finding as to the extent or adequacy of vassall&apos;s oral briefing in the Admiralty before he left for Moscow.In our view this is not the critical point. A detailed briefing beforedeparture from the United Kingdom and a further one on arrival may bea useful safeguard, but of the two we regard the second as much themore important. The impact of a detailed briefing is lost, we believe,when it is given at a time when the recipient is naturally heavily pre-occupied with personal and official problems of moving to a new assign-ment overseas, and when it relates to an environment and an atmospherewhich is remote and has not yet been experienced. Moreover we do not wish it to be thought that we regard briefing as necessarily the same thingas instruction. What matters is to make an impact on the mind of thelistener, and anything that smacks of the hurried and the formal is unlikely to retain the influence that is needed.   &apos;B. The Moscow Period88. Vassall arrived in Moscow at the beginning of March 1954, and, asclerk to the Naval Attache, was himself an attached member of the embassy staff without being actually a member of the Foreign Service.He was to work under and for the Attache, Captain Bennett, R.N., whoseoffice comprised an Assistant Naval Attache, the clerical officer, and atypist, and was later enlarged by the addition of a second Assistant. TheNaval Attache was responsible to the Admiralty for his day-to-day work ;but he was also generally responsible to the British Ambassador for any-thing that affected the local situation and would keep him informed about any matter of policy that could have local significance.89. The responsibilities for security in Moscow reflected this duality.The Ambassador, as local chief, was ultimately responsible for the securityof all Embassy staff, including Service Attaches and their staffs: but,under him, each Service Attache had a direct and immediate responsibilityfor his own office and his own staff. While he reported direct to theAdmiralty on matters concerning his clerical officer, without passing such reports through the Ambassador, any security question, since it affected the security of the Embassy as a-whole, would be brought to the attentionof the Ambassador in the first instance.90. This division of responsibility was, we found, fully understood inthe Embassy at Moscow in the years we are dealing with and was not thought to present any difficulties to the working of an effective securitysystem. Nor do we think that what went amiss was due to any defectin the system caused by this division.  It is however to be noted, when
weighing the responsibilities of the Embassy authorities, that they had nohand at all in the selection of a person in the position of Vassall. Hewas despatched to them by his home Department, the Admiralty, andthey were at least entitled to assume that the man they were receivinginto this sensitive post had been carefully chosen as suitable to meet its rather peculiar requirements. j91. It was not to be expected that the Ambassador could give more thana general directing attention to questions of security. The more immediateresponsibility was discharged on his behalf by the Head of Chancery whoacted as oo-coordinator in security matters for the Embassy as a whole,though without prejudice to a Service Attached right to consult the ambassador direct.92. There was not then, though there is now, a special security officer on the Embassy staff. There was however a Regional Security Officerstationed in Vienna, who visited Moscow for the purpose of making annualinspections and reports. These reports amounted to detailed and compre-hensive reviews of security arrangements, but in the nature of things theycould contribute almost nothing to the elusive question of personal, as opposed to documentary or physical, security.93. So much for the formal responsibilities of those to whom Vassallwas consigned. As we know, within the next 12 months he was to belured into Russian company, compromised, threatened with exposure, and,not long after that, successfully recruited. We thought it important there-fore to inquire closely what efforts were made on his arrival in moscow to condition him against the dangers of being entrapped in some suchway, considering that adequate home briefing could not be taken for granted and it was by then what may be called common learning in theForeign Service that Russian technique included regular attempts to penetrate our security through contrived incidents of this kind.94. For instance, the Foreign Office had on two recent occasions, inMaroh, 1953, and March, 1954, circularised our Embassies behind theIron Curtain with specific warnings about the dangers arising fromunofficial contacts with Russians. Moreover, the Foreign Office Memo-randum on Security of September, 1953, which contained the currentsecurity instructions for Embassies abroad, included two ably-writtenparagraphs (paragraphs 5 and 6) enlarging upon the risks of contrivedcompromise by hostile agents. No attentive reader oould have failed to note the lesson. We have no doubt at all that the Ambassador (sir william Hayter) and all his senior officials in the Embassy were well aware of and alive to danger of this kind: but the practical question is how far the warnings were communicated to and enforced upon the junior staff, a number of whom, not belonging to the Foreign Service,would not even have the background of its general discipline and expertise.95. The practice observed in the Embassy was as follows. Each year the Memorandum on Security was circulated to all members of the embassy Staff who had access to classified material: their duty was to readit and sign an attached sheet saying that they had. A new arrival was required to read and sign on arrival.   The Regional Security Officer
included in his annual review a check on this procedure; and in 1955, butnot in 1954, he noted that the Memorandum had not been seen by allnewly-arrived staff. The inference is that in 1954 he was satisfied thatthere was no omission.96. Apart from being given the Memorandum to read, the new arrivalwas taken in to be introduced to the Head of Chancery, who thereupon gavehim a short talk about local conditions, including in his talk a warning thatcontacts with Russians must be reported to him and must not be pursuedwithout his consent. We were satisfied by the evidence of the two successiveHeads of Chancery in vassall&apos;s time, Mr. Rouse and Mr. Slater, bothof whom gave evidence before us, as well as by the evidence of a numberof other members of the junior staff, that in fact the circulation of theMemorandum and the initial briefing did regularly take place.97. Vassall&apos;s evidence to us, on the contrary, was to the effect that hehad never seen the Memorandum on Security and that no one gave himany specific warning or guidance about Russian contacts until August, 1955,when the entire Embassy staff received addresses on the subject from sir william Hayter or the Minister, Mr. Parrott. The occasion was a Russian-arranged compromise of a woman employee, which necessitated her immediatereturn to the United Kingdom. By this time Vassall himself was already in their toils.98. We do not accept his evidence on this point. He had a naturalreason for representing himself as being as defenceless as possible and hemay well have been in no mood either to attend to or to remember what may have seemed to him unduly restrictive instructions. Indeed it wasplain to us that none of those who were giving evidence at the end of 1962could recall with any precision routines of this kind dating back to someeight previous years: but what impressed us was their general agreement that there had been security briefings on arrival and that they had beenpositively warned to be careful about and to report Russian contacts. It is highly unlikely that for some unascertainable reason Vassall&apos;s was an exception from the general experience, even if no account were taken ofCaptain bennett&apos;s positive statements to us that he himself gave Vassallshortly after his arrival a talk on the whole question of security, with anexplicit warning about the risks of blackmail by the Russians and the dangers of locally-engaged Russian staff.99. Our conclusion is that there was no breach of security arrangements on the part of the Embassy in this respect and that the briefing procedureswere adequately carried out. The particular issue about instructions withregard to the treatment of locally-engaged staff must however be reservedfrom this until we come to deal with the employment of vassalls actualbetrayer, Sigmund Mikhailski.100. The general attitude of the junior staff, as we learnt it in evidence,was to avoid much contact with Russians. They had their warning thatsuch contacts might always turn out to be dangerous. There was the language difficulty. The atmosphere of Moscow was strange and, no doubt,somewhat menacing.   The tendency was to keep in a self-contained group
and to take what relaxation and pleasure they could find among them-selves or in contact with members of other English-speaking Embassies.Vassall evidently took a different line from the first. His social ambitionswere gratified by many contacts in the varied diplomatic circle of moscow and, under the tutelage of Mikhailski, he soon began to go out to Russianrestaurants and, once there, to make what he believed to be Russian friends.None of these contacts or the invitations that followed them was reported by him to the Embassy, and only chance could have brought them to theattention of any of his superiors. No one, so far as we can make out,knew of his Russian contacts except the man who shared his flat and evenhe had no idea how far they had gone. The Embassy staff were not housedin any single area of the city, much less in any composite group of buildings.There was no room for them all in the Embassy itself or its grounds, andthe Russian authorities, probably by policy, were unaccommodating and difficult in the matter of housing. Vassall in fact spent his 2\ years in moscow in various apartments in a block of flats in Ulitsa Narodnaya,in which were lodged some other members of the British Embassy, someof the staff of other Embassies and some foreign, i.e., non-Russian press correspondents. This block was about two miles from the Embassy itself.Its entrance was always guarded by Russian police, but no British Chanceryguards would, of course, have been allowed. In effect, if Vassall or anyother Embassy employee chose to disregard his instructions and take himselfoff into Moscow out of working hours to pursue any contacts he mightlike to make, there was no means by which his superiors could check himor his comings1 and goings nor would anything but the most unlikely accidenthave told them where he was or what company he was keeping.101. At this point we must notice an allegation to which Vassall himselfgave currency by way of self-exculpation and which may have received some support from things said, we think mistakenly, by Press observers in Moscow.This allegation is to the effect that the junior staff in the Embassy wereneglected by their seniors and were left to fend for themselves without anyproper effort being made to provide them with tolerable amenities to mitigate the strain of living under Moscow conditions. Hence, it was suggested,boredom and discomfort themselves contributed to mischief. We can saywithout qualification that we find this allegation to be unfounded: both as applied to the general internal situation of the Moscow Embassy andas applied to Vassall himself.102. To take the general situation first, it has long been recognised bythe Foreign Office that service in an Embassy behind the Iron Curtainimposes exceptional strains on most members of the British staff and thatgood welfare arrangements for their benefit are themselves a positive con-tribution to security precautions. We are satisfied that the seniors at the embassy in Moscow in the years in question were conscious of this require-ment and made a deliberate effort to do what they could to bind the staffinto a reasonably contented body of people and to prevent individuals feel-ing that they were left out in the cold. That is not to say that the main features of life in Moscow under the conditions then prevailing could beanything but rather uncomfortable and disagreeable for most members ofthe staff or that there are not very real difficulties inherent in attempts to stimulate easy social intercourse between all branches of a British Embassy.
But the evidence that we received from many representatives of those whohad served in Moscow in this period, both seniors and juniors, seemed to usboth genuine and convincing, and it was all one way. Life was not easy orvery enjoyable for most of them, but it was agreed that the senior staff didall they could to maintain morale under the hard conditions and did a,f great deal more to get in touch with their juniors and to see to the organisar^- tion of their amusements than would be done in the normal type of Embassy.This, of course, is as it should have been in the circumstances, bult itdisposed for us of the idea that there had been slackness or indifferencein this regard.103. With regard to Vassall himself his complaint seems to us absurd.He may possibly have taken a little time to settle down in the new surround-ings of Moscow, and his undue sensitiveness to social distinctions, to whichwe have already referred, may have at first embarrassed him in an embassy in which he was, after all, a very junior employee. But no one studying the social diary of his Moscow life which he put together at the end ofhis time there could doubt that he quickly entered into and thereafter kept up a full social life, with plenty of contacts within the Embassy and inother Embassies outside it. Within a week of his arrival he was invited tolunch with the Ambassador and his wife, he had supper with Captain Bennetta few days later and lunched with the Head of Chancery, Mr. Rouse, earlyin the following month; and on most days he had social engagements ofone kind or another. It is sufficient, we think, to quote from a letter whichhe wrote to Mr. Pennells nine months after his arrival (10th December,1954): &quot;I am delighted to say how much I am enjoying this post. It hasbeen such a wonderful opportunity to visit such a strange land.&quot;&apos;     &quot; &quot;&apos;, &apos; 1v&quot;&apos;  &apos; &apos;   ;:&apos;&quot;v   &quot; / .104. It seems safe to say therefore that, while those actual comings andgoings of Vassall that led him into such trouble could easily have passedunobserved, he was presenting to the general observer the appearance of a young man who was taking a normal part in the life of the Embassy.  Inthe confined conditions of life under which the staff worked observation ofeach other and, despite warnings about the dangers of listening devices,probably gossip about each other, were more informed than is likely in alarge London office were people assemble in the morning and disappear inthe evening, without much likelihood of outside contact.  We made it our aim therefore to find out what the Embassy opinion of Vassall was, par-ticularly whether he had any reputation of being a homosexual in such senseas would have constituted him a security risk.   For this purpose we tookevidence from 23 different witnesses under or with whom Vassall had served in his Moscow period.105. We are very conscious of the ambiguity of the word homosexualin this connexion. It may denote a man whose natural sexual expressionis with a person of his own sex and who does, either promiscuously orselectively, indulge in sexual practices accordingly: or it may denote a man with the same proclivities who has controlled himself so as not to indulge in the sexual act or has sublimated his sexual desires in other forms of expression. No doubt there are other variants and refinements of thesedistinctions. The basic difficulty, when speaking of homosexuality in relation
to security, is to know how far another person&apos;s. observation can reasonably be expected to go towards detecting either these conditions or thesedistinctions.106. We are satisfied at least on one aspect of this elusive subject:Vassall had no reputation in the Embassy of being a homosexual. Assess-ments of him naturally varied with the means of observation and wit!the interest of the observer. Most men in the junior ranks thought himeffeminate and would refer to him among themselves as &quot; Vera &quot;: none ofthem would admit to having thought him to be an &quot; active homosexual&quot;.In fact, they had no reason to. His conduct in the Embassy was entirelycorrect, and he never did or said anything that could be ground for theforming of such an opinion. The seniors among the male staff do not seem,generally speaking, to have noticed even the effeminacy, nor did they know of any Embassy talk or gossip about him as being a homosexual. Thewomen members of the Embassy, with whom he was evidently popularand among whom he had a number of friends, neither thought him homo-sexual nor had heard any rumours that he was. Only one of the six calledbefore us spoke of &quot; some gossip &quot;, and indeed some gossip, we think, theremust have been. A woman member of the Embassy staff with security trainingtold us explicitly that she never thought of Vassall as a homosexual or asa security risk. He seemed to her happily engaged on his social activities andfor that reason itself less vulnerable than some others who were more atodds with their surroundings. In testing the idea that Vassall&apos;s Embassycolleagues must have been aware of his failing, we were impressed bythe facts that (1) the Naval Attache who succeeded Captain Bennett andunder whom Vassall worked for some six months never suspected his homo-sexuality nor did the Assistant Naval Attache who was there for most ofVassalPs lime ; (2) a colleague who shared a flat with Vassall in UlitsaNarodnaya for most of the whole period thought him not to be homosexual.107. Vassall evidently developed a considerable range of social contactsin Moscow outside the British Embassy. We should not have thought it afeasible proposition for us to try to establish by evidence what sort ofreputation he enjoyed in these circles, in effect the diplomatic colony. It is,we think, highly unlikely that if he was at all notorious as a homosexual inthat milieu some echo of this would not have been heard by responsiblemembers of his own Embassy. But this question of his supposed notorietyhas been brought vividly before the attention of the public by an articlethat appeared in the People on Sunday, 4th November, 1962, under the title headings &quot; &apos; For two years I saw him strutting around Moscow like adressed-up doll&apos;&quot; and &quot;Vassall: the Scandal Grows&quot;. This article hasappended to it a photograph of Vassall and under the photograph the lines&quot; vassall&apos;s way of life was an open secret. Why did the British Embassyturn a blind eye?&quot;.108. The substance of the article, attributed to the paper&apos;s diplomaticcorrespondent, was to assert that men of Vassall&apos;s sort were not regarded as security risks, even if they &quot; flaunted their abnormal characteristics, as he did &quot;. Evidence was now accumulating in London, it was said, that he didnot &quot; bother to conceal his tendencies as far back as 1954, when he servedas a clerk in the British Embassy in Moscow. His conduct was notorious inthe diplomatic colony. His fellow clerks referred to him as &apos; Auntie&apos;.&quot;
109. The article then continued as follows:&quot; Everybody in Moscow seemed to know about Vassall&apos;s peculiarities &quot;,a man who was virtually the next door neighbour of the convicted spytold the People in London last night &quot; He was a laughing stock &quot;.Vassall&apos;s neighbour in 1954 and 1955 was Mr. Stanley Johnson,formerly correpondent in Moscow for the American news agency,Associated Press.&quot; We had flats in the same block at No. 13, Ulitsa Narodnaya&quot;,said Mr. Johnson, &quot; I saw him almost every day during 1954.More than once I saw his face covered in cream. And I shall alwaysremember him strutting about Moscow like a dressed-up doll.iiNobody could make any mistake about Vassall. He shared his flatwith two other British Embassy clerks, but they would have nothing todo with him.They used the two bedrooms in the flat and made him sleep on asofa in the living room.&quot;110. The newspapers own assertions, &quot;he did not bother to concealhis tendencies&quot;, &quot; his conduct was notorious in the diplomatic colony, etc.&quot;,were apparently intended to be by way of comment upon and interpretation of Mr. Johnson&apos;s own contribution. And, coming as it did from a reporterof standing who was speaking as an eye-witness of events in Moscow, itpresented a picture of Vassall&apos;s mode of life there which was not the lessstartling because it was a very different one from that suggested by all theother evidence which we had been able to obtain. Fortunately for the furtherance of our investigation, however, we were able to get in touchwith Mr. Johnson, who was temporarily in London, and to obtain evidence from him direct. We wish to record our sincere gratitude to him for coming forward and submitting himself to examination and cross-examination beforeus and to the frankness and candour with which he gave his evidence under conditions of some difficulty. The impression conveyed by the sum&apos; of his evidence was not that of the article in the People.111. Mr. Johnson, it appeared, though invited to contribute an article tothe paper, as someone who remembered Vassall in Moscow and had in factlived in the Ulitsa Narodnaya block of flats, had explained that he wasnot free to write an article but that he would answer questions put to himby the representatives of the paper and that his answers could be publishedunder his name. This course was followed, and it is proper to record thatthe version of his remarks that was to be attributed to him was read over tohim on the telephone for checking and he accepted it &quot; broadly &quot;.112. The upshot of what he told us in evidence was, however, that hehad been speaking very much at large in what he said to the people and that the factual basis which he was prepared to stand by was a verysmall amount of personal observation, naturally not remembered with perfectclarity after a number of years. We will summarise briefly what it amountedto. Mr. Johnson and a fellow correspondent had shared a flat in the UlitsaNarodnaya block and he went to the Vassall flat from time to time, asthe other occupant of the flat was a member of the Joint Press Reading
Service in Moscow and did some Russian translations for Mr. Johnson.He never came across Vassall elsewhere, except in the corridors of the block of flats, and he could recall no discussions with other people about him,either in the British Embassy or in other quarters. The statements thateverybody in Moscow knew about his peculiarities and that he was notoriousin the diplomatic colony came down to the much reduced fact that he andhis fellow correspondent had formed the opinion that Vassall was &quot; queer &quot;but he had no recollection of anybody else&apos;s impressions to draw upon, though he thought that members of the British Embassy living in the same blockmight have shared his view. The fact that he recalled as the foundation of his own impression was an extravagance of dress: he remembered meetingVassall at the door dressed to go out skating and wearing a sort of woollenbonnet and an excessively long scarf. He did not wish to stand by the phrase &quot; strutting about like a dressed-up doll&quot;: he accepted that it wouldbe fair to describe Vassall generally as quietly dressed, though in somewhatfashionable style. The reference to cream on Vassall&apos;s face meant that hehad seen him in his flat using cream: he did not disagree with Vassall&apos;s own account to us that it was probably Nivea cream used as protection in extremeconditions of weather. Mr. Johnson had never heard Vassall referred to as&quot; Auntie &quot;, nor did he accept &quot; a laughing stock &quot; as his phrase.113. We have gone through these details because it is obvious that the remarks attributed to Mr. Johnson as an independent eye-witness in Moscowwere entitled to weight in the mind of the public and made a contribution to comment on other newspapers which followed the same lines. Having hadthe opportunity of hearing Mr. Johnson in person we are satisfied that his remarks, as reported, conveyed a wrong impression of the facts. There isno evidence to suggest that Vassall ever flaunted his abnormal characteristics ;or that his conduct was notorious in the diplomatic colony; or that hispeculiarities were widely known in Moscow. Incidentally, there is no truth in the story that the two British Embassy clerks who shared his flat wouldhave nothing to do with him and made him sleep on a sofa in the living-room. This sleeping arrangement lasted for a few weeks only, after Vassal!&apos;first arrival in Moscow, when he was quartered temporarily in a flat alreadyoccupied by two others. Thereafter Vassall and one of the others moved into a two-bedroom flat, in which Vassall lived for the rest of his time. Hiscompanion, whom we examined at length, was a friend of his and even he,according to what he told us, did not suspect Vassall of any homosexualpractices.114. Mr. Johnson&apos;s remarks to the People were evidently widely studied.They were quoted to us as one of the sources for an article in the SundayTelegraph of 11th November, which appeared under the headlines &quot;Reporton Vassall was ignored &quot; and &quot; Moscow links known: Admiralty accused &quot;.The article was under the name of Mr. Ian Waller, the newspapers politicalcorrespondent and himself a lobby correspondent in the House of Commons.115. The opening paragraph of this article contained the three followingsentences &quot; John Vassall, the convicted Admiralty spy, was known to Britishdiplomats in Moscow as a homosexual. His contacts with the Russiansthere were also known. But, according to Foreign Office circles, reports on him by the Embassy were ignored by the Admiralty.&quot;
116. These statements, if true, would be serious reflections upon the sense of responsibility of officials of the British Embassy in Moscow or of theAdmiralty or of both. Their basis, as explained to us by Mr. Waller,was the contact which he enjoyed, as a lobby correspondent, with a largenumber of Members of Parliament. Among them he had found a &quot; strong feeling&quot; that matters were or must be as he stated them in his article:indeed he himself thought it &quot; inconceivable&quot; that Vassall had not been known in Moscow for a homosexual. He could not recall that any particularmember had contributed any particular piece of information on the matteror that any one of them had claimed any personal knowledge of the subject.117. How little truth there is in the first two sentences of the paragraphwe have quoted will appear from what we have said in Part I and in this chapter. As to the third sentence and the assertion that the Admiraltyignored reports on Vassall sent by the Embassy, the Embassy sent no such reports and there was nothing for the Admiralty to ignore. Mr. Waller&apos;sattribution of this assertion to &quot; Foreign Office circles &quot; was not based on anycontact that he had himself had with any member of the Foreign Office:he thought that he was reflecting broadly opinions that he believed to beheld in the Foreign Office.118. So far we have confined ourselves to our inquiry into Vassall&apos;general reputation inside and outside the Embassy in Moscow. We must nowaddress ourselves to the difficult question whether any of those persons inthe Embassy who had responsibility for his security were lax or remiss in not detecting that they had among them a homosexual in a sensitive postand in not taking some protective action accordingly, as by insisting onhis recall or in some way bringing suspicion to the proof. In effect thismeans a somewhat detailed consideration of the attitude and observation ofCaptain Bennett, the Naval Attache when Vassall first joined and, to a lesser degree, of his successor, Captain Northey, and of the Ambassador,Sir William Hayter.119. Captain Bennett was vassalls superior, he had direct responsibilityfor the security of his office and he had exceptional opportunities ofobserving Vassall from day to day and at close quarters in his work as hisclerk. Indeed for the first part of Vassall&apos;s service, until the arrival of asecond Assistant Naval Attache involved a rearrangement of rooms,Vassall shared a room with Captain Bennett and his Assistant in the service attaches&apos; wing of the Embassy building.120. Captain Bennett gave evidence before us on more than one occasion.He did not prove to be in all respects a witness to whom it was easy todo justice. He had plainly been very much disturbed when he learnt in1962 that his confidential clerk in Moscow had been working for the Russiansunder his very nose and, as a good officer, he felt very keenly the possibility that he might himself have in some measure contributed to making this possible. In the result he had, we think, gone over his recollection ofevents again and again in his own mind, until on some points he gave theimpression of a precision and clarity of recollection that seemed almostunreal.  Nevertheless, we formed the conclusion at the close of his evidence
that he was essentially an honest witness, who was faced with the considerabledifficulty of trying to make clear to us long after the event ideas andperceptions that were not so clear at the time of their birth.121. For Captain Bennett had certainly entertained a suspicion that Vassallmight be a homosexual, what he described to us with perhaps some over-elaboration as &quot;a possible, latent homosexual&quot;: and he assured us with complete candour that he was fully aware of the security risk represented by anyone in Vassall&apos;s position who might be exposed to involvement incompromising incidents, and would have thought it his duty, if satisfied thatVassall was a homosexual in an active sense, to press strongly for his recall.The question that we had to form our conclusion on was how far CaptainBennett&apos;s suspicions had really gone.122. When Vassall first joined him in Moscow Captain Bennett was verydissatisfied with him. He thought him indolent and incompetent, and after three months of exasperation he gave him a stern warning that he wouldhave to go back to England if he did not improve. Socially, he regardedhim at first as a misfit in the Embassy. All this however was to undergo a rapid improvement. Vassall began to give much better service, and captain Bennett was able to report by the end of the year 1954 that hiswork was in general satisfactory, that he was trying hard to please, andwas socially acceptable &quot;despite his handicap of an irritating, effeminatepersonality &quot;.123. It was this effeminacy that was worrying Captain Bennett. Whenhe was back in London in August, 1954, he took the opportunity, he said,to mention the point to Mr. Pennells at the Admiralty, along with his other causes of dissatisfaction with Vassall. No reaction seems to have followedor is recorded. Again, in the autumn of 1954, he brought the matter upin some form at a talk with the Ambassador. We were not able to getany clear idea as to what shape this talk took. Sir William Hayter himself,while not denying that something was said, remembered it only in the vaguestway and thought that the allusion to Vassall was made half jokingly. CaptainBennett, though confident that he had brought it up in a serious way becauseof his then misgivings, did not wish us to understand that he had specificallyasked for the Ambassador s advice or directions or had consulted him about any proposed action.124. In November, 1955, Captain Bennett wrote his second report onVassall, just before he himself left his post. Evidently his attitude towardshim had changed very much in the meantime, and the remarks in it are sufficiently noteworthy to require quotation in full. &quot; After a poor start&quot;,it runs, &quot; he has developed into a first rate clerk who, except for occasionallapses into inaccuracy, can be trusted to work hard and well. I should beglad to have him as my secretary almost anywhere. ... A pleasant youngman of first-class appearance and manners. Never ruffled. Always helpful.His moral standards are of the highest. A distinct social asset to the Embassystaff.&quot;125. Captain Bennett told us in his evidence that a few weeks later,when handing over to Captain Northey, he mentioned to him the suspicions
that he had or had had that Vassall was a &quot; possible latent homosexual&quot;.The latter did not recall this, though he thought it not unlikely. His own judgement of Vassall was that he was &quot; rather a pansy little man &quot;, but nota homosexual, and he thought that &quot; pansy &quot; was the phrase that CaptainBennett had used to him. We ourselves cannot think that, having regardto the terms in which Captain Bennett had just reported to the Admiralty,Kjhe can ever have used words to his successor that conveyed the impression of a warning: or that, if he had, Captain Northey would not have takenspecial note of them.126. We can now assess Captain bennett&apos;s attitude and knowledge up tothe time when he left Moscow, and ask whether there was any action whichit was his duty to take and which he omitted. Clearly he did at first suspectthat Vassall might be a homosexual, judging solely by the evidence of hisappearance and manner. He was uneasy about it and mentioned hisuneasiness in some form or another both to Mr. Pennells and to Sir WilliamHayter, to see if he would get from either of them any confirmation of hissuspicions or suggestions of action. He got nothing. As time went on andVassall&apos;s conduct continued to appear unexceptionable, Captain Bennett&apos;ssuspicions were allayed, in the sense that he came to feel sure that, whateverVassalFs sexual inclinations might be, he was in full control of them andwas not therefore a security risk. His second report, with its singulartribute, &quot; his moral standards are of the highest&quot;, is only explicable to us as an intended recantation of the suspicions implied by his earlier referenceto an &quot; irritating effeminate personality&quot;. Moreover it is evident thatCaptain Bennett not only liked Vassall but felt no social disapproval of him,since after they were both back in London he and his wife saw himoccasionally, visited his flat and invited him to their son&apos;s wedding.127. It would be too much to say, we think, that Captain Bennett evergot so far as to dismiss entirely from his mind the notion that Vassall washomosexually inclined. We could not help being impressed by the evidenceof the two security officers who visited him just before vassalls arrest to inquire about his Moscow experience of Vassall, that Captain Bennett volun-teered to them the remark that one thing that he must mention about Vassallwas that he was &quot; an undoubted homosexual&quot;. The truth is, we think, that,once it was seen that other people were suspecting Vassall, the old doubtrecurred to his mind and presented itself afresh as a security consideration.The Ambassador himself used virtually the same words when, writing toCaptain Bennett after Vassall&apos;s committal proceedings, he spoke of his&quot; obvious weakness &quot;. Yet neither of them, we think, was able to find the weakness obvious at the relevant time, in any sense that allowed them totake action with regard to it.128. What, if anything, was Captain Bennett to do in this situation? Hehad not chosen Vassall for the post. Vassall had been chosen for him, andhe was entitled to assume, even if unfoundedly, that a proper process ofscreening and selection had been employed. He had nothing but Vassall&apos;sappearance and manner to go by: and these, though they were capable ofrousing suspicions in some observers, were only material for guesswork and could not justify any formal imputation to their owner of a sexual abnor-mality that would be wounding to many people and might well affect
his, whole future employment. There were no incidents to lay hold of orreport: there was in fact no material to found on at all. Conceivably, CaptainBennett might have tackled Vassall, speaking as an older man and hissuperior, and tried to see if he would admit to his suspected weakness ; but itwould have been an extraordinarily difficult thing to do, and he is not to beblamed for not attempting it. Lastly, he had no means at hand of makinginquiries of third parties by way of a special security investigation intoVassall&apos;s habits and way of life even if that would have told him anything: -and we accept the view that personal inquiries in the Embassy were, inpractice, virtually impossible owing to considerations of propriety and staffmorale.129. We have given the question very anxious thought. The situation asrevealed to us is a curious one and it brought home to us how very elusiveare apparently simple phrases, such as &quot; reasonably suspected of homosexualtendencies &quot;, when it comes to applying them by practical action: particularly,we must emphasise, when the question is not of selecting one out of other possible candidates for a post to which none is committed but of rejectingin disgrace a person already selected, when the objections to him are thoseof impression only. We conclude therefore on this point that there was nothing remiss or careless in Captain bennett&apos;s discharge of his respon-sibilities by reason of the fact that, knowing what he did, he did not recom-mend or press for Vassall&apos;s recall as a security risk.130. What we have said of him covers also Sir William Hayter and CaptainNorthey. The former, as Ambassador, could not be expected to have anybut the most brief and occasional observation of Vassall, and he is onlybrought into the matter at all by the talk that Captain Bennett had with himsome time in the autumn of 1954. Whatever form that talk took, it did not amount either to a positive request for advice or a report for aotion, and wethink that on that basis the Ambassador would be correct in supposing thatif Captain Bennett, the immediate superior in daily touch with Vassall, hadno concrete ground for action, there was nothing that he himself could requireto be done. Captain Northey, as we have said, did not himself entertainthe same suspicions of Vassall as Captain Bennett had, and we are not ableto accept that he received anything amounting to a warning about him.131. We investigated the system of documentary security observed in the embassy, so far as it affected the papers of the Naval Attached office. Wehave already described in the opening part of our Report the method ofabstracting documents followed by Vassall; and have explained how difficultit is to detect a trusted clerk in such operations, unless there is prior sus-picion. It does not appear to us to be necessary to set out here any detailedaccount of the general system of safeguarding the custody of documents,except to say that we were satisfied that it was an efficient one. All documents of any security classification were kept in a specially protected room, theregistry. The Naval Attache had a cupboard for his papers in this registry,and Vassall as his clerk had access to the cupboard when the registry was open, but had no access to the registry itself until it was opened for himby one of the registry clerks, who alone knew the combination control. Theseclerks kept the keys to the Naval Attached cupboard in the registry andwould hand them to Vassall when he asked for them.
132. It was VassaFs duty to get the papers for the day out of the cuprboard in the morning and to put them away in the evening and for theluncheon break, when the Naval Attached office would be empty. Normally,the Attached incoming mail was brought to him by Vassall in a sealedenvelope, without being first opened by the registry clerks. Papers were thenlogged in by Vassall and filed, except that certain papers of special secrecyfT were seen only by the Naval Attache himself and then kept in sealedenvelopes with his signature across the flap. Neither Captain Bennett norhis Assistant Attache, Lieutenant-Commander Rous-Moore, recalled any difficulty or suspicious delay in tracing a document when it was called for:nor did such occasional musters of documents as were made reveal anything to be missing. Confidential papers, when ready for destruction, were torn upin the office and then taken down in a sack to be burnt in an incinerator inthe Embassy grounds. It was vassall&apos;s duty to carry out this task withregard to Naval papers. The incinerator was, according to the witnesses whospoke of this, quite efficient for its task, though old-fashioned, and we could see nothing to find fault with in the method employed. Vassall gave us noreason to suppose that he had made use of his trips to the incinerator withthe multilated waste in order to abstract any of the documents that he took.133. Finally, we must consider whether there was anything blameworthyin the employment and retention of Mikhailski, the agent of the Russian secret service who was the instrument by which they secured their hold on Vassall.This man was engaged at some date in the early months of 1954 the actualdate was never established for us to act as an assistant in the administrativesection of the Embassy. He worked under another locally-engaged man,Costaki, of Greek origin, and he very soon made himself useful to the embassy staff as interpreter and local agent for arranging such matters ashelping with the Russian servants, travel facilities, theatre and ballet reser-vations, shopping expeditions in Moscow, etc. Services such as these areof real importance in contributing to the ease and convenience of the british staff, particularly with the language difficulty between English and Russian,and somehow they must be provided for in the general interests of staffmorale.134. The whole question of the advantages and drawbacks of locally-engaged staff in our Embassies is a long-standing one in the Foreign Office.They constitute, of course, a fixed security risk. To an experienced memberof the Service it comes as a natural assumption that, if not all, at any ratesome, of such employees will be in the service of and reporting to the localpolice or espionage agency, and it is habitual to take precautions accordingly.People sent out from England for a year or two of attachment do not, very likely, share the same instinctive suspicion: for safety, they should be speciallywarned and somehow kept on the alert. If proper precautions are taken, theadvantages of employing some local staff in a foreign capital are very con-siderable, both because they are inevitably more efficient, working in their home town, and more easily adjusted to conditions and also because theyease the problems of expense and of accommodation.135. In Moscow all these considerations applied in an intensified form.It would certainly have been very difficult and probably not at all satis-factory to have recruited at home the whole Embassy staff of, say, cooks,
maids, cleaners and chaffeurs and brought them out from England. On theother hand, it was impossible to suppose thalt any such persons, locallyrecruited, would not either be already under the control of the Russian secret service and serving them as agents or reporters or else could be broughtquickly enough into that conltrol, once they had taken up work in our embassy. No engagement of local staff was permitted except through Burobin,a branch of the Russian Foreign Office, which, on application, supplied thewants of foreign Embassies in respect of local staff. There was no meansof checking references or otherwise vetting staff so supplied, except so faras was possible through an informal exchange of names between co-opera-tive Embassies. The only safe line was to assume that all such people were or soon would be under hostile control and to plan defences accordingly.136. Generally speaking, we find that they were well planned from thispoint of view. We have already spoken of the special security room forclassified documents: no locally-engaged staff were allowed access to it orto its vicinity. Staff such as cleaners worked under the observation ofChancery guards when in any part of the Embassy buildings in whichconfidential talk could take place: this to reduce the constant danger fromthe insertion of listening or photographic devices under the instructions of the Russian Secret Service. Members of the Embassy were warned ofthe security risk attending any oral discussion of secret matters within the embassy building or in the presence of local staff and there were rulesabout the conduct of such discussions. All such precautions were sensibleand needed: what was not so well worked out or ordered were measures for counteracting the danger to personal security involved in contacts withthe locally-engaged staff, and the resulting risks of arranged compromise.137. Warnings about contacts with Russians and the reporting of them were, as we have found, given to all the Embassy staff and, on the whole,they sank in, at any rate so far as to create a general awareness thatalertness and prudence were called for. But it seems to us clear thatoontacts with Russians and others locally engaged and working with andfor the home-based staff necessarily raised the problem in a rather differentform, because in some cases the contacts themselves were both recurringand unavoidable, and they were bound to be followed in time by a certainamount of personal familiarity. Such oontacts could become dangerousvirtually unobserved. As Mikhailski&apos;s &apos;own activities in the Embassy were an outstanding instance of the danger and its consequences, we can mostusefully deal with the matter in terms of his employment.138. Mikhailski was supplied to the Embassy by the Burobin agency.The circumstances themselves were suspicious, since a week or so beforein Gorki Park he had approached one of the Embassy staff who wasRussian speaking and inquired about the chance of employment. He was referred to Burobin. On the other hand, the move was perhaps too obviousto be regarded as significant, and it was known that to refuse anyoneoffered by Burobin was normally followed by months of delay. So he was engaged.139. He was evidently a man of insinuating and attractive manners. Hewas, or said he was, a Pole and in conversation with people at the Embassyhe would indicate a lack of sympathy with the Soviet regime.  He made
himself very useful to several of them with small, but appreciated, services.There is no doubt that he quickly made a number of friends and before long was received as a guest at parties given by members of the Embassystaff and accompanied some of them when dining out at Moscow restaurants.The kind of services that he performed, securing theatre and travel tickets,buying food in the market, made it natural that he should have free accessrto the flats of staff members and, once admitted, hospitality very easilyfollowed.140. The senior staff, most of whom seem, unlike the junior staff, to havedisliked and distrusted him from the first, were unaware, we think, of theextent to which Mikhailski had made himself familiar with many membersof the Embassy. Scattered as was the living accommodation, it must havebeen very difficult to know the details of what was going on. Had theauthorities realised it earlier, they would have taken action more rapidly and more decisively than they did. But here, as we see it, there is to be observed a weakness in the Embassy&apos;s protective arrangements, for untilthe very end of 19.55 it is not possible to find that there was any clearly defined rule either formulated or enforced with regard to contacts withlocally-engaged staff that went beyond the necessary administrativeexchanges.141. Neither of the two Heads of Chancery at this period had formedany settled policy about these contacts. They would not, as we understoodthem, have objected to Mikhailski being invited to parties or to his receivinghospitality. They would, on the other hand, have assumed that all such persons would be regarded with suspicion by members of the Embassy andwould have expected Russian contacts introduced by them to be reportedin accordance with the standing rule.142. Our inquiries of the junior staff showed us that at this period therewas no sufficient realisation of the reserve required in dealing with a man of Mikhailski&apos;s origins, nor were they all as clear as they should have been as to how far they could go in admitting him to their company. Someindeed were fully alive to the necessary suspicion of all locally-engagedstaff ; but even so it seems to us doubtful whether in the case of Mikhailskithey were not to some extent put off their guard by his plausibility andhis general social acceptance.143. This matter came to a head towards the end of 1955. The sequence of events is not altogether clear to us, when the documents and the oral evidence given to us are put together, but what is beyond doubt is thatone member of the staff of the Embassy had become increasingly con-concerned during that year at the. pattern of attempted penetration by theRussian Secret Service and the lack of understanding of the dangers on thepart of some members of the junior staff ; and in particular had kept aneye on Mikhailski and his deliberate cultivation of contacts. From timeto time, though holding no official responsibility in this field, this memberof the staff pressed Mr. Slater, the Head of Chancery, for at any rate more effective action in the way of warnings and for consideration of the wisdom of retaining Mikhailski at all in the Embassy service. Mr. Slater seemsnot to have been easy to persuade that any further action would be effective or necessary: but it is due to him to say that on 1st December,
1955, just before leaving for England on holiday, he issued a circular toall members of the Embassy staff reminding them of their duty to reportRussian contacts, and on 3rd December, presumably as a result of a paper on the subject prepared by the member of the staff referred to which hadby then reached the eye of the Ambassador and been approved by him,a second short circular was sent round stressing the danger of oontaotswith locally-engaged staff no less than with other Russians and making special reference to Mikhailski by name.144. From that time forward Mikhailski may be said to have been officially under special rather than general suspicion: but he was not gotrid of. The question whether to get rid of him or to keep him on came up albout that time, either December 1955 or January 1956 and, we were told, was much discussed. After whatever discussions took place, it wasdecided, with the approval of the Ambassador, to retain him. The balanceof argument was, apparently, in favour of the view that, if he was gotrid of, he would only be followed in due course by a successor no lessunder Russian control. It had also to be said that experience suggestedthat there would be considerable delay in supplying that successor andthey would be unlikely to get another man as useful and obliging as hehad been in serving the needs of the staff. This was a matter of some importance, having regard to the desirability of making local conditionsas pleasant as possible.145. No one now claims that the decision to retain Mikhailski was aright decision in the light of all that later became known about him. Wethink the argument that prevailed, that he would only be replaced by the successor equally under control, was an injudicious one: for the specialdanger in Mikhailski was that he was so insinuating and skilful in hisdevelopment of his oontacts, and a new man coming in would have to start all over again with new oontacts in the Embassy and without necessary -sarily possessing MikhailskFs appeal. Nevertheless, the decision was a reasoned one, taken under very difficult conditions that could never admitof a wholly satisfactory solution, and it is not this decision itself that we find deserving of adverse comment. It is what was to follow that we mustfind fault with.146. It seems clear that the warning circular about Mikhaiilski, whichhad been issued on the 3rd December, produced results, for by 16thDecember, Miss Wynne, a typist in the office of the Military Attache, whowas herself a friend of and much cultivated by Mikhailski, reported severalinvitations passing between them and was warned to be on her guard andto report further from time to time. She reported again on the 8th january to the effect that he had said something to her indicating positively thathe. was under Russian control.   Then, on the 13th January, BrigadierDavidson-Houston, then Military Attache, passed a minute to Mr. CVRegan,who was acting as Head of Chancery in Mr. Slater&apos;s absence on leave,confirming that what Mikhaiilski had said to Miss Wynne appeared to her to refer to the Soviet authorities.  The minute then proceeded as follows:&quot; 2. She [i.e., Miss Wynne] also volunteered the information thatMikhailski&apos;s recent &apos; targets&apos; have been:Military Attached Office: Mr. Mullett
Naval Attached Office: Mr VassallAir Attached Office: Nil, as Mr. Feld was not well disposed towardshimEngineers: Mr. Bedworth (now gone)Wireless: Mr. Barklamb (now gone)r 3. I have no evidence, however, that his friendly approaches have..v   been other than innocent.&quot;On this minute Mr. 0&apos;Regan wrote, &quot; I have at any rate several times observedhim going to Narodnaya and Sadovaya on Sundays and after hours. H.M.M.has informed HE.&quot;147. The history of action taken on this minute is obscure. Mr. Parrott,the then Minister, satisfied us that he had no recollection of ever seeing itor of speaking to the Ambassador about it. He could not explain Mr.0&apos;Regan&apos;s reference to him in the minute. Mr. 0&apos;Regan is dead. the ambassador could not remember seeing the minute, but told us franklythat he thought that he must have. Mr. Slater, who came back from leaveat the end of January, remembered seeing it and remembered much further discussion with Mr. 0&apos;Regan and Mr. Burden (head of the administrativesection) on the subject of Mikhailski, hut he evidently thought that any positive action that the minute called for would already have been taken before his return.148. The result is that no one approached Vassall on the matter to try to find out how far his contacts with Mikhailski had gone or whether anything untoward had come of them. It seems certain that the minute,which pointed clearly to attempted penetration of the Service Attaches&apos;offices along with the other sensitive parts of the Embassy, was neverdiscussed at any of the weekly meetings which the Service Attaches held with the Ambassador. Neither the Air Attache nor his Assistants couldrecall hearing of it: nor could Captain Northey or either of his Assistants,Lieutenant-Commander Rous-Moore and Commander James. The military attache himself spoke to and warned his own clerk, Mr. Mullett, who was mentioned in the minute: but no attempt seems to have been made to follow up the matter with either Vassall or the two who had gone home, Mr.Bedworth and Mr. Barklamb. Captain Northey did independently give allthe staff in his office an instruction that they must have nothing to do with Mikhailski outside office hours. This was given some time at the endof January, 1956 (he had been away in Warsaw, his other post, for part ofthe period December-January) and was either a reflection of the generalChancery circular of the 3rd December or of the discussions about avoidingcontacts between Mikhailski and juniors which Mr. Slater took up on his return.149. Looking back now, it is not easy for us to account for the inactionover this minute. It seems probable that it was due to the combination oftwo separate circumstances Mr. Slater&apos;s absence on leave and CaptainNorthey&apos;s absence in Warsaw. Later, when everyone was back again andthe discussion about what to do with Mikhailski was resumed, the actualcontents of the minute, which had not, it is true, said that his approaches
were known to be other than innocent, were overlooked and treated as merelyone contribution to the general misgivings that were troubling everybody,150. It must remain speculation to-day whether anything useful wouldhave come out of an interview with Vassall at the time and an insistence on being told all that had passed in his contacts with Mikhailski. Vassallhad by then been working for the Russians for over six months and I was firmly compromised. After the compromise case of the woman employee&apos;in the Embassy in August, 1955, when all the staff were specially remindedof the dangers of contacts, Captain Bennett had spoken to him directly and asked if he had any difficulties, and he had confessed nothing. On theother hand Vassall was not a strong or resolute character and he was stillyoung as a spy. There speculation must rest.151. Mikhailski himself remained in the service of the Embassy until september, 1956, an object of increasing suspicion to the senior members.In that month there was an attempt by the Russian Secret Service to recruitby blackmail an Embassy wireless maintenance engineer through black-market offences into which he had been led by Mikhailski. He reported thematter and was promptly sent home. Mikhailski was then got rid of. even so, he left a trail of mischief behind him in the Embassy. He had, before his dismissal, involved a clerk to the Air Attache in black-market operations and in April, 1957, the Russian Secret Service tried to use this as a handleagainst the man concerned. He reported the attempt and was sent home.From information furnished by him it would appear that yet another memberof the staff had also been assisted by Mikhailski in black-market deals duringthe years 1955-56.  Nothing is known to have come of this.152. We can now state in summary form the conclusions that we have come to on the issues raised by this account of Vassall&apos;s Moscow period.(1) Vassall was adequately warned on arrival as to the dangers ofcontacts with Russians and of compromise arising from contrivedincidents.(2) The general security system observed in the Embassy was sound and well maintained.(3) There was no neglect by senior officials of a proper attention to thecomfort and welfare of the junior staff.(4) There was no carelessness on the part of anyone in not detectingVassalFs abstraction of documents.(5) Vassall had no reputation of being a homosexual, either in the embassy or in diplomatic circles or elsewhere in Moscow. He didnot &quot; flaunt&quot; or otherwise give any obvious indication of hisproclivities.(6) Neither Sir William Hayter nor Captain Bennett nor Captain Northeyis to be blamed for not identifying him as a security risk on theground of homosexuality and demanding his recall accordingly.(7) There was not sufficiently strict control of association between members of the Embassy staff and locally-engaged employees untilthe end of the year 1955.
(8) The retention in the Embassy service of Mikhailski, while not itselfcalling for adverse criticism in the circumstances, required the activerecognition of a special risk and should have involved directquestioning of Vassall after receipt of the Military Attached minute of 13th January, 1956. The responsibility for not taking this actionr must be shared between the senior officials of the Embassy at thattime, but the evidence is not precise enough to enable responsibility to be allocated more closely.C. Positive Vetting153. The post in Naval Intelligence Division to which Vassall was assignedwas one in which he would need to have regular access to Top Secret defenceinformation, including information from International Defence Organisations,and some access to classified atomic energy information. It was consequentlya post to which the special security screening known as Positive Vettingapplied, in accordance with the policy laid down for all Departments ina Treasury circular of 31st March, 1954.154. Under this policy the posts which were at that time subject toPositive Vetting were:(a) those which required regular and constant access to Top Secretdefence information or material; and(b) those which gave access to classified atomic energy information.There were two significant distinctions between these two categories whenit came to the application of Positive Vetting. In the first category access to Top Secret defence information had to be &quot; regular and constant&quot; andnot merely occasional, if the post were to be subject to Positive Vetting;whereas, in the second, any access to classified atomic energy information,however occasional, entailed Positive Vetting. And because at that time thespecial investigators carrying out the ifield inquiries involved in the PositiveVetting process were heavily overloaded and there was a serious backlogof investigations, Departments were necessarily employing many people inthe first category of posts who had not yet been positively vetted, in orderthat the day-to-day work of Departments could proceed; but no suchdispensation was permitted in the second category and no individual was allowed any access to classified atomic energy information until the PositiveVetting procedure was satisfactorily completed. This stricter application ofPositive Vetting in the field of atomic energy was a requirement of theagreement between the United Kingdom and the United States for theexchange of atomic energy information.155. These distinctions between the two categories initially affectedVassalFs employment in Naval Intelligence Division. He was allowed toundertake forthwith those duties of his post which involved access to TopSecret defence information without awaiting Positive Vetting clearance, buthe did not undertake the duties which would give him access to classifiedatomic energy information until the full Positive Vetting procedure had beencompleted. His name was submitted for Positive Vetting on 7th August,1956, and his clearance for access to classified atomic energy information and for regular and constant access to Top Secret defence information was issued on 10th December, 1956.
156. Because of the importance which must be attached to the failure ofthis Positive Vetting investigation to reveal any significant indication thatVassall was a homosexual or that he was other than a reliable and trust-worthy person, we consider it desirable to describe fully the scope of the investigation that was undertaken. The procedure followed was thatprescribed in the Treasury instructions of 31st March, 1954, and although,as we explain later, we consider that the investigation was unsatisfactory inone respect, this involved a defect of judgment and not a failure to carryout the stated requirements of that procedure.157. After ascertaining that the Security Service had no adverse informa-tion about Vassall in their records, the Admiralty Branch responsible for the positive Vetting of Admiralty civilian staff, Civil Establishments III, askedVassall to complete a standard security questionnaire. In this he nominatedtwo referees, to whom letters were sent asking for information bearing on hisreliability and character. The referees&apos; replies revealed that, although theymay have been well-acquainted with Vassall some 12 years previously, theywere now out of touch with him; Vassall himself had said, in submittingtheir names, that they were the same referees as he gave when he first joined the Admiralty. He was therefore asked to nominate two other refereeswith more recent knowledge of him in his private life. He gave the names of two ladies who had known him and his family for nine and 10 yearsrespectively; letters were sent to them and satisfactory replies received.All the documents and correspondence were then sent by Civil Establish-ments III to the Investigating Team of the Ministry of Supply for com-pletion of what were known as &quot; field enquiries &quot;. Although this team was employed by the Ministry of Supply they provided a common service to departments generally in the Home Civil Service in conducting field enquiriesabout their staff and they worked directly to the Departments using their services.158. It is necessary at this point to explain the respective responsibilities of the Admiralty and the Investigating Team in this Positive Vetting investi-gation. It was the responsibility of the Admiralty, as the Departmentemploying Vassall, to conduct the preliminary enquiries which we have described ; and, finally, to assess all the information about him disclosedby the Positive Vetting investigation and to decide whether a PositiveVetting clearance should be granted or withheld. The Investigating Teamwere responsible for field enquiries in which, by means of personal inter-views with the subject and such other persons as might be able to assistthe investigation, a sufficiently firm and coherent view of the subjecfsbackground, character and interests could be established to enable theemploying Department to determine his fitness to occupy a Positive \ ettingpost. The criteria for assessing trustworthiness, which investigating officers had to bear in mind in pursuing their enquiries, were listed in an annex to the Treasury instruction of 31st March, 1954. These covered not onlymembership of subversive organisations and similar considerations of directrelevance to security but also serious character weaknesses of a kind whichmight make a person unreliable or subject to blackmail. Thus any evidencethat the person being investigated had or was reasonably suspected of havinghomosexual tendencies would automatically have raised a presumption that:he was unfit to occupy a Positive Vetting post.
159. The extent of the field enquiries was not specifically laid down inthe Treasury instruction. The person being investigated was to be inter-viewed, so that the Investigating Officer could make an estimate of hischaracter and obtain at first hand some knowledge of his interests and wayof life; ascertain from him certain background information which would assist in supplementary enquiries; and check and ampify the answers givenKJoy him in the security questionnaire, for example, by examining his passportto check foreign travel and residence. Beyond this the Treasury instructionsleft it to the discretion of the Investigating Officer to decide what further enquiries should be made, but it was the invariable practice to interviewthe two nominated referees and to seek to interview the people who had beenthe subjects supervisory officers or previous employers during the precedingfive or more years. It was also the usual practice to make certain otherchecks of official records. If these enquiries revealed a good and consistentpicture of the subjects character, interests and way of life and revealednothing to indicate that he might not be reliable, they would normally be regarded as sufficient. If the enquiries did not produce a sufficiently clear picture, or if they threw up any &quot; adverse&quot; information, the Investi-gating Officer would make such further enquiries as he could in order topresent the employing Department with sufficient material upon which tomake a balanced assessment. The Investigating Officers findings were sub-mitted, through his senior officers in the Investigating Team, to the employingDepartment in the form of a detailed report, identifying the sources of theinformation used in it. If the Department, after studying the report, were of the view that more background information on the subject was necessary before they could make their assessment of the case, it was their duty to askfor further enquiries to be made.160. The Investigating Officer conducting the field enquiries in VassalfsPositive Vetting was Mr. E. S. Sherwood, a Security Officer, Grade II, whoworked under the supervision of Mr. C. F. James, Security Officer, Grade I,and the head of the Investigating Team, Mr. H. W. White. It does notappear that these latter made any material contribution to Mr. Sherwood&apos;work in the investigation. He was not an inexperienced officer, having atthat time served for 12 months in the Investigating Team and havingpreviously served in the Nigeria Police, retiring with the rank of DeputyCommissioner. We have studied the report that Mr. Sherwood made tothe Admiralty on these enquiries, taken evidence from him and fromMr. White, and taken evidence or received statements from most of thepersons who contributed to the enquiries. We have no doubt that the reportrecords faithfully the enquiries that Mr. Sherwood made and the information and assessments that he obtained.161. Mr. Sherwood&apos;s investigations followed closely the standard patternwhich we have described. He interviewed Vassall, obtained from himdetails of his personal history, interests and associations, checked his pass-ports and confirmed that he had taken a number of short holidays abroadsince 1949, including a visit to the United States and Canada in 1956, andnoted that some of these holidays had been spent with friends from otherEmbassies in Moscow; elicited the fact that Vassall was a member of theBath Club ; and formed the opinion that Vassall was being straightforwardand fully co-operative in the investigation.   He then interviewed the two
referees, the three supervisory officers under whom Vassall served between1947 and 1953, and Mr. H. V. Pennells, the Civil Assistant to the Directorof Naval Intelligence, who was able to give some information about Vassallin the period 1954-56 when he was at the Embassy in Moscow. Thetotal impression of Vassall created by these interviews, as they are recorded in the report, is of a reserved, sober and reliable young man of goodcharacter and unquestioned loyalty, who lived quietly with his parents andbrother at the family home at St. John&apos;s Wood, who had as his maininterests classical music, bridge and the theatre and who possessed a strongdislike of Communism and the Soviet way of life. There were no suggestions of any kind against his character. The Admiralty, in forwarding VassalfsPositive Vetting documents, had stated that their records contained nothing of significance about Vassall, and the other checks which were made revealednothing to his detriment. Mr. Sherwood therefore terminated his enquiriesat this point and submitted his report to Mr. White, the head of theInvestigating Team, who endorsed it and- forwarded it to the Admiralty.Mr. C. G. H. Cardo, the head of C.E.III, after studying the report authorisedPositive Vetting clearance for Vassall.162. In our consideration of this Positive Vetting enquiry we have hadto answer three questions : whether any of the information that it revealedabout Vassall was such that the investigators or the Admiralty should havedetected that he was other than reliable; whether the investigation was asthorough as it should have been having regard to the instructions underwhich the investigators were working ; and whether any improper influencewas exerted on Vassall&apos;s behalf to assist him in obtaining Positive Vettingclearance.163. In dealing with the first two of these questions it is essential to eliminate from one&apos;s mind much of the knowledge that is now available about Vassall but which would not and to a large extent could not havebeen known to the investigators and the Admiralty at the time. Vassallhad recently resumed residence in the family home on return from moscow and he was not to move to Dolphin Square for another two years. Theregular and extensive foreign travel which was to develop from the inter-national connexions which he had established in Moscow had only justbegun. There could as yet have been little evidence that he was livingabove his income, if indeed he was, and his homosexuality was, as always,kept very quiet. A process which is designed for the security screeningof several thousands of persons annually would not be likely to find muchto concentrate upon in a person so circumstanced. Nevertheless there were certain small indications in vassalls Positive Vetting investigation which,it might be argued with the benefit of hindsight, should have warrantedfurther consideration and we think it right to mention them, if only to showthat they have not escaped our attention.164. The first matter which might perhaps be said to indicate that therewas something odd about Vassall was his choice of referees. After nominat-ing two men who had been out of touch with him since he was 18-20 yearsof age, he provided as alternative referees two ladies who were much olderthan he was. It is, we understand, unusual for a young man to give elderly
Jadies as referees in Positive Vetting enquiries and it might now appear asif he were trying to exclude from the field of enquiry any close men friendsthat he had. However, even if the selection of referees were unusual, wedo not believe that the Admiralty could reasonably have deduced anymore from it than that Vassall, after being abroad for over two years, hadk lost touch with his men friends and was having difficulty in nominatingpeople who knew him sufficiently well in private life to act as his referees.165. In any case, the two ladies did not prove to be unsatisfactoryreferees. Investigating Officers were specifically charged to satisfy them-selves that referees were responsible persons, were well acquainted with theperson being investigated and were fit to express an opinion on his reliability.Mr. Sherwood was so satisfied and stated this in his report. One of thereferees, a Dr. Agnes Franklyn, was still practising part-time as a doctor.She had known Vassall for 10 years, met him regularly, as they had acommon interest in bridge, and also knew his parents well. The otherreferee, a Miss Elizabeth Roberts, was a retired civil servant who occupieda flat in the same block of buildings as the Vassall family and had knownVassall for nine years. It is evident from Mr. Sherwood&apos;s reports of hisinterviews with them that they did know what might be called Vassall&apos;public character quite well and knew his home circumstances, and so faras they went their assessments of him were generally sound. We see noreason why the Admiralty should have refused to accept elderly ladiesas Vassall&apos;s referees; they are generally accounted to be as shrewd atsumming up character as other members of the community.166. The second indication in the report that there might be somethingodd is a suggestion, recorded by Mr. Sherwood as part of Miss Roberts&apos;assessment of Vassall, that he took little Interest in the opposite sex. Inretrospect this might appear very significant (although it appears to be not strictly true), but we consider that it would require an excessive degreeof suspiciousness on the part of the Investigating Officer or of Mr. Cardoto have been led by this solitary comment to suspect that Vassall might bea homosexual and to initiate further enquiries directed to this point.167. The third is vassall&apos;s membership of the Bath Club. There hasbeen much Press comment on this and it has been presented as yet anotherindication of the expensive mode of life which Vassall followed. It is nodoubt unusual for a clerical officer to be a member of the Bath Club, butwe do not believe that Mr. Sherwood or Mr. Cardo could be expected to conclude that further investigation of Vassall was consequently necessary.The evidence of both referees was that he led a quiet life with his familyand there was no suggestion that he was living extravagantly or beyondhis means. In any event his membership of the club dated from before he started to receive money from the Russians ; he was originally a memberof the Conservative Club and automatically became a member of the BathClub when the two clubs were amalgamated.168. Our conclusion is that the investigators and the Admiralty werenot in any way remiss in not being impelled to further enquiry by any ofthe information about Vassall revealed in the investigation.
169. The second question we considered in connexion with the PositiveVetting enquiry was whether it was as thorough as it should have been.There is in our view one respect in which it was inadequate; this is in the coverage of the period of over two years during which Vassall was in moscow and which ended only shortly before the Positive Vetting enquirybegan. No one who had direct supervision of him during this period, or who worked closely with him, was interviewed in the course of the enquiry.Mr. Sherwood relied solely on Mr. Pennells for his information, noting inhis report that Mr. Pennells was at that time only &quot; indirectly &quot; responsiblefor Vassall. Mr. Pennells certainly knew something of Vassall&apos;s conductin Moscow and of Captain Bennetts opinions of him. He had had some discussion and correspondence with Captain Bennett about Vassall and received the two Annual Reports that Captain Bennett had made. But hewas not really able to speak for Captain Bennett in this matter or to givea full and accurate account of his opinions or of those of Captain Northey.It is, we believe, quite possible that if Captain Bennett had been interviewedand his full assessment of Vassall sought, he would at any rate have mentioned the suspicions that he had held that Vassall had homosexualtendencies. Mr. Sherwood would, we believe, have heeded such an opinion and he might well have returned to a closer questioning of Vassall or have sought to make a wider circle of enquiries about him. Where this wouldhave led can only be conjecture. But it is at least possible that sufficientdoubt about Vassall would have resulted from these enquiries for his PositiveVetting clearance to be withheld, with the consequence that his espionageactivities would have been restricted.170. Mr. Sherwood told us in evidence that he had it clearly in his mind that he had sought to interview Captain Bennett and that the reasonhe did not see him was because he was informed by the Admiralty at the!time that Captain Bennett was on his way to the Far East. This was clearly an error, as Captain Bennett was then stationed at Portsmouth.Captain Northey was still in Moscow and not readily accessible except bycorrespondence. Just what Mr. Sherwood should have done in thesecircumstances is a matter of judgment. The Treasury instructions left tothe discretion of the Investigating Officer the interviews which should be conducted in pursuing an enquiry: this was subject, of course, to thegeneral direction of his senior officers in the Investigating Team who super-vised his work and to whom he might look for advice, and to the rightof the employing Department to ask for further enquiries to be made.Even allowing for hindsight, we believe that his judgment erred when he decided to rely solely on Mr. Pennells for information about Vassall duringthe Moscow period, rather than to seek in some way to get direct information from a person or persons under whom Vassall had served at the time. Thefailure to do so meant that the most recent part of vassalls life, the part which we now know to have been of great security interest, was inadequatelycovered by the Positive Vetting enquiry.171. The initial error of judgment was Mr. Sherwood&apos;s. But there was nothing apparent to him on this point that was not equally apparent onhis report to his superiors Mr. James and Mr. White, who were, presumably,
supposed to direct and check his investigation with the aid of their greaterskill and experience. They therefore shared his error; as did Mr. Cardoat the Admiralty who accepted the report as adequate for clearance.Nevertheless we do not consider them as deserving of censure for thiserror. The Treasury instructions gave no precise guidance on how farr field enquiries ought to be pressed as a minimum safeguard, apart froman interview with the person being investigated. Officers were expectedto use their discretion and if in doing so they came to the conclusion thatit was unnecessary to pursue their enquiries about one period of Vassall&apos;slife so far as we consider that they should have done, this does not mean that they were negligent or that they failed in their duty. They were however in our opinion guilty of an error of judgment.172. The third question we considered in connexion with the PositiveVetting enquiry was whether any improper influence was exerted on Vassall&apos;behalf to secure his Positive Vetting clearance. As we have said, we aresatisfied that Mr. Sherwood&apos;s report faithfully records the enquiries that he made and the information about and the assessments of Vassall that he received. We are satisfied that these various assessments were honestones, given without reservation. Apart from the inadequacy in one respectto which we have referred the full range of standard enquiries was made.We have been unable to establish to our satisfaction the reasons whyCaptain Bennett was not interviewed about VassaH&apos;s character and conductin Moscow, since we do not think that Mr. Sherwood can be expectedat this date to recall at all accurately what passed at the time ; but thereare no grounds whatsoever for suspecting that some person deliberatelymisinformed Mr. Sherwood as to Captain bennett&apos;s whereabouts in orderto prevent an interview, lest Captain Bennett should disclose hissuspicions of Vassall&apos;s homosexuality. Indeed, such a move would beinherently improbable. Vassall did not realise that Captain Bennett hadother than the highest opinion of him and his moral character and wouldhave every reason to believe that Captain Bennett would speak favourablyof him in a Positive Vetting inquiry ; and the last recorded statement ofCaptain bennett&apos;s opinion of Vassall within the Admiralty was to theeffect that vassalls moral standards were of the highest.173. Finally, we are satisfied that Mr. Cardo did not himself knowVassall at the time of the inquiry, that no approach was made to himon Vassall&apos;s behalf and that, if such an approach had been made, itwould have prejudiced rather than assisted Vassall&apos;s case. Our conclusion is, therefore, that no improper influence was exerted on Vassall&apos;s behalf,directly or indirectly, in the Positive Vetting investigation that was made.D. Special Influence174. The main facts of Vassall&apos;s career as a civil servant, by themselves,and without detailed examination of the methods by which his variousappointments were made and of the persons who decided them, show the unlikelihood of the suggestion that he was the recipient of specialfavours or the beneficiary of some extraneous influence exerted on his behalf. He served in the Admiralty for 14 months during the war in atemporary capacity until called up for service in the Royal Air Force
and rejoined in May 1947, again as a temporary clerk. He was upgradedto Temporary Clerk II four months later, and in January 1948, was established by the Civil Service Commission as a clerical officer. since that time he has reoeived no promotion, having failed two promotionboards. The clerical officer posts which he has filled have, with two possible exceptions the post in Moscow, which was apparently not a )popular one, and that in the Civil Lord&apos;s office, which was well suited to his capabilities been routine appointments of the kind which mostAdmiralty clerical officers can expect to undertake in the course of their service.175. Our investigations have confirmed this general impression. Wehave taken evidence from the persons who decided Vassall&apos;s appointmentsand the persons who contributed to those decisions and are satisfiedthat, with two minor exceptions, no influence was exerted on Vassall&apos;behalf in the securing of appointments or in furthering his career and interests.176. These two exceptions were interventions by Mr. P. N. N. Synnott,who was at the time Principal Establishment Office in the Admiralty.Vassall took the opportunity of a meeting with him at a Civil Servicefunction in 1951 or 1952, at which time Vassall was serving in NavalLaw Branch, to say that he found his work boring and confined to routineand to ask help in obtaining a transfer to something more interestingand stimulating. Mr. Synnott spoke to the appropriate Establishmentbranch and suggested that Vassall might be moved. In due course hewas appointed to War Registry, where he was concerned with the distribu-tion and processing of Admiralty communications. Vassall took theadvantage of another encounter with Mr. Synnott some five years later to make a similar request for a move from Naval Intelligence Division,his work in which again he found dull and uninteresting. Mr. Synnottgave him a warning that he must go up the hard way, and try to earn hispromotion to executive officer, but nevertheless he mentioned VassalTsrequest to Mr. W. J. E. Attwell; the chief executive officer in CivilEstablishments I responsible for the postings of clerical officers in mostAdmiralty departments, drawing attention to vassalls good appearance,manners and background. He did not suggest any particular appointmentnor did he learn of vassalls transfer to the Civil Lord&apos;s office, which tookplace some months later, except by chance and after it was made. Wedo not consider there was anything improper in Mr. Synnotfs interventions.As Principal Establishment Officer he had the general responsibility for civil Service appointments in the Admiralty and had a duty to try toensure, in the interests of the Department, that members of the staff werenot discontented with nor ill-suited to their work.177. Having stated at the outset what our findings have been, we describebriefly in the following paragraphs what vassalls appointments were, thecircumstances in which they were made and the factors which influencedthem.178. His transfer from Naval Law Branch to War Registry in June, 1952,was the result, as we have said, of an intervention by Mr. Synnott. Vassallapparently did not find the work in War Registry particularly attractive
either, and when he learnt in December, 1953, of a forthcoming vacancy in moscow for a Naval Attached clerk he volunteered enthusiastically for it.The method by which he was selected for and appointed to this post is described in Chapter A of this Part. Mr. MillaT, the Assistant Secretary who made the appointment, and Mr. Dammarell, who prepared the short listr of likely candidates and participated in the final selection, have assured us that no influence was exerted on them to favour Vassall and that no approach was made to them in his interest. Vassall himself suggested, at a very latestage in our proceedings, that a person who has been described as a seniorAdmiralty official might have influenced his selection for the Moscow post.This matter subsequently received considerable publicity and we shall bedealing with it later in this Chapter of our Report. It is sufficient to say at this point that we followed up vassalls suggestion and could find no tracewhatever of any such influence having been exercised.179. On his return from Moscow in May, 1956, Vassall was appointed toN.I.D. It was a common practice to appoint returning Naval Attachedclerks to this Division, if there were a convenient vacancy, in order to takeadvantage of their recent experience. There was nothing unusual or outof the way in vassalls posting and the officer in C.E.I. who made theappointment was sure that no pressure had been put upon her from any direction to post Vassall to N.I.D. The vacancy which Vassall filled was ina small secretariat of four; in addition to his share of the secretariat dutieshe took over from his predecessor the tasks of co-ordinating the work ofthe section and of acting as secretary to the Deputy Director of NavalIntelligence. However, within a matter of weeks it became evident to hissenior officers that he was not of the calibre of his predecessor and not ableto discharge these additional tasks. He was therefore relieved of them.Thereafter each member of the section worked directly to the deputy director instead of through Vassall and the latter had no more dealings with him than had the other members of the section. Thus the statement inVassalFs confession to the police, which was quoted at his trial, that inN.I.D. he was secretary to the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence is onlytrue of the first few weeks after his arrival in the Division.180. Within a year of vassalls appointment to N.I.D. there was a reductionin the authorised complement of clerical officers in the Division and Vassallbecame redundant. At about the same time, June, 1957, a vacancy for aclerical officer occurred in the private office of the Civil Lord. When Mr.Galbraith had taken over as Civil Lord in January of that year the staffin the private office had been reduced at the instance of the private secretary,Mr. J. Peters, who thought it excessive, and two clerical officer posts hadbeen abolished. But by the following June Mr. Galbraith had come to theconclusion that the reduction had been too great and that Mr. Peters was having to devote too much time to minor matters which could well be delegated to a clerical officer. A post for one clerical officer was thereforere-created. The selection of a suitable person for the post was theresponsibility of Mr. Attwell in C.E.I., assisted by one of his executive officers, Miss E. M. Paterson. In selecting Vassall they took account of thefacts that he was reasonably well educated for his grade, had reasonably satisfactory Annual Reports from his senior officers and was of personableappearance and address all relevant considerations when selecting a person
to serve in a Minister^ private office. Mr. Attwell also recalled and tookinto account Mr. Synnott&apos;s approach some months previously. As iscustomary with private office appointments, Vassall was interviewed in theprivate office before he was formally assigned to the post. Mr. Attwell and miss Paterson assured us that Vassall did not seek the appointment andthat, apart from Mr. Synnotfs approach, which did not suggest any particularassignment for Vassall, no one approached them or interceded with them tosecure his appointment; their decision was arrived at without any prompting.181. We have described elsewhere in our Report the limited range of duties which he had to perform in the Civil Lord&apos;s office. They accordedwell with his capabilities and he discharged them very satisfactorily. Inthis respect C.E.I&apos;s selection of him for the post proved to be an admirableone.182. In 1959 the posts of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Civil Lordof the Admiralty were amalgamated and with the combining of the twoprivate offices there was one clerical officer more than the work required.Not long before, Vassall had appeared unsuccessfully in front of a PromotionBoard, which had come to the conclusion that he would benefit from aperiod of work in an administrative branch. It was therefore decided thathe should be the clerical officer who should be removed from the combinedprivate office. Miss Paterson of C.E.I, with the approval of Mr. Attwell,posted him to a vacancy in Military Branch II, where he remained until hisarrest in September, 1962. Again Mr. Attwell and Miss Paterson assuredus that they arrived at their decision without any prompting and we accept their evidence. His duties in Military Branch were normal clerical officerduties of a routine character in which he evidently found little interest. Atthe end of 1961 he had a change of duties, as a result of which he actedfrom time to time as the personal assistant to the head of the section inwhich he was employed, but he was not specially selected for this work.He was one of two clerical officers in a subsection which, in addition to itsmore demanding tasks, was responsible for providing clerical assistance tothe head of section. It was the other clerical officer, Miss E. E. Turner,who undertook this duty, not Vassall. Only while she was absent on leave,or sick leave, and Vassall had to stand in for her, did he act as the personalassistant.183. We have considered it necessary to describe the details of Vassall&apos;sassignments because of the allegations which have been made in the press and elsewhere that he was picked out in some strange way for special posts and that he was in some way sponsored in the Admiralty. Only two personshave ever been mentioned to us in the course of our investigation as beingsuggested &quot; backers &quot; of Vassall in connexion with his assignments and asexercising an influence on his behalf. The first name was given to us when we were inquiring into the allegations contained in an article in the daily Mail of 5th November, 1962, under the headline &quot; Are the security menreally expert? &quot;. Its last four paragraphs, which were written by one ofits reporters, Mr. Brendan Mulholland, run as follows:&quot; The harassed Admiralty security team has been trying to traceVassall&apos;s contacts right back to his boyhood at exclusive MonmouthSchool.
It is now know that when he was at Monmouth he met a man whowas to figure prominently in his career at the Admiralty.The man became a well-established Admiralty official.  He has nowretired, but while he was there he acted as one of vassalls sponsors.It was sponsorship, by two ranking officials, which led to Vassallavoiding the strictest part of the Admiralty&apos;s security vetting.&quot;184. In evidence before us Mr. Mulholland said that he obtained his information about the alleged sponsors from a person in an official positionwho was likely to have sources of information on the matter. He told us that he had been given the name of only one of the two sponsors and he put that name to us in writing. He refused to disclose the name of theperson from whom he said he obtained his information.185. The name of the alleged sponsor which Mr. Mulholland put to us was Mr. W. R. Lewin, who had been headmaster of Monmouth School from1937 until 1943 and had served in the Admiralty in the rank of Principalfrom 1950 to 1960. Mr. Lewin has been examined before us and we haveenquired into the possibility that he had sponsored Vassall or assisted him at any stage in his Admiralty career. The essential facts of the relationship between them can be briefly stated. Vassall left Monmouth School inMarch 1941 of his own volition and went to London to work for a short period in the Midland Bank and then as a temporary clerk in the Admiralty.At about the same time Mr. Lewin was granted leave of absence to join the army. Eventually, in 1943, he resigned. At that time Mr. Lewin&apos;sknowledge of Vassall, who was not a senior pupil, was slight; but Vassallsought him out at the War Office where he was serving and over the next five years there were occasional random meetings, almost wholly, we think,on Vassall&apos;s initiative. The relationship was a somewhat equivocal one,although it apparently did not involve any homosexual practices. when mr. Lewin was appointed to the Admiralty in 1950 and realised that Vassallwas also serving in that Department, he came to the conclusion that it wouldbe better for both of them that their relationship should not be revived.Thereafter they had virtually no contact, except occasional accidental meet-ings at the Admiralty.186. Mr. Lewin denies that he sponsored Vassall in any way, either onentering the Admiralty or subsequently. The persons responsible for VassafTsappointments and security clearances confirm that Mr. Lewin made noapproach to them on Vassall&apos;s behalf, and he certainly played no part atall in Vassall&apos;s Positive Vetting. Although Mr. Mulholland&apos;s refusal to disclose to us the name of his alleged informant has precluded us fromsummoning such a witness and thereby testing directly what is attributed to him, we nevertheless think it right to say that, on the evidence in ourpossession which all runs in the contrary direction, we can find no foundation for the allegation that Mr. Lewin sponsored Vassall and helped him to avoidpart of security vetting.187. As Mr. Mulholland was unable to tell us the identity of the secondalleged sponsor referred to in the Daily Mail article, and as he refused to disclose the identity of the informant whom he claimed to be the source ofthe allegation, we were unable to direct any enquiries to this &quot; sponsor &quot; or
to establish the basis for alleging that he existed. In the circumstances we find that the facts about Vassall&apos;s selection for his various posts and about his Positive Vetting are as briefly set out in this Chapter and in Chapters Aand C of this Part and that no improper influence was exerted by anyoneon his behalf.188. When Vassall appeared before us he was closely questioned on thesubject of possible sponsorship in the Admiralty and he told us that he )had, or could recall, none, apart from Mr. Synnott&apos;s minor assistance.Subsequently we learned through his counsel and also from a note whichhe had written in prison and which appeared to be addressed to the Chairmanof this Tribunal that before he was selected for the post in Moscow he had written a letter to the late Lord Cilcennin, who was then Mr. J. P. L. thomas and the First Lord of the Admiralty ; and that he thought Lord Cilcenninmight have intervened on his behalf to secure the Moscow appointment.They were, he said, both members of the Bath Club. We followed up thissuggestion. We inquired directly of the officials who made the appointment as to whether Lord Cilcennin had made any approach to them on thissubject and received positive assurances that he had not. We enquiredof the then Permanent Secretary whether the Minister had consulted him in the matter and he reported to us that he had no recollection of thisoccurring. The official correspondence in the First Lord&apos;s office relating tothis period has been examined on our instructions, as have the records ofthe Permanent Secretary&apos;s office and the Civil Establishments Division;and enquiries have been made of the former members of Lord Cilcennin&apos;private office. No evidence has been found to support vassall&apos;s suggestion.We are fully satisfied that Vassall&apos;s suggestion that Lord Cilcennin mighthave intervened on his behalf was based on surmise and that no suchintervention occurred.189. We also learned through Vassall&apos;s counsel and from the note hehad written in prison the names of other persons in public positions, notin the Admiralty, with whom he claimed to have been associating. Wedirected the Treasury Solicitor to take statements from some of these personsabout their knowledge of and association with Vassall, where this might conceivably be relevant to our inquiry, and have concluded that there is nothing in relation to these persons that we ought to embrace within thescope of our investigation.E. Document Security190. In Part I of our Report we have described in some detail the system by which, according to Vassall, he abstracted documents in pursuance ofhis espionage activities. He did not seek out specially valuable material for his Russian masters or incur any avoidable risk in obtaining material for them ; he worked at random and took only such papers as were readily available to him, usually documents which had come to him for filing orretention after action upon them had been completed; and he only retainedthe documents over-night, taking them out one evening and returning them the next morning. We have also stated briefly the general reasons whichlead us to believe that vassalls account of the way in which he operated isin all probability true. There is in addition some positive evidence incorroboration of his story.
191. When Vassall was arrested photographs were found in his flat of17 documents which he had abstracted since his last meeting with his Russiancontroller. The movements of these documents in Fleet Section of MilitaryBranch have been traced for us from entries in section registers and it is established that they would all have come into vassalls sands during twoshort periods in which he was acting in his capacity as the deputy to MissV Turner, personal assistant to the head of the section, during her absenceson leave. They, either came to him as documents to be held for Miss Turnerto file or otherwise deal with on her return from leave, or were already heldby Miss Turner in her cupboard awaiting filing or delivery to an officer who was also absent on leave. As her deputy Vassall naturally had access to Miss Turner&apos;s cupboard while she was away. Thus the abstracted paperswere all documents to which he had ready and authorised access, they were[documents on which action had at the time been completed or was insuspense, and Vassall would have incurred little or no risk in abstractingthem over-night. To this extent there is confirmation of his story of the way in which he operated.192. We also made such other investigations as we could to test itstruth. We enquired whether any of the colleagues with whom or for whom he worked in the Moscow Embassy and in the Admiralty had observedanything in his conduct which, in retrospect, might now be seen to besuspicious, and we followed up, with negative results, one report that Vassallhad been seen in a secret registry where he normally had no business to go.We enquired whether they recalled documents being mislaid or missing in circumstances which might now be explained by Vassall having abstractedthem and kept them for a longer period than over-night. But we obtainedfrom them no evidence to indicate that he operated in any other waythan that stated.193. It was because of the absence of such evidence that we found itnecessary to pay particular attention to an allegation which appeared in anarticle in the Daily Sketch of 23rd October, 1962, that vassalls spying ledto Russian trawler fleets turning up with uncanny accuracy in the precise area for secret NATO sea exercises. Vassall had little authorised access, certainlyin recent years, to information about NATO sea exercises. If there had been any substance in the allegation it would have indicated that Vassall hadnot been confined to operating in the way we have described but had atany rate on some occasions successfully obtained surreptitious access tosecret information unconnected with his duties.194. The article in question, we learnt, had been compiled from materialprovided by a team of reporters, the allegation about vassalls connectionwith the Russian trawler fleets having been contributed by Mr. DesmondClough, the newspapers air and scientific correspondent. We found oninquiry that it was based on and deduced from two items of fact. First, thatone part of Military Branch, which was the Branch in which Vassall hadbeen working, dealt with Fleet movements ; and second, the generally-knownfact that Russian trawlers had turned up at recent NATO sea exercises.We were eventually to learn, too, that on more than one occasion Mr.Clough has discussed with an information officer in the Admiralty pressoffice, Mr. N. Taylor, his idea that there might be a link between vassalls
employment in Military Branch and the appearance of the Russian trawlers ;and Mr. Taylor had eventually conceded that it was a possibility, nothing more, adding that the Admiralty had only just embarked on an investigation to ascertain what information Vassall had disclosed and consequently therewere as yet no facts to justify making such an assumption; Mr. Cloughnevertheless chose to make that assumption. His assertion that the appearance of the Russian trawler fleets was due to Vassall&apos;s spying was simply a matterof speculation and was not based on any evidence that Vassall was in factresponsible or that he had gained access to secret information about NATOsea exercises. Moreover, other evidence that we obtained satisfied us that, inthe case of the major NATO exercise in the autumn of 1960, the informationannounced to the general public in advance of the exercise was sufficientin itself to enable the Russians, aided by their naval intelligence resources,to make an accurate deduction as to the location of the exercise ; and we accepted this as much the most likely explanation of the incident or incidentsthat Mr. Clough was referring to.195. Another matter which we examined was whether the security arrange-ments in the sections where Vassall was employed were sufficient to ensurethat, even with his cautious method of operation, he did not have ready andunquestioned access to a greater range of material than was justified. Thearrangements for the control of documents in the Embassy were satisfactory in this respect. We have described them briefly in Part II, Chapter B. TheNaval Intelligence Division also appears to have been alert to the importanceof security and to have followed sound security practices. The custody of keys to cupboards and cabinets was carefully organised, all keys being returned to a key safe at the end of the day, checked by a Duty Officer andre-issued the following morning. Vassall shared an office with three others,and had a key to the main cupboard in which papers that were beingworked upon were stored over-night. He could also, and we do not thinkany valid criticism can be made of this, have had access to documents that were in filing cabinets in the office, although his normal duties did not require such access. In a busy section it is normally neither practicablenor efficient so to segregate the work of the individual nvembers that theyare completely excluded from access to each other&apos;s working papers and cannot substitute for one another during leave periods or other absences.196. One of vassall&apos;s duties in Naval Intelligence Division, after he hadbeen Positively Vetted, was that of Atomic Liaison Officer. This entailed no more than the registering and transmission of papers on atomic energymatters. He had access to the safe in which these papers were kept inN.I.D., but the safe was not under his immediate control and there wouldhave been some risk in trying to extract papers from it for an unauthorisedpurpose. We think it worth recording that the Admiralty investigation, towhich we have already referred, into the documents which Vassall mighthave disclosed to the Russians has shown that Vassall was not in factgranted access to Atomic papers until after his Positive Vetting clearancewas issued and that the rules were fully observed in this respect; and that even after his clearance he would not have seen more than 14 such papers.197. In the Civil Lord&apos;s office, which was vassalls next appointment, theposition was very different from that in N.I.D. The documents which passed
through the office were in general much less sensitive than those on whichVassall worked in N.I.D. and, according to Vassall, the Russians were notvery interested in what he was able to produce for them. And, as the assistant to the Civil Lord&apos;s private secretary in a small Private Officeand as the person in charge of it at times when the private secretary was--accompanying the Civil Lord on duties outside the office, he necessarily^ had access to all the cupboards, cabinets and documents. His access couldnot reasonably have been restricted and there was no reason why the CivilLord or his private secretary should have sought to do so.198. In Military Branch the position changed yet again. The work uponwhich he was engaged was still of low classification and the Russians foundhis material of little interest, but he was once more a member of a largeorganisation in which work was segregated. However, the security arrange-ments in Military Branch were such that, if he had been a more adventurousspy, he could readily have gained access to a great deal of secret material.Many, if not the majority, of the security cupboards in the Branch weresuite cupboards, operated by common keys ; and as the user of one of thesecupboards Vassall had his own suite key. It was not the practice to segregatethe more highly classified documents and store these in the more securecupboards fitted with detector or combination locks, and to use the lesssecure suite cupboards to house only the less sensitive material. Staff usedwhichever cupboards were available to them in their rooms for storing all their material, regardless of its classification, and regardless of the type ofcupboard. Key control was also less than adequate.199. We have not found any reason to think that Vassall exploited this situation or that it contributed in any way to his espionage activities, other-wise we should consider those responsible deserving of censure. Indeedfor much of the time, from January, 1961, until early in 1962, he was lyinglow and not abstracting documents. Early in 1962, with the improvedconcentration on security questions that was being felt in the Admiralty,steps were taken in Military Branch to remedy the situation and considerable progress had been made by the time Vassall came under suspicion. further improvements had then to be halted lest they should alarm him, but theyhave now been completed. No doubt everything that was done by way ofimprovement could, theoretically, have been done sooner. But the task of thoroughly reviewing the whole of the security practices and procedures of a large Service Department, which has not kept up to date in all thosefields of planning the necessary reforms and then of getting them implemented,is a very considerable undertaking indeed, and we ascertained enough ofits magnitude to conclude that we could not fairly criticise the rate of progress.200. One of Vassall&apos;s duties in Military Branch, to which reference hasalready been made, was that of acting as occasional personal assistant tothe head of his section. He undertook this duty for five short periods after he resumed his spying activities early in 1962. It is evident from the photographs found in his flat that these periods provided him with theopportunity, of which he took full advantage on at least two occasions(21st August and 3rd-7th September), to abstract material of much greater importance than he was likely to handle in the course of his normal duties.
201. Apart from the deficiencies in Military Branch to which we have referred we make no criticism of the Admiralty arrangements for the pro-tection of documents, in so far as they were relevant to Vassall&apos;s activities.He was a trusted member of the staff in each of his appointments and hissupervisors had no reason to consider him unreliable ; indeed, after hisPositive Vetting he could be regarded as more surely reliable than manyof the other staff who did not have a Positive Vetting clearance. He wastrusted, and he proved to be a traitor, and there is little a Department can do through protective measures to prevent such a person from abstractinginformation for transmission to the agents of other countries, provided heacts with discretion and incurs no avoidable risks.F. Security Supervision202. We have already given a general account in Part I (see paragraphs57-60) of VassaH&apos;s mode of life while serving in the Admiralty in London.The purpose of this Chapter is to draw together certain findings and tomake some comments relative to the issues raised by Questions 13, 14 and 15in paragraph 69.203. Vassall moved from his parents&apos; home to a flat in Dolphin Squarein April, 1959. The rent was  350 p.a. plus rates, making just over  400 p.a.in all. It was a &quot; two-roomed &quot; flat, consisting of a sitting-room and bedroom,with lobby, bathroom and kitchenette.204. It has been asserted in the Press (Daily Sketch, 23rd October, 1962,Daily Express, 2nd November, 1962) and was made the subject of a parliamentary Question that the Admiralty or some official in the Admiraltygave him a reference in respect of this tenancy. From this it was sought to deduce that officials in the Admiralty were careless and in breach of their duty in not realising that he could not be paying this rent out of a clericalofficer&apos;s salary and so must be an object of suspicion until his extra meanswere accounted for. We need not inquire whether this deduction wouldhave been justified, because it is founded on a false premise. No one inthe Admiralty, officially or unofficially, gave Vassall a reference for hisflat. The references were supplied, as we ascertained from the letting com-pany, by his solicitors, his bankers, and a friend, a medical physician in private practice. It is therefore false to say that such a reference did comefrom the Admiralty and beside the point to ask what should have beendone if it had.205. It is due to the two reporters concerned, who made the inquiries fortheir respective papers, to record that they had made approaches both tothe letting office at Dolphin Square and to the Information Office at theAdmiralty and had received replies to their questions that made it seem atany rate very possible that Vassall had received an Admiralty reference.Certainly, no one had told them definitely that he had not and we aresatisfied that each acted in good faith in reporting as a fact what was onlyhis assumption.206. Vassall&apos;s flat has been spoken of in the Press as &quot; an expensive flat &quot;,a &quot; luxury flat&quot;. We heard several descriptions of it from different viewers,whose descriptions varied a little with their point of approach, and we were
furnished with a set of photographs of the interior taken in the autumn of1962. We have mentioned its accommodation and the rent it commanded.For the rest, it was or in due course became obviously well furnished, with good carpets and curtains and some handsome pieces of furniture and smallerdecorations. Judging by the reactions of the witnesses who visited it withoutany pre-existing cause of suspicion it was not a striking affair.207. We have dealt already in paragraphs 57-66 of Part I with the facts of Vassall&apos;s homosexual activities and general standard of living, so far asthey are known to us, apart from the details that we have now set outabout his flat in Dolphin Square. In view of the flow of public comment,however, to the effect that someone in the Admiralty or, perhaps, the security service, must have been negligent not to detect that such a man was a securityrisk, we think that we ought to explain briefly the standard we have applied in coming to our conclusion that no one was at fault on this count., 208. Suspicious observation of a person must differ according to threedifferent situations:(a) When something has occurred which brings him under actualsuspicion. In Vassall&apos;s case this dates only from the early summer of 1962.(b) When he is going through a Positive Vetting. This may be regardedas an officially organised period of suspicion. In vassalls case it lasted during the second half of 1956. We have considered it indetail in Chapter C of this Part.(c) When his work brings him into contact with classified (i.e., moreor less secret) material, but he is not otherwise the object of anysuspicion. Vassall was in the latter situation after he had been cleared on Positive Vetting and until he came under actual suspicion.209. Government Departments, whether or not their work involves dealingwith much classified material, are not conducted on the basis that it is theduty of colleagues to report to some superior or to a central SecurityDepartment every instance of a &quot; character defect&quot;, drunkenness, pecuniaryirresponsibility, sexual intemperance or perversion, etc., that they may chance to detect or suspect in each other. However &quot; security conscious&quot; each individual officer ought to be, such a system of delation would be intolerableand, in our view, its encouragement would be inimical to the spirit of theCivil Service or, indeed, of any decently conducted organisation of human beings. This question of the observation of &quot; character defects &quot;, which hasa real, though indirect, bearing upon security, must be distinguished fromobservation of direct breaches of security, suspicious in themselves, as,for instance, if Vassall had been seen by someone while abstracting documentsor had been detected searching in a registry to which he had no right of access. In such cases, we think, there is a general and positive duty toreport.210. The duty to observe &quot; character defects &quot; in the security sense andto report on them is deliberately placed, by the Civil Service instructions,on supervisory officers, i.e., a senior officer at a level of seniority designated by the Department in which he serves, of which the rank of assistant secretary serves as a norm. Not only have such supervisors the long-standing
duty to know the staff working under them and to observe any defects ofcharacter detrimental to the Department^ own work (points which would normally be covered in Annual Reports), but in recent years there has been imposed this additional duty of being alert to character defects that bear upon security, whether or not they concern the Departments work in thestricter sense, and of reporting anything observed either to the Head of theDepartment himself or to someone designated by him, such as the principalestablishment officer or the principal security officer.211. It was to this standard of duty that we related our investigation ofthe extent to which Vassall&apos;s homosexuality and extravagance were or could have been known in the Admiralty. If we had found that he was widely reputed among his colleagues for the possession of such qualities, weshould have thought it necessary to press for an explanation how it was thatthis reputation did not reach the ears of his successive supervisors, whose duty it was to know something of him. If we had found that even asubstantial proportion of those who worked with him credited him with sucha reputation we should still have been anxious to know how the supervisorhad missed what they had seen. But in fact, as we have said earlier, our examination of the departmental witnesses revealed virtually no one whohad anything suspicious to contribute on this topic ; and if those who worked in closer contact with Vassall, some of whom ranked as more or less his friends, neither knew him nor thought him to be an extravagant or sexuallyperverted man, we were unable to see how his supervisors could be blamedfor not detecting on their own what was hidden from the others.212. It belongs to the general consideration of the questions raised by theVassall case rather than to anything special to the present topic to observehow difficult it is for anyone ranking as supervisor in a large central Depart-ment in London, such as the Admiralty, to get any knowledge of the out-side life of those working under him or to form any worthwhile appreciation of their general character and way of life. No one of the three successiveheads of Military Branch II who gave evidence before us knew anything,in effect, about Vassall as a person: each of them spoke to us of the diffi-culty of doing so, even apart from Vassall&apos;s normal reticence about his private affairs.III.-THE HON. T. G. D. GALBRAITH, M.P.213. Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith, M.P., resigned his office as Under-Secretaryof State for Scotland on 8th November last. His resignation was caused, ashe made plain, by the fact that since the arrest of Vassall on 12th September,1962, there had been comments in various quarters as to the nature of hisrelationship with Vassall, and questions had been raised as to the proprietyof that relationship in general and, more particularly, as to his own respon-sibilty for making possible some of Vassall&apos;s traitorous activities or failing to detect in him an objeat of suspicion. We thought it our duty thereforewithin our terms of reference to find out as clearly as we could what thosecomments amounted to and then to investigate any facts coming to our attention which confirmed or refuted the validity of those comments.214. It is not an easy task to give any precise account of something whichis built up out of a mixture of comment and suspicion, but it may be simpler
to follow what his story is about if we first set out in narrative form what we find to be the material facts of such association as ever was formedbetween Mr. Galbraith and Vassalli215. Mr. Galbraith held the post of Civil Lord of the Admiralty from january 1957 to October 1959. During that time he had a small office in(Jthe Department for the purpose of his official duties, and from June 1957until Mr. Galbraith left the Admiralty for the Scottish Office Vassallserved as a clerical officer attached to the office, working as assistant to theCivil Lord&apos;s private secretary. vassall&apos;s position was neither important norresponsible: apart from minor clerical duties his main services were suchpersonal ones as keeping Mr. Galbraith&apos;s diary of engagements, making histravel arrangements, meeting and escorting his official visitors and seeingto the comfort and convenience of his room. All this work he did mostacceptably, and in that limited sense he was brought into personal contact with the Civil Lord in a way that a clerical officer would not usually be intouch with a Minister.216. Two other aspects of Vassall&apos;s work during this period must be noted,since they have some bearing on the letters which Mr. Galbraith sent toVassall and which have already been printed for public reading in the InterimReport of the original &quot; Committee of Enquiry into the Vassall Case&quot;(Cmnd. 1871, November 1962) whose work we have taken over. The first is that the responsibilities of /the Civil Lord involved him in a great dealof travelling on visits of inspection, both inside and outside the UnitedKingdom. There was, for instance, a 1957 visit, to the Far East covering bothSingapore and Hong Kong, and in August 1959 Mr. Galbraith visited SouthAfrica. On these occasions his private secretary travelled with him, andVassall was left for the time being to look after the office in the Admiraltyas best he could and to make the necessary arrangements for forwarding ordistributing such few papers as would be likely to come in during the CivilLord&apos;s absence. Considering that the private office amounted to no morethan a staff of four persons, including two typists, and that Vassall had been passed on Personal Vetting before he came to the office, we find nothingexceptional or lax in such a temporary disposition.217. The second point, to which much attention has had to be devoted,is that Vassall from time to time carried papers up by hand from theAdmiralty to Mr. Galbraith&apos;s family home at Barskimming in Ayrshire.There were in all some six to nine journeys for this purpose during VassalPstwo and a quarter years in the office, and the occasion of them seems always to have been the same, that papers of some urgency and some degree of secrecy came into the office at a time when Mr. Galbraith was in Scotland,either during the Parliamentary recess or at the conclusion of a tour or,sometimes, when he had gone up to Glasgow on his constituency business on a Thursday and the papers were required for the following Monday. such the papers as were Secret or Top Secret, if committed to the post at all,could only be sent by registered mail and, although the Admiralty runs a regular courier service to Scotland to certain defined points, Barskimmingitself was not on or near to any courier line. In those cicumstances Vassallvolunteered to act as messenger on the first occasion when one was needed,and the practice began of his taking up by rail a locked &quot; black box &quot; con-taining the papers and bringing it back when Mr. Galbraith had been through
them and given any necessary, instructions. None of the Admiralty officialswhom we examined on the point appeared to think that there was anythingunusual or improper in such a use of a Ministers private staff.218. In view of certain rumours that were put about on the subject ofthese journeys, it is desirable that we should state with some particularitywhat we find to be the facts concerning them. The necessary papers were put into the box by the Civil Lord&apos;s private secretary, who then locked it with a key which he retained. It was unlocked at the other end by Mr.Galbraith who had a key in his own possession. Vassall himself did not havea key to the box, except on the few occasions when, the private secretarybeing absent on leave, he was in possession of the key as the person incharge of the office. Twice he made up a box and took it to Barskimmingunder these conditions, but of course, as he was looking after the - officeanyway, this made no contribution to his opportunities of abstractingdocuments for photographic reproduction.219. The journeys seem always to have been made at weekends. Vassallwould take the night train to Scotland travelling on a 2nd class warrantissued by the Admiralty and paying out of his own pocket the differencebetween 2nd class and 1st class sleeper. He would leave the train at Kil-marnock, the nearest railway station, and make his way by motor bus toMauchline, a village a mile or so from Barskimming. From there he wouldwalk up to the house, arriving in the course of the Saturday morning: onceor more, in bad weather, he was met by car at Mauchline. He was offeredrefreshment in the house while Mr. Galbraith went through his papers and sometimes he was asked for explanations or received instructions. Whenthe box was ready to be returned he might be invited to stay for lunch orhe might leave before, and on occasions he was given transport back toMauchline. Only on the occasion of his first journey, when he was invitedto lunch and went on to see a gymkhana in the neighbourhood with twosisters of Mr. Galbraith, did Vassall stay longer in the company of theGalbraiths at Barskimming than the short visits which we have described.220. It was not vassalls practice to return to London before the Sundaynight. He had more than one friend living near the Ayrshire coast and hewould spend Saturday night in an hotel at Troon or elsewhere and visit or bevisited by them. He does not seem ever to have mentioned these plans toMr. Galbraith, in accordance with his usual reticence about the different-sectors of his life, and since he put in no subsistence claims to the admiralty in respect of these journeys to Scotland no one was concerned to know what he was doing with his time.221. Having stated these facts as they emerged at our inquiry we mustturn to consider what evidences there were of other facts tending to showan improper relationship between Mr. Galbraith and Vassall or some measureof responsibility in Mr. Galbraith for making possible the continuance ofVassall&apos;s espionage activities.222. First, there were assertions that Vassall had spent weekends atBarskimming as a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Galbraith. Taken by itself suchan assertion would not appear to us to have been of significance, even ifit is not in the usual run of things for a Minister and a clerical officer
in his Department to be on such friendly personal terms: but when theassertion is made at the time when the clerical officer has been convicted ofa long series of offences under the Official Secrets Acts under the controlof a foreign Power and these activities are linked with the courier journeysto Scotland which we have just described, it is no doubt necessary to^ascertain upon what material such stories are based. We must therefore setout the relevant paragraphs of an article which appeared in the Daily Mail of23rd October, 1962, the day after Vassall&apos;s conviction at the Old Bailey,under the heading &quot; Courier &quot;, since it presents an apparently detailed factualaccount of Vassall&apos;s reception at the Galbraith house.&quot; Vassall left the train at Dumfries where a car drove him the 15 or so miles to the Robert Burns village of Mauchline, Ayrshire.Two miles outside the village the car would turn into the mile-longdrive of the Barskimming estate home of Mr. Thomas Galloway DunlopGalbraith, Tory M.P. for the Hillhead division of Glasgow and thenCivil Lord of the Admiralty.In his 18th century mansion Mr. Galbraith and his assistants waitedfor Vassall their trusted courier a paid servant of Moscow.Vassall played his part well. He was ambitious, willing to give up hisweekends.At Mr. Galbraith&apos;s home he mingled with the other weekend visitors.He would listen so attentively that he made a good impression on hissuperiors.His love of music was a basis for many an opening. He chatted know-ledgeably too about bridge and golf.Over the weekend Vassall had plenty of time to develop his friendships.There were often as many as 30 people staying at Barskimming.Each time he returned he was one stage nearer to an all-round know-ledge of Admiralty procedure.He loved to walk in the surrounding countryside. And he always hadthe correct clothes for the occasion.&quot;223. Now this account clearly presents to the reader a meticulous picture of Vassall using his position as friend and guest of Mr. Galbraith to furtherhis service to the Russians. It is, we find, in all essentials a piece of fiction.When we inquired upon what source of information it rested it appeared that it was written by a staff reporter, Mr. Brendan Mulholland, who hadtravelled to Scotland on the 10th October in order to interview Mr. Galbraith(without previous appointment) and, in company with a Mr. Henry Miller ofthe Daily Telegraph, whom he met by chance in Mauchline, had a conver-sation with Mr. Galbraith at Barskimming on the morning of the 11th.224. It is not necessary to analyse the details of what passed at thisinterview. What is certain is that Mr. Galbrailth, on being asked aboutVassalFs journeys to Barskimming, told the reporters that he used to come up from the Admiralty with bags and said explicitly that he had never stayedin the house. He did not say anything to the effect that he entertained 30or so guests at Barskimming at weekends or at any other time, a thingentirely beyond the resources of his menage where, in fact, his wife did thecooking: he did make some obscure and defensive remark on being pressed
to answer questions about Vassall, to the effect that he had had as many as30 officials in his house at one time or another. Mr. Mulholland asked himwhether Vassall ever stayed in the village at Mauchline when he brought thebags and Mr. Galbraith made a non-committal reply, using some such wordas &quot; Presumably &quot;.225. The reporters left with this amount of information and returned to -London that evening. According to what Mr. Mulholland told us in exami-nation he carried out some local inquiries independently of Mr. Miller before he went back. No one, he found, could remember Vassall having stayedin any of the inns or public houses in Mauchline, but in the course ofnumerous inquiries on the night of the 10th and on the 11th he said that he came across two people, over drinks in a public house, who remembered seeingVassall having, it was thought, a glass of sherry on one or more occasionsand two &quot; estate workers &quot;, men employed on the estate at Barskimming, whohad seen Vassall about &quot; over the weekend &quot;. He had not made any note of the names of his informants or of the substance of what they had said.226. Mr. Mulholland, as we understand it, concluded from these inquiries,when set against Mr. Galbrailth&apos;s explicit denial, that Vassall had neverthelessbeen a weekend guest at Barskimming in the sense that he had lodged some-where in the vicinity and spent his time up at the house. Upon this con-clusion he based the descriptive paragraphs of his article that we havequoted. We do not need to say more, but we cannot say less, than that we regard his conclusion of fact as altogether unfounded ; and we must add that,after hearing Mr. Mulholland, we were far from satisfied that he had everobtained any significant information at all from the informants he spoke of,even to the limited extent to which he deposed.227. Another source of information about Vassall and his way of lifewas provided for Press inquirers by two ladies who had done cleaning andwashing up at his Dolphin Square flat. When he first moved in in April 1959Vassall had done all this work himself, but from December 1960 a Mrs.Murray came in for two mornings a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, andwhen she gave this up in March 1962 in order to leave herself free for other work, her married daughter, Mrs. Hickey, took over and was still working forVassall at the time of his arrest. Mrs. Murray had obviously a kindly-feeling for Vassall, as he had for her, and was to some extent in his confi-dence. She would sometimes be asked to visit his flat in the evenings, heonce took her out to dinner at a restaurant: Mrs. Hickey, we think, had amuch less direct acquaintance with him. Both these ladies were examinedbefore us; they gave their evidence, almost wholly negative, in a positive and responsible fashion ; at the same time we are bound to conclude that, after their connexion with Vassall had become known to the Press, they had beensusceptible to the excitements and temptations of publicity and had made or at any rate encouraged certain statements about Vassall and his relationswith Mr. Galbraith about which they had no real knowledge or even themeans of it.228. Evidently they had been the subject of constant and pressing inquiriesfrom reporters once it became a &quot; line &quot; in Fleet Street to find out if therewas anything in the way of a story about the relations between Mr. Galbraith
and Vassall. Mr. Duffy, for instance, the Daily SketcKs principal crimereporter, told us that on 8th or 9th October he had had &quot; a doorstep conver-sation, in a conversational way&quot;, with Mrs. Hickey and in the oourse ofit he had learnt from her that Vassall had &quot; paid visits to the home of, as sheput it, his boss, Mr. Galbraith &quot;. In another part of his evidence he expressed/-this as &quot; used to go to spend weekends at Mr. Galbraith&apos;s home &quot;, and in factCine Daily Sketch published his report in an article on 23rd October in theform &quot; had stayed weekends &quot;.229. What really passed between Mrs. Hickey and Mr. Duffy on thispoint we are quite unable to say, since when she gave her evidence beforeus she firmly denied having said anything of the sort to him and made it plain that she regarded herself as having been the victim of excessive atten-tions from representatives of the Press. We note however that Vassall had ceased working in the Civil Lord&apos;s office 2\ years before she began to look after his flat and it is in itself very unlikely that he would have talked to herin these terms of earlier visits or have spoken to her of Mr. Galbraith as&quot; his boss &quot;. We conclude therefore that, whatever she may have conveyed to the effect alleged by Mr. Duffy, she could have had no personal know-ledge of any kind to draw upon and could only have been relying on someremark which she had heard her mother make to some other reporter.230. Mrs. Murray presented us with rather a different problem. Puttingaside what she may have said more casually to other reporters, we have nodoubt at all that she gave a considered account to a Daily Express reporter,Mr. John Vass, which included statements to the effect that Vassall hadspent weekends with Mr. Galbraith in Scotland, staying with him at namedplaces, the Isle of Arran and Fort William ; that Vassall had been visited byMr. Galbraith in his flat one evening in 1961 when she had been in the livingroom with Vassall playing the gramophone ; and that Vassall had told heron occasions when she was washing up glasses in the morning that Mr.Galbraith had been of the party on the night before or had said at other times that he had been out to Chelsea to dine with Mr. Galbraith. Vassall,according to her, spoke of Mr. Galbraith to her as &quot; his boss &quot;.231. Now we could not, of course, lightly dispose of such statementssuggesting, as they did, a relationship between Mr. Galbraith and Vassalla good deal more intimate than that to which the rest of our informationpointed. The Daily Express had not made any publication of the materialobtained by Mr. Vass, their only published reference to vassall&apos;s visits toMr. Galbraith being one to the effect that a Miss Evelyn Roberts, a familyfriend of his family, had said, when interviewed, that Vassall himself had spoken to her of weekend visits to Mr. Galbraith in Scotland. But notes of Mrs. Murray&apos;s statement to Mr. Vass, which concluded with a tape-recorded interview played over to us at a public hearing, were quite properlymade available to us by the Daily Express for the purpose of our inquiry.232. In examining the truth of these statements by Mrs. Murray we wereguided by the following considerations:(a) Both Mr. Galbraith and Vassall denied that there had been any suchvisits or exchanges between them.
(b) Mrs.. Murray could have had no personal knowledge of any of them;She did not know Mr. Galbraith by sight at the time of the allegedevening visit nor had she any opportunity, in fact, of seeing the face of whoever the evening visitor was.(c) Any information she had was derived from conversations with Vassall.He was an inveterate &quot; names-dropper&quot;, who liked to associatehimself, accurately or inaccurately, with persons of standing. Hemay quite well have given Mrs. Murray the impression that hehad social contacts with Mr. Galbraith of a more intimate orderthan he really possessed and something of this may have been the foundation of what she produced much later for Mr. Vass. ButVassall himself, when examined, was clear that he had never saidanything to her to the effect that he had taken holidays in thenamed places in the West of Scotland in the company of Mr.Galbraith or had been out to dine with him or had entertained him in his flat in the evening.(d) The incident of a visitor to the flat, when Mrs. Murray was presentand they were playing the gramophone, was recalled by Vassall.He took the man from the entrance hall into the bedroom wherethey talked together for about 15 minutes. He was certain thatthe visitor was not Mr. Galbraith and that he had not spoken of him to Mrs. Murray at the time as &quot; his boss&quot;. After muchrecollection and the tentative suggestion of several possible names,he told us that he thought that either one of two persons whom he named to us must have been the visitor. We directed inquiriesto be made of both these persons but the answers obtained did not provide us with any material that oould further the purpose of ourinvestigation.(e) Mrs. Murray, when before us, denied the truth of any of the relevant statements to which we have referred as made by her toMr. Vass. There was no doubt that she had made them: we hadno real explanation from her as to how she had come to make them.233. In the light of these considerations it is our duty to make a clearfinding as to whether there was any truth in these statements about the relationship between Mr. Galbraith and Vassall which Mrs. Murray provided to Mr. Vass. We were satisfied that there was not. We wish to state that we regarded Mr. Vass as an honest and capable reporter and we make no criticism of his proceedings. But at the same time we have to remember that the daily Express had paid Mrs. Murray a very considerable sum of money forthe exclusive rights to her story about Vassall, that unaccustomed and urgentapproaches from Press representatives may well have led her on to saysensational things as to which she had no true information, and, finally,that the 15 or 16 hours which, according to him, she spent in Mr. Vass&apos;company before her story was complete may have left her with the belief thatshe had a clear impression of events of which at the beginning she had onlya very hazy recollection.234. For these reasons we accept Mrs. Murray&apos;s evidence on oath beforeus to the effect that all she knew of Vassall&apos;s relations with Mr. Galbraith
was that in the course of conversations not perfectly remembered Vassallhad conveyed to her the idea that he had had some social contact with Mr.Galbraith . under whom he had worked at the Admiralty. Everything elsewas, we think, embellishment prompted by a desire to respond to questioningwhich was, no doubt, persistent and carefully directed.% 235. Before out Tribunal was constituted it was known that Mr. Galbraithhad written a number of letters or postcards to Vassall and that these hadbeen found in his flat after his arrest. These, as we have said, have alreadybeen published in Cmnd. 1871. We were supplied with a somewhat amplercollection of correspondence which included also a few communications fromVassall to Mr. Galbraith which had been retained and were produced bythe latter.236. We have studied the contents with care, not forgetting that in debate in the House of Commons on 5th November, Mr. George Brown, M.P., had spoken of some of these letters as &quot; indicating a degree of ministerial responsibility which goes far beyond the ordinary business of a minister in charge&quot;. Seen however in the light of the fuller knowledge of the relevant circumstances which was available to us, this correspondence failedto convey to us any untoward or exceptional significance whatsoever. Itseems to us innocuous and entirely consistent with the friendly relationship which appears to have existed between Mr. Galbraith and the clericalofficer who had worked in his office and with whom he later maintainedan occasional and casual connexion. No indiscreet or improper expressionsare used and we find it impossible to dwell at any length upon the contents of communications which are never more than trivial and are always correct.237. If analysed in any detail, it can be seen that Mr. Galbraith&apos;s letters (orpostcards) can be divided into several general categories: letters written toVassall, mainly about office business, while the Civil Lord and his private secre-tary were on tour and Vassall was in charge of the office, letters written fromBarskimming about small office details in London, and letters written fromBarskimming or London thanking Vassall for personal messages on suchevents as the births of Mr. Galbraith&apos;s children or for his services in theLondon office. The letters did not end when Mr. Galbraith left the admiralty for the Scottish Office in October, 1959. Vassall with his insistent cultivation of social contacts continued to keep in touch with Mr. Galbraith by anoccasional congratulatory message or a letter designed to consult Mr.Galbraith about his future prospects in the Civil Service, and once or twiceMr. Galbraith sent a letter or postcard to Vassall containing such messagesas commiseration on his mother&apos;s death or greetings of the holiday postcardorder.238. We received certain explanations both from Mr. Galbraith andVassall about the occasions and circumstances of this correspondence. Theyleft us with the general impression that Mr. Galbraith was a kindly andconsiderate head of his office who liked to encourage some personal relationswith those who served him as his staff, and that Vassall not only was a somewhat insinuating young man who liked to develop any social contactswhich came his way but had also formed a genuine admiration and attach-;
ment to Mr. Galbraith which he was reluctant to terminate with the periodof his service in the Civil Lord&apos;s office.239. The only matter that may perhaps cause some surprise is the factthat letters of such trivial passing interest should have been preserved atall. But people vary very much in their habits and attitudes in this matter.Mr. Galbraith, who had kept a few letters or postcards sent by Vassall tohim or his wife or to them jointly, explained himself to us as a regularpreserver of correspondence, important or unimportant, coming to himeither in public or private relations. It provided, he thought, the raw material for future social historians. In vassalls case we have no doubt that hiskeeping of all Mr. Galbraith&apos;s letters was ascribable to his admiration forthe sender, of which we have spoken, and to his pleasure in the contactwhich he had enjoyed. For the same reason he had collected and kept ina drawer a number of Press or other photographs of Mr. Galbraith meetingor conversing with people during his official tours; these had either beenpicked up in the Civil Lord&apos;s office or, in one or two cases, had been obtained by Vassall direct from the takers. Indeed there was in his flat a small studiophotograph of Mr. Galbraith which stood on the chest of drawers in hisbedroom. This, it turned out, had been taken by a Press Agency and hadbeen appropriated by Vassall at the time when the Civil Lord&apos;s office was cleared upon his transfer from the Admiralty to the Scottish Office.240. We come now to inquire into the singular interview which took placeon the evening of the 8th November in the House of Commons dining roombetween Mr. Tapsell, M.P. for Nottingham West, and Mr. Boyd-Maunsell,the political editor of the Daily Sketch. After hearing the evidence of both these gentlemen we are in no uncertainty as to the substance of what passed between them on the topic with which we are concerned, the possibilityof any improper relationship between Mr. Galbraith and Vassall. Indeedthere is virtually no conflict of evidence on the question of what was said,and, where there is any conflict, we are disposed to accept Mr. Tapsell&apos;sversion, since he had, we think, the clearer and more positive recollectionof the details of their conversation. What we are in no position to explain,as will appear later, is how Mr. Boyd-Maunsell came to express himself as he did or in the terms that he did. That however is a question between himself and his colleagues in the office of the Daily Sketch which, in viewof the evidence they gave to us, we are unable to resolve and which is notin any event a question which needs resolution for the purposes of our inquiry.241. To turn then to this conversation, Mr. Tapsell and Mr. Boyd-Maunsell, who knew each other very slightly, had an imprecise engagementfor Mr. Boyd-Maunsell to dine with Mr. Tapsell at the House of commons on 8th November. Mr. Tapsell had forgotten about it until told of Mr.Boyd-Maunsell&apos;s arrival. He then left the people with whom he was already at dinner and took Mr. Boyd-Maunsell in to dine with him. The white paper containing the Galbraith-Vassall letters had been published on thepreceding day. Mr. Galbraith&apos;s resignation had been made public on the morning of the 8th, and the whole matter had been discussed that eveningat the 1922 Committee. Conversation between Mr. Boyd-Maunsell andMr. Tapsell turned at once to this topic.
242. We find that in the course of this conversation Mr.. Boyd-Maunsellmade to Mr. Tapsell the following statements.(a) The Daily Sketch crime reporter or &quot; crime man &quot; had very goodcontacts both with Scotland Yard and with the Security Service.He had been at work on the story of a connexion between Vassalland  Mr. Galbraith  since Vassall&apos;s  arrest and had  obtained&quot; information.(b) Someone in Scotland Yard or Admiralty security Mr. Boyd-Maunsell did not know which had told the crime reporter that&quot; the man the Press should keep their eye on was not Vassall but mr. Galbraith &quot;.(c) The same informant had said that Vassall had been arrested just before he left for Italy for fear that he might &quot;do a Pontecorvo &quot;.(We understand by this &quot; go abroad and then defect to theRussians&quot;.)(d) The informant had further said that Mr. Galbraith was in Italy atthe time and &quot; they thought Vassall might possibly be going thereto join him &quot;. (In fact Vassall was arrested on the 12th september and Mr. Galbraith and his wife did not leave the United kingdom for a holiday in Italy until the 22nd September.)(e) The same informant had said that &quot; they&quot; had reason to believethat Vassall and Mr. Galbraith had spent holidays abroad togetherbefore: &quot; they &quot; had not been able to prove this and thought the newspapers might be able to find out more.(f) The Daily Sketch had instructed their representative in Italy tokeep an eye on Mr. Galbraith, though Mr. Boyd-Maunsell did not make clear for what purpose this was to be done.(g) Mr. Boyd-Maunsell added towards the end of this conversation thathe personally was absolutely satisfied that there was not a wordof truth in the story. He agreed with Mr. Tapsell that, if it wasuntrue, action ought to be taken against the security officerconcerned.243. We did not understand from Mr. Boyd-Maunsell that he really wishedto dispute that he had conveyed to Mr. Tapsell the substance of what we have set out above. To some extent, but we are not clear to what extent,he thought that he had attributed it not to a security informant but to aline of thought that had at one time been explored in his newspaper office.For instance, he did not think that the suggestion that the Press should keep their eye on Mr. Galbraith not Vassall was spoken of by him asderived from any such informant: he thought that he had said it had beenthe newspapers own idea. We cannot accept, however, that there was anymisunderstanding between the two gentlemen as to the basis upon whichthese statements were being advanced. Mr. Tapsell, who was much shockedboth by the stories and by the notion that they were attributed to a securitysource, went over them explicitly two or three times with Mr. Boyd-Maunselland was absolutely convinced as to what it was that he was being told.When he said that he felt that he must report the whole matter to his chief whip, having regard to the seriousness of its possible implications, Mr.Boyd-Maunsell&apos;s comments, as recalled by Mr. Tapsell and not disputed
by him, are only consistent with the impression formed by the latter. &quot;I personally have no objection whatever to your doing that&quot;, Mr. Boyd-&apos;Maunsell said, &quot; but I would rather that you allowed me to discuss it with my editor before you go ahead and repeat what I said to the Chief Whip,because while I have no objection personally, my newspaper does dependvery much on the confidential contacts of its crime reporter with scotland yard and the Security Services and it may be that when I go back to myeditor he will decide it will be wiser for the newspaper to deny the wholestory.&quot;244. When we endeavoured to find out from those concerned with thismatter in the office of the Daily Sketch what had been said by the allegedsecurity informant and who he was we were in fact met with an unqualifieddenial of the existence of any such person. There were three gentlemenwho gave evidence before us ; Mr. Todhunter, the assistant editor, whoadmittedly was the only person in the office who had spoken to Mr. Boyd-Maunsell on the subject and from whom alone therefore he could havederived the impression he conveyed to Mr. Tapsell, Mr. Kirby, the chiefreporter, who was in charge of the newspapers investigations into the Vassallstory, and Mr. Duffy, the principal crime reporter. Put together their state-ments to us amounted to this. It was known in the office that Vassall wasa homosexual, that he had been arrested just before he left for Italy, thatMrs. Hickey, according to the impression that Mr. Duffy had carried away from his interview, had said that Vassall stayed with &quot; his boss&quot; (Mr.Galbraith) in Scotland, and lastly that Mr. Galbraith was on holiday in italy. Putting these facts together, Mr. Todhunter and Mr. Kirby had thought that there was a possibility of there having been a homosexualrelationship between Mr. Galbraith and Vassall, a possible story thatneeded investigation, and a possibility that there was some significance intheir both being or intending to be in Italy. No one of the three, eachassured us, had derived any information or pointer on this topic from anofficial source, Admiralty, Scotland Yard or Security Service. All that had ever come from an official source was that some time about 12thOctober Mr. Kirby, on inquiring of a contact of his who could be sodescribed, had been advised that there was nothing in such a notion andabsolutely no evidence to support it. Thereafter, we were told, the news-paper dropped the idea and regarded the story as a dead line of inquiry.245. This, of course, leaves unexplained how it was that on 8thNovember Mr. Boyd-Maunsell was talking to Mr. Tapsell in the terms thathe was about the newspapers confidential sources and the informationderived from them by their &quot; crime man &quot; or crime reporter. There could have been, on Mr. Todhunter&apos;s evidence, no excuse for Mr. Boyd-Maunsell&apos;sfailure to grasp the position, for, while Mr. Todhunter had told him on 8th October about the Galbraith-Vassall line which the newspaper wasinvestigating and the facts, as set out above, which might support it, hehad also told him in the following week, about 15th October, when Mr.Boyd-Maunsell returned to the office from attending the Conservative party conference at Llandudno, that the whole line had been dropped and therewas nothing in it.246. Here then we had to leave any further pursuit of the story told to Mr. Tapsell by Mr. Boyd-Maunsell. We could not follow up and examine
an informant who, we were assured on oath, had never existed; nor had we found from any other source any evidence which gave the least support to the various insinuations spoken of by Mr. Boyd-Maunsell to Mr. Tapsell.On the contrary, Vassall had no suspicion before his arrest that his activitieshad been detected. He was leaving for Italy for his annual holiday, as hehad done in other years, and he had planned to meet an American friend^jn Rome, to go on with him to Capri, and then to return together withhim to London. He had no thought of &quot; doing a Pontecorvo&quot;. Mr.Galbraith&apos;s plans, which he carried out, were to spend his holiday in Elbain the company of Mrs. Galbraith, reaching the island by way of Milanand Pisa. There has never been any evidence whatsoever that Mr. Galbraithand Vassall had ever spent any holidays abroad in each other&apos;s company.247. This concludes our account of our investigation into the personalrelationship between Mr. Galbraith and Vassall. Necessarily, it has con-sisted mainly of identifying and analysing certain matters brought to our attention which seemed possible ground of suspicion or to suggest somethingout of the ordinary that might be significant. Having considered these various matters and sought to ascertain either the truth of them or the explanations that throw light upon them, we are satisfied that there is nothing to be said against Mr. Galbraith on this head except that he hadthe misfortune to be brought into official contact with a man who, unknownto him, was acting as an agent for the Russian Secret Service, and that inthe course of those contacts he showed a civil kindness which did not altogether terminate with the end of the official contacts.248. We must now address ourselves to the separate question whether anyreflection rests upon Mr. Galbraith in that he failed to detect in Vassall aperson whose character and conduct was such that he should have been treated as a &quot; security risk&quot;. This phrase, which it is easier to employthan to define, must mean in this context a person of obvious irresponsibilityin his work or someone otherwise plainly unfitted by defects of situation orcharacter to be entrusted with secrets important to the State. As is known,those defects or misfortunes such as chronic financial difficulties, drunkennessand sexual intemperance or abnormality are regarded as rendering a personsubject to them a security risk, if only because of the opportunities theyoffer for subornation or blackmail by hostile agencies.249. We have already described such contacts as existed between Vassalland the Civil Lord during the period when the former was employed inthe office. While the Civil Lord, being a Minister, was not vassall&apos;s &quot; super-visor &quot; in the administrative sense and, as such, under a functional obligationto keep his eyes open for any character defects in a subordinate in touchwith secret material, we have considered the matter upon the basis that,as a Minister in the Department, Mr. Galbraith should have been alive to security issues and vigilant to notice and report any disquieting conductor character evidences which came to his attention in respect of those with whom he was brought into contact.250. But what was he to see in Vassall that could have aroused hissuspicions? We have described in an earlier section of our Report VassalPsgeneral demeanour and reputation among his Admiralty colleagues. Mr.Galbraith may have had certain opportunities of observing him which were
not open to them, but in essentials Vassall presented to him the sameappearance as to them : a quiet young man, discreet in conduct, well butnot conspicuously dressed, pleasant and obliging, well spoken and writinga good hand. For the bulk of the time, until Vassall moved to the DolphinSquare flat, he was living at his parents&apos; home in St. John&apos;s Wood andthere was nothing in his appearance or observable way of life that suggestedextravagant living or indeed the possession of any particular sources of income beyond his pay. Certainly he spoke to Mr. Galbraith of travelabroad and of his liking for it. Mr. Galbraith knew of at any rate onesummer holiday in Italy, just as he knew of vassalls projected holiday in cairo at Christmas 1959, after he had left the office of the Civil Lord.But he did not know and had no means of knowing of those frequent andvaried visits to foreign countries which vassall&apos;s passport records. In fact,if Mr. Galbraith&apos;s two private secretaries, Mr. Peters and Mr. Brown, whoinevitably saw more of Vassall from day to day, and had contacts withdepartmental colleagues that were not open to the Civil Lord, saw andsuspected nothing that suggested a security risk, we can find nothing in mr. Galbraith&apos;s own knowledge or observation of Vassall that should havewarned him to call for inquiries or to make a report.251. This is not to forget that Vassall was a man who aroused a measureof curiosity in a number of people who come into contact with him or thatMr. Galbraith was to some extent among them. People were evidently struckby an incongruity between an appearance that indicated a good educational and social background and his persistence in junior rank in the Civil Service.The latter was due, we have found, to vassall&apos;s very limited intellectualcapacity. His mental grasp was weak. Mr. Galbraith himself is on recordas having said in a telephone interview with Mr. Kirby of the Daily Sketchon 19th October, 1962, that he thought Vassall had &quot;a screw loose&quot;.Whether this interview was, as Mr. Galbraith thought, on &quot;lobby terms&quot;and so admitting of loosely-chosen language or, as Mr. Kirby thought, was an open conversation available for reproduction, we do not need to inquire.Most likely there was a genuine misunderstanding between the twoparticipants. However that may be Mr. Galbraith explained the phraseto us as intended to convey the idea that there was something lacking inVassalPs make-up which prevented him from rising to a level in the CivilService for which he would otherwise appear to be fitted. The expressionis hardly well chosen to convey that meaning, but we attach no importanceto it, because it is quite clear to us that Mr. Galbraith neither thought norintended to convey that Vassall was an irresponsible character in any sense that would convert him into a security risk.252. Much attention has been paid to the fact that Mr. Galbraith had actually seen vassall&apos;s flat in Dolphin Square. .He did pay one visit to the flat on an occasion in the autumn of 1959, after he had gone to the scottish office, when he and Mrs. Galbraith paid a call of about 20 minutes andwere shown over by Vassall. Vassall, it will be remembered, had taken hisflat in April 1959, about six months before his service in the Civil Lord&apos;office  ended, and he had evidently been pressing Mr. Galbraith to come and see his new possession. The visit was a courtesy visit made in response to this invitation.
253. It is no doubt true that, whatever the range of variation of flat rentsin Dolphin Square, no one who thought about it could suppose that a flat of sittingroom, bathroom, bedroom and kitchenette could be carried onthe single salary of a clerical officer in the Civil Service earning say,  700a year. And, even though the furnishings were not complete by the autumn,the flat was obviously well furnished and equipped with pieces of appreciable value. Should the sight of this have placed Mr. Galbraith on the alert%nd warned him that there was something suspicious, even perhaps sinister,in Vassall&apos;s way of living? We have given this question our careful con-sideration, because it has a certain plausibility ; but we have come to theconclusion that to answer it unfavourably to Mr. Galbraith would assumed measure of critical vigilance on the part of the visitor which is out ofrelation to the realities of human intercourse. Mr. Galbraith had no intimate knowledge of Vassall&apos;s circumstances and background-, and some curiosityon his part, spoken to by his private secretaries, had not revealed any detailed information. Vassall presented all the appearances of belongingto a family of some standing. There was nothing far-fetched in the assump-tion that he might enjoy some private means or an allowance. Mr. Galbraithhad, he says, a general impression that Vassall had come into some money,an impression which, as noted elsewhere, Vassall was not at all reluctant to disseminate. He had in fact received a small legacy by that date, althoughby hindsight one can see that it was not the source of the level of expenditurethat he was maintaining in these years.254. It is evident to us that the significance of vassalls fiat as evidenceof unexplained extravagance did not occur to Mr. Galbraith at all. Lookingback with knowledge of what was going on and of what subsequentlyhappened, one can see that it might have: but in our view it would notbe reasonable to pass any censure upon Mr. Galbraith because he did not make a deduction or form a suspicion which might well have arisen had much more been known about Vassall than was then apparent.IV.-THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (LORDCARRINGTON) AND HIS SERVICE CHIEFS255. We were required, under the first head of our Warrant, to inquire into&quot; the allegations made that the presence of another spy inside the admiralty was known to the First Lord and his Service Chiefs after the Portland case18 months ago&quot;. This allegation was first made by Mr. Percy Hoskins,the Chief Crime Reporter of the Daily Express, in an article in that news-paper on Thursday, 8th November, 1962, under the headline &quot;Don&apos;t forgetthey knew for 18 months there was a spy around . . .&quot;. The relevant partsof the article are :&quot; Let me recount the facts and add a few new disclosures.When Special Branch men raided the bungalow at Cranley-drive,Ruislip, occupied by the Krogers, in January 1961, it took three days to find the underground radio transmitter capable of sending informationdirect to Moscow.It was then only too obvious that such an elaborate communicationlink had not been set up just to transmit the secrets that Harry Houghtonwas bringing from the Dorset naval base on his monthly excursions toLondon.
It was, indeed, the transmitting centre for an entire spy network.The proof was not hard to find for among the microdot films found inthe house was one of a highly secret document which had not been circulated to Portland or to any other naval base.This document had or so the authorities believed never left the strong room of the Admiralty.So when on 22nd March, 1961, Lord Carrington and other Admiraltyofficials heard the Krogers, Houghton, Lonsdale and Miss Gee receivetheir heavy sentences, they knew that another spy was at work.And this one was inside the Admiralty. It was, as we now know,Vassall.* * *- * *But the crucial question remains: Who permitted such a lackadaisicaland perilous state of affairs to exist at the Admiralty for 18 months-knowing that a spy was established in the building? &quot;256. On the following day the essence of this allegation, described as arevelation by Mr. Hoskins, was repeated in the Daily Express in an articleby Mr. Douglas Clark, the Political Editor and Chief Lobby Correspondent.Mr. Clark added that, as a result of the revelation, the First Lord hadbeen called urgently to Admiralty House to explain why he had not told the Prime Minister earlier of the existence of the spy. The allegation wasalso repeated, more briefly, in leading articles in the Daily Express of9th November and the Sunday Citizen of 11th November. The writers ofthese three articles informed us that they had no other sources of information for the allegation than Mr. Hoskins&apos; original article, and it was to him thatwe addressed our enquiries as to the basis of his statement that for 18 months the Admiralty authorities had known of the existence of a spy at work inthe building.257. Mr. Hoskins told us that his article had been based almost entirely on material that had already been published; that he had not regarded it as making any sensational revelations; and that, although he had said in the article that he was making new disclosures, this was inaccurate ashe was only seeking to put previously-published material into properperspective. That material was the product of several journalists in variouspublications, and as some of the information and speculation upon which their articles were based was common and the articles themselves to someextent interrelated, it will make the material easier to follow if we set out its development chronologically.258. At the time of the Portland trial in March, 1961, there was ageneral impression among journalists who had been following the case thatthe care with which the Krogers and Lonsdale had established themselvesin this country and the scale on which the Krogers&apos; house had beenequipped with espionage apparatus indicated a much greater traffic in secretsthan the limited information which Houghton and Miss Gee were providing.There was a feeling that some members of the spy ring must have escapeddetection and were, perhaps, still being sought by the authorities.   Colour
was thought to be lent to this by the fact, stated by the then Attorney-General at the trial, that call-signs in accordance with signal plans found inLonsdale&apos;s flat and the Krogers&apos; house were still being transmitted fromthe Moscow region some days after the ring had been arrested. Thesetransmissions certainly suggested to some people that other agents had escaped detection and were listening on the same radio frequency. Such aSuspicion was expressed with confidence by Mr. George Brown, M.P., inthe debate on the Portland case in the House of Commons on 23rd March,1961, and reported in the Press on the following day.259. It received apparent confirmation in a very precise form in a briefreport in the Sunday Telegraph of 26th March, 1961, which, Mr. Hoskinsand other journalists told us, contributed materially to their belief that theauthorities knew that some members of the ring had escaped, and to theirlater conclusion that Vassall was linked to the Portland case. The report was headed &quot; Yard&apos;s file not yet closed &quot; and read as follows:&quot;Scotland Yards Special Branch has not yet closed the file on thespy ring operating round Gordon Arnold Lonsdale. Papers found inthe house of the Krogers implicate two more undiscovered agents.One is believed to be a diplomat in the London Embassy of an iron curtain country who has since been sent home. The other is thought to be a minor civil servant operating in a similar way to that mentioned at the trial.There is no clue to his identity.&quot;260. A separate indication that there were other agents working withLonsdale came from Houghton himself. In his proof for his counsel at thePortland trial Houghton said that he had been told by his controller,Lonsdale, and by another Russian contact known to him as John, that theRussians wanted no information from him on radar or fire control as they already had a contact at Portsdown, that they had sea mines &quot; covered &quot;,and that he was not to concern himself with the Polaris base as an agentor agents were already working there. Houghton&apos;s proof was later handedover to the Sunday Pictorial under an arrangement made with his solicitorfor the publication of his &quot; life story&quot;. This &quot; life story&quot; was written by two Sunday Pictorial journalists and was subsequently published in many parts of the world, and the overseas, but not the home, version included the statement that Houghton had been told by Lonsdale not to concernhimself with the Polaris base as an agent was already working there. Therewas thus a general knowledge among journalists who interested themselvesin espionage cases that Houghton had talked of the existence of otheragents working for the Russians and it was assumed that the authorities must be aware of what he had said. It was also generally known, fromthe speech in mitigation by Houghton&apos;s counsel at his trial, that Houghtonhad offered to assist the authorities by identifying photographs of anundisclosed nature. This indicated to some journalists that Houghton wasoffering to identify these other agents or the naval installations where theyworked.261. With this background it was a fair guess, when the details of VassalTscase became known, that there might have been some link between him
and the Portland ring. There were certain obvious but superficial similarities.Houghton and Vassall-both worked for the Admiralty; they had bothbeen instructed to use Exakta cameras ; and Houghton had had a contactcalled Nikky and Vassall one called Nikolai who might be one and thesame man. But articles which appeared in two newspapers on 23rd October,1962, the day after vassalls conviction, went much further than this. It./.an article in the Daily Herald Mr. Sidney Williams wrote, apparent!) -as a statement of fact, that Vassall had worked in alliance with the Portlandring, that some microfilm found at the Krogers&apos; house had not come fromHoughton and Gee but from a department inside the Admiralty, and that military Intelligence then knew that another spy was operating in theAdmiralty. An article in the Daily Mirror by a team of reporters led by Mr. Tom Tullett told a similar story, except that in their article the film was said to have been found on Lonsdale. And on the followingSunday, 28th October, the Observer also published a similar story in anarticle on the Vassall case. Mr. Hoskins told us that he noted these threearticles and that before writing his article of 8th November he spoke toa source, whose name he was unwilling to disclose, and asked if this story about a microfilm were true : he received the comment &quot; You are onthe right track&quot;.262. This, then, was the background and these the main sources uponwhich the allegation in Mr. Hoskins&apos; article of 8th November was based.We have described them in some detail so that it can be seen what measureof credibility they would have given to it, had all that they stated beenthe truth. However, we have thoroughly investigated the allegation andthe nature of the information upon which it was based and have no doubtthat it is completely false.263. On examination we found that the brief report in the Sunday-Telegraph of 26th March, which appears to have carried considerable weightWith Mr. Hoskins and some other journalists, was in most of its particulars,though posing as fact, essentially speculation and not founded on anyactual knowledge. It was written by Mr. George Catling, a free-lancejournalist, who had been among the reporters questioning SuperintendentG. G. Smith of Special Branch at Bow Street immediately after the committalproceedings in the Portland case. Superintendent Smith said in reply toone question that the file on the case was not yet closed a remark that by itself and in the circumstances was not revealing or significant. HoweverMr. Catling apparently came to the conclusion that if the file were notclosed there must be other suspects whom the police were following up.He had already seen quantities of papers being removed from the Krogers&apos;home by the police and deduced that clues indicating the existence of suchsuspects must have been contained in these papers. Upon this he foundedthe reference in the first paragraph of his article to &quot; two more undiscoveredagents &quot;. The statements in the second paragraph that one of the suspectswas believed to be a diplomat and that another was thought to be a minorcivil servant appear to suggest by their form that they were based uponinformation derived from official sources, but this is not so. Mr. Catling,who was an entirely candid witness, told us that they were based solely on
his own suspicions that a member of an Iron Curtain Embassy, whom hehad met socially, was a spy and was cultivating people who looked likejunior civil servants in two public houses in Whitehall; and that he resembleda person who (according to Mr. Catling&apos;s own inquiries) used to visitLonsdale&apos;s business premises. Mr. Catling&apos;s deductions did not seem toAus to have sufficient substance to call for further examination.w. 264. We found that the stories in the Daily Herald and Daily Mirror of23rd October, about the film said to have been found in the Portland case which indicated another spy within the Admiralty, were also fiction andwere not based on any information that could support the story. Mr.Williams and Mr. Tullett were apparently convinced from the circumstantialevidence which we have outlined that Vassall was associated with thePortland ring and that his detection must have resulted from clues obtained at the time of their arrest. And, as some espionage material found in thePortland case and referred to at the trial was in the form of film ormicrodots, Mr. i Williams and Mr. Tulleiit deduced that the clues to Vassallwhich they presumed to exist must also have been in that form. They told us that before writing their articles they had put their deductions separatelyto certain &quot; sources &quot;, the identities of whom they were unwilling to disclose,and that each received some comment to the effect that he &quot; could be right&quot;, or &quot; was not far wrong &quot;. The third Press reference to the supposedfilm clue, that in the Observer of 28th October, was, we were informed, basedentirely on the previous two articles in the Daily Herald and Daily Mirrorand not upon any separate information or deduction.265. We made exhaustive inquiries, calling before us for the purpose boththe Director-General of the Security Service and the two Special Branchofficers who had been in charge of the Portland spy case, and we were satisfied by them that there was no such film of any Admiralty document and that no films or documents of any kind found at the Krogers&apos; home,at Lonsdale&apos;s flat or at the premises occupied by Houghton or Miss Geesuggested or implied that there was another spy operating in the Admiraltyor in the Naval Service generally.266. The statements originating with Houghton about other agents whowere said to be covering certain naval subjects require some detail inexposition, though it may be as well to give the preliminary warning that none of the security authorities who had to consider what he had saidregarded him as a man at all likely to be telling the truth. Houghiton hadnot only put these statements in his proof but had also put them in aseparate note for his counsel which had been sent after his trial to theSecurity Service at his suggestion. In it he made a number of allegationsabout his Russian controllers, including the following:&quot; Information being received by them possibly by the 3 persons 3could identify.1. Sea mines2. Radar3. Fire control4. Dreadnought-in the U.K. and the U.S.A.5. Holy Loch activities of Polaris missile submarines.&quot;-and he added towards the end of the note :&quot; Is there any possibility of me turning State Evidence re the above? &quot;
267. The &quot; 3 persons &quot; to whom Houghton was referring in this note werethe Russian contacts whom he said that he had had at different times, otherthan Lonsdale. The offer made through his counsel to assist the authoritieswas in identifying photographs of these Russians and not, as some journaliststhought, photographs of agents working for them in naval installations orof the installations themselves.268. On receiving this note the Security Service wrote the same day to iheAdmiralty giving them its substance and adding that they had not yet beenable to interrogate Houghton, whose appeal was still pending, and were notin a position to comment on the note. After the appeal had been disposedof on 9th May, 1961, Houghton was interviewed by a member of the security service on 18th and 23 rd May. At these interviews Houghton persisted in giving a version of his espionage activities which was known to theSecurity Service to be grossly untrue. As he could not be persuaded totell the truth about these activities the Security Service saw no useful purpose in questioning him about the statements in his note. Their viewof him was that he had proved himself a liar in the witness box at histrial and was not prepared to speak the truth even after he had been convicted and his appeal rejected; his motive in providing the information in the note was suspect it was in order to be allowed to turn Queen&apos;sEvidence or in order to obtain a reduction in his sentence; and their experience told them that it was inherently improbable that Houghton&apos;sRussian controllers would have disclosed to him the fields in which otherspies were operating. After full consideration the Security Service wrote to the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence (Security) on 13th June for-warding a copy of Houghton&apos;s full note and saying that no reliance couldbe placed on any statement which he made. They considered that inquiriesof Houghton about the note would be of no value.269. The Director of Naval Intelligence and his staff shared the security service view about Houghton&apos;s reliability and about the improbability ofthe Russians telling a traitor such as Houghton of any other espionageactivities in which they were engaged. They were also influenced by thefact that the subjects which Houghton had listed were either very wide andvague or very topical at the time and were just the kind of subjects whichHoughton might have thought of if he wanted to invent a list. The Directorof Naval Intelligence therefore accepted the Security Service advice andtreated Houghton&apos;s story as incapable of affording any useful clue. Apartfrom warning the Directors and Security Officers of Research and Develop-ment Establishments concerned with some of the listed subjects, whichwas all he could effectively do, he took no action. He made this decision as a matter falling within his responsibility and without referring it to ahigher level in the Admiralty. The First Lord did not know of Houghton note or of !the decision to discount it. We think it right to record thatwe do not think that the Security Service or the Director of Naval Intelligencewere at fault in coming to the conclusion they did. Houghton gave evidence before us about this note and related matters and we ourselves found him a most unsatisfactory witness, whose statements were not to be relied uponand could not be accepted without corroboration.270. We must now return to the allegation contained in Mr. Hoskins&apos;article in the Daily Express of the 8th November.  It will be seen that the
two assumptions which alone give any support to the idea that the presenceof a spy in the Admiralty had been known for 18 months before Vassalfsarrest are both without foundation. No imicrodot or other film had beenfound at the time of the arrest of the Portland spy ring which related toany secret document retained in the Admiralty. The authorities had obtainedMFno information from Houghton which could possibly be accepted as indicating that another spy was at work in the Admiralty field.271. Consequently, there is nothing to give ground for the allegation that lord Carrington and other Admiralty officials had known since 22nd March,1961, that a spy was at work inside the Admiralty building. On the contrary,the true facts as to vassalls detection and as to the dates when it was first brought to the attention of Lord Carrington and his officials are aswe shall now set out, having had them proved in evidence before us. Itshould be stated for record that on 1st February, 1963, during the courseof our public sittings, Mr. Mars-Jones, Q.C., appearing as counsel for mr. Hoskins, Mr. Clark and Beaverbrook Newspapers, stated that he was instructed on their behalf, after hearing the answers given by Lord Carringtonin examination, to withdraw unreservedly both the allegation that he knew that there was a spy operating in the Admiralty, and the allegation that hewas reprimanded by the Prime Minister for failing to disclose the existenceof that spy.272. We mention here, in order to dispose of it, a statement thatoriginated with an article in the People of 11th November, 1962, to the effectthat Rickard, an Admiralty clerk who was found murdered in his flat inFebruary, 1962, had been recruited as an informer for the Admiralty SecurityDepartment some three months before his death and that the task given him was to inform on homosexuals in Government Departments. It was said that he had been inquiring about Vassall before his death, becauseVassall was by then already under suspicion. If there had been any truth in this story, it would have indicated that Vassall was under suspicion of one kind or another before the first possible date given to us, i.e., March1962. After examining Mr. East, the reporter who contributed the story* to the People, and hearing the evidence of Colonel Macafee, the head ofthe Admiralty Security Department, the Director-General of the security service and Commander Evan Jones, the head of the Special Branch atScotland Yard, we are satisfied that there is no truth in the story connectingRickard and Vassall or, for that matter, in the story that Rickard everwas employed as alleged.273. Vassal!&apos;s detection was brought about by information which reachedthe Security Service from March 1962 onwards. His detection did notderive in any way from the Portland case. The first intimation that reachedthe Admiralty was on 4th April, 1962, when the Director-General of theSecurity Service told the Secretary of the Admiralty that he had reasonto think that a spy was at work in the Department. The First Lord and first Sea Lord were also informed. The Director-General then reported the matter on 5th April to Lord Normanbrook (at that time Sir NormanBrook, Secretary of the Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service) so that hecould inform the Prime Minister, which he did shortly afterwards.   Thus
the allegation by Mr. Douglas Clark in the Daily Express of 9th November,that as a consequence of Mr. Hoskins&apos; article the First Lord was summonedby the Prime Minister and asked to explain why he had not told the PrimeMinister earlier about the spy, is also without foundation. Mr. Clark&apos;sallegation was based on deductions only and the facts show that isdeductions and allegation were incorrect. I;:-))274. There are two other questions in relation to Lord Carrington andthe senior members of the Admiralty that we have thought it right to consider and to deal with in this chapter of our Report. The first is, did they do all they could to bring about vassalls detection and capture, once theexistence of a spy within the Admiralty became known to them in April1962? The second, had all reasonable measures been taken to secureimprovement in Admiralty security arrangements after the Portland case?275. The responsibility for tracking down the spy in the Admiralty, oncehe was known to exist, rested with the Security Service and not with theAdmiralty, although the latter Department had a duty to do all in their power to assist. This assistance was given and the Director-General ofthe Security Service has paid tribute to it. It greatly assisted in VassalPsidentification as the spy. No criticism can be made of the Admiralty, orof the Security Service, for the fact that this arduous and delicate task of identification took about five months to complete.276. There is ample evidence that after the Portland case came to lightLord Carrington, the First Lord, supported by his senior staff, took firmsteps towards remedying the deficiencies in the Admiralty security arrange-ments revealed by the Romer Committee of Inquiry. He gave these arrange-ments his personal attention, himself selected the officer to head the newAdmiralty security organisation and has given him strong backing. On theFirst Lord&apos;s instructions this officer, the Director of Naval Security, hasmade periodical reports to the First Lord on the progress made in improvingAdmiralty security. The correction of weaknesses revealed by the RomerCommittee has been carried forward vigorously. A Minister cannot beexpected to be in touch with all the day-to-day security problems of a busyService Department, and in our view Lord Carrington has fairly dischargedhis Ministerial responsibility for security in the Admiralty in the actionshe has taken. There are no reasonable security arrangements which by themselves could have resulted in Vassall being detected as a spy, nor,so far as we can establish, did any failure in the security arrangements that were in force within the Admiralty result in vassall&apos;s espionage activitiesbeing more extensive or more fruitful than they otherwise would have been.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGSThe summary of our findings in answer to the questions posed at thebeginning of Part II and in Parts III and IV is as follows:1. The system by which the Admiralty selected Vassall for the post&apos; i of Naval Attached clerk in Moscow was inadequate to the needs ofthe situation and only permitted a superficial check of his generalreliability and character. Mr. H. V. Pennells, Civil Assistant to theDirector of Naval Intelligence, was remiss and lacking in judgement in not giving proper attention to Foreign Office warnings about theneed for careful selection and in failing to take any effective actionto have the Admiralty&apos;s system reviewed.   (Paragraphs 82-84.)Given the system of selection which existed, the Admiralty officials who chose Vassall for the Moscow post exercised due care and respon-sibility and are not to be criticised for having selected him. (Paragraph85.)2. No criticism can be made of the fact that a clerical officer of.  vassalls standing was employed on regular contact with classifiedmaterial.   (Paragraphs 27-28.)3. The staff of the British Embassy in Moscow were sufficientlyforewarned of the dangers of Russian subversion and of their duty toreport Russian contacts; but until the end of 1955 there was not sufficiently close control of association between the staff and locally-recruited employees.   (Paragraphs 137, 142-143.)4. There was no neglect by senior members of the Embassy of a proper attention to the comfort and welfare of the junior staff. (Para-graphs 102-103.)5. No person having security responsibilities in the Embassy is to blame for not detecting Vassall s homosexuality as a security risk and taking action accordingly. (Paragraphs 129-130.)6. There is no truth in the allegation that reports on Vassall by the embassy mentioning his homosexual proclivities or his Russian con-tacts were ignored by the Admiralty. No such reports were made.(Paragraph 117.)7. The means by which Sigmond Mikhailski sought employment inthe Embassy might reasonably have aroused suspicion of him, but inall the circumstances the Embassy are not to be blamed for engaginghim. The decision to retain him in the face of growing suspicion,though injudicious, was a reasoned one taken under very difficult conditions that could not admit of a wholly satisfactory solution and does not call for censure. But fault is to be found with the failure to follow up the report made by Miss Wynne in January 1956 thatVassall, among others, had been cultivated by Mikhailski. Theresponsibility for not doing so, and for not questioning Vassall about
the association, must be shared between the senior members of the embassy at that time ; the evidence is not precise enough to enableresponsibility to be allocated more closely. Whether such questioningwould have led Vassall to admit his involvement with the Russiansmust remain a matter of conjecture.   (Paragraphs 138, 145-150.)8. No blame is to be attributed to the security authorities in tlu.-British Embassy in Moscow or in the Admiralty, or to VassalFscolleagues, for the fact that Vassall&apos;s abstraction of documents wasnot detected sooner. (Paragraphs 40, 42, 201.)9. No improper influence was exercised in the Admiralty in orderto obtain for Vassall any of his various appointments or to assisthis clearance on Positive Vetting.   (Paragraphs 172-173, 175-176.)10. No blame is to be attached to the decision to assign Vassall toa post in Naval Intelligence Division at the Admiralty immediatelyafter his return from Service in Moscow.   (Paragraph 47.)11. vassalls Positve Vetting was conducted in accordance with theprescribed procedure, but in exercisng the discretion allowed them under the procedure those responsible, while not deserving of censure,were guilty of an error of judgment which resulted in inadequateenquiries being made about the period of Vassall&apos;s life when he wasin Moscow. It is possible that if Captain Bennett had been askedabout him some suspicon of Vassall&apos;s homosexuality might have come to light.   (Paragraphs 169-171.)12. Although the majority of Vassall&apos;s colleagues in the Admiraltyregarded him as effeminate, there was little suspicion by any of themthat he might be a homosexual. He had no office reputation as ahomosexual and was not, as has been alleged, a &quot; known pervert&quot;.(Paragraph 66.)13. No blame can be attributed to any person in the Admiralty whowas responsible for vassalls security for failing to detect Vassall&apos;shomosexuality as a security risk.  (Paragraphs 66, 211.)14. No blame can be attributed to any person in the Admiralty whowas responsible for vassalls security for failing to inform themselves of his style of living and deducing from this that he was a security risk.(Paragraphs 58, 61, 211.)15. There is no truth in the allegation that &quot; the Admiralty &quot; or &quot; topAdmiralty men &quot; gave Vassall a reference in connexion with his lease of a flat in Dolphin Square. (Paragraph 204.)16. There was nothing improper in the relationship between Mr.Galbraith and Vassall. Any suggestion that they were planning to meet in Italy and that Vassall then intended to defect to the Russians iswithout foundation. Mr. Galbraith was not remiss in failing to suspect,from his knowledge of Vassall, that the latter was a security risk.(Paragraphs 246-247, 250-254.)
17. There is no truth in the allegation that the presence of anotherspy inside the Admiralty was known to the First Lord and his Servicechiefs for 18 months before Vassall&apos;s arrest. The first suspicion of thiswas conveyed to them in April, 1962.   (Paragraphs 271, 273.)*The services of Mr. K. M. McLeod as Secretary to the Tribunal were ofgreat value to us in our work. He carried a heavy burden of administrativeduties, and in addition to that he was a constant and skilled assistant tous in everything that related to our deliberations. We wish to record oursincere gratitude to him for all that he did.RADCLIFFE.PATRICK BARRY.E. MILNER HOLLAND.5th April, 1963.
