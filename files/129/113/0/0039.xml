SECRETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1963-64Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Bills suggested by Ministers for inclusion in the Legislative programme for 1963-64 have been considered by the Future Legislation Committee, who have assumed that the aim should be to provide a programme for a full Session.Wherever possible, particularly in List B the Main Programme Bills, the FutureLegislative Committee have tried to include Bills which are relevant to our generaltheme of modernisation. In the list annexed the Bills have been provisionallyclassified under the following heads:A.l. EssentialA.2. ContingentB. Main ProgrammeC-Bills in ReserveD.-Other BillsP. Bills suitable for a Private Member.2. It has been assumed that the Peerage Bill and the Nigeria Bill will beobtained this Session; but there may be Bills already introduced (for exampleLegal Aid) which will not be carried through this Session and will have to beprovided for in the next.3. On the best estimate that can be made at present (and allowing for someof the Contingent Bills not in the end being required) the Essential, Contingentand Main Programme Lists would provide us with a full programme for the session. It follows that Bills can be, added, to the. Main Programme only at theexpense of ones already there and that there is little prospect of Governmenttime being found for Bills in Lists C and D. We must of course expect that someother Bills will emerge as policy develops which it will be imperative to add to theProgramme.4. Among Bills not in the main programme I would particularly inviteattention to Further Education-the Bill to implement decisions arising out of thereport of the Robbins Committee. This has been excluded because I understandthat the report is not expected before July and there would be obvious practicaldifficulties in legislating next Session. But if some way could be found of expediting the report or the consideration of the Committee&apos;s recommendations this Bill wouldbe a very worth while addition to the Programme even at the expense of someBill already included in it.5. The Programme will be further considered when the terms of the Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament are being settled in the autumn. MeanwhileI seek the approval of the Cabinet for the provisional Programme I have described.I.
