Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1963C. (63) 81 Copy No.   5216th May, 1963CABINETUNITED KINGDOM SHIPPING TO CUBA \\Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of TransportWe circulate at Annex for the information of our colleagues a memorandumon this subject in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet at their 28th Meeting(C.C. (63) 28th Meeting, Minute 2 (d)).In the circumstances we do not feel that any further action to restrain UnitedKingdom ships from trading with Cuba is called for, although it may be necessaryto re-examine the position at a later date.H.E. M.15th May, 1963.
AnnexUNITED KINGDOM SHIPPING TO CUBAAt the time of the Cuban crisis last October, 10 United Kingdom companies had contracts in the Cuban trade with the Soviet bloc and the Cubans involvingabout 40 ships. Five of these companies have already withdrawn from the tradeand a sixth may shortly do so. Of the 32 United Kingdom flag ships known tohave visited or to be en route to Cuba since 1st January, 1963, 23 are UnitedKingdom registered and nine are on colonial registers (eight from Hong Kong andone from the Bahamas). The two major United Kingdom companies engaged inthe trade are committed to long-term contracts with the Russians and the Cubans.If these contracts were broken, indemnities running into millions of pounds wouldhave to be paid and there is no readily available alternative trade for the ships.2. The United Kingdom is now, in United States eyes, the main delinquent.The Greeks have nearly as many ships involved, but the Greek Government has given way to United States pressure by agreeing not to permit any new charters of greek vessels for the Cuban trade. Other Western countries have only a handfulof ships left in the trade.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have no powers at present to control themovement or chartering of United Kingdom ships; to take such powers wouldrequire legislation. So far as United Kingdom-registered vessels are concerned,the most we can do is to draw the attention of shipowners to the situation(including the possibility of United States reprisals) and leave it to them to decidewhere their best interests lie. This we have done. The recent appearance of hong Kong-registered ships has inflated the total of United Kingdom flag vessels and the Governor of Hong Kong is being asked to report on the position.4. Apart from prohibiting United States flag ships from trading with Cuba,the United States Government has so far taken only one measure to restrictmaritime trade with Cuba. This prohibited the carriage of United StatesGovernment cargoes in ships which had called at Cuba since 1st January, 1963,with the proviso that offending shipowners might have their ships again madeeligible for such cargoes if they gave satisfactory assurances that they had withdrawn from Cuban trade.5. The United States Foreign Aid Appropriation Act, passed by Congress inOctober 1962, contains provisions which also affect countries whose ships tradewith Cuba. Section 107 (a) of the Act provides that no United States aid shall begiven to a country which, inter alia, permits its ships to carry arms or certainstrategic materials to Cuba. Section 107 (b) provides that no United Stateseconomic aid shall be given to a country which permits its ships to carry items ofeconomic assistance to Cuba. It was to avoid the consequences of Section 107 (a)that Her Majesty&apos;s Government recently decided to refuse export licences for theexport of goods on the Co-ordinating Committee (COCOM) List I to Cuba. Itis extremely unlikely that the Soviet bloc would use United Kingdom ships to sendstrategic materials to Cuba. The possible effect of Section 107 (b) on our colonial territories is being studied in consultation with the United States authorities.6. Last autumn the United States Government were contemplating thefollowing further measures against shipping to Cuba which they did not in theevent put into effect:(i) the closure of United States ports to all flag ships of any nation any of whose ships carried arms to Cuba;(ii) the closure of United States ports to any ships which on the samecontinuous voyage were used on bloc-Cuban trade.A third measure has in the past been urged on the United States Government by congress and by the Longshoremen&apos;s Union, namely(iii) the closure of United States ports to all the ships of any line any of whoseships are engaged in the Cuban trade.
7. The possibility of the United States Government adopting further measures designed to restrict free world shipping to Cuba can by no means be excluded. Domestic agitation in the United States to do something about Castroshows no signs of abating and the Republicans are using the Cuban problem as their main platform for attacking the Administration. The Administration have no present intention of resorting to a full-scale invasion or blockade of Cuba, butshort of these extreme steps they would like to create at any rate the appearance of following a tough policy calculated to lead to the downfall of the Castro regime.There are not many ways in which they can give this impression. United Statespressure on the Soviet Union to withdraw more troops from Cuba will no doubtcontinue, but quick results cannot be expected. There is little more that theAdministration can do in the Organisation of American States to bring about theisolation of the Cuban regime.; The Cuban exiles have turned out to be an embarrassment, and the United States authorities have been obliged to clampdown on their activities. There is therefore virtually nothing left to theAdministration but to bring pressure to bear on their allies to apply economic sanctions to Cuba, particularly in the context of shipping.8. If the United States Government decide to take further action they arelikely to proceed step by step in the hope that each step will at least buy time byrelieving the pressure on them. They would be most unlikely to adopt (i) inparagraph 4 above: this was related to the Soviet military build-up last autumn and in any case the risk of arms being carried to Cuba in free world ships is negligible. The closure of United States ports to ships on the same continuousvoyage ((ii) above) is more probable. This would not have a serious effect on united Kingdom shipping interests. If it proved ineffective in solving theAdministration^ domestic difficulties they might be inclined to adopt the more radical measure in (iii) above the closure of United States ports to all ships ofany line trading with Cuba.9. This measure would have less effect on United Kingdom shipping now than when it was proposed in October last because most major United Kingdomcompanies with no long-term commitments have voluntarily left Cuban trade. Itwould however be seriously harmful to one major shipping line (the Athel Line),which has had long-term continuing contracts with the Cubans for the transportof sugar to the United Kingdom and Europe for over 30 years. The other majorUnited Kingdom company (London and Overseas Freighters) with a long-term contract (to the Soviet Union) and the smaller companies doing single voyagesmight be little affected. It is understood that they do not normally do business with the United States and would have nothing much to lose by continuing in the cuban trade.10. Provided the problem for the United States Government remainsprimarily one of domestic politics and provided the Cuban Government doesnothing seriously to provoke the Administration, the United States Governmentare most unlikely to contemplate any measures more serious than those mentionedin paragraph 6 (ii) and (iii) above.
