EXPORT, OF LARGE DIAMETER STEEL PIPET^TjHFsO^TBLgGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and jhe Presidentof the Board of TradeIf, as seems possible, a United Kingdom firm secures a soviet contract for a large quantity of steel pipe over 19 inches indiameter there is liable to be an outcry on the part of our north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies.    This is because her majesty&apos;s Government have been accused of bad faith, and inparticular have been misrepresented as committed to uphold a unanimous NATO embargo on the export of such material to theSoviet blqcrBackground2.     The facts are as follows.    Large diameter pipe was removed from the Co-ordinating Committee (COCOM) List, with United Statesagreement, in 1958.    In 1962, however, the United States government undertook a campaign to secure an embargo on its export to theSoviet blo . in order to delay the completion of the &quot;Friendship&quot; oilpipeline linking the Soviet Union with the satellites.    They did not press for its re-inclusion in the COCOM List, but introduced a draft resolution in the NATO Committee of Economic Advisersrecommending an embargo on it.    Both there, and v/hen the subjectcame up in the North Atlantic Council on 21st November, our representatives opposed the United States proposal and attacked theeconomic, political and military arguments adduced in favour of it.They called in aid the conclusions of a committee of NATO expertswhich had reported on 8th October, 1962, that even if a completeembargo v/ere imposed the construction of the &quot;Friendship&quot; pipelinewould only be delayed by eight months (according to the German,French and United Kingdom experts) or a maximum of two years(according to the United States expert).    We disputed the strategicsignificance of this pipeline, since it would be of value only in the prolonged kind of warfare which NATO does not envisage, and pointedout that in any case West German firms had already exported verylarge quantities of this material to the Soviet Union (according to german industry&apos;s own figures the total is 710, 000 tons between1959 and 1962), not to speak of smaller amounts exported from Italyand France.    There was also the problem of making an embargowatertight v/hen Japanese and Swedish firms would not be committed by the NATO embargo.    Our representative on the North atlantic council stated that &quot;the United Kingdom Government had no means,-1-siC. (63) 60 COPY NO..............0f*CABINET
direct or indirect, of stopping deliveries of large diameter pipe tothe Soviet bloc, or of preventing new contracts for such deliveries&quot;,and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;were not prepared to undertake the Parliamentary procedure necessary to obtain legal power to implement the Decision, since, given their position on the matter,they would not be able to assure Parliament that the embargo was justified&quot;.    (A note on the Parliamentary procedures involved in applying an embargo on the export to the Soviet Union of largediameter steel pipe is at Annex 1. )    In view of the pressure towhich we were exposed in the North Atlantic Council, however, wherenot even the German representative supported us, the United kingdom representative said that he could agree not to oppose the Decision,the text of which is an Annex 2, provided it was clearly understoodthat the words in it &quot;to the extent possible&quot; would mean in the caseof the United Kingdom &quot;not at all&quot;.    The text of our representative1 remarks, including this reservation of our freedom of action, wasincorporated in the official NATO record, and no member of NATOcould have been in the slightest doubt that we did not considerourselves bound by the Decision.3.     As a result of this Decision the Federal German government took powers not only to prevent German firms from concluding furthercontracts for the supply of this material to the Soviet bloc^, but alsoto prevent the fulfilment of existing contracts.    The matter was raised in the Bundestag on 18th March, and despite pressure openlyapplied to the Free Democratic Party by the United States embassy at Bonn, it was clear that the Free Democrats intended to join theSocial Democrats in defeating the Government on this issue.    TheFederal German Government thereupon instructed all theirChristian Democrat supporters to leave the Chamber and for want of a quorum the motion opposing the Governments action was notcarried.4.     Both during this debate and afterwards, German Ministers andthe official spokesman of the Federal German Government havemisrepresented Her Majesty&apos;s Governments position in the matter by saying that the NATO decision was &quot;unanimous&quot; and that all membersof NATO are committed to uphold it.    This has led to a good deal ofabuse of the United Kingdom, notably in the German and Swiss Press,including accusations that for the sake of a Soviet contract we areprepared to default on a NATO obligation.   Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Bonn has, however, reported that the true position is beginning tobe better understood in Germany, and that he does not consider thatthe effects of an announcement that a United Kingdom firm had gaineda Soviet contract would be either severe or lasting.    He comments also,however, that the German Foreign Minister feels himselfpersonally involved, since he has been attacked for deceiving the bundestag and German public opinion, and would take such anannouncement hardly.    The United States reaction would probably be stronger, since our action might provide an excuse to other membersof NATO to claim that there was no point in upholding the embargoany longer now that a breach in it had been opened.-2-CONFIDENT8AL
5.     Basically, of course, this issue is between ourselves and theUnited States and is inspired partly by their desire to restrict Sovietcompetition with United States oil companies in Western Europe, andpartly by their hankering after more restrictions on trade with theSoviet bloci than are provided for by the COCOM Strategic List.    Ourview has always been, however, that subject to certain safeguardsEast-West trade is desirable on political as well as economic grounds.There is therefore bound to be a continuing source of disagreement between us, though it is clearly in our interests to damp down contro-versy as far as possible on individual issues like steel pipe.    Nor dowe want an open row with the Germans.     We do not, therefore,favour an immediate statement of our position as made clear in NATO,however justifiable this might be following German misrepresentation.Apart from anything else, the replies to Parliamentary questions whichthe Lord Privy Seal and the President of the Board of Trade haverecently given provide our posts abroad with a good deal of ammunition to use informally with their contacts, including the Press.The Pre sent Situation6.      The present state of the negotiations being conducted by theUnited Kingdom firms is as follows.    The only United Kingdomcompany likely to get a Soviet order in the near future is the SouthDurham Steel and Iron Company.    They had an enquiry from theRussians at the end of 1962 but discussions petered out, since theRussians stipulated a barter deal on terms unacceptable to the company.On 4th April, however, the Soviet Trade Delegation in London proposedto renew negotiations, abandoned the idea of a barter deal and showedconsiderable keenness to conclude a contract quickly.    Since, however,a United States oil company had meanwhile suggested the possibility ofa deal whereby South Durham should receive a United States orderlarge enough to prevent them from concluding a contract with theSoviet Union, South Durham told the Russians that they could not givea firm answer for about a fortnight.    Our latest information is thatthe United States offer will not be large enough to satisfy South durham and the latter are therefore likely to resume negotiations with theRussians, this time in Moscow, about the end of this month.    It isquite likely that a contract will be concluded very shortly thereafterand an announcement would quickly follow.    If South Durham do des-patch representatives to Moscow, a fact which would inevitably become known, we can expect a further wave of criticism even before a contractis concluded.7.     It is before this point is reached, therefore, that we considerthat a statement of the Governments attitude in this matter,emphasising that our attitude has been perfectly consistent throughoutand that all our Allies have been well aware of it from the beginning,would be most useful.8.     We therefore ask our colleagues to agree that such a statement,which would be agreed between us, should be made just before the departure to Moscow of representatives of South Durham.H.F.

ANNEX 1Parliamentary Procedures Involved in Applyingan Embargo on the Ex Oj^t^c^the^oviet?LL9iL 2 JiaJ E . Diameter Steel PipeThe object of an embargo is to prevent goods which are under united Kingdom control arriving in the Soviet bloc.To do this, two prohibitions have to be imposed -(a) The first is to prevent the goods being exported directly from the United Kingdom.    To prevent.the export of pipeswould require an order to amend the Export of Goods(Control) Order under Section 1 of the Import, Export and customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939.    This order is not subject to any Parliamentary procedure, i. e. it is not subject either to affirmative or negative resolution.(b) The second is to prevent disposal to the bloc of goods heldabroad by persons in the United Kingdom.      To applythis to pipes would require an Order amending the strategic Goods (Control) Order;  this would be madeunder Regulation 55 of the Defence (General) Regulation1939 as continued in force by the Emergency Laws(Repeal) Act 1959.    The Order has to be laid beforeParliament for forty days and is subject to a negative resolution.Both amending orders can become operative as soon as they are made.These are the procedures which are followed  in embargoinggoods on the COCOM International List.The fact that one of the orders is subject to a negative resolutionmeans that a Parliamentary procedure is involved.    This is the point which has been emphasised in the NATO discussions on the export oflarge diameter pipe.
ANNEX 2The NATO Council Decision of21st November, m 1962X1.     Member countries, on their own responsibility, should tothe extent possible -(i)  stop deliveries of large diameter pipe (over 19 inches)to the Soviet bloc under existing contracts;(ii) prevent new contracts for such deliveries.2. The Council would keep the situation under observation and review as appropriate.-5-
