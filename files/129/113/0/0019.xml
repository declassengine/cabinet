22nd April, 1963CABINETTHE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT ACT AND THE NORTH-east memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentjand Minister for Welsh affairs agree with the President of the Boardof Trade that a recon-sideration of general Local Employment Act policy must await thevarious regional studies.    I fully understand his difficulties in changing the administration of the policy so as to appear to reduce the percentageof unemployment which would justify designation.2,     But I also agree with the Lord President that it is already clearthat the current policy will not serve in the North-East without some modification.    It seems certain that we shall have to concentrate effort on some places not themselves within development districts, but con-veniently sited to take up the slack in development districts.    such places would offer better prospects of new growth than the old coal andsteel settlements.    We cannot get the growth, however, unless such places are eligible for the various grants and fiscal aids;  and since their development will be for the benefit of the development districtsit must be right that they should be eligible.3.     While we cannot at this point anticipate the result of the studyor the decisions taken on it, it would be extremely embarrassing notto be able to implement whatever measures we decide on because of alack of powers.    Of course, it may be that the powers under the I960Act are in fact sufficient for the purpose.    The Act says that the purposeof the powers conferred is to provide appropriate employment for thebenefit of a development district;  it does not say that the employment has to be provided within the development district.4.     It is for the President to say whether he would feel able to operate his present powers, as proposed to be amended by the newBill, so that grants and fiscal aids were available in a place not itselfwithin a high unemployment exchange area, but to be developed for thebenefit of such an area.    If there is doubt, I think we should take theopportunity offered by the Local Employment Bill to make it clear thatthe powers would, where appropriate, be so operated.K. J.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, 3. W. 1.22nd April, 196352COPY NO.
