FURTHER MILITARY AID FOR india memorandum by the Secretary ofJStatg^for^ Commc^wealth relations and Secretary of State for the ColoniesQuite apart from the question of Anglo-American co-operation in theair defence of India, which is being considered separately, we shall have todiscuss with the Indian Minister of Defence Co-ordination,Mr. Krishnamachari, the general question of further military aid for India.2,     Under the Nassau arrangement, we and the United States are eachsupplying India with about  20 million worth of equipment without charge tomeet the immediate needs of the emergency.    Since then, the Indians have worked out a  2,400 million rearmament plan and are asking us and theUnited States to help meet its foreign exchange element, which they estimateto be about  600 million,3.     The United States, who agree with us that aid on this scale isaltogether outside the realm of reality, have discussed withMr. Krishnamachari the possibility of helping India to meet a number of specific needs.    An account of their talks has been circulated to theCabinet (C, (63) 94).     From this it will be seen that the United States have undertaken to consider assisting in the following ways:-(a) loan of transport aircraft;(b) provision of equipment for road-making;(c) provision of plant for small arms and ammunitionproduction;(d) training facilities for Indian officers.4,     In the light of these United States offers, it is clear that our. response to the Indians cannot be wholly negative.    However, like the United States,we need not at this stage indicate precisely what further military aid we areprepared to give.5.     I propose therefore that we should tell Mr. Krishnamachari that,while we cannot promise further large scale defence aid from the UnitedKingdom, we are prepared to consider certain specific requests which havebeen made by India, for example:-(a) military technical assistance, including the training ofIndian air crews and the despatch of experts;(b) repair and maintenance of existing Indian radar;(c) the provision of some additional army and signalsequipment;(d) certain urgently needed Air Force stores, including some 30   vx-a.$ ammunition.-1-SECRETG. (63) 92 COPY NO.27th May, 1963CABINET
6.     The cost of such further assistance will depend on the quantitiesof equipment we provide in each category.     It might amount to about 10 million beyond the  20 million agreed at Nassau,    As most ofthis equipment would have to be manufactured, deliveries and payment would be spread over a period of two or three years.7.      v7e should also make it clear to Mr. Krishnamachari that, inspending any foreign exchange which India has available for buying armabroad, we would expect her, wherever possible, to purchase equip-ment from the United Kingdom and the United States rather than from our European and other competitors (e.g. Swede?i) who are not givingher military aid.D.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1.27th May, 1963-2-
