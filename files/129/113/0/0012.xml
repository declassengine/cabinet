A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State,1st April, 1963
ANNEX:From the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia29th March, 1963aThe Rt. Hon. R.A. Butler, C. H. , M.P. ,Her Majesty&apos;s First Secretary of State,Treasury Chambers,Great George Street,London, S. W. 1.Sir,At our interview this morning when you informed me of theBritish Governments decisions taken as a result of the talks heldthis week in London, I raised the question of the full independence of Southern Rhodesia in the light of the situation as you described it.You invited the Southern Rhodesia Government to attend later in theyear in RJiodesia a Conference with the Governments concerned todetermine the broad lines of a new association between SouthernRhodesia and Northern Rhodesia.   I emphasised that the nature of theBritish Governments decision amounted to a recognition ofNorthern Rhodesia&apos;s right to secede from the Federation and,therefore, this raised the vital issue for Southern Rhodesia of itsown independence.   I have now carefully considered the southern rhodesian attitude towards the Conference and I wish to state thatthe Southern Rhodesia Government will not attend a Conference unless we receive in writing from you an acceptable undertaking that southern Rhodesia will receive its independence concurrently with thedate on which either Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland is allowed tosecede, whichever is the first.You were kind enough to state that you thought this attitude was not unreasonable but that it would not be possible for you to give an immediate decision on Southern Rhodesia&apos;s independence; and thatyou were ready to receive from my Government a formal applicationfor this independence on the terms I have outlined.I, therefore, submit in this letter a formal application, now that both Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia have been given the rightto secede from the Federation that Southern Rhodesia should be givenits full independence on the first date when either one or the otherterritory is allowed to secede or obtains its independence.I do not think it is necessary to enlarge on the strength ofthe Southern Rhodesia claim at this juncture, but I feel that I mustmention two pointe that are of particular importance.    The first isthat Southern Rhodesia has successfully managed its own internal affairs for forty years and that it cannot be granted less thanNyasaland which will not have much more than one year beforeprobably attaining its complete independence.    The second point
is that so long as the last remaining links remain and the impressionpersists that the United Kingdom has the right to interfere in ourinternal affairs there is the danger of a series of serious incidents of disorder being encouraged from outside in order to compel suchintervention by the British Government.    It was confirmed by youat our interview that the British Government had of course nosuch intention but so long as these links remain the impression willcontinue that the British Government has the powers irrespective of their intention to use them.Mr. Dupont will be remaining in London for some days forthe purpose of receiving the decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government,I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) WINSTON FIELDPrime Minister
