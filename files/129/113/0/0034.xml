COPY NO. J^si.14th May, 1963CABINETWHITE PAPER ON HOUSING policy memorandum by the Minister of HealthWhile recognising the importance of an initiative in the field of housing policy, I submit that the three major proposals in thememorandum of the Housing Ministers (C.(63) 80) are open to serious difficulties.The Future Housing programme .      The minority of houses are built on the initiative of localauthorities;     the majority are built on the initiative of private firms,corporations and individuals.    We can stop local authorities buildingmore than a certain number by withholding loan sanction.    within limits we can cajole them into building more.    Beyond that theGovernment has no power to determine how many houses are builteither negatively (unless we are to reintroduce licencing), orpositively (unless we are to take over house-building as a state activity).3.      I do not therefore think we should be wise to represent anytotal number of houses as a &quot;target&quot; or attribute to Government the&quot;intention&quot; that it should be attained.    The Governments mainfunction is to give guidance and leadership to local authorities in doing what we consider they should do.    Should our policy not be expressedrather on the lines of paragraph 47 of the draft White Paper, than on those of paragraph 19 ?AJriousing Corporation4.      The proposition is that houses can and should be produced to let at rents covering all costs, if the capital, repayable over 40 years,is provided as to two-thirds or less by building societies and as to atleast one-third by the Government &quot;at current rates of interest&quot;.5.      This proposition assumes (a) that there is a large potentialdemand for houses to rent at economic rents and (b) that the demand isnot satisfied because of the fear of re-imposition of rent control.6.     I consider these assumptions to be dubious.    With so manyhouses still let at controlled rents or subsidised rents and with the continuing spread of house ownership, it is easy to over-estimate the size of the potential market for houses to let at rents well abovecontrolled or subsidised levels.
7.     As regards the second assumption, the proposed arrangementsdo admittedly meet the risk of re-imposed rent control by shifting itonto the Exchequer.    The doubt is whether we can rely on philanthropyto provide the initiative and enterprise which elsewhere have to berewarded with profit.    As The Economist put it (llth May, 1963 page 521)&quot;The one clear way in which the skill, energy and community spiritneeded to run a housing project as a grotip can be attracted is by removing, or finding how to evade, the restrictions that demand thatthere is no profit for anyone in exerting them&quot;.8.     I suggest that a prospective 15, 000 houses by 1967 are not worth the risk of this initiative proving a failure or the objections to creating a new state-guaranteed agency to do the job of private enterprisewithout profit.    Would it not be wiser to see how the housing societyprovisions of the 1961 Act continue to work out?Compulsory Improvement9.     The proposition is that if tenants do not think improvementsworth 6^ per cent of the cost in annual rent, and landlords do not think12^ per cent a sufficient return on improvements, then they ought to be forced to do so.    The Minister of Housing does not exaggerate when hecalls this &quot;a new principle&quot; - presumably for non-Socialists.    It isnot here argued that the prospect of renewed rent control inhibits theworking of the market:  we are frankly asked to use compulsion to makeprivate owners do what it is not worth their while to do.    I do notthink that a fall in the annual rate of grant-aided improvements from135, 000 in I960 to 115, 000 in 1962 is sufficient to justify this.J. E. P.Ministry of Health, S. E. 1.14th May, 1963
