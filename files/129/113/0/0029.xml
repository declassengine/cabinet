Copy No.   52CABINETDISARMAMENT: A UNITED KINGDOM PACKAGE of pre-STAGE I measures memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith for the consideration of my colleagues and for discussion at our meeting on 9th May a proposed &quot; package of pre-Stage i disarmamentmeasures &quot;, together with an explanatory note.2. These papers are in the form in which they were considered by the DefenceCommittee on 3rd May with amendments of detail, including an amendment totake account of the Defence Committee&apos;s discussions. i hope that my colleagues will be prepared to authorise the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to putforward this proposal to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva, subject to theagreement of the United States and the NATO Alliance.3. The only paper to be tabled at Geneva would be the so-called &quot; WorkingPaper on Pre-Stage i Measures&quot;. The explanatory memorandum has beenprepared to assist consideration here.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,6th May, 1963.DISARMAMENT: A UNITED KINGDOM PACKAGE of pre-STAGE I measures the Geneva Conference is at present going through a difficult phase, as you know, and virtually no progress has been made since the Christmas recess. quite apart from our problems on the nuclear tests side, which recently brought theconference for the first time to the verge of collapse, we face a troublesome situation on disarmament. There has been little substantive discussion of disarmament sincethe conference resumed in February; but previous discussions had been sufficientto expose the immensity of the problem and the divergencies between the two sides.In addition, procedural difficulties have held up work on collateral measures, wherethe only progress has been Soviet acceptance in principle of the American proposalfor direct emergency communications. In the circumstances it is not surprising that the neutrals are losing heart. The Russians have already dropped a hint thatthe conference should be wound up and pressure for this, might mount if eventsdo not take a new turn fairly soon.C.

2. We know that the Americans have been working on what they term a&quot; separable &quot; Stage I for disarmament, but this has run into difficulties in washington and may never emerge. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs has thereforehad it in mind that a single package of introductory pre-Stage I measures mightbe put forward as a British initiative at the conference in an endeavour to getthings moving. The Swedes tentatively suggested such a package last summer.Its purpose would be to assemble a number of modest measures, drawn from the fields of collateral measures, of arms reduction and of preparation for general and complete disarmament, most of which are already on the conference table, but which we hope would be sufficient to get some physical destruction of weaponsstarted.3. The attached memorandum summarises the initiative in the form in whichit would probably be presented to the Geneva Conference. The following criteriahave governed the choice of items:(i) The measures should be those on which there already is, or appears likelyto be, a fairly wide area of agreement between East and West.(ii) They should be those in which the United Kingdom is ready to take part,or which would involve no special difficulties for us.(iii) They should not be open to serious objection from our NATO allies.(iv) They should be simple and easy to apply.(v) They should not necessitate complicated verification or other forms ofreassurance.(vi) Wherever possible, they should be of a type that could be developedfurther in Stage I, and could lead on to the sort of measures that the americans are thinking of putting forward for a &quot; separable Stage I&quot;.4. The most important of the items in the package is that providing for thedestruction of armaments. It is of course essential that we should contribute in ourown plan; the Chiefs of Staff have therefore been consulted about a possible UnitedKingdom contribution. The following items, which are all surplus stock and donot affect operational capacity, could probably be made available now:ShipsOne cruiserOne destroyerTwo frigatesOne ocean minesweeperAircraftTwenty Canberra B-2sBombs1,000 250-lb. high-explosive bombs2,000 500-lb. high-explosive bombsThe Admiralty put the approximate total value of the ships to be offered at about 1,545,000 broken down as follows:One cruiser ...     ...     .....      ...  860,000One destroyer      ......-    ...     ...  440,000Two frigates        ......     ...     ...  170,000One ocean minesweeper.........  75,000If the aircraft were to be destroyed as they are, including radar, gunsights andnavigational equipment, the value to the Air Ministry would be  40,000 per aircraft,i.e., a total of  800,000. If they were stripped, however, of these trimmings first(although they would remain complete aircraft) the value of the twenty Canberraaircraft on the open market would be about  15,000 per aircraft. The value of the bombs has been put at  20,000.5. It is not intended to give details of the armaments that the UnitedKingdom would be prepared to contribute for destruction when the UnitedKingdom package is presented at Geneva. Details will be given at a later stage ifthe Russians show interest in the idea.
6. The question of which Department should meet the cost of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s part in the item providing for the destruction of armaments is one whichwill need further study. The Ministry of Defence have expressed the opinion that none of the cost should be borne on the Service Votes and they have said that theyassume the Foreign Office would be ready to accept responsibility. Our officialswill take this up.7. In the present climate it is highly unlikely that a package of this kind would lead to an early agreement at Geneva. It should however be widely welcomed byall the members of the conference other than the Soviet bloc. It could thus be a welcome stimulus to the work of the conference and an encouragement to the neutrals to remain at the table. It should also reflect credit on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for taking the initiative.8. I hope that my colleagues will be able to give their approval to this UnitedKingdom initiative. Assuming that they do, the next step will be to consult the americans and the NATO Alliance. If they agree with our proposal, it will betabled at Geneva. Something of this nature is urgently needed in view of thepresent climate there and I would hope that we can carry out these consultationsrapidly.WORKING PAPER ON PRE-STAGE I measures the United Kingdom remains convinced that agreement on a workable plan for general and complete disarmament can and must be achieved. But it is clearthat this will take time. No. 8 of the Principles agreed by the United States andthe Soviet Union in 1961 called on the States participating in the negotiations &quot; to achieve and implement the widest possible agreement at the earliest possible date &quot;.It also stated that &quot; measures of disarmament should be undertaken without prejudicing progress on agreement on the total programme and in such a way thatthese measures would facilitate and form part of that programme &quot;. The UnitedKingdom believes that the time has come when the conference could usefullyconsider adopting a group or package of such pre-Stage I measures.2. The essential purpose of pre-Stage I measures, in accordance with No. 8of the agreed Principles, is to build up international confidence in preparation forgeneral and complete disarmament. The measures in question must thereforeinvolve no special difficulty or disadvantages for any of the Powers taking part andshould be simple and easy to apply. They should necessitate only such verificationas is generally acceptable. By definition, they should be of such a nature that theycould be developed further in Stage I.3. It is hoped that, when assembled together in a package, the measures will do more to foster international confidence than if implemented one by one.4. The United Kingdom proposes that the following measures drawn fromthe fields of arms reduction, of collateral measures and of preparation for generaland complete disarmament should now be agreed and assembled into a packageof pre-Stage I measures to take effect at the same time. Where verification wouldbe needed, this is indicated and the means suggested.Destruction of Weapons5. The Governments and peoples of the world expect the Geneva conference to agree upon an early start to the physical destruction of arms. The UnitedKingdom proposes that, as a gesture to increase confidence and as a preliminary to the full-scale programme of general and complete disarmament which theconference is negotiating, a mutually agreed quantity of armaments should be destroyed. In order that an effective contribution to disarmament can be made,the armaments to be destroyed must come mainly from the principal militaryPowers. The United Kingdom will be prepared to play its part and is ready toenter immediately into detailed discussions on this subject.6. Destruction would take place at agreed localities under supervision byagreed international teams. The United Kingdom would be prepared to makefacilities available, both for reception of the agreed weapons and for theirdestruction.   It suggests that verification of this measure should be undertaken by
teams made up of representatives of each of the Powers participating in the geneva conference. Hence valuable experience will be gained in the problems of destruction of weapons under international supervision, and this will be of directhelp in the establishment of the International Disarmament Organisation.Exchange of Military Missions7. There is an urgent need to take steps to reduce the risk of war. A number ofsuch steps have been proposed in the United States working paper on the reductionof the risk of war through accident, miscalculation, or failure of communication,circulated as Document ENDC/70. The United Kingdom suggests that, withoutfurther delay, the proposal to exchange military missions should be implemented.The purpose of this exchange would be to improve contacts between the militaryestablishments of States in order to reduce the danger of misunderstanding. Themost urgent need is for an exchange of military missions between the United Statesand the Soviet Union, but other Powers would be free to take part in such a scheme,and the United Kingdom, for its part, would be prepared to exchange missions withthe Soviet Union, if this were thought useful.Emergency Communications8. The United Kingdom proposes that the plan for the establishment of direct Government-to-Government communications for use in a military emergency should be implemented without delay. The main need is again for a direct link between the United States and the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom welcomesthe fact that this has already been agreed in principle and that technical discussions between the two countries are beginning (have begun).Other Measures to reduce the Risk of War9. The most urgent of the other measures to reduce the risk of war is theestablishment of observation posts at important communications centres, such asmajor ports, railway centres, motor highways and air bases, to observe troop movements and the concentration of forces. This measure would not onlycontribute to the reduction of the risk of war through miscalculation or accidentbut also to the reduction of the risk of surprise attack. The United Kingdomproposes that the principal military Powers should consult together and draw uplists of the sites at which observation posts should be established.The Peaceful Use of Outer Space10. World public opinion is alarmed at the prospect of the arms race spreadingto outer space. Because of the swift development of modern weapons, it is important to take steps to prevent this happening without delay. The United Kingdomproposes that the United States and the Soviet Union, as the Powers principally concerned, should consult together with the object of agreeing to declare that theywill not place weapons of mass destruction in outer space.Military Expenditure11. The United Kingdom hopes that it will prove possible to include in stage I of general and complete disarmament provisions for the indirect verificationof disarmament measures by the use of information about military expenditure,including widely based economic and financial information. Careful study of this possibility is needed and the United Kingdom proposes that the Powers taking part in the Geneva Conference should undertake this study now.Conclusion12. The above list is in no way intended to be exhaustive. The proposals aredeliberately modest because they are designed for immediate action. agreement on their implementation could lead to an immediate start on the physical destructionof armaments, with consequent encouragement to the work of the conference,and to the hopes of all those who wish to see our efforts crowned with success.Foreign Office, S.W.1,April 24, 1963.
