Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1963C. (63) 88 Copy No.     5 221st May, 1963I CABINETAMENDMENT TO PUBLIC ORDER ACT, 1936IMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 2nd May (C.C. (63) 28th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet consideredmemoranda by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and myself (C. (63) 70and 71) about the question of amending the Public Order Act, 1936. As a result,I was invited to consider in consultation with the Attorney-General the possibilityof promoting legislation which would both increase the penalties for offences underSection 5 of the Public Order Act, 1936, and amend that section to include the concept of inciting hatred, without explicitly referring to racial hatred. I attach aBill which Parliamentary Counsel prepared for these purposes.2. This has been discussed with the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Attorney-General andthe Chief Whip. We are agreed that, if the Cabinet desires that legislation be promoted on these lines, the text of the Bill is suitable.3. We considered whether legislation of this sort might be secured by meansof amendments to the Bill already introduced by Mr. Iremonger. We are allsatisfied that this is not politically wise; the long title of Mr. Iremonger&apos;s Bill is sowide that any attempt to amend it would open the way for other far-rangingamendments.4. With the agreement of my colleagues I have seen Mr. Iremonger and discussed with him very tentatively the possibility of his dropping the present bill and replacing it by another one on the lines of the draft. He would support this newwording, but thinks that it should be a Government Bill. I have also seen at his request Mr. Ronald Bell, who brought with him several other Governmentback-benchers, and who strongly represented to me that, while penalties under theAct should be increased, he would oppose any amendment of Section 5 as anunwarrantable restriction of free speech, even if the concept of race did not appear in the amendment.5. Clearly a controversial Bill in the present Session would have no prospectof success if it was introduced by a Private Member. We are committed to anincrease of penalties, and on the need for this there is general agreement. It may become urgent at any time. On the whole, therefore, and having regard to the differences of opinion on our own side of the House, I am disposed to stand by myoriginal suggestion that we should go ahead with a Bill doing no more than increasepenalties. This would have to be a Government measure.(u As the Cabinet know, we are committed to making a statement beforeWhitsun (Hansard, 2nd May, column 1318). I suggest that this should follow theline of the draft statement; appended to my previous paper.H. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,21st May, 1963.
