COPYPrime MinisterSalisburySECRET20th April, 1963My Dear First Secretary of State,Thank you for your letter of the 9th April, 1963? which mr. Dupont delivered to me when he got back to Salisbury on the10th April.    I also received a copy, the same day, from lord Alport,the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Salisbury.2.     My Ministers and I have been giving very careful considerationto this letter, and although we issued a Press statement on theoccasion of its publication, along with my letter of the 29th March,we feel that it is necessary, in view of the importance of the issues, to comment at some length on the various points you make.3.     None of our friends who visit this country appreciates betterthan you do what has been achieved here under sound governmentadministration, and what there is to be preserved in the interestsof civilisation.   This achievemej.it is due entirely to the efforts of the people of this country over the last forty years, duringwhich time the Government has exercised self-government in all itsinternal affairs.    Initially the achievement is due to the Europeans,who still bear the main burden of taxation and are the principalsupport of the economy% but slowly, and increasingly, it is duealso to the other groups who live in this country, namely the africans, the Asians, and the Coloured people.   It may be unnecessary to remind you that Southern Rhodesia is not, and neverhas been, a dependency in the sense that it has relied for its administration and finance on the United Kingdom Government.    Itwas a Colony occupied by people who voluntarily came here mainly from the Commonwealth countries, and at no time has it been directly under the control of Whitehall.4.     Europeans resident in Rhodesia over the years have accumulatedthe balance of the capital resources of the country.   investment in agriculture is substantial, and has been accumulated as theresult of the ploughing-back of profits into development over along period of years.   Many of our mines, industries, shops andThe Rt. Hon. R. A. Butler, C.H., M.P. ,First Secretary of State,King Charles Street,Whitehall,London, S.W.1.
commercial establishments have been built up and developed bythe same method.   The relatively high development of the economyhas been largely due to European immigrants who have made their homes here.   Over a long period of years, the savings of Rhodesiansover two or three generations who plough the greater part of theirprofits back into their businesses rather than invest them abroad,have played a large part in capital development.5.     I am recalling these facts to remind us that Southern Rhodesiahas, since 1923, fulfilled all the requirements for Commonwealthstatus.    It has financed its own development, taxed itself, and paid its way.    It has looked after its own defence, and hascontributed money and men to the defence of the Commonwealth and western civilisation; and, finally, it has successfully operateda democratic Parliamentary form of government.    This record, weclaim, more than fulfils the requirements of any normal process to independence, and it obviates, without question, any need fora Conference to deal specifically with the principle of independencefor Southern Rhodesia.   In your letter you refer to the need for southern Rhodesia to go through &quot;normal processes&quot; to independence.As I have shown, Southern Rhodesia has already gone through these processes.   Your letter in no way gives us &quot;the assurance orguarantee that we asked for, that Southern Rhodesia will be givenits right to full independence on the first date when eitherNorthern Rhodesia or Nyasaland secedes from the Federation orobtains its independence.6.     We recognise the desirability - since the United KingdomGovernment has given a unilateral decision to the electedMinisters in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia on the question of secession - of discussions between the Territories on the broadlines of a future relationship and on the transitional arrangements.We cannot, however, accept the contention that the unqualifiedrecognition of Southern Rhodesia&apos;s right to independence must be delayed pending the conclusion of these discussions.    It is surelyself-evident that an undertaking from the United Kingdom Governmentthat Southern Rhodesia will get its independence under the cir-cumstances we have requested, has no valid connection with thediscussions or arrangements which remain to be considered orconcluded between Southern Rhodesia and the other Territories ofthe Federation.   It would be quite unjustifiable, in our view, to delay the recognition of Southern Rhodesia1s unqualified right to independence, pending the holding of a Conference which will, bythe nature of things, be confined to a consideration of economic
links between the Territories.7.   I With the principle of secession admitted for all territories of the Federation, there surely can be no longer any bar to thegrant to all of them of the independence which they expect andlook forward to.    I would suggest, with respect, that your legal advice, that it would not in any event be possible to make SouthernRhodesia an independent country in the full sense of the word whileremaining a member of the non-independent Federation, has no practicalsignificance, since your decision has been taken in principle to doaway with the existing Federation.   What we have asked for is that southern Rhodesia should receive unqualified recognition of itsright to full independence as soon as that Federation is terminatedby the secession of, or the grant of independence to, one of theother partners in the Federation.8.     On the subject of the break-up of the Federation, we cannot,accept your proposition that the United Kingdom Parliament has power to legislate with regard to the Federation and so, indirectly,with regard to Southern Rhodesia.   With respect, you must haveoverlooked the joint declaration of the 28th April, 1957, made bythe United Kingdom and Federal Governments, in which the following statement was mades-&quot;United Kingdom Ministers made it clear that the UnitedKingdom Government recognise the existence of a conventionapplicable to the present stage of the constitutionalevolution of the Federation whereby the United KingdomGovernment, in practice, does not initiate any legislation to amend, or to repeal, any Federal Act, or to deal withany matter included within the competence of the federal legislature, except at the request of the federal government.&quot;The convention here formally recognised is binding as is theconvention specifically relating to Southern Rhodesia which youquote in your letter.9.     I find some contradiction between the United KingdomGovernment1s acceptance of the principle of secession for the territories within the existing Federation, and its insistencethat discussions on the broad lines of a future relationshipshould be held before any such secession is implemented.    In viewof what has happened to the present Federation, it is quiteunrealistic to think that in present-day circumstances any formof association here will be lasting unless it is freely entered
into &quot;by Territories each of which has complete control of itsown affairs.    It is a fact, which the United Kingdom government must now accept, that any form of association imposed by it onany of the component parts of Central Africa will have nodurability.   The only association likely to endure is oneacceptable to the Territories? and that can only come aboutwhen they are able to commit themselves without direction fromthe United Kingdom Government in the secure anticipation oftheir own independence.   Therefore, I must point out that westrongly disagree with the contention of the United KingdomGovernment that it is only when these discussions have takenplace that the future course of events can be clarified, ?.The course of events must be anticipated now.    The decision onthe next step rests squarely with the United Kingdom Government;and that step is the recognition in an unambiguous manner ofour right to independence, without conditions or qualifications,before we come to the Conference table.10.    You go on to say that the United Kingdom Government, inaccordance with normal procedure and before granting independence to Southern Rhodesia, would expect to convene a Conference todiscuss the financial, defence, constitutional, and &quot;othermatters&quot; which always have to be settled before self-governingdependencies are granted independence.    Apart from the factthat I have already shown that Southern Rhodesia is not adependency, and never has been, I think this procedure is quiteinappropriate for a self-governing country of Southern Rhodesia&apos;sstatus.   If it is analysed closely, your suggestion amounts to aproposal to hold a Constitutional Conference, a proceeding whichwe could no longer accept.    Southern Rhodesia, as I must repeat,has over the years been entirely responsible for its own financialaffairs, and has never received any financial help or contribution from the United Kingdom Government other than loan money^s.   in defence, it exercised unfettered control from 1923 to 1953, and since 1953 the Federal Government has continued this unfetteredcontrol over defence matters for the Federation.   In the new1961 Constitution, Southern Rhodesia has the right to legislatewith extra-Territorial effect, and this enhances its rights oversubjects, like defence of our country against external aggression,which must revert to Southern Rhodesia when the Federation ceaseBto exist.11. &apos; When the Federation does come to an end on the secessionof either Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland, the functions and
powers formerly exercised by the Southern Rhodesia government before entry into Federation will revert to Southern Rhodesiain as full a degree as they existed before that time and, infact, in a fuller degree, in so far as they will now be operatedunder the 1961 Constituion, whereby the United Kingdom Governmentreserve powers have been eliminated except for certain formalitems.   The 1961 Constitution was accepted by the United KingdomGovernment and the United Kingdom Parliament as containingeverything that they considered to be requisite, or desirable,for protecting the rights of the peoples and communities whohave a right to live in the country.12.   You go on to say that the limited form of independencefrom the United Kingdom, which Southern Rhodesia enjoys whilethe Federation remains in existence, cannot be improved from our point of view, pending the granting of full independence.It seems to us that this claim is a direct contradiction ofyour earlier statements that Southern Rhodesia, like the other territories, must proceed through the normal processes to independence, and that Southern Rhodesia may only expect to bein the constitutional position to move to independence after further discussions on future relationships with northern rhodesia and Nyasaland have been held.   Surely your referenceto this limited form of independence is an admission that southern Rhodesia is practically independent already, and thatthere can be no further &quot;normal processes&quot;.    I would go even further, and maintain that with the combination of the 1961Constitution - which confers wide powers for amending thatConstitution on Southern Rhodesia - and the convention to which you refer, it is not possible for the United Kingdom Governmentto initiate any changes in the 1961 Constitution.   In our opinion the next step is for the United Kingdom Government to pass through its Parliament an Independence Act to provide that from an appointed day the United Kingdom Government would haveno responsibility for the Government of Southern Rhodesia; thatno Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed on or after that day, shall extend or be deemed to extend, to SouthernRhodesia as part of its law; and that the Colonial Laws ValidityAct, 1865, shall not apply to any law made after the appointed day by the Parliament of Southern Rhodesia.13.   With further reference to the &quot;other matters&quot; mentioned inyour letter, which would have to be settled at a Conference onIndependence, I cannot visualise what matters you have in mind,
for the 1961 Constitution contains ample safeguards againstamendments to the Constitution contrary to the wishes of anygroups of the country&apos;s inhabitants, and ample safeguards againstracial and other forms of discrimination.     There can he noquestion of the United Kingdom Government requiring, as acondition precedent to the grant of independence, constitutional changes in the franchise law or in the law relating torepresentation in Parliament, because these matters were fullyexamined and settled at the Constitutional Conference ofFebruary   I96I.II4.    I must once again repeat that the Southern rhodesia government insists upon the principle of its independence being agreed to before the process of breaking up the Federation is put in hand officially.     This is essential, in order to preventinterference with and discussion of Southern Rhodesia&apos;s internal affairs at any Conference that the United Kingdom Governmentmay succeed in arranging to discuss future relationships betweenthe Territories.     Southern Rhodesia was a High-Contracting Partyto the creation of the Federation, comprising the three componentStates, and her consent is necessary to any change in the originalconcept of a three-State Federation.     We cannot agree with the contention that the secession of one member of the Federationwill not, in itself, end Southern Rhodesia&apos;s membership of theFederation.     It is surely obvious that if one member&apos;s secessionis effected by United Kingdom legislation, the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland will have ceased to exist.     If the twoRhodesias are to remain linked in some way, it cannot be underthe present form of Federation.     But this is an academic pointin to-day&apos;s circumstances, because it is obvious that the elected Ministers in Northern Rhodesia - no less than those in nyasaland - are quite determined to exercise the right which theUnited Kingdom Government has now recognised for the secession ofthe Territories.     When Northern Rhodesia has taken this step,Southern Rhodesia is left in isolation.15.    In such circumstances, it is nothing less than our duty, asa Government, that we should look to the interests of our country;and since we have reached such an advanced stage of independence in our own affairs, that we must adhere to our position, whichwas set out in my letter of the 29th March, that the SouthernRhodesia Government will not attend a Conference to discuss the broad outlines of a future relationship between the Territories,or the transitional arrangements that will be required to be madp,unless it receives in writing from the United Kingdom government an acceptable undertaking that Southern Rhodesia will receive its full independence on the first date when either Northern Rhodesiaor Nyasaland secedes or obtains its independence.6
16,   You may rest assured that, as soon as the United KingdomGovernment gives such an undertaking, it will receive from theSouthern Rhodesia Government the closest possible co-operation in endeavouring to achieve an acceptable and durable relationship between the Territories and the United Kingdom Government and inthe consequential transitional arrangements,I ii17.   Unfortunately your proposals suggest nothing that will promote a speedy end tor the uncertainty that has been5 and stillis, bedevilling the affairs of Southern Rhodesia both politically and economically, with serious repercussions to the well-being and progress of all our people.     Rather does it appear to be theintention of the United Kingdom Government to prolong, and therebyaggravate, this uncertainty.     There may indeed be some reasons why this approach suits the United Kingdom Government, perhapsinternally, perhaps internationally, or perhaps both, but delay now is entirely wrong and greatly to the present and future detriment of Central Africa and all its peoples.18.    I therefore formally request that you make known to us your government&apos;s decision at the earliest possible date.Yours sincerely,(Sgd)   Winston Field7
