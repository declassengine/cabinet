Printed for the Cabinet,   May 1963C. (63) 95 Copy No.   5 228th May, 1963CABINETNATO NUCLEAR FORCE: MIXED-MANNED COMPONENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe purpose of this paper is to set out for my colleagues the political factors which must govern any consideration of the mixed-manned (multilateral) armwhich the United States proposes should be part of the nuclear force of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)., The Minister of Defence isdiscussing the military implications in a separate&apos;paper (C. (63) 96). The essenceJof the matter is that the Germans are not content to remain indefinitely in theposition of a second-class Power. United States diplomacy and the french force de frappe have stimulated the Germans into this mood, but I am convincedthat they will not for very much longer be content to have no share in the controlof nuclear weapons. It is to meet this problem in a way that does not give theGermans an independent nuclear capacity that the United States have proposed the multilateral force. Theoretically it is not the only answer to the german problem. But we now have to face the fact that the Germans have adopted itand that most of the leading German politicians of both parties are personallycommitted to it. Equally the prestige of the United States Administration is deeplyinvolved and the multilateral force has become an important part of their policy towards Europe and the organisation of the Western Alliance.2. Accordingly in judging our response to the multilateral force proposalwe have to give full weight to its effect upon our relations with the United states on the one hand and with Europe on the other, particularly the Germans and theItalians.I3. If Germany is not to be inferior to the United Kingdom or France thismeans bringing Germans into the nuclear business. The question is whether thisis to be under national control or in some wider alliance grouping. The Germans(and this is true of Erhard and Schroeder) profess to prefer the latter. It may beof course that some of them secretly harbour hopes that it can be converted intothe former. On this no one can be certain. It is in our interest and our policy that any German nuclear capacity (and there is already a significant amount)should be firmly tied in to an Atlantic Alliance structure and kept that way, ratherthan developing on national lines or in close association with the French forcede frappe. The question is how this can best be achieved.4. Whatever the position may have been at Nassau, things have now movedfurther and faster. The problem now boils down to a choice between (a) joining the multilateral force and controlling the Germans from inside it or (b) standingaloof from it in the hope that it will be stillborn and that the Germans will notacquire nuclear weapons in other ways; or that it will come into being, but thatit will not lead to a German national capacity or be detrimental to us in otherways. The United States are convinced that participation in the mixed-manned force will satisfy German nuclear ambitions for the foreseeable future (10 or 20years). If there is to be a multilateral force all the other countries in NATO (withthe exception of France which is sceptical of the whole idea) are very anxious thatwe should take a part in its management and control.2593
5. Consequently the importance of the multilateral force lies mainly in thepolitical field. The motives for establishing it are at the lowest respectable andat the highest imaginative, namely preventing the spread of nuclear weapons ona national basis and creating an arm which is international in the fullest sense.II6. If we could be reasonably certain that by standing aloof from the forcewe could kill it and retain the status quo and not suffer grave consequences there might be something to be said for this course. But I now believe it to be certainthat the force will come into being shortly, even if we take no part in it. TheGermans and the United States have already reached agreement and they requireonly one other partner to go ahead. It seems very likely any Italian Governmentwill join and so will the Greeks and Turks. Failing this the United States althoughreluctant to do so, would I believe go ahead with Germany alone. In either case,German influence would be strong and in time might come to dominate the force.7. Moreover, if by any chance the multilateral force fails to come into being,the United States have plainly said that they see no alternative but to meet theGerman demand by the establishment of a NATO medium-range ballistic missileforce and by increasing nuclear weapons under German command on Germansoil or in German ships, with the warheads under United States custody. Thiscontains obvious dangers.8. Clearly if there is to be a multilateral force we stand a much better chanceof controlling its development and preventing the Germans from acquiring anational nuclear capability if we are in it rather than outside it.9. To sum up, from the foreign policy point of view a United kingdom contribution to the multilateral force is clearly of the first importance.(a) in the context of Anglo-American relations: if we are not in it the germans will increase their influence at Washington at our expense;(b) in the context of our European policy and our relations with both major political parties in Germany, each of whom supports the force;(c) to ensure that we ourselves maintain adequate control through theunanimity rule over the nuclear forces in. which Germany participates.There are thus not only powerful foreign policy reasons for going into the force;there are also powerful foreign policy disadvantages if we do not. One of thearguments by which we have justified the retention of our own independent nucleararm is that it will ensure that we take our place by right in all discussions in bodies concerned with nuclear matters. If we are absent from the Board of the multilateral force this argument will no longer hold.Ill10. I think that the Minister of Defence feels that militarily speaking the multilateral force is a luxury. I accept that the multilateral force would have inhis view a low priority on grounds of military desirability. But I must qualifythis by saying that if this force does not materialise, the demand will quickly be renewed for medium-range ballistic missiles. The multilateral force must be looked at as an alternative.11. I also understand that our Chiefs of Staff, while unenthusiastic, considerthat if it were politically necessary a mixed-manned fleet could be made to bemilitarily feasible, at least so far as surface vessels are concerned. The talks with admiral Ricketts the United States Vice-Chief of Naval Operations, will help to clarify this aspect of the matter.IV12. Of course we should need to look carefully at the terms of an agreementestablishing the multilateral force and we should not finally have to commit ourselvesuntil we could see them in their entirety. Attached at Annex I is a statementapproved by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, setting out exactly what the Americans are asking of us now. In fact we are at present in an unusuallystrong bargaining position which should enable us to obtain favourable terms,
and terms notably better than those which the United States and Germany wouldenjoy as contributors to the force. In conversation with the United States in Ottawaand elsewhere they have indicated to us a number of ways in which they would beprepared to offer assistance advantageous to us both financially and in terms ofcontrol over the force.13.  These include:(a) contracts for shipbuilding and repairing;(b) the establishment of a new base in the United Kingdom;and, if we supply warheads,(c) contracts for making, servicing and replacing the warheads; and(d) the provision for the warheads of U-235 (which the United States can make much more cheaply than ourselves) on generous terms.Of these (c) and (d) would be non-starters if it proves too difficult for us to supplywarheads, but (a) and (b) could be advantageous both politically and economically.14. In addition to these United States inducements, we should naturallyhave desiderata of our own on which we could undoubtedly insist if we now agreedto join in drafting a charter for the multilateral force. These include on the militaryside undertakings by the United States not to support the establishment of theiNATO medium-range ballistic missile force and on the political side to provide that any change in the unanimity rule should itself be made by unanimity.15. The problem therefore boils down to this: whether it is worthwhile paying&apos;the financial price for a project which is politically of the highest importance butmilitarily not a high priority; and if so how to present our position to Parliament.16.  The latter problem can be considerably eased by:(a) pointing out that we are not accepting a financial obligation which is open-ended: a formula for this can, I feel sure, be agreed;(b) stressing that no foreign exchange commitment is involved;(c) explaining that the greater part of our contribution could be made fromsurplus capacity, e.g., orders for ships from our shipyards.In short we could probably show that there would be little if any drain on the economy as a whole. Thus we should be getting at a bargain price an important political advantage.17. We could explain quite frankly to Parliament what this is. The politicalmotive behind the multilateral force is sensible and respectable, even high-minded,and can be presented as such. It helps to integrate Europe and the United States.It helps to maintain our influence in the Western Alliance and particularly withthe United States. It helps to contain German ambitions and to prevent the spread of these dangerous weapons. It is true that no one can guarantee that the latter will be achieved but much the best chance of doing so is to integrate the german military machine into that of NATO. I think that, before we go into the draftinggroup on the lines which the United States propose, it would be useful if we can,to have a further multilateral examination of the idea of mixed-manning. TheUnited States may not like the idea of proceeding in two stages, but I attach at annex II a possible approach to the United States designed to achieve a realexamination by ourselves and interested allies. If the matter was handled in thisway, I believe it would help the public presentation quite a lot..   &apos;    &apos; :&apos; :&apos;H. &apos;Foreign Office, S.W. 1,27th May, 1963.
