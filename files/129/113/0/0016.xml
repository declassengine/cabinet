Copy No.  52CABINETREFORM OF EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general in his Budget Speech of 1961 Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, as Chancellor of theExchequer, referred to the need to reform the Exchequer Accounts. The objectof this, in his view, would be to produce a less confusing presentation than thepresent one with its artificial distinction between above and below the line. Inthe 1962 and 1963 Budget Speeches publication of a White Paper wasforeshadowed.2. There has been much public comment over recent years on this question;and there is a fair consensus of informed opinion in favour of some reformdesigned to ensure that the published Exchequer Accounts more closely reflect the realities of Budgetary finance.3. Attached to this Paper is the proof of a White Paper on this subject whichit is proposed should be published before the Second Reading of the Finance bill which is on Monday, 6th May. It contains no declaration of Government policyand no proposals for immediate legislation. It is intended as a basis for public discussion which might at some later stage lead to a change in the form of theExchequer Accounts.Outline of the White Paper4. The paper indicates the antiquated and irrelevant structure which pastlegislation has imposed on the Accounts, and then proceeds to describe how theCentral Government sector is fitted into the statistics of national income andexpenditure (the Blue Book classification). The tentative conclusion is that thearchaic and legalistic &quot; above and below the line &quot; distinction cannot be adapted to reflect any real and important difference, e.g., between capital and current expenditure as normally understood.5. The suggestion is made that there should be one unified Budget Account,showing all the basic autonomous transactions of Central Government,supplemented by a Financing Account showing how the deficit on the mainBudget Account is accommodated by National Debt and other monetarytransactions. It is also suggested that there should be a capital and current table,on a National Accounts basis, for the Central Government designed to reflect the impact of its activities on the rest of the economy. Specimens of these accounts and tables, based on this year&apos;s figures, are given in Appendices A-E to the white paper.Practical Implications6. In practice this would mean abolishing the &quot; line &quot;. The new ExchequerAccounts; in other respects, would be compiled in much the same form as atpresent; receipts and issues of cash from the Exchequer would continue to be recorded and published by reference to the requirements of Parliamentary controland departmental responsibility. The items in the Accounts would not, that is,be classified in &quot;economic&quot; terms. /7. If any reforms were to be made on these lines legislation would berequired inter alia to repeal the Sinking Fund Act, 1875.  It is unlikely that anyPrinted for the Cabinet. April 1963C.

such legislation would be brought forward in the 1963-64 Session; andtherefore the earliest year for which statutory Accounts in the new form couldbe introduced would probably be 1965-66 or 1966-67.conclusion. The agreement of the Cabinet is sought to the publication of a white paper on the reform of Exchequer Accounts before the Second Reading of theFinance Bill.J. A.

THE REFORM OF THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTSI. FOREWORDThe Need for reform the form of the present Exchequer Accounts is governed by a statutenow 88 years old. It was designed in an age when the range of govern-ment activity was very much smaller and government responsibilities formanagement of the economy were very much more narrowly conceivedthan today. Then one of the chief aims of budgetary policy was to raiseat least enough revenue to meet all ordinary expenditure and if possibleenough to bring about a steady reduction of the National Debt., Nowadays&apos;an increase in the National Debt, even in peacetime, is normal; andbudgetary policy has the much broader objective of regulating the balanceof supply and demand for the economy as a whole. The existing form ofthe Exchequer Accounts does not necessarily meet the different circumstances and needs of today.2. In his 1961 budget speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer said :-&quot; We can rightly commend what our forefathers did in the 1860&apos;s to reform the accounts of their day, but it is hardly surprising that, a hundred years later, the system they drew up should need modernisa-tion. There is surely something rather confusing about a presentationwhich puts some capital receipts, including certain debt repayments,above the line ... at the same time, we put below the line some itemssuch as post-war credits which, from many points of view, are indis-tinguishable from other current payments. I am sure that we haveto produce a less confusing presentation.&quot; iuooThe Government have for some time been considering how a change inthe form of Exchequer Accounts could help towards a better unstanding of the nature of Parliamentary control and of the economic significance ofthe Government^ operations. The problems turned out to be more com-Jplicated and difficult, and the scope for reform to be more limited, than had at first been imagined. But several distinct improvements seem pos-sible ; and they are explained in this paper. It is hoped they will serve to clarify the essential functions of the Exchequer Accounts. But, before putting any definite proposals before Parliament, it is thought that further discussion will be useful.3. The improvements suggested should be viewed in the context of the wider programme which the Government has in hand for improving theapparatus for handling, and presenting the facts about, problems of public expenditure and finance. This programme is in the spirit of the recomnienda-tions of the Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure under theChairmanship of Lord Plowden (Cmnd. 1432). It is important that any changes should not only improve work and overall control inside thegovernment machine, but should also help to inform public opinion.
4. The first step was the reform of the Estimates and AppropriationAccounts. The characteristics of this reform were, first, that it simplified,shortened and clarified the information contained in the Estimates so thatit would better serve the purposes of Parliamentary and departmental con-trol. Secondly, the new lay-out included for the first time a statement showing how expenditure on each Vote was divided between the categoriesused in the statistics of national income and expenditure published by theCentral Statistical Office. The changes in the form of the ExchequerAccounts suggested in this paper are likewise designed, on the one hand,to clarify and simplify the Accounts themselves and, on the other, to show how they link up with the way in which government transactions are recorded in statistical accounts of the national economy.5. It is recognised, however, that reform of the Estimates and theExchequer Accounts, the two main official sources bearing on public expenditure, can only go part of the way towards giving a full account ofthe raising and spending of public money. The Estimates cover a large part, but not the whole, of public expenditure. The Exchequer Accounts,by their very nature, can never do more than record the monies passing through the central bank account of the Government (see section II). the transactions so recorded are at the core of the system of public finance andof great importance. But to see how government transactions affect people&apos;slives and businesses and to see the full extent and nature of the activitiesof public bodies, it is necessary to look, not at the core, but at the point of(contact with the rest of the economy. This means looking directly at the transactions of all public bodies with other sectors.6. As explained in this paper, any new form of the Exchequer Accountsshould be accompanied by a table going beyond the Exchequer Accountsto the accounts of all bodies comprised within the central governmentsector of the economy, as it is defined for the purpose of national incomestatistics. This could then be combined with information, classified in thesame way, relating to the accounts of local authorities and public corpora-tions. The end-result would be tables analysing the transactions of thepublic sector as a whole. Their purpose would be to provide a picture ofthe activities of the public sector as a whole, showing the relationships between the different parts of the public sector and the relationship of thewhole to the activities of the private sector. The picture, without being over-burdened, should have enough detail for considering broad issues of,policy and of the priorities and direction of public expenditure as well asthe implications for taxation.7. The problems of obtaining up-to-date figures, of classifying figuresfrom different sources on a common basis and of presenting the results inan intelligible and meaningful way are being tackled in preparation for this further step. In due course it is hoped to present to Parliament tablesshowing total public expenditure and how it is financed (i.e. &quot; public sectorestimates &quot;) for the same periods and at the same time as the budget state-ment. Inevitably some of the figures will be provisional; but it is valuable and important to present through Parliament to the public the materialnecessary for an informed public opinion about public expenditure.
II. THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTSThe Exchequer and the Consolidated Fund8. The word &quot;Exchequer&quot; derives from the name (Scaccarium)originally given to a small body of administrators, first recruited by KingHenry I, when they sat for financial purposes. It was named after thechequered table-cloth which assisted the counting of money. : This bodysurvived only as a Court of Law and finally ceased to exist in 1880. its functions had already devolved partly on to Parliament, as the legislatureprogressively wrested from the Crown the control of taxation and expendi-Iture and partly on to the Treasury as it came to administer the royalrevenues, the modern equivalent of which are still received into &quot; her majesty&apos;s Exchequer.&quot;9. The Consolidated Fund was first set up in 1787 as &quot;one Fund into which shall flow every stream of public revenue and from which shall comethe supply for every service.&quot; The basis of the financial mechanism bywhich the Fund is operated is now governed by the Exchequer and AuditDepartments Act 1866(&apos;). The great bulk of the Governments money stillpasses through the Consolidated Fund, although there are now substantialpublic funds separate from it. Section 10 of the Exchequer and AuditDepartments Act 1866 required all Customs and Excise, Inland revenue and Post Office(2) gross revenue, as well as other public monies payable to the Exchequer, to be paid into accounts at the Bank of England and Bankof Ireland, to be called in each case &quot; The Account of Her Majesty&apos;sExchequer &quot;. Section 11 requires the two Banks to treat all money so paidto them as forming one general fund from which Treasury orders for pay-ment shall be made. This Account, kept by the Treasury at the Bank ofEngland (and that at the Bank of Ireland), is thus the central&apos;cash account!of the Government; and all money paid into it becomes part of the consolidated Fund(3).The Exchequer Accounts10. The Exchequer Accounts which record transactionsupon this account(4) (sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot; the Exchequer&quot;) are,as published: (a) The Public Income and Expenditure Account. The form of this account is prescribed by the Sinking Fund Act 1875(5). It hasto be certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and rendered to the House of Commons by the Treasury within one,month ofthe close of each financial year. , S fj ?ov0) The full title of the head of the Exchequer arid Audit Department is the&apos;&quot; ComptrollerGeneral of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty&apos;s Exchequer and the Auditor-General ofPublic Accounts &quot;. &apos; - 11338 30 mw &quot; -.  *(2) In the case of the Post Office, since repealed by the Post OfnceAct:19&apos;61,.t e gphsvou0) A full discussion of the terms,\&quot; Exchequer &quot; and &quot; Consolidated Fund,&apos;-&apos;;;is to be.foundin &quot; The British Budgetary System &quot; by Sir Herbert Brittain-ps, &quot;13-16., &apos; &apos; &quot;\ &apos; &quot;-&quot;(4) In the published Accounts the transactions on the Exchequer Account&apos;at; the Bankof Ireland are consolidated with those on the Bank of England Account.and:ordyjthe.openingand closing balances are shown separately. The Irish.Account raises no:separate.problems in the present context.(5) The requirements of the Act were modified in one particular by the Finance Act 1954(see footnote, paragraph 19).
(b) The Finance Accounts of the United Kingdom. They have to be rendered to the House of Commons by the Treasury as soon aspossible after the end of each financial year. The statutory require-ment is the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges Act1854, although finance accounts have been presented since 1802.They are drawn up on the same basis as the Public Income andExpenditure Account, but give much greater detail. They are notcertified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General; but the state-ments of tax revenue are certified by the responsible officials in therevenue departments.(c) The Consolidated Fund Abstract Account. It has to be rendered by 30th September each year; and the statutory requirement isSection 21 of the Exchequer and Audit Department Act 1866. it only covers payments which are charged directly on the consolidate fund under various Acts of Parliament (i.e. excluding issues for supply Services). It is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General ; and his report on it would be the normal vehicle for any comments he wished to make on Consolidated Fund issues.In addition, the following, though not statutory and not strictly speakingAccounts, form part of the present system : (d) The Exchequer Weekly Return. This is published in the LondonGazette each Tuesday, showing the Exchequer receipts and issuesduring the year up to the previous Saturday. It is also published on the evening of the last working day of each calendar quarter sothat the return for the fourth quarter of the financial year, which is available on the evening of the last working day (normally 31stMarch), is in effect an account for the year as a whole. In formand degree of detail the Returns are similar to the Public income and Expenditure Account.(e) The Financial Statement. This differs from the other three in thatit is primarily concerned with estimates for the coming financialyear. It is published on budget day (normally in April); and its purpose is to present the budget proposals for the coming yearagainst the background of the Government^ revenue and expemdi-ture. It contains a statement of the out-turn of the previous yeardrawn up on the same basis as the Public Income and ExpenditureAccount and the Exchequer Returns, and in much the same degreeof detail. It compares this out-turn item by item with the budgetestimate of twelve months earlier and with the new budget estimate for the coming year, both before and after the taxation proposalsWhich it describes in some detail.11. It will be seen from this that an account of Exchequer transactionscovering a full financial year is published four times (excluding the Con-solidated Fund Abstract Account which covers issues only). The first occasion is on the evening of the last working day of the financial year, inthe Exchequer Return. Next come the Financial Statement and the PublicIncome and Expenditure Account. Finally, some six months later, comethe Finance Accounts with their greater detail. Of the four, public attention is naturally and inevitably focussed on the Financial Statement because of
its connection with the budget. The Exchequer Return is of interestprimarily because it is the first in order of time. The other two normallyattract little public attention.The nature and scope of the accounts12. The transactions recorded in the Exchequer Accounts consist prin-cipally of payments to and from subsidiary accounts such as the accounts of the Revenue Departments or those of departments responsible for ex-penditure. The classification of items in the Accounts corresponds with thosein Parliamentary authorisations, so serving the purposes of parliamentary control. The system of Parliamentary control of expenditure is on a cashbasis. Whether this should be so has been examined a number of times inthe past; and the case for cash accounting has always been endorsed. the suggestions in this paper presuppose that system of control; but, whateversystem is adopted, an account of the cash flows through the ExchequerAccount would still be needed as they are important to monetary policyand central banking operations.13. Parliamentary control over the Exchequer is assured as follows. Allreceipts of Government, except where otherwise provided by statute, mustbe paid into the Exchequer from which they can only be drawn under the specific authority of Parliament. This authority is given either by specificlegislation dealing with individual services (the so-called &quot; consolidate fund Services&quot;) or by the annual Consolidated Fund Acts*, which givestatutory effect to the Votes for Supply Services. Each drawing from the consolidated Fund must be authorised in advance by the Comptroller and auditor-General, who is an officer of Parliament independent of the executive and whose duties in this regard stem from the Exchequer and Audit Depart-ments Act 1866. The Comptroller and Auditor-General also audits receipts and payments. He is thus able to check that the statutory requirements havebeen obeyed.14. The scope of the Accounts is confined to those transactions whichare required by law to pass through the Consolidated Fund; the operations of the National Insurance Fund, the Post Office Fund, the Exchange equalisation-tion Account and a number of other government funds are either excludedaltogether or only very partially reflected in the central Exchequer Accounts.The Form of the Accounts15. The present form of the Exchequer Accounts is determined by the distinction drawn in Section 4 of the Sinking Fund Act 1875 betweenexpenditure which can specifically be met from borrowing and all other ex-penditure. The Act thereby implies (but does not prescribe) a distinction onthe other side of the Account between the proceeds of borrowing and allother receipts.   There is thus a four-fold distinction, as follows  Part I1. Receipts other than the proceeds of borrowing and loan repay-ments to be applied to debtredemption.&quot; Income &quot;&quot; Expenditure &quot;2. Expenditure not met from specificborrowing.* See Note paragraph 16 below.
Part H&quot;Receipts&quot;3. The proceeds of borrowing andloan repayments to be appliedto debt redemption.Expenditure met from specificborrowing and redemption of debt.&quot; Payments &quot;The Act is only concerned with item 1 (which it refers to as &quot; income &quot;) anditem 2 (which it refers to as &quot; expenditure &quot;). It provides for the preparation and publication of an account of these and directs that any surplus of&quot; income&quot; over &quot; expenditure&quot; shall be used for the redemption of debt.This account is now Part I of the Public Income and Expenditure account and is known as the &quot; above-the-line &quot; account. Items 3 and 4 are covered in Part II of the Public Income and Expenditure Account, which is knownas the &quot; below-the-line &quot; account (see, however, the proviso in paragraph 21).For convenience and clarity item 3 is referred to as &quot; receipts &quot; and item 4 as&quot; payments &quot;. Both Part I and Part II are records of transactions upon asingle banking account; and it is necessary for them to be linked (bycarrying into Part II any surplus or deficit on Part I) and for the openingand closing balances to be shown in order that the account may be &quot; proved &quot;.16. The distinction drawn by the Act between &quot;expenditure&quot; (item 2)and &quot; payments &quot; (item 4) is quite clear and rigid. It is not concerned withthe fact that during the course of the financial year issues of any kind fromthe Consolidated Fund may be met from temporary borrowing to prevent a deficit on the Exchequer Account. The distinction it makes is betweenthe case where a statute authorising expenditure also authorises the borrowingof money to meet it and all other cases. This is a purely legalistic distinction.Neither the Sinking Fund Act nor any other lays down the types of expenditure which should be met from borrowing and the types which should not. Thisis decided by each piece of legislation authorising expenditure*. Somestatutes confer powers to lend but not to borrow for that purpose; and inother cases borrowing powers have been given to meet expenditure other thanlending. In practice, however, the majority of statutes which have authorisedborrowing have done so for the purpose of enabling the Government to makeloans. The Government has statutory powers under the National Loans Act1939 to borrow for the purpose of replacing maturing debt. But it also has an obligation to redeem a certain amount of specified forms of debtannually by means of contractual sinking funds ; and for this purpose it hasno powers to borrow. The Government has no specific powers to borrowto meet more than an insignificant part of its own direct capital expenditure,while it has borrowing powers to meet some kinds of current expenditure.It will be clear from this that, despite first appearances, the distinction drawnby the Sinking Fund Act and observed in the Exchequer Accounts is quite different from that between &quot;current&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; expenditure. : ZWOI 01 cH .fioiionri2irj fiiol-tuiYi k amn     &quot;n* Note: There is one further formal distinction; &quot;expenditure&quot; above the line is classified either as being in respect of a &quot; Consolidated Fund Service &quot; if it is chargedpermanently on the Consolidated Fund and payable year by year without further authority-or as a &quot; Supply Service &quot;^-rif; it; is to be met from &quot; monies provided by Parliament &quot;, i e.voted annually for one year at a time. &quot; Payments &quot; (that is issues which may be met fromspecific borrowing) are always charged directly on the consolidate fund and the authoritydoes not have to be renewed annually; but there is no commonly used general description ofthem. (See paragraph 18 below.)
17. The Act does mot draw so clear a distinction between &quot; income &quot;and &quot; receipts&quot; (see paragraph 15 above). It is clear enough that the Actintended that the proceeds of all taxes should be treated as &quot; income&quot;for its purpose and that money raised by the creation of debt should not.But there are other kinds of receipts which come to the Government onwhich the Act gives no guidance. In certain cases departments are autho-rised to apply monies received by them as offsets to expenditure (i.e.&quot; appropriations in aid &quot;); and these are accounted for as such by them.In other cases the receipts are required to be paid into the Exchequerand so appear in the Exchequer Accounts. In these Accounts such receiptsare classified according to the source of the expenditure with which they are connected. Thus repayments of loans are treated as &quot; income &quot; if the loanitself was made out of income and as receipts applicable to debt redemp-tion if it was made out of borrowed money. Since virtually all physicalassets acquired by the Government are paid for out of &quot;income&quot; the proceeds of the sale of such also treated as &quot; income&quot;.   Aspecial case is interest received by the Government on loans made out ofborrowed money. The majority of such reoeipts are required by law tobe used to meet interest on the National Debt, for which the Governmenthas no borrowing powers, so that in effect they are treated as &quot; income &quot;.But, since they arise out of &quot; below4he-Iine &quot; expenditure, they are firstbrought in as &quot; below-the-liine&quot; reoeipts. They are then in effect paid from the &quot; below-the-lime&quot; accounts to the &quot; above-the-line&quot; accountwhere they are shown, not as income, but as an offset to the relevant expenditure on debt service.18. With these elaborations the full structure of the Public Income andExpenditure Account is as follows:  Part I&quot; Income &quot;&quot; Expenditure &quot;Tax Revenue: Inland RevenueCustoms and ExciseMotor Vehicle DutiesConsolidated Fund Services: National Debt ServicesOtherNon-Tax RevenueSupply Services: Defence VotesCivil VotesSurplus:-&quot; Issued from Revenue to redeemDebt.&quot;Part II&quot; Receipts &quot;PaymentsSurplus from Part IInterest applicable to National debt interest applied to National DebtRepayments of loans (which wereInterestInterestLoans (financed by borrowing)originally financed by borrowing)Other expenditure financed byMoney raised by the creation of debtOpening balanceborrowing iotRedemption of debt - - ,u vnaosing.baiance!f;j Wei loivAwnenR
The Purpose of the Accounts19. This basic framework of the Public Income and ExpenditureAccount is also, with. certain modifications, the basis of the FinancialStatement. The purpose of the Financial Statement is to provide the detailed background to the budget; and it is therefore primarily concernedwith the estimates for the coming year. Until the period immediatelyafter the Second World War, the budget was concerned primarily with the items comprised in Part I of the Public Income and Expenditure Account.In peacetime National Debt transactions and expenditure out of borrowed money were relatively small. The money borrowed was mainly for lend-ing ; and the theory was that the interest receipts would cover the extrainterest on the additional National Debt, which would in any case bereduced again when the loans were repaid. Parliament concerned itselfonly with &quot; income &quot; and &quot; expenditure &quot; in the sense described above ;amd the aim of the budget was generally taken to he to keep both in balance. A deficit was to be avoided as unsound, while a surplus would help to reduce the National Debt an aim which still had some attraction,although no-one wanted At to be pursued at the cost of too heavy a burdenof taxation1&quot;. In these circumstances the Financial Statement, though it contained full Exchequer Accounts for the past year, confined its estimates and its detailed comparisons with the previous year to the &quot;above-the-line&quot; account.20. Since the Full Employment White Paper of 1945 it has beenaccepted that budgetary policy should have a much wider purpose than hitherto and should be consciously used to exert an influence on the balanceof the economy. In the circumstances of the time, enough taxation hadto be raised to produce substantial surpluses &quot; above-the-line &quot;, no longer in order to reduce the National Debt, but to maintain the balance ofsupply and demand in the economy. Also the &quot; below-the-line &quot; trans-actions of the Government chiefly loans to local authorities and to public corporations grew very large and could no longer be regarded as outsidethe budget. To make this clear to Parliament estimates were included inthe Financial Statement of 1949, for certain items for which there werepowers to borrow, of the amounts the Government proposed to spend inthe coming year, with corresponding figures for the out-turn of the previous year (the out-turn for 1947 had been given in the Financial Statement of1948). There was no requirement to provide these estimates, since noParliamentary authorisation of them was necessary ; and they were there-fore limited to the items for which estimates could usefully be given.National Debt transactions and certain other items (mainly transactions with international financial institutions) were omitted, both from the esti-mates and from the corresponding figures for the out-turn.21. With this innovation the terms &quot; above-the-line &quot; and &quot; below-the-line &quot; came into general use. While &quot; above-the-line &quot; corresponds exactlyto Part I of the Public Income and Expenditure Account, &quot; below-the-line &quot;* Note: The Sinking Fund Act of 1875 had provided for a permanent annual charge of 28 million to meet the cost of service and management of the debt and to provide in additionfor its reduction (the &quot; New Sinking Fund&quot;), and renewed attempts were made in 1923and again in 1928 to provide for a fixed rate of future redemption. It was not until theFinance Act of 1954 that the permanent annual charge was abolished.
is only part of Part II of that account-that is, that part of it with whichthe budget is concerned. This distinction is preserved in the weeklyExchequer Returns, and in the Finance Accounts, which classify the items^as:  (a) Above the line.(b) Below the line.(c) National Debt transactions.(d) Other issues and repayments.In the Financial Statement the net payments below-the-line are shown asoffset by the above-the-line surplus, the difference being either the net&quot; borrowing requirement&quot; or the &quot; overall surplus &quot;.ItIII.-THE RELATION OF THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS TO the statistics OF NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE22. The scope of the Exchequer Accounts is considerably narrower thanthat of the Central Government sector of the economy, as defined for thepurposes of national income statistics(J). In these statistics central govera-ment transactions are presented in the form of a &quot; current account&quot; and a&quot; capital account &quot;; but strictly speaking they are tables rather than Accounts.They are not part of the system whereby the Government accounts toParliament for its use of public funds, they are not audited and in severalrespects they reflect the results of statistical estimation rather than preciserecords of actual transactions. Their purpose is to present the transactions ofthe Government in categories which are economically significant and to relate the Governments activities to those of the rest of the economy.23. The tables show the transactions, not simply of the Exchequer, but of the Central Government as a whole, including the transactions of theGovernment of Northern Ireland, the National Insurance Funds and anumber of other funds which are separate from the Consolidated Fund,These transactions are not shown separately, but are consolidated with similar Exchequer transactions(2). Hence the tables show the cash spentand received by departments and other central government bodies intheir transactions with the public, not Exchequer receipts and issues of cash.Some receipts, which do not appear at all in the Exchequer Accounts becausethey are retained by departments and used to offset their expenditure (&quot; appro-appropriations in aid &quot; see paragraph 17 above), are put on the receipts sideof the tables and expenditure is correspondingly higher. There are alsoother differences in scope because of the &quot; imputation &quot; of some non-cashtransactions.24. The classification of items in the tables cuts across not only themain categories of the Exchequer Accounts, but also departmental respon-sibilities. The items are obtained by aggregating receipts or payments of the same economic category from the accounts of all departments con-cerned, there being more than one for almost all items. The majordistinctions are between &quot; current&quot; and &quot; capital&quot; in the usual sense of theterms and between expenditure on goods and services and on transfers.(&apos;) For a full description see &quot; National Income Statistics-Sources and Methods &quot;.(2) Subsidiary tables are published, however, of the current account of the CentralGovernment, excluding the National Insurance Fund, and of the transactions of the national insurance Funds.n
,25. Statistical tables of the kind just described for the central govern-meiit sector of the economy are published for calendar years in detail inthe annual National Income and Expenditure Blue Book and in summaryform shortly before the budget in a White Paper entitled &quot; PreliminaryEstimates of National Income and Balance of Payments&quot;. Figures forcalendar quarters are published about three months in arrears in the monthlypublications of the Central Statistical Office. From these it is possible toconstruct tables for financial years.&apos; 26; Until 1962 nothing was published showing how the transactions of individual central government bodies were classified in statistics of national income and expenditure. The Civil Supply estimates for 1962-63, however,were published in a revised form in March, 1962, and contained, as an annex to each estimate, a section headed &quot; national accounts classification &quot;with figures on this basis for the estimates of both the previous and thecoming year. This reform was extended to the Defence estimates for1963-64. These tables are aggregated and summarised in Table III ofthe&apos; Financial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum which accompanies the estimates.This table is described as showing &quot;how the expenditure. and receiptsprovided for in estimates are recorded in the statistics of national income and expenditure published by the Central Statistical Office&quot;. (The expendi-ture and receipts referred to here relate,&apos; of course, only to expenditurecovered by Supply issues from the Exchequer and to receipts which pass through Votes.)27. In April, 1962, the White Paper on Government Expenditure Belowthe Line, 1962-63 (Cmnd.1680), which gave estimates for &quot; below-the-line&quot;expenditure in 1962-63, introduced a similar table (Appendix II) giving a national accounts classification of these estimates together with the esti-mates and out-turn of the previous year. So far there has been no publica-tiori of estimates, on the national accounts classification, for &quot; above-the-line &quot; Consolidated Fund Services, or for revenue.IV. BASIS FOR REFORMAims    ...28. Any reform of the Exchequer Accounts must aim at clarifying andsimplifying the Accounts themselves and as showing how they link up withthe .way in which government transactions are recorded in the statisticalaccounts of the national economy.Limitations29. From section II (paragraphs 12 and 13) it will be clear that anyExchequer Accounts, i.e. statements of the cash flows through the Govern-menfs central bank account, must be cash accounts and must show exchequer-quef receipts and issues under headings which correspond to the require-rrients of Parliamentary control and departmental responsibility. Given this and the nature of the statistics of national income and expenditure describediri section III, it will further be clear that no system of Exchequer Accounts,however reformed, can by itself elucidate the economic significance ofGovernment transactions. The Exchequer Accounts are radically different,not just in form, but of their very nature, from economic tables of thekind,used in national income statistics. Hence the two aims of reformstated above must be pursued independently, although in parallel.
Scope for clarification of the Exchequer Accounts30. The problem of clarifying the Accounts thus reduces itself to oneof re-grouping in a more helpful manner the material already differentiatedaccording to the requirements of Parliamentary authorisations. As shownin paragraph 21, the Exchequer Accounts are divided as follows:  (a) Above the line(b) Below the line(c) National Debt transactions(d) Other issues and repayments.With certain minor exceptions, there is a natural dividing line betweengroups (d) and (b), on the one hand the budget and groups (c) and (d),on the other mainly financing transactions.&quot; The Line &quot;31. In the past confusion and misunderstanding has centred round the separation between groups (a) and (b), i.e. the &quot; line&quot;. As it stands theline is confusing, and therefore objectionable, chiefly because people thinkunderstandably, but mistakenly, that it corresponds with the common dis-tinction between &quot; current&quot; and &quot; capital &quot; ; and this misapprehension is bound to persist so long as the line is so prominent in the Accounts as presented.Current /Capital32. The present line, based on a difference in borrowing powers (see paragraphs 15-16) is purely legalistic. Moreover, it adds nothing to the realities of Parliamentary control since Parliament already controls expen-diture and revenue, of which the net borrowing requirement is the residual.It will only be worthwhile preserving the line if it can be made to reflectsome other distinction, which is real and important. The obvious candi-date is a distinction between &quot; current&quot; and &quot; capital &quot;. One way of assimi-lating the existing line to a current/capital dichotomy would be to relatethe Governments permanent borrowing powers explicitly and exclusively to capital expenditure. This, however, would cut across not only the presentParliamentary control of Supply expenditure but also the need to reconcilea stable programme of capital expenditure with a successful full employ-ment policy. For the latter requires that net borrowing should fluctuatewidely from year to year depending upon the state of the economy as awhole.33. The Chancellors budget judgment, as embodied in his tax pro-posals, takes into account, not only the Governments own direct expenditureon current goods and services and on capital formation, but also the levelof demand in other sectors of the economy and the balance of payments.These will be influenced by the Governments own activities by with-withdrawals of spending power through taxation and by additions to spending power through grants and other forms of assistance. If the prospective growth of productive resources in the period ahead and the growth of demandupon them at the existing level of taxation are in balance, then the budgetwill be a neutral one with either no changes in taxation, or offsetting increases and reductions. If the forecasts show demand to be insufficient, then theobject of the budget will normally be to stimulate demand by reducing
taxes. If the demand is expected to be excessive the budget will normallyset out to restrict it by increases in taxation. Although forecasts of thedevelopment of the economy and calculations of the effect of particular taxchanges are inevitably imprecise, a judgment has still to be made to decide the general direction of the budget. This judgment will determine theGovernments net borrowing or &quot; financing &quot; requirement, which then hasto be considered in itself from the point of view of debt management and monetary policy.34. The proper level of the Governments capital expenditure depends on quite separate considerations (e.g. the building programmes of the social services); and therefore it cannot be linked to the level of the Govern-ments borrowing without artificiality. Moreover, the introduction of a quite independent current/capital distinction into the Accounts, in additionto the existing division on the basis of borrowing powers, would lead to worseconfusion still. For there would then be two lines.35. But there are still more fundamental objections of principle to anycurrent/capital distinction in the Exchequer Accounts, however it mightbe arranged. Such a distinction would be inappropriate and misconceivedfor two reasons. First, at the point of issue of cash from the exchequer-quer there is a transfer of a lump sum of cash to some spendingagency ; and it is only when the cash comes to be spent by that agency that a distinction between current and capital can be made. Such a distinction weekby week in the Exchequer Accounts themselves would necessarily be some sort of fiction. Quite apart from this point arising from the special nature ofthe Exchequer Accounts, a proper accounting distinction between current and capital cannot usefully be drawn in a purely cash account. Non-cashitems have to be added ; and some statement of existing capital assets isrequired if the capital transactions are to be significant. A valuation of theGovernments total capital assets, tangible and intangible, most of them not revenue producing, would be quite meaningless.36. The analogy between the Government as such and a private business,from which springs the idea that the current/capital distinction would be valuable and important, is mistaken. Although it must be clearly recog-nised that there are areas of government activity which are properly thesubject of scrutiny in the light of sound commercial principles, in generalquite different considerations apply. In preserving law and order, in itsdefence and foreign policy, in its programme for the development of social and other services for the community, indeed for virtually all its traditionalactivities, the aims of the Government are not those of a private business.Specifically, the Government is not primarily and of its nature engaged inmaking a profit or earning a return on &quot; capital &quot;. In terms of the enduringbenefits created by government activities, the tangible fixed assets produced(hospital buildings, schools, roads, etc.) are not necessarily as significant asthe intangible assets produced. Hence the distinction between current and capital in the normal commercial sense is not of prime importance. Indeed,the concept of &quot; capital &quot; expenditure, with all it implies in terms of financing,depreciation and earning power, can only make full sense in a propercommercial context where there are definite and recognised monetary criteria for judging the soundness of such expenditure.   This is, of course, not at
all to say that the distinction should not be drawn in the economic statistics of the public sector which are used as an aid to interpreting general economic developments in the nation as a whole.The Structure of the Suggested new Exchequer Accounts37. Certain conclusions can now be drawn. No useful economic or financial function would be served by dividing up government expenditureinto one category which had to be met from revenue and another whichcould be met from borrowing ; and no useful distinction between current and capital can be drawn. In the absence of any other discernible role for theline it follows that the present &quot; above-the-line &quot; and &quot; below-the-line &quot; partsof the Exchequer Accounts should be merged. The natural division in the accounts is between the transactions leading up to the net financing require-ment, on the one hand, and the transactions showing how the requirementis met, on the other. The former, it is suggested, might be called the budgetaccount and the latter the financing account. Together they would make up the new form of Exchequer Accounts.Minor ^classifications38. There remains the question whether the scope of the present&quot; above-ithe-lkie&quot; and &quot; balow-fhe-iime&quot; parts would be in detail appropriate tothe new style budget account. Would it contain transactions which couldbe better included with the new style financing account, and converselywould there be any transactions now included under the headings ofNational Debit transactions, or Other Issues and Repayments, which oughtto be brought into the budget account? Payments from the exchequer on account of certain contractual Sinking Funds seem to come into theformer category. These amount to just over  40 million a year. If left in the budget account, they would inflate the borrowing requirement airti-fioially ; and it seems more natural to regard tihem as part of the operations of managing the National Debt.39. The present &quot; National Debt transactions &quot; form a coherent group of transactions in the Exchequer Accounts ; and there is no doubt that theyare properly placed. Of the items under the heading &quot; Other Issues andRepayments &quot; special mention need only be made of issues to the CivilContingencies Fund.  These may be for one of two purposes:  (a) to finance supply expenditure in advance of Padiamentairy pro-vision ; these are almost always paid back before the end of theyear.(b) to finance departments&apos; working balances; these are mostly made&apos;Over the turn of the year.The former would properly belong in the budget account because theyanticipate Supply issues which belong there. During the course of theyear there would be entries under this heading ; but there would generally be a nil figure in the budget account for a complete year. On the otherhand, issues from the Civil Contingencies Fund to finance departments&apos;working balances would belong in the financing account since they merelyrepresent an internal financing transaction. During the course of the year there would generally be no entries ; but the accounts for a completefinancial year would show the difference between the amounts of such issuesoutstanding at the end of the year and ait the end of the previous year.
Detail of the suggested new Exchequer Accounts40. A -possible new lay-out of the Exchequer Accounts is shown inAppendix A (budget account) and Appendix B (financing account). It willbe seen that in the budget account receipts are divided between &quot; taxation &quot;and &quot; other&quot;, and payments between Supply Services and consolidate fund. A single total on each side of the budget account yields immediately the net &quot; financing requirement&quot; which is carded forward to the &quot; financingaccount&quot; (Appendix B). This is the sum which remains to be raised bythe Exchequer after taking account of &apos;tihe prospective yield from taxation and &apos;of receipts from other sources and of prospective expenditure in theform both of issues for Supply Services, Debt interest etc., and of netlending to various borrowers at home and overseas. This new budgetaccount would show the progress of Exchequer receipts and issues underheadings which correspond to the way in which taxes and expenditure havebeen authorised by Parliament. It would also show the effect of budgetarytransactions on the cash position of the Exchequer which is of cardinalimportance for debt management and monetary policy. A financing account would not usefully be produced for the year ahead because the items in there are mostly quite unforecastable.Link between new Exchequer Accounts and national income statistics41. The changes in the form of the Exchequer Accounts that have beensuggested in order to clarify their essential functions as the Governmentscentral cash account do not in themselves help with the problem of showingthe relation of the Exchequer Accounts to statistical accounts for the restof the economy, nor of elucidating the economic significance of the transactions they record. To solve this problem and improve the publishedmaterial relating to the effect of the budget upon the national economy,two additional tables are suggested.42. The first (Appendix C) would be a table for the central governmentsector of the economy, with the same scope and classified in the same way as the national inoome tables already published retrospectively by theCentral Statistical Office, but on a financial year basis. It would givefigures derived from the budget estimates for the coming year together withfigures derived from last year&apos;s estimates and for the provisional out-turn.This table would be based on an extension to all central governmenlt bodies of the national accounts classification which, as already noted, has been published for Supply and &quot; below-the-line&quot; expenditure from 1962-63.43. The other table (Appendices D and E) would provide a detailedreconciliation With the new form of the budget account, showing what additional information is included from the accounts of the national insurance and other Funds.Conclusion44. In this way the two aims of the Teform of the Exchequer Accountswould be achieved. In their suggested new form the Exchequer Accountswould still fulfil their chief role as instruments of Parliamentary controlof taxation and expenditure; but present causes of confusion would beremoved. In addition, the tables would classify and supplement theExchequer accounts in a way which would bring out their economiccharacter.

Note on the reconciliation of the new Budget Account and the national accounts table for Central GovernmentThe object of the reconciliation table (Appendix D) is to show how the totals of receipts and payments in the new budget account are classified inthe national accounts table of Central Government; to show, similarly classified,the additional transactions outside the budget account which go to complete the table for the whole Central Government; and to show the items, both within and without the budget account, which are transactions inside &quot; the family&quot; and hence cancel out when the Central Government is considered as a whole. In the subsequent paragraphs each of the numbered columns of appendix D is considered in turn ; and the explanations are completed byseparate notes showing the relationship between the net financing requirement of the new and old budget accounts and the national accounts net financingitem shown in the table of Central Government.(1) ReceiptsThis column shows the classification of the total of  7,982 millionshown on the receipts side of the budget account. The major part  7,751 million is allocated to items on the receipts side of the national accounts table; but  79 million of receipts consisting either of sales,refunds of expenditure, or repayment of loans, is classified as deductionsfrom items on the payments side. The remaining  152 million consists of receipts from within the Government; and the corresponding pay-ments appear in the other columns of the reconciliation table.(2) Supply services the total of Supply Services in the budget account is  6,139 million ;and the table shows that this consists in national accounting terms ofpayments of  6,085 million and receipts of  289 million, the remaining 343 million being transactions within the Central Government, forexample the grant to the National Insurance Funds, with correspondingentries in the other columns of the reconciliation table.(3) Consolidated Fund services the budget account shows payment of  1,843 million, of which  1,606million is classified among the payment items in the national accountstable. The remaining  237 million is classified under the heading ofinternal transactions, of which about half is interest paid on the NationalDebt to the various extra-budgetary funds brought into the national accounts in columns 4 and 5 and half consists of the payment to northern Ireland of its share of reserved taxes (see also column 5).(4) National Insurance Funds (U.K.)This column shows the national accounts classification of the grosstransactions of the National Insurance Funds and the contra entriesof the transactions of other parts of the Central Government with theseFunds.(5) Other extra-budgetary itemsThis column brings into the national accounts table of Central Govern-ment the income transactions of the Issue Department of the Bankof England and of the Exchange Equalization Account and the trans-actions of the Local Loans Fund, the Post Office Savings BankFund and other minor accounts. In addition it contains a classificationin national accounting terms of the gross transactions of the NorthernIreland Government, the share of reserved taxes received from theExchequer being included as a transaction within the Central Govern-ment as a whole. Finally it introduces as a receipt an imputed rentalincome from Government buildings and the assets of the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority and, as a payment, the same amount as animputed rental charge.
The new compared with the old borrowing requirement2. Between the old overall deficit (i.e. the balance of the items above and below the line shown in the Financial Statement) and the net financing require-ment on the new budget account (Appendix A) there are only two differences.First, Sinking Fund payments, which now appear with other payments forDebt redemption in the &quot; financing account&quot; (Appendix B), do not enter intothe financing requirement and so reduce it by  42 million in 1963-64. Secondly,in the new budget account interest on National Savings Certificates is debitedas it accrues rather than as it is paid out on encashment of Certificates. As aresult the charge for interest and hence the financing requirement is increasedby  25 million in 1963-64. The net effect of the two changes is that the borrowing requirement of  687 million shown in the Financial Statement becomesthe  670 million shown as the net financing requirement in the new budgetaccount. (Appendix A.)The net financing requirement compared with net financing in the national accounts table of Central government. The reconciliation table (Appendix D) shows that the net financing require-ment of  670 million, on the new budget account becomes a net financingrequirement of  625 million in the national accounts table of Central Govern-ment. This is because the extra-budgetary accounts covered by the table areexpected to yield in 1963-64 a net surplus of  45 million a requirement of 23 million on the National Insurance Funds (column 4) and a surplus of 68 million on other extra-budgetary transactions (column 5). The principalitems producing this amount are interest on stocks held by the Issue Depart-ment of the Bank of England and the receipt of interest and dividends by theExchange Equalisation Account.(30496)  Wt. 134-12  3, 51 26,   4/63  St.S.
