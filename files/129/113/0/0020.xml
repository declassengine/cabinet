Copy No.     JCABINETFASCIST ACTIVITIES AND PUBLIC order memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 23rd October, 1962, I submitted a Memorandum (C. (62) 156) seeking theviews of my colleagues on the question of legislation to deal with the threat to public order arising out of the activities of Fascist organisations. I suggested that,as certain cases were then sub judice, it was impossible to hold that the present lawwas inadequate; that we should review the situation as soon as these cases hadbeen decided; and that in the meantime we should say that there was a case for increasing penalties, and that we should enact this as soon as opportunity occurred.I made a statement on these lines in reply to a Question by Mr. Iremonger on 8th November (Hansard, columns 1158-1161).2. The Cabinet also invited me, in consultation with the First Secretary ofState, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, to consider further, in thelight of the Cabinefs decision, ways in which the law might be amended to dealwith incitement to racial hatred; and to bring this question before them again at alater meeting.3. The two cases to which I referred in C. (62) 156 have now been disposedof. One of them concerned Colin Jordan, leader of the National SocialistMovement, John Tyndall, its national secretary, and two other members of themovement who were found guilty at the Central Criminal Court on 15th Octoberof organising, training and equipping the movements quasi-military cadre&quot; Spearhead &quot; in contravention of Section 2 of the Public Order Act. Jordan wassentenced to nine months&apos; imprisonment, Tyndall to six months, and each of the others to three months. Jordan and Tyndall sought leave to appeal against theirconvictions and sentences, but this was refused by the Court of Criminal Appealon 9th November. The upholding of these convictions shows that the law is adequate to deal with the more extreme activities of the Fascist organisations.4. In the second case, Jordan and Tyndall had been convicted by the magistrate at Bow Street on 20th August of using, in Trafalgar Square on 1st July,insulting words whereby a breach of the peace was likely to be occasioned, contraryto Section 5 of the Act. Jordan was sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment, andTyndall to six weeks. Both appealed to Quarter Sessions against conviction andsentence. Jordan&apos;s appeal against conviction was allowed. Tyndall&apos;s appeal against conviction was dismissed, but a fine of  10 was substituted for the sentence of imprisonment. The police took the view that in the case of Jordan the decisionof Quarter Sessions was wrong in law, and asked the Chairman to state a case forconsideration by the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court decided that thecourt was wrong in allowing the appeal, and that Jordan was rightly convicted bythe magistrate. The Lord Chief Justice said in the course of his judgment that&quot; a man was entitled to express his views as strongly as he liked . . . but he mustnot threaten, abuse or insult by hitting with words &quot;. This gives strong grounds for saying that the existing law is sufficient to deal with language of the kind used by Jordan in Trafalgar Square on 1st July.   ,!5. Jordan subsequently applied to the Divisional Court for leave to appealto the House of Lords. The Court did not consider that leave to appeal shouldbe granted, but granted a certificate to the effect that a question of law of generalC.(63) 7026th April, 1963Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1963
public importance was involved. The House of Lords Appeal Committee, sittingon 23rd April, took the view that the test Would be whether a reasonable Jewwould be likely to be provoked by the words which were used by Jordan; andthey dismissed the application.6. Various suggestions have been made that incitement to racial hatredshould be made a specific offence. In particular, there is at present before theHouse of Commons a Bill introduced by Mr. Iremonger which would add to section 5 of the Public Order Act, 1936, the words italicized below:&quot; Any person who in any public place or at any public meeting usesthreatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or words inciting hatredof any racial group of Her Majesty&apos;s subjects with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned, shallbe guilty of an offence.&quot;7. I do not think that this amendment is necessary or indeed desirable. Inmy statement on 8th November I explained that the Government would need tobe certain, before legislating further, that the present law is inadequate and thatany amendment of it would be enforceable and more effective. Any wordsinciting others to racial hatred are bound to be &quot; threatening, abusive or insulting &quot;,and if they are uttered in circumstances likely to cause a breach of the peace (which mr. Iremonger&apos;s amended section would still require) they are covered by the lawas it stands. Indeed, even the Chairman of Quarter Sessions found, as a fact, thatthe words used by Jordan on 1st. July were &quot; highly insulting &quot;. The doubt in his mind was whether they were words &quot; whereby a breach of the peace is likely tobe occasioned &quot; within the meaning of the section. This doubt has now beenlesolved by the Divisional Court. Mr. Iremongefs amendment would thereforemerely import into our legislation the concept of &quot; race&quot;, from which it hashitherto been free, without strengthening the law in any way.8. There is the further consideration that much of the disorder that occurredlast year was due not to anything which the speakers said for example, Mosleyhas not in recent years said anything that would bring him within the ambit ofMr. Iremonger&apos;s amendment but to deliberate attempts by Communists and young trouble-makers to break up Fascist meetings. Mr. Iremonger&apos;s amendment would not help in this respect nor would any other proposals to make racial hatred, as such, a specific offence.9. There is now much less evidence of public concern about all this than there was last autumn. Jordan has been in prison, and the activities of the otherneo-Nazis have been on a very small scale partly maybe owing to the winter,whose extremism outdid theirs. The court decisions have been well received bythe interested public. But no doubt the demand for fresh legislation will continue;and as the weather improves there may be further disorders at open-air Fascistmeetings. But the determining considerations seem to me to be:(a) The upholding of the conviction of Jordan and his followers underSection 2 of the Public Order Act, 1936, shows that the law is adequate to deal with the more extreme activities of the Fascist organisations.(b) The decision of the Divisional Court and the refusal of leave to appeal tothe House of Lords in the case under Section 5 of the Act show thatthe law is adequate to deal with language of the kind used by Jordanin Trafalgar Square on 1st July.(c) The creation of a new offence of inciting to racial hatred (which, in anycase, would present difficulties of its own) would not deal with troublessuch as those that occurred last year, and would import into our law a concept at present11 absent from it.10. It must also be remembered that the weapon of a prosecution for themisdemeanour of sedition is still available for use. Any person who speaks wordsor publishes matter calculated to provoke a breach of the peace with the intentionof stirring up hatred or hostility between different classes of The Queen&apos;s subjectsis guilty of sedition at common law. This would exactly cover stirring up hatredor hostility on the ground (for instance) of race. The Attorney-General is willingto direct a prosecution if sufficient evidence of such an offence comes into his possession. This will be the most expeditious way of dealing promptly with any
renewed outbreak of Fascist provocation, whether against Jews or against colouredpersons, and, if the first prosecution is successful, it will also show that new legislation is not needed to deal with the Fascists or to give protection to thosethreatened.11. I suggest therefore that I should now take the line that, having consideredthe situation in the light of the decisions reached by the courts, I do not considerthat any amendment of the law is necessary other than the strengthening of the penalties available to the courts to which we are already committed. The policecan be relied on to make full use of their powers to check both incitement and disorder, and the courts to enforce the law. The position must, of course, be closely watched; and if at any time further powers appear to be needed I shallnot hesitate to ask Parliament for them.12.  I attach, for the approval of my colleagues, a statement on the above lines.H BHome Office, S.W.1,25th April, 1963.annex draft STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF state as promised in my statement of 8th November last, the Government hasreviewed the adequacy of the law relating to public order in the light of the two cases which have, since then, been before the courts.In one of these cases Colin Jordan, leader of the so-called National SocialistMovement, John Tyndall, its national secretary, and two other members of itwere charged under Section 2 of the Public Order Act, 1936, with running aquasi-military organisation. They were found guilty at the Central Criminal Courton 15th October and sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment. Jordan andTyndall sought leave to appeal against their convictions and sentences, but thiswas refused by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 9th November. They have since been serving their sentences.In the other case, Jordan and Tyndall had been convicted by the Magistrateat Bow Street on 20th August of using, in Trafalgar Square on 1st July, insultingwords whereby a breach of the peace was likely to be occasioned, contrary to section 5 of the Public Order Act. Both appealed to Quarter Sessions againstconviction and sentence. Jordan&apos;s appeal against conviction was allowed. Tyndall&apos;s appeal against conviction was dismissed, but a fine of  10 was substituted for the sentence of imprisonment.The Chairman of Quarter Sessions was asked to state a case for considerationby the Divisional Court, which decided on 19th March, 1963, that the court was wrong in allowing the appeal and that Jordan was rightly convicted by the magistrate. The Lord Chief Justice said in the course of his judgment that &quot; a manwas entitled to express his views as strongly as he liked . . . but he must notthreaten, abuse or insult by hitting with words&quot;. An application for leave poappeal to the House of Lords was subsequently refused.As I explained to the House on 8th November, we ought to be certain, beforelegislating further, not only that the present law is inadequate, but also that any amendment of it would be enforceable and more effective.The decisions reached by the courts in these two cases show that the existing law can effectively deal with the problems created by such bodies as the national socialist Movement. The only strengthening required is an increase in the penalties for offences against the Public Meeting Act, 1908, and Section 5 of the public order Act, 1936, and we shall bring forward legislation for this purpose as soonas an opportunity occurs.I indicated in my statement in November that the sanctions provided by theexisting law do not rest entirely on statute law, and that a person who speaks wordsor publishes matter calculated to provoke a breach of the peace, with the intention
of stirring up hatred or hostility between different classes of The Queen&apos;s subjects,is guilty of the common law misdemeanour of sedition. As I informed the House,that offence extends to the stirring up of hatred or hostility on the ground of race;and it is punishable by fine and imprisonment, the amount of the fine and the termof the imprisonment being entirely at the courfs discretion.The Government do not think that a need has been established to take powerto prohibit meetings in advance a power which was never taken in the muchgraver situation that existed before the war nor to introduce into our law forthe first time the concept of race. Historic rights of assembly and free speech are involved; and I do not believe that anyone would wish to see them restricted unless this was rendered essential by abuse of them and by the overriding need to maintainpublic order. The present law as interpreted by the courts is sufficient, and thepolice can be relied upon to enforce it with vigour.I would add only two things. First, the situation will be kept under continuous review. Second, now that the adequacy of the law has been conclusivelydemonstrated there can be no excuse for the opponents of a particular doctrine,however obnoxious it may be, to take the law into their own hands. The rule oflaw must prevail against those who dislike Fascism, as it will certainly be made toprevail against the insignificant minority who support it.
