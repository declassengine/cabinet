K FOREWORDI. This Report is very long. For the convenience of Ministers we start witha summary of its contents and a list of what we consider are the main points for decision.II. The Report begins with the conclusions of the Economic Policy committee at their meeting on 13th February (paragraphs 1 and 2). It then reviews (i) theGovernment&apos;s commitments to United Kingdom agriculture (paragraphs 4-7);(ii) the expansion of home production (paragraph 8); (iii) the trend of farm incomes(paragraphs 9 and 10); (iv) the level of imports (paragraph 11); (v) the Exchequerbill and the additional costs to the economy (paragraph 12); (vi) food prices to theconsumer (paragraph 13). Detailed figures on (ii) and (iv) are in Appendix I, andon (v) in Appendix II.III. The scope of the present Report is discussed in paragraphs 14 to 18. Onthe assumptions given in the remit from the Economic Policy Committee, the objectives of future agricultural policy are taken to be (i) to check the continuingexpansion of domestic production and so prevent the further increase in the costof agricultural support, particularly in terms of cost to the Exchequer, from thatcause; (ii) to secure broadly the present volume of home production under conditionsof progressively growing efficiency and ability to compete with imported supplies,with a consequential reduction in cost to the economy and to the Exchequer. Somemethods of achieving these objectives will be studied further (paragraph 15) but certain decisions on future policy are needed urgently (paragraph 16). The Reporttherefore concentrates on the problems of containing home production, regulatingimports and limiting the Exchequer cost of the guarantees, on which some general considerations are discussed in Part I; and on specific proposals for cereals (Part II),fatstock (Part III) and horticulture (Part IV). Other commodities, including milk and dairy products, will be reported on as soon as possible.SUMMARY OF PART I.-GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THECOST OF THE PRICE GUARANTEES, THE POSSIBILITIES OFCONTAINING IT AND THEIR IMPLICATIONSIV. The greater part of the Exchequer bill for support is due to the price guarantees, on which the liability is largely open-ended. In considering ways of helping to contain the bill the Agricultural Departments have assumed that changesinvolving substantial amendment of the Agriculture Acts are beyond theCommittee&apos;s remit. They consider that much can be done within the presentsystem; the Treasury feel that more is needed to check the expansion of home production (paragraphs 19 and 20).V. Three main factors affect the cost of implementing the price guarantees.They are considered in turn, together with possible remedies.(i) The level of the price determinations at the Annual ReviewThis depends in the end on political decisions by the Government. Butthe Government^ freedom of action is also limited by their pledge as regardsthe percentages in the 1957 Act and their assurance to the industry about sharingthe gain from increasing efficiency. Ministers will need to reconsider their position on these two commitments (paragraphs 21 to 24).The problem of the small farm business also affects the pricedeterminations. The Committee have briefly considered a major change inthe present system which would provide special payments to low incomefarmers, the cost being deducted from guaranteed prices. One possiblemethod is examined (paragraph 26). If any scheme of this kind could takecare of the problem of the small farm business, Ministers would be in a stronger position at Annual Reviews. The Agricultural Departments see betterpossibilities in other, but less substantial, changes (paragraph 27). ministers are asked whether they wish further study to be given to the more radicalapproach (paragraph 28).
(ii) The quantity to which the guaranteed price appliesThe limitation of the price guarantee to a particular quantity of production is permitted under the Agriculture Acts; and &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangements are already in operation for a number of commodities. The choice is broadlybetween &quot; conventional &quot; and &quot; flexible guarantee &quot; arrangements. The lattercan be made more effective in restraining production and would also be easier to present to our own farmers and to overseas suppliers (paragraph 31). Bothtypes of arrangement (and their Exchequer implications) are discussed further in Parts II and III.(iii) Level of market priceUnder the present support system the Exchequer bill could not be fullycontained without some control both of home production and of imports.As regards imports the possibilities considered are minimum import prices,quantitative restriction and tariffs (paragraph 32).VI. After explaining why priority has been given to proposals for cereals andfatstock (paragraphs 33 to 36), the remainder of Part I discusses in general termssome of the problems raised by import control. ViPossibilities and implications of import control(a) Balance of paymentsVII. Of the measures that might be taken to prevent the home market beingweakened by import at unduly low prices, some, e.g., tariffs or a variable levy,would be unlikely to affect the balance of payments. Others, e.g., import quotas orminimum import prices, would in general enable exporters to obtain higher prices for their sales in the British market and thus would increase the cost to the balanceof payments. This increased cost would need to be assessed in relation to the benefitsobtained.  Some general considerations are in paragraphs 37 to 41.(b) Effects on the consumerVIII. Restrictions on imports designed to raise market prices in the UnitedKingdom involve extra cost to the consumer. The relation between this extra costand the saving to the Exchequer can differ greatly, depending on the proportionwhich imports bear to home production. It is for consideration how far it wouldbe desirable to transfer the cost of support to the consumer. The effects on theconsumer to the various methods of transferring the cost are analysed (paragraphs42 to 48). An attempt is made to assess the effect on retail food prices, includingthe effect of proposals in Parts II and III (paragraphs 49 to 53).(c) Commercial policy implicationsIX. The circumstances in which our present agricultural policy is coming intoconflict increasingly with our overseas commercial policy are discussed in paragraphs54 and 55. To impose variable levies or quantitative restrictions would meanrenegotiation of our commitments to our overseas suppliers. To avoid loss toour exports, we must convince our overseas suppliers that the new policy as a whole would maintain their position. On the other hand, if domestic production is tobe checked our farmers will press for a comparable check on imports. The changesin policy should therefore be capable of being presented at home and abroad as areasonable &quot; package &quot;. A reduction of the Exchequer bill at the cost of serious damage to our overseas trading relations would not be in the national interest(paragraphs 56 to 58).SUMMARY OF PART II.-CEREALSX. Home production has been increasing. As a result of this, and of theeffect of import prices, market prices for home grown cereals have been lowin relation to guaranteed prices. For these reasons, the Exchequer bill for the cereals subsidy has been increasing and will reach  83 million in 1963-64. Thereport examines what could be done to contain further increases.XI. Paragraphs 60 to 66 examine possible action to check further increases in home production and therefore the Exchequer liability. It is recommendedthat a &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangement should be introduced to reinforce actionon the guaranteed prices.
XII. Paragraphs 67 to 78 examine possible action to prevent sharp falls in import prices for short periods from unduly disturbing the market. It is recommended that if Ministers consider that such action is required, some formof minimum import price scheme for all cereals would be the most practicableinstrument. Three possible courses of action are set out in paragraph 78. Ofthese the Agricultural Departments favour the third, i,e., raising the level of minimum prices under the International Wheat Agreement by up to  2 per ton,and securing related minimum import prices for coarse grains, preferably through an international agreement. They consider that increases of this order would keep the additional liability on the cost of imports within relatively narrow limits.These arrangements should be negotiated with our main suppliers and if agreement could not be reached the position should be reviewed. The agricultural departments also consider that such actipn would be an essential corollary to a&quot; standard quantity&quot; for home production. The Treasury and the Board ofTrade do not agree with this approach. While recognising that the introductionof effective floor prices for cereals may be demanded of us in forthcominginternational negotiations, they think that in deciding this issue Ministers will need to weigh closely the risk to our balance of payments, both now and in thefuture, against any advantages obtainable either from our overseas suppliers orfor the Exchequer.XIII. Paragraphs 80 to 87 consider what action could be taken to transfer the cost of the Exchequer cereals bill to the consumer. It is recommended that if ministers decide that such action is desirable, the best method of taking it wouldbe by a levy-subsidy; but in the view of the Treasury and the Board of Trade anysuch action should be considered in the context of any possible similar action on other commodities.XIV. Paragraphs 88 to 99 set out the international implications of thepossible courses of action indicated above. It is considered that, if standard quantities, a minimum import price scheme and (if desired) a levy-subsidy were presented as a single &quot; package &quot;, and if our suppliers were convinced that the&quot; package &quot; included an efficient method of containing home production, it shouldbe negotiable internationally and should not involve paying compensation (otherthan any extra cost on our imports) for relief being given to the United kingdom on tariff bindings and duty-free obligations. Any comprehensive proposals should,in the first instance, be negotiated in the context of the forthcoming GATTdiscussions. Ministers will, in any case, need to consider what attitude the UnitedKingdom should adopt towards international commodity agreements on cereals.These might incorporate, in addition to the elements in the &quot; package &quot; already mentioned, confrontation of domestic cereals policies and arrangements forsurplus disposal.XV. The conclusions of the Committee, together with the differing views of departments, are set out in paragraphs 100 to 102.SUMMARY OF PART III.-FATSTOCKXVI. During the past few years home production of all types of meat hasincreased considerably. Total imports have not increased. Figures are inAppendix III. With the increase in total supplies, the Exchequer bill has risenvery substantially and sharply, and disturbances in the marketing pattern of eitherimports or home production can bring about disproportionately large effects onmarket prices. Policy should be directed towards containing production of all types of fatstock at about present levels. This may well require reductions inguaranteed prices apart from the changes in system discussed in the Report(paragraphs 103 to 105).XVII. The guarantee arrangements could be changed, consistently with the agriculture Acts, so as to increase the influence of the market on farmers&quot;decisions. This would tend to reduce the Exchequer liability and help in negotiations with overseas suppliers. There are however serious practicaldifficulties to be overcome. The Committee agree that the Agricultural departments should work out a revised scheme which, after consultation with the Farmers&apos;Unions, would be submitted to Ministers, who would decide at that stage whether to await the report of the Verdon Smith Committee on fatstock and meatmarketing (paragraphs 106 to 111).
XVIII. The Committee are in favour of applying standard quantityarrangements to cattle and sheep. There is already a &quot; flexible guarantee &quot; for pigs and there would be advantage in applying so far as practicable a similar arrangement to the other fatstock. The Agricultural Departments should workout proposals for cattle and sheep taking account of their proposals for revising the guarantee arrangements (paragraphs 112 to 119).XIX. Recent experience has shown that with the market amply supplied,comparatively small irregularities in the marketing of imports can havedisproportionately large effects on prices in the home market. Moreover, imports are expected to increase and would tend to depress British prices even if home production were contained. The Agricultural Departments consider that controlof imports is in any case necessary if our farmers are to accept measures affectinghome production (paragraph 120).XX. Control of imports through minimum import prices or variable levieshas been examined but found impracticable (paragraphs 121 to 128). The only practicable way of regulating imports seems to be through a comprehensive systemof quantitative restrictions by country quotas. This would, however, be open to considerable difficulties. It would be necessary for us to negotiate to obtainfreedom by agreement from our contractual commitments (these are set out inAppendix IV) and to justify our proposals, e.g., in the GATT; and to have any chance of getting such agreement we would need to convince our suppliers thathome production would also be effectively limited.XXI. The Agricultural Departments consider that an attempt should be madeto negotiate a comprehensive system of quota restriction based on country quotasand that if it proved impossible to secure the agreement of our main suppliers itwould then be necessary for Ministers to take stock of the position and to decide what action should be taken both on home production and on imports. Theother Departments believe, however, that the disadvantages of such a system(including increased cost to our balance of payments) are such that they couldnot recommend this course of action. The GATT discussions this summer on international trade in meat will provide an opportunity to explore how far anyforms of regulation would be acceptable to both the United Kingdom and our overseas suppliers (paragraphs 129 to 132). It is agreed that the Ministry ofAgriculture should continue the talks already initiated with certain supplying countries with a view to arranging on an informal basis voluntary regulation ofsupplies to the market (paragraph 133).XXII. The Committee&apos;s conclusions are set out in paragraph 134.SUMMARY OF PART IV.-HORTICULTUREXXIII. The present declared policy of the Government is to continue tosupport horticulture with tariffs as the main instrument; and they are pledged togive the industry a measure of support equivalent to that given to agriculturegenerally. Tariff protection though of long standing has not been successful, inthe sense that those sectors which are most protected (especially the glasshousesector) are also the least competitive. There is increasing demand for some new approach to horticultural policy. There is also the need to decide whether the horticultural tariff has to be excluded from the field in which concessions couldbe made in forthcoming international trade negotiations (paragraphs 135 to 137).XXIV. These considerations have led the Agricultural Departments to propose a new policy comprising broadly: (i) a move away from reliance on tariff protection in that the Government would reserve the right to bind or reducehorticultural tariffs when it was in the national interest to do so; (ii) government measures to help the industry to increase its ability to stand on its own feet. since it would be some years before the industry could begin to benefit from such measures, it would be necessary to provide for sensitive products a standstillperiod in which the tariff could be bound but not reduced. The quota restrictionson apples and pears would have to be phased out. The future of tariffs givingpreference to the Commonwealth rather than protection to the home grower will need further study (paragraphs 138 to 148).
XXV.  The new measures of assistance proposed are:.(i) an extended scheme of grant-aid designed to help potentially viablegrowers to re-equip themselves for more efficient production and to reorganise or amalgamate small businesses, and also to assist theestablishment of co-operatives. This scheme would operate for alimited period of 10 years and (with a grant rate of one-third) might cost around  25 million (including the  8 million authorised for theexisting Horticulture Improvement Scheme) (paragraphs 150 to 152);(ii) grant-aid, again for a period of 10 years, for the redevelopment of anumber of the main wholesale horticultural markets. The precise form of such grants would be determined later, but the total cost to public funds over the period might amount to around  20 million(paragraphs 155 to 158);(iii) arrangements to improve the existing credit facilities for growers undera system of Government guarantee. Interest rates would not be subsidised and the cost to the Exchequer should not exceed  200,000in any one year (paragraphs 159 and 160);(iv) a system of compulsory grading for horticultural produce, beginning witha few of the main products and extending later to others. This wouldbe enforced at the wholesale stage, the task of inspection falling uponthe Government at a cost of  400,000 per annum (paragraphs 163to 165).XXVI. These measures are similar to those contemplated for horticulture inthe Common Market context. They could do much to equip the industry to meetconditions of greater competition. But they would not be regarded by the industry as full recompense for assured tariff protection (paragraph 168).XXVII. The industry will be concerned over the possibility of surplusesarising in Europe and being exported to our market at very low prices; and theywill have a strong case for some alternative safeguard against such surpluses iftariff protection is reduced. The long-term answer may lie in arrangements totake surplus supplies off the European market generally; but meanwhile we should examine the possibility of adopting safeguard measures similar to those of theE.E.C. (paragraphs 166 and 167).XXVIII. The introduction of this proposed new policy for horticulture is supported by the Committee with the exception of the Treasury and theCommonwealth Relations Office. The Treasury accept the desirability of reducingthe present tariff protection given to horticulture but do not accept that this must inevitably be accompanied by the substitution of grant-aid, and believe thatthe Governments pledge to horticulture is limited by the general provision ofthe Agriculture Acts under which the Government is only bound to maintainfcuch volume of production as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom (paragraph 141). They doubt whether the grants forgrowers will have any significant effect in improving long-term viability or that,if they were introduced, it would be politically possible to stop them after 10 years;they consider that in any case no grants should be given until the decision toreduce particular tariffs has actually been taken and that they should be limitedto firms producing significant quantities of the products concerned (paragraphs153 and 154). They agree in principle to some financial assistance towards the redevelopment of markets, but consider that no promises should be made untilthe current survey of such markets is complete (paragraph 157). They are opposedto the guaranteeing of credit (paragraphs 161 and 162), but do not object to theintroduction of compulsory grading.XXIX. The Commonwealth Relations Office do not object to the adoptionof the proposed new policy, if this is dissociated from contractual preferences for commonwealth countries (paragraph 145); but reserve their position if thesepreferences are considered incompatible with the abandonment of tariff protection.
POINTS FOR DECISIONXXX.   The following major points for decision arise from this Report.A. General (Part I of Report)(i) On the assumption that Ministers wish to give themselves greater freedom to make reductions in the guarantees, do they desire(a) to decide whether or not to renew their pledge to retain thepercentages in the 1957 Act, with or without modifications; and(b) to reconsider their assurance to the industry that, save in exceptional circumstances, they will leave farmers with a share of theindustry&apos;s gain from increasing efficiency? (Paragraphs 23and 24.)(ii) Do Ministers envisage the possibility of more radical changes whichwould involve substantial alteration of the structure of the AgricultureActs?   (Paragraphs 19 and 20.)(iii) Do Ministers wish to make it an object of policy to transfer, in whole orin part, the cost of farm support from the Exchequer to the consumer?(Paragraphs 43 to 53.)(iv) On the problem of the small farm business, do Ministers wish further study to be given to the kind of approach outlined in paragraph 26?B.-Cereals (Part II of Report)(v) Do Ministers agree that the introduction of a standard quantityarrangement for cereals should be an objective of policy? (Paragraphs62 to 66.)(vi) Do Ministers consider that a standard quantity arrangement should beintroduced in any case or, as the Agricultural Departments recommend,only in association with a minimum import price scheme for all cereals?(Paragraph 101.)(vii) As regards the type of minimum import price scheme, do Ministersconsider that we should aim at the present International wheat agreement arrangement, possibly extended to coarse grains, or should we aim at a rather higher level of minimum import price, as inparagraphs 70 and 78?C-Fatstock (Part III of Report)(viii) Do Ministers agree that the Agricultural Departments should press ahead with the revision of the guarantee arrangements for fatstock in orderto increase the influence of the market on farmers&apos; decisions?(Paragraphs 106 to 111.)(ix) Do Ministers wish to instruct the Agricultural Departments to work outrevised arrangements which include provision for standard quantitiesfor cattle and sheep? If so, should this be conditional on effectiveregulation of imports, or should it be carried through in any event?(Paragraphs 118 and 119, and 134 (i).)(x) In the interests of market stability and reduction of the Exchequer liability,do Ministers wish to accept a policy of quantitative import restrictionsby country quotas?   (Paragraphs 129 to 131.)(xi) Do Ministers agree that we should use the opportunity of the GATTmeeting this summer to explore the possibility of negotiating with our main suppliers international arrangements for regulating trade inmeat?   (Paragraph 132.)D-Horticulture (Part IV of Report)(xii) Having regard to the nature of their undertakings to the horticulturalindustry, do Ministers agree that in the context of the Kennedy Round,a new policy for horticulture involving the progressive reduction of tariffs should be adopted(a) as a policy in itself, or(b) only in conjunction with some or all of the schemes for Exchequerassistance on the basis set out in paragraphs 150 to 160?
INTRODUCTIONTerms of referenceAt their meeting on 13th February (E.A. (63) 7th Meeting, Minute 2,Conclusions (5) and (6)) the Economic Policy Committee agreed that futureagricultural policy should be based on the following assumptions:(a) despite its attractions in improving the competitivenes of our economy, apolicy involving substantial reductions in domestic agriculture was tobe ruled out;(b) overall home production should remain at roughly its present level, soas to enable us to maintain our imports of agricultural commodities onbroadly the present scale;(c) the Exchequer bill should be brought under control, and Ministers should consider its size and whether it should in part be transferred to theconsumer;(d) Ministers would be willing at any rate to contemplate some minimummeasures to prevent some imported foods entering at unduly low prices.2. The Committee further agreed that officials should prepare a study of future agricultural policy on the following lines:(a) In future the quantity of output on which deficiency payments will be paidcould be limited.(b) The Government could, at the cost of not renewing their present pledge,give themselves scope to increase the percentages by which the guaranteed price could be reduced.(c) The market price, when this is affected by imports, could be brought undergreater control by ensuring that imports did not enter below areasonable minimum price. This could be fixed at a relatively low level designed to prevent the undermining of the market by producesent here at unrealistic, subsidised prices. This might be doneinternationally by commodity agreements, if they can be negotiated;failing this we should have to act unilaterally, e.g., by some such deviceas a levy subsidy scheme. There would be balance of payments and cost-of-living aspects to be considered.Background3. In the immediately following paragraphs, 4 to 13, we summarise the main features in the present situation which a study of future agricultural policy must take into account.(i) The Governments commitments to United Kingdom agriculture4. The Government are committed to the objective, set out in the agriculture Act, 1947, of maintaining:&quot; a stable and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such partof the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interestit is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it atminimum prices consistently with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in the industry.&quot;The means by which the Government have hitherto achieved this objective is thesystem of Annual Reviews, guaranteed prices and direct farming grants which hasbeen developed gradually and which is now operated under the powers given inthe Agriculture Act, 1957.5. The guarantees to the industry are determined each year in the light ofthe Annual Review. But the 1957 Act limits the reductions in guaranteed prices to not more than 4 per cent a year for any commodity and not more than 9 percent over three years for livestock and livestock products.  It also puts a limit
of 2\ per cent, subject to cost changes, on reductions in the total value of the guarantees (i.e., the value of the price guarantees together with that of the relevantfarming grants). The Act provides that these percentages may be changed, afterconsultation with the industry and subject to a delay of one year in applying thenew percentages. The Government are pledged, however, to leave the presentpercentages unchanged during the lifetime of this Parliament.6. Among the factors which the Government take into account in determining the guarantees is the extent to which the industry&apos;s resources are increasing through increased efficiency. The Governmenfs figure of  25 million a year for the commodities guaranteed under the Agriculture Acts is accepted bythe industry as a broad indication, taking one year with another, of the amountof this increase in resources. In 1960 Ythe Government gave the industry an assurance that, save in exceptional circumstances, they would leave farmers witha share of the  25 million; the share would be decided each year at the Review.In a year in which the circumstances could not be shown to be exceptional, this commitment could limit the scope which the Government would otherwise haveto reduce the guarantees up to the limits permitted by the 1957 Act. Thelimitation affects the overall cut in the guarantees, i.e., 2\ per cent. The limitationwould still be felt even if the 2\ per cent were increased. It does not, however,directly affect the scope for reducing the guarantees on any individual commodity.7. Horticulture is, by definition, included in the agricultural industry towhich the Government has a general obligation under the Agriculture Act, 1947.Although horticultural commodities are not covered by the price guarantees andthe percentage limitations under the 1957 Act, the Government are pledged togive horticulture support equivalent to that given to agriculture, using tariffs as themain instruments.(ii) Expansion of home, production8. In the post-war period up to about 1954 the Government pursued a deliberate policy of expanding home agriculture in order to deal with foodshortages and to alleviate balance of payments difficulties. By the mid-1950s net output in the United Kingdom was more than 50 per cent above pre-war. the government&apos;s policy later became more selective but encouragement of theexpansion of beef production continued until as recently as 1961. Increasingproduction of cereals has matched the increasing demand for animal feedingstuffs.Since the latter part of the 1950s and particularly since 1960 the emphasis ofGovernment policy has been on the reduction of costs and better marketing withthe object of improving the competitive position of the industry and restrainingthe cost of Exchequer support. Throughout this period, the productivity of theindustry here, as in other developed countries, has continued to increase. Thesetechnological advances, both at home and overseas, together with the agriculturalprotectionism which most countries have pursued, have increased the pressure ofsupplies on our market. Productivity per man in United Kingdom agricultureincreased by 32 per cent over the five years 1956 to 1961; this is well above theaverage increase in the 17 industries covered by the recent N.E.D.C. survey orin the economy as a whole. In the United Kingdom, agricultural net output hasincreased by some 20 per cent since the mid-1950s. Between 1957-58 and 1962-63the value of the output of Review commodities increased from  1,135 million to 1,235 million.  Details are shown in Appendix I.(iii) The trend of farm incomes9. The total net income of farmers doubled in real terms (i.e., allowing for changes in the value of money) during the war years and continued to rise intothe early 1950s. Since then the total in real terms has shown little change and(on a normal weather basis) has been only 5 to 10 per cent above the average forthe years 1945-46 to 1947-48. The number of farmers is, however, declininggradually so that there has probably been some improvement in the average realincome per farmer in the last 10 years. The range of incomes within the industryis, however, wide and because of the limited scale of many farm businessesa substantial proportion of farmers earn only very modest incomes. The resultsof a sample of full-time commercial farms in England and Wales in 1960-61showed that the net income of more than one-third of the farmers covered by the survey did not exceed  800.
10. Exchequer support is a substantial element in farmers&apos; returns. Thefollowing figures show the Exchequer bill as a percentage of (i) total net farmincome (including that from horticulture) and (ii) the value (excluding subsidies)of the output of Review commodities:1959-60 1960-61 1961-62 1962-63Per cent Per cent Per cent Per cent(i) Total net farm income   ...        71 67 81 79(ii) Value of output of Reviewcommodities     ......        22 22 28 26(iv) The level of imports11. As a result of the expansion of domestic agriculture, about half of our total supplies of food are now provided from home production, compared with about one-third pre-war. Home production provides nearly two-thirds of our supplies of temperate agricultural produce. About half our requirements of concentrated feedingstuffs are met from home production. The percentages oftotal supplies of other commodities provided by home agriculture compared with pre-war and earlier post-war years are as follows:Pre-warCommodity	average	1945	1951	1957	1961Wheat and flour ...      .	23	32	33	35	37Coarse and grain(a)	38	88	65	64	60Sugar        ......	18	32	23	19	30Carcase meat and offal	51	50	65	63	67Bacon and ham   ...	32	38	49	42	37Butter       .......	9	8	4	11	11Cheese	24	10	18	48	46Shell eggs  ...	71	87	86	99	97(a) Includes barley, oats, maize and sorghums.The value of imports of commodities comparable with those covered by the domesticguarantees has shown little change in total over the past six years at around  800million but there have been significant variations for individual commodities andthe importance of particular overseas suppliers varies considerably as between thedifferent commodities. Details of the value of imports in the past six years are shown in Appendix I.(v) The Exchequer hill12. During the four years 1957-58 to 1960-61 the total cost of agricultural support varied between about  240 million and  280 million a year. In 1961-62it rose sharply to  343 million, and although during 1962-63 it is estimated toshow a slight fall to  321 million, the estimate for 1963-64 is  364 million (or  350million after allowing for the savings secured for the Exchequer at this year&apos;annual Review). The main items in each year are shown in the table in Appendix II.In addition to the Exchequer bill, there are additional costs to the economy resultingfrom the special marketing arrangements for milk, sugar beet and potatoes; theprotection given to horticultural products by tariffs and quotas; and the special privileges of farmers in the matters of local rating, vehicle licences, etc. these may be worth in total perhaps  100 million.(vi) Food prices to the consumer13. Our system of support differs from those of most other countries by placing the greater part of the cost on the taxpayer. By this means we havereconciled prices to farmers at levels appreciably higher than world prices (whichare in many cases dumped or subsidised prices) with cheap food to the consumer.Scope of present report14. A fundamental question in this field is whether we are not devoting too much of our resources to agriculture. But taking the assumptions in paragraph 1as a basis, and having regard to the situation summarised in paragraphs 4 to 13,the objectives of future agricultural policy should be (i) to check the continuingexpansion of domestic production and so prevent the further increase in the cost of
agricultural support, particularly in terms of cost to the Exchequer, from that cause;(ii) to secure broadly the present volume of home production under conditions ofprogressively growing efficiency and ability to compete with imported supplies,with a consequential reduction in cost to the economy and to the Exchequer.15. Some of the methods by which these objectives might be achieved will need further study before we can report on them. These include possible methodsof dealing with underlying structural problems, e.g., the extent to which efficiency and competitiveness can be increased by measures to reduce the number of farmbusinesses by elimination of smaller holdings, through the encouragement ofamalgamations and possibly retirements. We shall also need to study furtherpossible changes in guarantee arrangements, e.g., changes designed to makeproducers more responsive to market forces and in this way to reduce the Exchequerbill for support.16. There are, however, certain decisions on future policy which are neededurgently. In particular it is necessary to decide on some measures to check thegrowth of home production and to bring the cost of Exchequer support undergreater control, even if these need to be supplemented or developed in the light ofour further studies. The Government have announced in this year&apos;s Annual review white Paper that during the coming months they will be discussing with theagricultural industry, and with Commonwealth and other supplying countries,proposals for further changes in the guarantee arrangements designed to bring theExchequer bill under more effective control whilst still ensuring a fair standard ofliving for agriculture and maintaining a proper balance between home-grown and imported food. Decisions on the proposals are needed so that these discussionscan begin without delay. A further reason for early decisions on certain aspects ofpolicy is the need to consider how far we are prepared to see agriculture brought within the scope of the Kennedy Round and subsequent commodity discussions.Ministers will wish to assess the position before the meeting of commonwealth trade Ministers which is to be held early in May in preparation for the negotiations in the GATT later that month. With this in view the Economic Policy committee agreed on 13th February that an assessment should be made of our attitude to international commodity agreements on cereals, meat and dairy products.17. This interim report therefore concentrates on the problems of containingdomestic production and giving more weight to market forces, regulating imports and limiting the Exchequer cost of the price guarantees. Certain general considerations are discussed in Part I. It discusses cereals (Part II) and fatstock(Part III). It deals also with horticulture (Part IV), where both domestic and international considerations make it desirable to decide at an early date our future policy as regards tariff protection.18. We shall report as soon as possible on other commodities, including milk and dairy products. The guarantee for milk does not affect the Exchequer becausethe arrangements ensure that the consumer bears the full cost of the guaranteed price; the questions to be considered arise from the fact that much milk is produced in excess of what is needed for the liquid market and has to be disposed of at low prices for manufacturing uses (cheese and butter especially) which compete with overseas supplies.PART I.-THE COST OF THE PRICE GUARANTEES: GENERALCONSIDERATIONS19. The figures in Appendix II show that the greater part of the Exchequerbill for agricultural support is due to the price guarantees. While the cost of the direct farming grants can be predicted with some accuracy that of the price guarantees is largely open-ended. Under the present system the cost of implementingthem depends on:(a) the level of the guaranteed price determination at the Annual Review;(b) the quantity to which the guaranteed price applies;(c) the level of the market price, which determines, by reference to the guaranteed price, the size of the unit deficiency payment.
We have considered changes which would help towards containing the Exchequerbill. Some of these, which are discussed later in this report, would be compatible with the Agriculture Acts. Others would involve substantial amendment of theActs. For instance, an arbitrary limit could be put on either the total of exchequer support, or the support given by way of commodity subsidies as a whole, or theamount of support given for individual commodities. Radical changes such as these have, in the view of the Agricultural Departments, been considered to be beyond our remit, though not necessarily to be ruled out as an objective in the longer term.20. In the view of the Agricultural Departments a great deal could be donewithin the framework and spirit of the present system; and this they take to be the broad intention of Ministers. The Treasury feel that the present structure of theActs (including particularly the procedures at the Annual Review) makes it verydifficult for Ministers to reduce the level of support to the extent needed to check the present expansion of production, and they regard this as the first andindispensable step towards containing Exchequer expenditure.The level of the guaranteed prices21. As regards (a) in paragraph 19 above, the determination of the level ofthe guaranteed prices at Annual Reviews depends in the end on political decisions by the Government as to the extent to which they are prepared to imposedeterminations on the industry. Apart from purely political considerations,however, their ability to reduce the price guarantees is limited by the percentagesin the 1957 Act and the assurance the Government have given about leaving farmers,save in exceptional circumstances, with some share of the gain from their increasing efficiency (paragraphs 5 and 6).22. The following table sets out the Annual Review awards from 1957. it shows that during this period there could, within the limits set by the 1957 Act,have been an aggregate net reduction in the total value of the guarantees of about 100 million. In fact, as the table also shows, the aggregate net reduction madewas only about  7 million.Annual Review Awards(  million)	1957	1958	1959	1960	1961	1962	1963	Total								(Net)Cost change	+37-65	+ 11-01	+ 11-56	+ 12-82	+ 19-04	+ 19-39	+ 12-7	+ 124-17Minimum possible								award......	  8	-21	-19	-19	-13	-14	-22-5	-100-5Global award	+ 14	-18-90	+ 3-04	- 8-96	+ 14-16	-10-85	No	-   7-51							change	Global award minus								cost change	-23-65	-29-91	- 8-52	-21-78	- 4-88	-30-24	-12-7	-131-68Farmers&apos; share of								assumed  25 mil-								lion gain from								efficiency	4- 1-35	- 4-95	+16-48	* 3-22	+20-12	- 5-24	+ 12-3	 Average +6-18 a year.23. At some stage the Government will have to decide whether or not to renew their pledge to retain the present percentages in the 1957 Act. As theabove table shows, the reductions actually made in the total value of the guaranteeshave been well within the overall percentage limit in the 1957 Act. On the otherhand, the present percentage limits, particularly on reductions in the guaranteed prices of individual commodities, do tend to inhibit the Governmenfs freedom ofaction. The Governmenfs pledge is limited to the lifetime of the present parliament and the question of renewal or otherwise is a political issue for decision by Ministers.24. Ministers will also need to reconsider the assurance given in the white paper of December 1960 that, taking one year with another, farmers should beleft with a share of the gain from increasing efficiency. This seriously inhibits the government&apos;s freedom of action in the Review. The Agricultural Departmentstake the view that it is inherently reasonable that the industry should have thisCONFIDENTIAL
assurance. They would see very great political difficulty in seeking to withdraw the assurance which, unlike the pledge on the percentages, was not limited to the lifetime of the present Parliament. Other Departments take the view that,nevertheless, withdrawal should be considered.The problem of the small farm business25. At successive Annual Reviews the need on social and political grounds to maintain the standard of living of low income farmers (less accurately described as small farmers) has resulted in the overpayment of other farmers. The small farmer Scheme (introduced in 1958) has diminished this pressure, but has noteliminated it. We have therefore given consideration to a major change in thepresent system which would make special payments to low income farmers, suchas the cost being deducted from guaranteed prices. The object would be thatthe Ministers should feel freer to reduce the level of the guarantees because theposition of most or all of the low income farmers would be protected by this specialdevice; and a subsidiary object would be to maintain incomes in particular regionsor areas where such farms are numerous.26. An example of this approach would be a payment related to the &quot; standardman days &quot; on each farm. (Standard man days is a conventional measure of the size of farm, closely related to its earning power under normal standards of management.) One would pay (say)  1 for each s.m.d. within the range of275-500 on any farm i.e., a maximum of  225 per farm and the total of thepayments would be of the order of  50 million per annum. No one under 275 s.m.d. who would in practice almost invariably be a part-time farmer would qualify,and the payments received by the larger farmers would be less than they lost onlower commodity prices. The range of farm sizes over which gains and losseswould balance would depend on the precise s.m.d. figures taken and those couldbe adjusted to produce quite a number of different effects. On the example given,the net gainers would be most of the full-time small farmers (except in NorthernIreland) and some of the medium ones. While such a scheme might be workablethe administrative cost would be considerable and the avoidance of fraud extremelydifficult. The Farmers&apos; Unions would be opposed to an income redistribution of this kind. There would be some conflict with policies for structural improvements to achieve greater efficiency, and to avoid this conflict it might be necessary torefuse payment to businesses of under 400 s.m.d.; but one could not go as high as400 without being unfair to many low income farmers who are nevertheless viable.27. The Agricultural Departments see better possibilities, although they wouldbe on a much smaller scale, for special measures in favour of hill farmers, and perhaps Northern Ireland farmers, so as to segregate them in some degree fromthe guarantee system, and divert their pressures. Some extension of the existingSmall Farmer Scheme could also be considered. But in the main the agricultural departments see most promise in the constructive, though admittedly slower acting,remedy of policies to encourage farm amalgamations, and the elimination of the smallest farms by absorption into others.28. The main advantage of the possible plans outlined above for sustainingthe small farm business, particularly of the major change which would be involved by paragraph 26, can be summarised thus: If any scheme of this sort could bemade to succeed in its object, which is to take care of the small farm businessproblem, and if this could be clearly demonstrated, Ministers would then be in a stronger position to decide the level of the guarantees in relation to their cost andthe best use of national resources. On the other hand payments would be madeeven to the largest farmers, and it would be very difficult to devise any schemewhich was not open to abuse. Ministers are asked to decide whether plans of this sort should be pursued.29. Graduated commodity payments. Applying to individual commoditiesthe same line of thought on special measures to help low income farmers,consideration has also been given to graduated commodity payments. In effectthese would provide bonuses on the first slice of individual output; and the bonuseswould be financed by reductions in the guaranteed prices. Such payments wouldbe practicable, though not easily managed, for cereals, sugar beet, milk and perhapspotatoes. They would not be practicable for cattle, sheep or pigs or for eggs. Inthe case of fatstock, deficiency payments are made to any persons presenting stock
for certification, and there are very substantial reasons for not insisting that thepayment must be made to the actual producer. For eggs and for fatstock too itwould be difficult to establish that a farmer presenting any particular produce wasin fact the grower of it. A further difficulty is that if the bonus payments were large they would create incentive to farmers to subdivide farm businesses or appearto do so.30. Graduated payments for cereals would not in themselves make muchimpact on the small farmer problem since cereals are among the least typical linesof output on small farms. For milk such payments would probably run counter to structural policy. For these reasons, and having regard to the impractibilityof graduated payments for fatstock and eggs, our conclusion is that this approach is unlikely to help much in dealing with the problem.Standard quantities31. We pointed out in (b) of paragraph 19 that the cost of the price guaranteealso depends in part on the quantity to which the guaranteed price applies. The1947 Act speaks of &quot; such part of the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural&apos;produceas in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom &quot;; andthe 1957 Act enables the guarantee for any commodity to be limited to a particularquantity of that commodity. This is the &quot; standard quantity &quot; concept, which hasalready been applied to milk, sugar-beet, potatoes and pigs, and most recentlyeggs. Different forms of standard quantity are used, but broadly the choice is between the &quot; conventional&quot; standard quantity arrangement and the &quot; flexible &quot;guarantee. Under the former, the guarantee is reduced proportionately asproduction exceeds the standard. Under the latter, a target level of production is set, and the guarantee is reduced when production rises above the target and increased when it falls below. The &quot; flexible &quot; guarantee can be made to bitemore sharply than the conventional standard quantity, by making the proportionate reductions in the guarantee larger than the corresponding increases in production. It can therefore be the more effective way of helping to restrainproduction and from this point of view the more likely to impress overseas suppliers. On the other hand, its aim of holding production around the target leveland the provision it accordingly makes for increasing the guarantee if productionfalls makes it easier to present to our own farmers as an equitable arrangement.We consider in Parts II and III below the possible application of this concept tocereals and fatstock, and discuss there the Exchequer implications.Level of market price32. The third factor affecting the cost of implementing the price guarantees((c) of paragraph 19) is the level of the market. This level, and therefore the size of the unit deficiency payment, is determined by the total quantity on offer inthe market, whether from home production or imports. In order to bring theExchequer bill fully under control some control is needed both of home productionand of imports. As regards imports we consider in Parts II and III whetherminimum import prices would be practicable, and negotiable with overseas suppliers, and what might be the consequences for our balance of payments. Thisdevice is specifically envisaged in our terms of reference; but we have also thoughtit appropriate to consider quantitative restriction and tariffs as possible alternativeways of regulating imports.Commodity proposals: the priorities33. We have given priority to proposals for cereals and fatstock because oftheir importance in terms of Exchequer liability and because apart from pigs, forwhich there is a &quot; flexible &quot; standard quantity arrangement these are (with wool)the only guaranteed commodities on which the Exchequer liability continues tobe completely open-ended.34. As regards the Exchequer bill, the cost of the price guarantees for cerealshas increased substantially since 1957-58. In that year it was about  52 million;by 1961-62 it was  74 million; and though in 1962-63 a drop to about 64 million is estimated, the estimate for 1963-64 is  84 million. There have been substantial fluctuations from year to year in the cost of the price guarantees for
fatstock; but in 1961-62 the figure was about  116 million compared with 84 million in 1957-58; for the current year the estimate is  107 million and for1963-64  128 million (the figures are set out in Appendix II).35. For other guaranteed commodities some measures towards containing the Exchequer liability have now been taken or, alternatively, are not neededbecause of the nature of the guarantee arrangements. As we have pointed outthe consumer bears the full cost of the guaranteed price for milk. He does so for sugar beet also. Apart from this, the guarantee for milk is limited to a standard quantity, and the guarantee for sugar beet to the produce from amaximum contract acreage. For potatoes the guaranteed price is a floor price and is limited to the quantity sold for human consumption. Imports of main crop potatoes are excluded so long as prices to consumers are reasonable.36. At this year&apos;s Annual Review features analogous to a standard quantitysystem have been introduced to the guarantee arrangements for eggs, with provision for an increase in Exchequer payments if imports rise above a leveltaken as normal in recent years (during which imports have been about 2 to 4 percent of total supplies). At this Review also the &quot; flexible &quot; guarantee arrangement for pigs has been strengthened so that larger reductions (or increases) in the guaranteed price can be made on the basis of the estimated marketings. it remains to be seen how far these changes in the guarantee arrangements for eggs and pigs will be effective in containing the Exchequer liability. The new schemefor eggs will be reviewed during the third year of its operation.Balance of payments37. The fourth assumption contained in the Ministerial directive(paragraph 1 (d)) was that Ministers would be &quot; willing at any rate to contemplatesome minimum measures to prevent some imported foods entering at unduly low prices&quot;.38. From the point of view of the balance of payments the first issue whicharises is that of the method of import control. Some methods, for example a simple fixed tariff or, in most cases, a variable levy applicable uniformly to allimports, are unlikely in themselves to impose any burden on our balance ofpayments: they work by imposing a tax which, broadly speaking, leaves thelanded import price unchanged, raises the price to consumers, and takes thedifference as revenue to the Exchequer. On the other hand, other forms of control,such as import quotas allocated to the various exporting countries, or the fixing of a minimum price below which imports will not be admitted, have in general theeffect of enabling exporters to obtain a higher price for their sales in the british market: they raise prices to the users, but the exporter, not the Exchequer, getsthe benefit. By their very nature, controls of the first type are likely to be moreobjectionable to our foreign suppliers than those of the second, and therefore moredifficult to negotiate. In the context of control of imports of cereals and of meatwe discuss both these types of control in the succeeding chapters.39. If it were decided, for reasons of practicability or negotiability, to adoptcontrols of the second type i.e., controls which inevitably impose an additional cost to our balance of payments the question of balance of payments cost inrelation to other benefit arises. There may be some cases where the introductionof control may place only a very small additional burden on the balance ofpayments, while permitting a much larger saving in the Exchequer cost of subsidies. This arises mainly where the exclusion of a small quantity of imports,or the fixing of a minimum price for them, would enable the market price for home production to be kept substantially higher than it otherwise would be.40. Some of the balance of payments cost on account of higher prices mightbe offset by the effect which higher market prices might have on the volume ofimports. Any reduction in imports on this account would be likely to be marginal,and would not significantly affect either the level of consumption of the public orthe prospects of exporters in our market.41. In addition, we should try to secure whatever advantages we could in international negotiations from our willingness to pay higher import prices.
Effects on the consumer42. Restrictions on imports designed to raise market prices in the UnitedKingdom must ipso facto affect the consumer (except where, in the short term, theeffect on prices may be absorbed). But the relation between the extra cost to theconsumer and the saving of Exchequer subsidy can differ greatly, according to theproportion which imports bear to home production. For instance, in the case ofwheat, where roughly half our supplies are imported and half home produced, a given rise in market prices will, on certain assumptions, cost consumers abouttwice as much as the Exchequer saves in subsidy; whereas for beef, of which about70 per cent is home produced, the saving of subsidy is relatively so much the largerpart. Whether, in addition to saving subsidy on home production, the Exchequeralso secures revenue from the imported supplies, will depend on the method of import control and /or other devices adopted, e.g., levy subsidies.43. Thus import restrictions primarily designed to &quot; close one of the openends &quot; of the Exchequer subsidy merge, as far as their effect on consumers isconcerned, with the broader question, which Ministers have also asked us toexamine, of whether the Exchequer subsidy should be in part transferred to theconsumer. But if this were regarded as an objective in itself, the scale and methodsused might well be different.44. There are broadly three ways in which the Exchequer subsidy could betransferred to the consumer:(i) By strictly enforcing minimum import prices or bilateral import quotasso as to raise the level of market prices in the United Kingdom up to,or towards, the level of the guaranteed prices to farmers thus makingdeficiency payments unnecessary, or at least, reducing them.(ii) By taxing imports by means either of a fixed tariff or a variable levy with the same objective,(hi) By imposing levies, both on imports and on home production, sufficientto cover all, or a determinate part, of the Exchequer subsidy to home production on the products concerned.45. In the case of method (i), the cost to the consumer must be greater thanthe saving of Exchequer subsidy by the amount of the increase in the market prices of the imported commodities, which would still be consumed. There wouldalso be a balance-of-payments burden, broadly equal to the increase in market prices multiplied by the quantity of imports, which in some circumstances couldbe heavy.46. Under method (ii), if the revenue obtained from imports were credited to subsidy purposes, the increase in prices to consumers need not be so great.Market prices would be raised only to such a level as would make the remainingdeficiency payments equal to the revenue from the tax on imports. There need be no balance-of-payments burden, but for that reason, our overseas supplierswould not like it.47. The net effect under method (iii) would be similar to method (ii). the yield of the tax would be equal to the cost of the subsidy.48. It should be noted, however, that if any of these methods of raising pricesleads to an increase in distributors&apos; margins, the cost to consumers will be further increased without off-setting benefit to the Exchequer.49. It is not easy to estimate closely the degree of increase in food prices which would be involved by these methods, partly because of this difficulty of estimating the change in distributors&apos; margins, which would mean that the risein retail prices was somewhat greater in absolute amount than the increase inthe wholesale market prices. To illustrate the orders of magnitude, the treasury have made rough calculations of the effect of shifting the whole of the cost of the deficiency payments ( 200 million in 1962-63) from the Exchequer to the consumer;and these are as follows:Increase in food pricesEffect on totalretail price index of (b)(a) (b)Wholesale        Retailfood prices by method (i)By method (ii)By method (iii)Per cent Per cent5-8 say 83-6 say 5Per cent2 -3l -2
50. Ministers, however, asked the Committee to consider the effects of transferring to the consumer part only of the present Exchequer cost. If onlyone-half or one-quarter of the present cost were to be shifted, the effect on thecost of living would thus be only one-half or one-quarter of that shown above.51. The Agricultural Departments consider with respect to the proposaldeveloped later in this report for cereals and fatstock, that the effect on the consumerwould be of the order of one-third of that shown in the preceding table, i.e., about 100 million on retail prices. It is difficult to be precise at this stage, but theAgricultural Departments have attempted to indicate the probable maximum effect,both on the consumer and the Exchequer. On this basis the total net savings ofthe Exchequer (including as a saving any additional Exchequer receipts fromlevies) would be about a maximum of  55 million, made up of three items. First,about  20 million would be the proceeds of a levy-subsidy on cereals, net of such payments as might have to be made to livestock producers to compensate themfor the higher prices of cereals bought as feedingstuffs. The second item wouldbe some  30 million of relief to the cost of deficiency payments on fatstock becausepf an assumed rise in price at wholesale of about 8 per cent on domestic meat,brought about by import restrictions. Lastly, there would be a possible saving of  5 million due to the operation of minimum prices for cereals.52. The cost to the consumer would be higher than this  55 million becauseof three further effects. First and most important, the consumer would bear higher prices for imported meat to the extent of perhaps  20 million. Secondly, therewould be a similar increase in respect of imported cereals amounting to perhaps 5 million- Third, distributive margins might increase by perhaps  15 million.The Agricultural Departments thus assume that the net cost to the consumerwould come out at about  95 million per annum, which would be just under 2 percent of present food prices.53. Thus by any use of the methods described in paragraph 44 the Exchequermight be relieved either wholly or in part of the liability for paying the presentsubsidies by raising food prices and the consumers&apos; cost of living. The moneyso saved would be available for the relief of other taxation, or for easing the impact of the change on those in receipt of various social service payments.Whether this kind of transfer would be desirable is a matter of taxation policywhich is outside the purview of this Committee.Commercial policy implications54. It has been our policy to work for the most liberal possible international trade arrangements generally as being in the interest of the most effective use ofOur own resources and in development of overseas supplies to meet our needs offood and raw materials on favourable terms. Even after the imposition of aprotective tariff in 1931, we maintained duty-free entry for all our food from theCommonwealth, and a good deal of that from foreign countries, and we gaveunrestricted entry to Commonwealth produce. Our desire after the war both toimprove our food supplies and to assist our balance of payments led to theexpansion of our agricultural industry, and this involved some departure from our traditional commercial policy. The two policies were reconciled by maintainingfreedom for imports while home production, which usually accounted for thesmaller part of our food consumption, was supported by Exchequer subsidies.55. Our present agricultural policy is, however, coming into conflictincreasingly with our overseas commercial policy, because it is resulting in a progressive increase in our home production at a greater rate than the rise in consumption, and therefore in a diminishing share of our market for our overseas suppliers, most of which are important markets for our exports. The problem isthe more acute as other countries subsidise or support their agricultural industrieswhile restricting imports so that the United Kingdom is the only major open market for agricultural products. Last year nearly a third of our total imports werefoodstuffs and one-eighth of our imports consisted of meat and cereals. If thispart of our import trade were to diminish, this is likely to affect the trading conditions for our exporters.56. While our overseas suppliers have become increasingly restive at theencroachment of subsidised domestic production on their share of our market,there have been few occasions for retaliation because we have been within our
international obligations. Our overseas suppliers are now seeking assurances thattheir share of our market will be maintained and for higher prices for the products which they send to us. For us now to seek to introduce variable import levies,minimum import prices or quantitative restrictions would clearly require negotiation.It would be important in such negotiations that anything which we did, by wayof quantitative restrictions or other devices, to raise the prices which overseas suppliers obtain in our market and which therefore mean increased cost to ourselvesshould be accepted by them as a concession for which they would have to payby way of appropriate improvements in the conditions for our exports to them.Whether they would be willing to do this,&apos; particularly if they had doubts about our ability to contain our home production (and therefore to enable them to retain their share of our market), is doubtful and could only be shown in negotiation.57. Conversely, in so far as any revision of the agricultural support systemseems likely to put a check on domestic production, farmers will press for a comparable check to be put on imports. Therefore we have had in mind that changes in policy should be capable of being presented both to our own farmers and to overseas suppliers as a reasonable &quot; package &quot;. It would not be in thenational interest to secure a reduction of the Exchequer bill for agricultural support if this could only be achieved at the cost of serious damage to our overseastrading relations and prospects.58. The issues cannot be postponed because the agricultural issues are centralto the United States approach to the Kennedy Round and we shall have to considerthe possibilities of commodity agreements which in some cases may amount tomanaged international and domestic markets.PART II.-CEREALS59. The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the subsidy on cereals is  83million in 1963-64. This compares with  53 million in 1958-59 and  64 million in1962-63. This increase in the subsidy has taken place in spite of three cuts in thewheat guaranteed price (from  28 Is. 8d. per ton to  26 10s. per ton) and of threecuts in the barley guaranteed price (from  29 per ton to  26 13s. 4d. per ton) duringthe last five years. There is, at present, no limit on the quantity of home growncereals which qualify for the full deficiency payment. As regards imported cereals,the International Wheat Agreement (see paragraph 74), of which we are members,sets a minimum price for wheat, but partly because of the level at which it is set, andpartly because of the method by which it is calculated, it has in fact never operated.As regards coarse grains there is no international agreement or minimum price. Forthese reasons, there is no effective control over the level to which prices of importedcereals may fall with a consequential depressing effect on market prices for homegrown cereals.Home production60. The total cereals acreage is now 7 - 9 million acres. This is an increase of400,000 acres since 1958-59 and is now back at about the acreage level of 1953. this total figure covers a wheat acreage which has been fairly stable; a steeply risingtrend in the barley acreage; a reducing oats acreage; and a small stable rye acreage.At the same time, yields, particularly of wheat and barley, have been rising steeply.Total production has risen from 8 - 3 million tons in 1958-59 to 11-3 million tons in1962-63. Most of this increase has been in barley where production has increasedby 2 - 6 million tons over the last five years as opposed to a reduction in oats, mixedcorn, and rye of about 0 - 5 million tons. But there has also been an increase of 0 - 9million tons in wheat production, which means that, owing to the technicallimitations on the amount of home grown soft wheat which can at present be usedfor milling into bread, some 50 per cent of United Kingdom wheat must now be sold for feed in competition with barley and imported maize.61. This rising trend in home production seems likely to continue with itsconsequential effect on the size of Exchequer bill, unless some check can beintroduced. Some control could be exercised through progressive reductions inguaranteed prices. But the cuts that we have already made have not yet resultedCONFIDENTIAL2389 c 2
in a reversal of the rising production trend. Moreover, for the reasons given in thefirst part of this report, there are political and practical limitations to the extent andspeed of any reductions that can be made.62. We think, therefore, that it is desirable to consider the adoption of some additional method of checking home production which would reinforce action onthe guaranteed price. The device which is most likely to do this is the introductionof some form of standard quantity arrangement for cereals. This (as already mentioned) has already been done in one form or another for a number of other commodities and is consistent with the principle incorporated in the 1947 Act ofproviding a guarantee &quot; for such part of the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as, in the national interest, it is desirable to produce in the UnitedKingdom&quot;. n63. Under the simplest form of &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangement the totalsubsidy payable is the difference between the average market price and the guaranteed price multiplied by the &quot; standard quantity &quot;. If production exceeds the standard quantity, the total deficiency payment has to be spread over the largertotal, and, in effect, the guaranteed price per unit is reduced in proportion to the excess of total production over the &quot; standard quantity &quot;. For example, if thestandard quantity has been set at 11 million tons and total production was 12 million tons, the guaranteed price would be in effect reduced by a twelfth. The knowledge that this would happen and experience when it did would be likely to have somedeterrent effect on production. Such an arrangement could also be worked on a&quot; standard acreage &quot; basis.64. It would also be possible to vary this arrangement by having a scale of guaranteed prices (or a scale on an alternative basis related to them) equated to different levels of production. There would be a normal production level to whichthe guaranteed price would apply; if production was above this norm the effectiveguaranteed price would be reduced by so much for each &quot;tranche&quot; of over-production; similarly if production was below the norm, the effective guaranteed price would be increased by so much for each &quot; tranche &quot; of under-production.Such a variation would permit the introduction of stronger disincentives to increasing production; tend to hold the total receipts of cereal producers stable;and has presentational advantages.65. We think that both methods are well worth further exploration. Inaddition, further consideration will need to be given to the level of the &quot; standard quantity&quot; and as to whether this should be applied globally to all cereals, or to individual cereals. These questions, although of great importance, need not delayconsideration of the principle of introducing some form of standard quantityarrangement for cereals, which we favour.66. This would deal with some of the risks to the Exchequer from increases in home production. But the Exchequer would still be at risk on low market prices which may result not only from the quantity and the pattern of marketing of home production but also from low import prices. In addition, the agricultural departments are convinced that in a commodity such as cereals, where we areimporting very large quantities, it would be impossible to get the agreement of the farmers (although this is not required under the Agriculture Acts) to introducing acheck on home production by means of a &quot; standard quantity &quot; device without at thesame time introducing some measure of control over imports. We have, therefore,considered what steps might be practicable on the &quot; open end &quot; of imports, and whatthe advantages and disadvantages of these steps are.Imports67. We import on average just under 10 million tons of cereals and cerealproducts, roughly 50 per cent of our total supplies in recent years. This compares with about 9 million tons five years ago. Just under half our present imports consistof wheat of which over 50 per cent is hard Canadian wheat necessary for making the type of bread we eat. Our remaining wheat imports come mainly from Australia,United States, Argentina, Russia and France and practically all are for themanufacture of flour. The other part of the 10 million tons of imports (about million tons) consists of coarse grains and cereal feeds of which the major part(about 3^ million tons) is maize, a large part of which comes from the United States.The rest consists of sorghums mostly from the United States, and barley, mostlyfrom Canada and Australia.
68. At present the United Kingdom is the one remaining free market lorcereals. There are no restrictions on access and only small tariffs on some of the cereals from non-Commonwealth sources. Most of the main exporting countries are unitary sellers through some kind of central organisation, or control exports in other ways, and the United Kingdom market is therefore subject to the pressuresresulting from their selling policies, which may vary not only from year to year, butalso from one part of the season to another, in accordance with changes in the pattern of world supply and demand. In addition, much of United Kingdomwheat imports and some of the other cereal imports are subsidised, or the product of subsidised production. In consequence fine United Kingdom market may at certain times, in certain years, and for certain cereals, experience price &quot; troughs &quot;considerably lower than the normal level of import prices. An example of thiswas the low imported barley prices in the first half of 1961 when the government felt it right to ask our main overseas suppliers to make voluntary arrangements(based on the threat of anti-dumping action) that barley should not come in belowa minimum price. Another example has been in this season when in the summer and early autumn of 1962 imported maize was freely available at low prices ( 18 to 19 per ton), and French wheat was on offer at a very low subsidised price (about 19 10s. per ton) as compared with more normal levels (see paragraphs 74-77).These two factors, coupled with the large home crops of wheat and barley and alate harvest, depressed home grown wheat and barley prices to very low levels atthe beginning of the season from which they have not yet fully recovered. Aconsiderable fall in import prices for a comparatively short period may producedisproportionate effects both on the level of home grown cereal prices and the time during which they are depressed.69. We have considered what action it might be possible, to take to prevent such situations arising. An increase of the present tariffs would not prevent suchfluctuations in import prices any more than present tariffs do. quantitative restrictions on imports, apart from the international difficulties which they would raise, would be very difficult in the case of cereals, since requirements of different types vary with the changing circumstances each year, and even during the courseof a season. It seems to us, therefore, that if it were considered desirable to take any action, the only method which would be likely to be effective would be to seta minimum level of import prices, and take steps to ensure that imports did not come in below these levels. This would mean putting a &quot; floor &quot; in the marketso as to prevent collapses in import prices with consequent repercussions on thehome grown cereals market (see paragraphs 74-77 below).70. This might be done either by prohibiting the entry of imports belowthese prices (a system which would in our view be open to abuse) or by imposing a levy on imports, varying in accordance with their price, so as to ensure that thegeneral level of import prices was not below these specified minimum levels. Ifsuch a levy were calculated on any difference between the lowest of the import prices and the minimum, and then applied equally to all imports (as is done in theE.E.C. system) it would be impossible for any individual country to avoid paying the levy even if its prices were above the minimum. This means that the proceeds of any levy charged would almost certainly go into our pockets, and there would,therefore, be no extra cost in foreign exchange. (This is on the assumption thatthe main cereal suppliers to the United Kingdom could not gang-up to raise prices,a possibility which cannot altogether be excluded but which might, even in the caseof cereals, be very difficult for them.)71. Such a levy would be contrary to various United Kingdom tariff bindingson cereals under GATT, and the preference and duty free arrangements under someof the bilateral agreements with Commonwealth and other countries. It wouldbe necessary to negotiate out of these obligations, and pay a price by way ofcompensation elsewhere, which might be heavy, and not easy to find. in commonwealth countries it might possibly in part take the form of reductions inUnited Kingdom industrial preferences with damage to export prospects. Sincesuch a levy would not only create a preference for competing home grown wheat,but would give overseas cereal suppliers no compensating benefit in price, such negotiations would probably prove very difficult.72. Some of these consequences might be avoided if the minimum importprice arrangement (described in paragraph 70 above) were altered so that whereany overseas cereal supplier undertook to make satisfactory arrangements to
observe the specified minimum import prices, no levy would be charged on cereal imports from that country. Since most of the main exporting cereal countries have either single selling agencies, or can exercise some control over exports, itshould not be very difficult for them to give such an undertaking. This wouldmean that the exporting country would get the benefit of any minimum price. TheMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is satisfied that such a scheme wouldbe practicable, and could be enforced, particularly if the co-operation of the mainexporting countries were to be obtained.73. Such an arrangement would, however, have a major disadvantage. Whileit would be more attractive to cereal exporting countries, and so make it easier and less costly to negotiate out of present tariff bindings, and preference and duty freeobligations, this very fact would mean that the United Kingdom would be incurringa potential liability to pay, at certain times,1 higher prices for cereal supplies than would otherwise be necessary. The magnitude of this potential liability would depend upon the level at which minimum import prices were set. We would certainlytake the view that if any action of this sort were to be taken, the minimum import prices should be set at such a level that they would only bite occasionally in conditions where the price of a particular type of cereal would otherwise have beenvery low.74. We have considered what sort of levels of prices would be likely to fulfilthese conditions while at the same time preventing the worst effects on market prices for home grown cereals. We took as our starting point the level of theminimum wheat price set under the International Wheat Agreement of which weare members. This is determined on the basis of Canadian Manitoba NorthernNo. 1 the highest quality wheat and works out at about  25 10s. per ton (c.i.f.the United Kingdom). The equivalent minimum price for European soft wheats the lowest quality imported and that most comparable to United Kingdomwheat is estimated to be at present about  19 to  20 per ton. This equivalentminimum is not, however, a firm figure, and varies from time to time in accordancewith changes in the relative values of different quality wheats. In the past it hasnot prevented imported wheat being sold here at about  18 per ton. Coarse grainsare not covered by the agreement and there are at present no international minimum prices applicable to them.75. These conditions have not strengthened home grown cereal prices in theUnited Kingdom market. Quite apart from price levels, no arrangement whichleaves coarse grains free can effectively strengthen wheat and barley prices since they are both profoundly influenced by the prices of imported maize, barley andsorghums. If minimum prices were determined for coarse grains related to thepresent International Wheat Agreement minimum for wheat, they would be about  18-  19 per ton. On the assumption that there were no excessive supplies of homegrown cereals, this might mean that home grown wheat and barley should notfetch less than about  16- 17 per ton exfarm. On past experience such price levelswould make hardly any impact since there have only been very rare occasions whenprices for either imports or home grown supplies have fallen so low.76. If such minimum price levels were considered to be too low because theywould have no significant effect on the deeper fluctuations of import prices, itwould seem necessary to consider raising the level of such minimum prices to alimited extent so that, while cutting off the lowest troughs in import prices, theminimum prices still only operated from time to time. An increase of up to  2 per ton would, in the view of the Agricultural Departments, achieve this objective.This would mean a minimum price level of about  21- 22 per ton for Europeansoft wheats, and of about  20- 21 per ton for coarse grains. Subject to the quantities of home grown cereals being marketed, this should, mean that homegrown wheat and barley should not fetch less than about  18 to  19 per ton,exfarm, and this should help to improve the average price over the year.77. On the basis of such minimum price levels the potential liability whichmight be incurred on the cost of imported cereal supplies through higher prices should not be very great, although a lot would depend on the future course of world prices. From past experience it does not seem likely to amount to morethan about  5 million in any one year (on top of the present cereals import bill of 220 million) which might be offset by a slightly smaller volume of imports ifhigher prices were to cause some reduction in demand. It is extremely difficult tomake any reliable calculation on the degree of relief that a minimum import price
scheme might give to the Exchequer. The reason is that home grown cereals prices are determined not only by the influence of prices of competitive imported cerealsbut also by the quantity, quality, and pattern of marketing of the home crops inrelation to imported cereals. All that it is possible to say with any certainty isthat a minimum import price scheme for imported cereals should help to firm upprices for home grown cereals, but the Agricultural Departments believe on thebasis of past experience that the Exchequer saving per annum would be roughlycomparable to the extra cost of imports, i.e., about  5 million.78. There would seem to be three possible courses of action on minimum import prices, namely:(i) to rely solely on the minimum wheat prices at their present levels underthe International Wheat Agreement, without seeking to take anycorresponding action on minimum import prices for coarse grains; or(ii) to rely, in the case of imported wheat, on the minimum prices at theirpresent levels under the International Wheat Agreement, but to seek to secure minimum import prices for coarse grains related to these levels,preferably through an international agreement; or v(iii) to seek to raise the level of minimum wheat prices under the international wheat Agreement by up to  2 per ton, and to secure minimum import prices for coarse grains related to the higher minimum wheat price levels, preferably through an international agreement.79. In considering these alternatives Ministers will wish to bear in mind the domestic objective of providing, for the benefit of the Exchequer, some protection of home-grown cereal market prices from the effects of overseas supplies at prices well below normal levels; the importance which the farmers will attach to matching the introduction of standard quantities for home production with reasonable protection from the effects of very low-priced imports; and lastly the potential extra cost of cereal imports which might result from a higher level of minimum import prices with a consequential very small increase in food costs.Before reaching any conclusions Ministers will also wish to consider some of the wider international considerations which have been considered by the GATTPolicy Committee and are dealt with in paragraphs 88 to 99.Transferring the cost of the Exchequer cereals bill to the consumer80. In the earlier paragraphs of this section of our report we have been discussing possible means of containing increases in home cereals production, and increases in the Exchequer subsidy on cereals. Neither of the methods we thinkmost suitable for this purpose namely a &quot; standard quantity device&quot;, and aminimum import price scheme, is however likely to achieve much actual reductionin the current Exchequer cereals bill which over the last three years has averaged 70 million. We now turn, therefore, to considering whether, if Ministers thoughta bill of this size too high for the Exchequer to bear, all or part of it could betransferred to the consumer.81. This does of course raise important political and economic questionswhich are dealt with in the first part of this report. One of these general considerations is that food costs would be raised. The extent of this in the caseof cereals would depend on the method adopted and we deal with this inparagraph 86. In the case of feedingstuffs, however, there is one general argument in favour of livestock producers bearing a part of the Exchequer cereals bill throughhigher prices. The Agricultural Departments think that at present there is awasteful use of feedingstuffs. If they were more expensive, this might makelivestock producers more economical in their methods. This could provide a useful check on overproduction of milk, eggs and pigs by cutting out uneconomicalmarginal production and reducing to some extent our large and increasing importbill for coarse grains, particularly maize. This would, however, only happen iflivestock producers were not compensated for any rise in the price of feedingstuffsby an increase in the guaranteed prices for livestock products, for which no doubt the National Farmers&apos; Union would press.82. One possible method of transferring the cost to the consumer would beby increased tariffs which would tend to raise prices. This would mean having tonegotiate out of present tariff bindings, and duty free obligations. On the otherhand, a tariff is not normally variable at frequent intervals, and might for this
reason have more appeal to exporting countries than a variable import levy,particularly if the increased tariff were bound. But a fixed tariff would not be certain to transfer the whole cost of the Exchequer bill to the consumer since prices would still fluctuate.83. It would also be possible to transfer the cost to the consumer by means ofa variable import levy applied to all imported cereals so as to raise market pricessufficiently high to enable the cereal grower to get all or most of his return fromthe market (with only a limited subsidy in reserve). This is the principle of theE.E.C. system. But (and this applies also to tariffs and minimum import prices),it would not be possible, unless this were accompanied by an intervention system,to be certain of the extent to which market prices for home grown cereals would beraised. Moreover, it would still involve us, in negotiating tariff bindings, preferencesand duty free entry, with exporting countries who would be hostile to a system which created an additional preference for home grown cereals, and which isalready subject to attack in the E.E.C. We are advised by the GATT PolicyCommittee that, from the international point of view such a system would not benegotiable for the United Kingdom with its many international commitments.84. Another method of transferring all or part of the burden to the consumerwould be by means of a levy subsidy. Under such an arrangement a levy (normallya fiat-rate determined for a year or at any rate for a long period ahead) would bemade on all imported and all home grown cereals, and all the proceeds of such alevy would then be used to subsidise the home cereals crop. The levy would be incorporated (to the extent that it was not absorbed by the processors) in the pricesof cereals as they passed on into trade, and so would be borne by the ultimateconsumers. A levy of  3 per ton (which should probably be imposed graduallyover a period of say three years) would produce about  60 million which, if thetotal subsidy bill could be reduced somewhat, would cover all, or most of it. Itwould, of course, entail setting up an administrative machine to collect the levy on home grown cereals as well as collecting a levy on imports through the Customsbut this should not be unduly difficult or costly. The number of imported cerealproducts on which it was necessary to charge a levy might give rise to some difficulties, but it is thought that it would be possible to limit the size of theproblem by charging the levy only on imported cereal products that have a highcereal content and are genuinely competitive with home cereal products.85. Such a levy would be in the nature of a non-discriminating internal tax(or revenue duty) on both imported and home-grown cereals. For this reason, itwould be technically admissible under the GATT and the United Kingdom wouldnot be obliged to negotiate out of tariff bindings on cereals. We would also try to argue that there was no breach of our obligations on duty-free, entry under our trade agreements with countries in the Commonwealth.86. The principle of a levy-subsidy is not new. It was operated in theUnited Kingdom before the war for wheat without any major difficulties. It isin operation now for sugar. It is too a preferable method of transferring theburden of the subsidy to consumers as it would not raise costs to the same extent as an increased tariff or a variable import levy. It is estimated that if the fullsubsidy were transferred by a levy-subsidy this would not increase the price ofthe loaf (now Is. O^d.) by more than  d.; the increase under either of the other methods might be twice this amount. Feedingstuffs costs would also go up byabout twice as much under the other two methods. Moreover if, under aa levy-subsidy, livestock producers were expected to bear the increased cost offeedingstuffs, there would be a built-in check to the National Farmers&apos; Unionpressing for higher guaranteed prices for cereals.87. For all these reasons we think that if Ministers should consider itdesirable to transfer all or a large part of the Exchequer bill on cereals to theconsumer, the best method of doing so would be by means of a levy-subsidy.International considerations-views of the GATT Policy Committee88. The GATT Policy Committee have considered the internationalimplications of the possible action considered in this part of the Report, namely:(i) the introduction of(a) a &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangement to check increases in domesticcereals production; and
(b) a minimum import price scheme to put a low &quot;floor&quot; to pricesof imported cereals;with the possible addition of(ii) a levy subsidy for all cereals which would transfer all or part of the cerealsubsidy bill from the Exchequer to the consumer.89. It is considered that a &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangement would not raise any international problems, and if it pould be shown to be effective as a means of containing increases in home production, it should prove a positive advantage in international negotiations. It would, therefore, be preferable to avoid committing ourselves firmly and publicly to such an arrangement domesticallybefore it had been possible to use its benefit internationally as part of anycomprehensive proposals for cereals.90. A minimum import price scheme for all cereals could be attractive tothe main cereal exporting countries, particularly if the level of the minimum pricesprevented the bottom falling out of the market and represented some improvement on the present position. It would be applied unilaterally, or on alimited multilateral basis in consultation with our principal suppliers. But thefact that there is already in existence an International Wheat Agreement (ofwhich we are members) which embodies the principle of minimum prices, wouldmake it undesirable to adopt a limited approach before the whole question hadbeen discussed in the wider international context. Moreover in the circumstancesof post-Brussels, and in the context of the Kennedy Round discussions, there islikely to be very great pressure from exporting countries, particularly from australia, the United States and Canada and for some more satisfactory arrangements for world trading in cereals, both wheat and coarse grains,preferably in the form of international commodity agreements. This pressure maybe impossible to resist at least not without damage to our prospects for industrial exports, particularly in Australia, Canada and the United States whichare our biggest industrial markets. Some kind of minimum price arrangement might help to satisfy the main cereal exporting countries; secure us somecompensating benefits in the Kennedy Round or in some other negotiating forum;as well as satisfying the domestic objective of putting a floor in the UnitedKingdom market.91. For these reasons it would clearly be better to negotiate at any rate inthe first instance in the context of the general international discussions whichare likely to arise out of the GATT and of the Kennedy Round. We are in anycase likely to find ourselves faced with this whole problem by exporting countriesin the context of the agricultural aspects of the Kennedy Round on which the americans are very insistent and of the general pressure for international commodity agreements. If we tried and failed to secure agreement in this forum,it would then be necessary to consider what would be the balance of advantage in some more limited arrangement with our principal suppliers.92. Such international commodity discussions will of course have to coverquestions of access as well as price. There is at present no restriction of accessinto our market, the main complaint from exporting countries being that ourincreasing home production is tending to reduce the room for imports. It is here that the proposal to introduce some form of standard quantity for our home production should help, and prove a valuable bargaining counter in any international discussions if it can be shown that it would be an efficient method ofcontaining home production. Indeed if we are prepared to introduce such ameasure we should press strongly that similar measures should be adopted byother countries, whether exporting or importing, which are financially assistingdomestic cereal growing by one means or another.93. Another method of bringing pressure to bear on domestic policies which&quot; are encouraging uneconomic over-production is through the system of&quot; confrontation&quot; of individual countries. It seems likely that international agreement could be obtained to some fairly stringent provisions for a&quot; confrontation &quot; policy and that even the United States and the E.E.C. wouldbe prepared to submit to such examination on their domestic policies. We thinkthat the United Kingdom should certainly be prepared to accept such a proposal.
94. Apart from such measures to assist access, there will no doubt be pressure from exporting countries for other measures such as the fixing of guaranteed import quotas; or the binding of levies or of the maximum level of support or guaranteed prices. It seems likely that such measures would be strongly resisted by other countries, particularly the E.E.C., and in any eventsome, such as import quotas, would be contrary to United Kingdom interestswhile others, such as the binding of the level of support or guaranteed prices, wouldbe contrary to the Agriculture Acts.95. It would seem therefore that the sort of package which might emerge from any international commodity discussions on cereals might well be someeffective minimum import price system; confrontation of individual countries on domestic policies; and standard quantities to contain production. It may alsobe proposed to add some method of financing surplus disposal for the benefit ofthe underdeveloped countries. If such a package was not negotiable in the formof a strengthened International Wheat Agreement, and a new International coarse grains Agreement, then it might be possible and desirable to make similar arrangements on a more limited basis with our principal suppliers.96. Although a levy, under a levy-subsidy scheme, would not be technicallycontrary to GATT or inconsistent with our obligations under some of our bilateral agreements, this does not mean that exporting countries might not express disquietabout its possible effect. They could argue that they might have to bear part ofthe levy through accepting lower prices, although, since most of the main cerealexporting countries are strong unitary sellers, they should be able to resist any suchpressure. They could also argue that higher prices to the consumer might cutconsumption and so affect them detrimentally. It seems unlikely, however, that alevy of up to  3 per ton would have a significant effect on prices. There mightbe some decline in the off-take of wheat for human consumption in all its various forms, but this is likely to be only marginal. Similarly, demand for feedingstuffsmight be affected if livestock producers were not compensated by increases in theprices of their products, but here too, if the levy were introduced gradually, thereshould not be a very large reduction in demand.97. In spite of such possible criticisms it is considered that a levy-subsidy should not, of itself, cause any significant problems for exporting countries, or,particularly if it formed part of comprehensive proposals, lead to international difficulties.98. In general the GATT Policy Committee thinks that proposals embodyingsome standard quantity arrangement coupled with a minimum import price scheme(together, if so desired, with a levy-subsidy) should be negotiable internationally(even though some aspects of them may contravene our existing international obligations), provided that they are dealt with as a single package. The Committeeattaches great importance to this proviso. Our suppliers would have to be convincedthat the package included an effective method of containing domestic cerealsproduction, of maintaining access for imports to our domestic market, and of preventing import prices falling too low to their detriment. Moreover, if negotiated at any rate in the first instance in an international forum in the context of theprobable pressures for the introduction or strengthening of international commodity agreements, our willingness to co-operate in ways which could be beneficial toexporting countries, should also prove of advantage. In such circumstances itseems improbable that we should be obliged to pay any compensation (beyondthe additional cost of imports) for being relieved of our tariff bindings, andpreference and duty free obligations. Indeed if our intentions are deemed to be good, and our methods thought to be efficacious, such proposals should, at thevery least, create a more favourable atmosphere for forthcoming commercialdiscussions, and should be of sufficient value to be weighed in the scales on our side in assessing our offers in the Kennedy Round, even if it were not possible tosecure any specific concessions in direct return.99. Ministers will wish to consider in the light of the probable pressures for international cereals agreements in the context of the GATT discussions in Maywhat attitude the United Kingdom should adopt, having regard to the assessment of the negotiability of these proposals made by the GATT Policy Committee; andthe extent to Which they would be consistent with United Kingdom interests inthe light of the desired objectives on domestic cereals policy, and of the potentialincreased cost of imported cereals supplies through higher minimum prices.
Conclusions100. We are not able to make agreed recommendations on this part of our report but we have reached certain unanimous conclusions which are set out in thisparagraph.(a) In the first place we are agreed that a &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangement,as a re-enforcement to such action on guaranteed prices as Ministersthink desirable, is within the limits of the Agriculture Acts the best method open to us of containing home cereals production.(b) Secondly, we are unanimous in thinking that if Ministers decide thatsome action should be taken to prevent low-priced imports, the only practicable method would be a minimum import price scheme. But thiswould have to be negotiated with our main suppliers and if this proved impossible Ministers should review the position.(c) Thirdly, we are agreed that if Ministers consider that it is desirableto transfer all, or a large part, of the Exchequer cereals bill to theconsumer, a levy subsidy is the best way to do this.101. In the light of these general conclusions and of the advice given bythe GATT Policy Committee (paragraphs 88-99) the Agricultural Departmentsrecommend to Ministers the following comprehensive proposals which they believe would be acceptable domestically and negotiable internationally.(i) As a means of containing increases in domestic cereals production andin the size of the subsidy for cereals, we should introduce(a) a &quot; standard quantity &quot; arrangement covering all cereals togetherwith(b) a &quot; minimum import price scheme &quot; covering all cereals.The Agricultural Departments consider that these two proposals arecomplementary to each other. Furthermore, if farmers are to beexpected to accept containment of home cereals production through a standard quantity arrangement so as to bring the Exchequer bill under control, it is essential that there should also be some control overimport prices. In their view both elements are necessary to make sucha &quot; package &quot; acceptable at home. Moreover, they believe that thiswould also make the &quot; package&quot; more acceptable-and so morenegotiable internationally where there has long been pressure fromthe main cereal exporting countries for new or strengthenedinternational cereals agreements incorporating improved minimum price arrangements as well as provisions relating to access. TheAgricultural Departments consider that the small additional potentialliability on the cost of cereal imports would be a price well worthpaying for these advantages.(ij) If Ministers wish to secure a significant reduction (as opposed to only acontainment) of the Exchequer bill for cereals, we should, in additionto the proposals under (i), introduce a levy subsidy scheme for allcereals. Such a scheme would also have certain incidental advantagessince, if livestock producers were expected to bear any increasedfeedingstuffs costs, this would help to reduce the present uneconomicuse of feed and to restrain National Farmers&apos; Union pressure for highguaranteed prices for cereals.(hi) These proposals should be presented and discussed both domestically, andinternationally, as one &quot; package &quot; since the elements are closely inter-related and balance each other.(iv) The United Kingdom should be willing to co-operate in the formulation of strengthened or new international commodity agreements on wheat and coarse grains containing effective minimum import price arrange-ments at reasonable levels somewhat higher than the present minimum price for wheat under the International Wheat Agreement; standard quantity arrangements to contain production in countries providingfinancial assistance to domestic cereals production; and confrontationof individual countries on their domestic cereals policies. It might alsobe necessary to consider some limited arrangements for financingsurplus disposal.
(v) If general international agreements on these lines do not seem likely tobe negotiable, the United Kingdom should endeavour to make similar arrangements on a more limited basis with our main overseas cerealssuppliers, in particular, the United States, Australia and Canada; andif necessary, the United Kingdom should be prepared to actunilaterally.(vi) These proposals should be discussed on a confidential basis on the domestic front with the National Farmers&apos; Union and any other trade associations concerned, and on the international front with theCommonwealth. representatives in May, and subsequently in the context of the Kennedy Round discussions and the probablysubsequent meeting of the GATT cereals group. This internationalforum appears to be the best for seeking the maximum compensatingadvantages in return for the benefits which these proposals would confer upon exporting countries.102.  The Treasury and the Board of Trade:(i) Recommend that attention should be concentrated primarily on measures,including the vigorous application of the standard quantity principle,designed to check the expansion of home production of cereals. TheTreasury regard such measures as the key both to the reduction of support and to improved relations with our overseas suppliers. Theythink that decisions about such measures should not wait upon the outcome of international negotiations.(ii) Think that the presentational advantage, even to farmers, claimed forlinking &quot; floor &quot; prices for imports with the introduction of &quot; standard quantities&quot;, is exaggerated. As long as guaranteed prices continue,even if these are qualified by the operation of &quot; standard quantities&quot;,cereal growers can suffer no damage from cheap imports, and livestockproducers benefit from them. If the benefit of cheaper feed is removed by an act of Government policy, it may be more, not less difficult to persuade farmers to accept measures designed to check the presentover-production of livestock.(iii) Recognise that the introduction of effective floor prices for wheat andcoarse grains in the United Kingdom market may be demanded inforthcoming negotiations by some of our overseas suppliers. Theythink, however, that in judging, when the time comes in these negotiations, whether this concession should be made, Ministers willheed to weigh closely the risk to our balance of payments, both now and in the future, against any advantages which may be thus obtainableeither from our overseas suppliers or in securing greater stability forthe Exchequer subsidy.(iv) Consider that, if Ministers wish to make transference of the exchequer cost to the consumers an object of policy, the implication of transferringthis cost in the case of cereals would have to be considered in the context of whatever methods of transfer might be proposed for other commodities.PART III.-FATSTOCK103. As will be seen from the table in Appendix III, there has been a veryconsiderable increase during the past few years in home production of meat ofall kinds. There has been a notable rise in beef production, stimulated by higher price guarantees. Poultry production, not supported by price guarantees, hasexpanded very rapidly. The result is that although there has been very little change in the level of meat imports overall, the increase in the total supply of meat of all types has created a very competitive situation which has tended to depress prices generally. Moreover, the market has become disproportionatelysensitive to comparatively small fluctuations in the seasonal! offerings, in the market,whether from home or overseas supplies, and has experienced marked price fallsfrom which recovery has been slow. As a consequence the deficiency paymentshave increased very substantially and sharply in recent years.
104. In these circumstances, it is important that policy should be directed towards securing that the production of all types fatstock should be contained atsomething like the present levels, and somewhat lower in the case of pigs. this may well require reductions in the guaranteed prices apart from the changes insystem dealt with in the following paragraphs.105.  It is against this background that we have considered:(i) the need for changes in the present guarantee system to increase the impact of the market on producers;(ii) the possibility of introducing standard quantities for fatstock;(iii) import control.Guarantee system106. The present guarantee system for fatstock does not give farmers asufficient incentive to study the market either when making long-term productionplans or in the actual marketing of their stock. This often means that farmersdo not sell their stock to the best advantage, so far as the market is concerned.107. There are various ways in which the scheme could be amended. the simplest would be to have a uniform rate of deficiency payment over the year,calculated in arrear. This would be consistent with the Agriculture Acts. It mighthave wide repercussions on the organisation and economy of livestock and dairyfarms. Moreover, since the final rate could not be calculated until the end of theyear, it would be necessary to make advance payments to producers as they soldtheir stock in the course of the year, with a final payment at the end of the year.This would give rise to serious practical difficulties.108. These practical difficulties could be overcome if the rate of subsidy were determined in advance; and this would be consistent with the Agriculture Actsif the rate of subsidy were based on a genuinely objective estimate of what theaverage market price was likely to be over the year. But estimates of market prices for fatstock are notoriously unreliable, and such a system could lead to grossunder or over-payments to producers unless it was practicable to introduce somebalancing adjustments into the system.109. We are in favour of amending the guarantee system in order to increasethe influence of the market on farmers&apos; decisions. We think that this would helpin securing steadier market prices which would tend to reduce Exchequer liability;and that it would also help in discussion with overseas suppliers who sometimescomplain that the present arrangements upset the market to their disadvantage.110. The Farmers&apos; Unions were informed in the course of this year&apos;s annual review that changes in the system are necessary. The precise form in which these changes might best be made needs to be studied with farmers and various experts.The present arrangements for calculating the guarantee payments, for paymentsevery week, and for varying the guaranteed price itself seasonally throughout theyear, are among the factors that need to be reviewed. Without at this stagewishing to suggest the precise ways in which the present system might be modified,the Ministry of Agriculture consider that changes can be made, consistent withthe Agriculture Act, which will have the desired effect of making farmers pay more regard to the market. The results of this study will also need to take intoaccount any views which the Verdon-Smith Committee may express on the operationof the guarantee arrangements. This Committee, which is expected to report inthe autumn of 1963, was appointed to consider fatstock and meat marketingproblems, and it may indeed make recommendations affecting the fatstockguarantees which go wider than the sort of changes just mentioned.111. It is difficult at this time to put forward detailed proposals for a workablerevision of the existing guarantee scheme. Ministers are recommended to instruct the Agricultural Departments to work out a revised scheme which would be assimple and direct as possible and have the desired effect of requiring the farmer,in his own interest, to adjust his marketing to the state of the market; to. discuss their proposals with the Farmers&apos; Unions; and then report back to Ministers. Itwould be for Ministers to decide at that stage whether it was necessary to postponedecisions until the recommendations of the Verdon-Smith Committee had beenreceived.
Standard quantities112. As noted in Part I there is already an arrangement (the &quot;flexibleguarantee &quot;) whereby the guaranteed price for pigs is varied automatically accordingto the estimated number of pigs to be marketed. We think that this is capableof being made as effective an instrument as can be devised for pigs and we have considered whether it or any other form of standard quantity arrangement couldbe applied to cattle and sheep.113.  A standard quantity arrangement can take one of three main forms:(i) If production exceeds the standard quantity, no guarantee payment ismade on the excess. In practice, this means that the guarantee payment on the total volume of production is reduced in proportion to the excess.Hereafter this arrangement will be referred to as the conventionalstandard quantity;(ii) If production exceeds the standard quantity, the guaranteed price onthe whole is reduced by predetermined amounts depending on the size of the excess. For example, if the excess was 2 per cent the guaranteed price might be reduced by, say, Is., if 4 per cent by 2s. 6d., if 6 per cent by 5s., and so on;(iii) A variant of (ii) in which the price steps are applied both ways, i.e., theprice is reduced in predetermined steps if there is excess production,and increased similarly if there is a shortfall. (This is, in fact, one ofthe main elements in the &quot; flexible guarantee &quot; for pigs.)114. Each of these three arrangements can be operated on the basis of theactual volume of production in a current or past period, or it can be operated onthe basis of a forward estimate of production. If the basis is actual production inthe current year, the final rate of guarantee cannot be calculated until the endof the year, in which case an advance and final payment of subsidy would have tobe made to producers.115. There is an advantage in operating on the basis of an estimate ofproduction, if one can be made with sufficient accuracy. It enables changes inthe guarantee to reflect current trends in production and it consequently has amore immediate impact on the level of production than a standard quantity basedon past performance. Moreover, there is no need to withhold final payment of subsidy to the end of the year. There is also advantage in operating on the basisof a predetermined scale, as described in (ii) above, since, provided that the stepson the scale are steep enough, it is more effective in containing Exchequer liability in the event of over-production. The two-way variation (type (iii) above), because it provides for an increase in the guaranteed price if marketings are less than thestandard quantity, is easier to defend to farmers as a means of stabilising home production; but this entails an extra liability for the Exchequer not present in(i) or (ii).116. The flexible guarantee arrangement now applying to pigs provides foradjustments of the guaranteed price in both directions as production rises aboveor falls short of the standard quantity, and operates on forward estimates. Thedifficulties of forecasting marketings for cattle and sheep are however very muchgreater than for pigs, because the statistical data are less satisfactory and becausethe weather can have a very considerable and unpredictable effect on productionand marketings in any year. If the forecast, even if it purported to be framed ona normal year rather than an actual year basis, were in the event to be seen todiffer significantly from actual marketings, the system could easily fall into disrepute.Because we see no present prospect that sufficiently reliable forecasts can beproduced, we have concluded that it is not practicable to base a standard quantity for cattle and sheep on a forecast of marketings.117. An alternative which would have some of the advantages of a forecastwould be to base the standard quantity for cattle and sheep on population figuresinstead of marketings. In the case of sheep, for example, the sheep-breeding flockmight be taken as the base. In the case of cattle, it would be more difficult tofind a suitable base, because the population figures do not adequately distinguish between cattle destined for milk and beef production. It might, however, bepossible to select population figures which would indicate broad trends in productionand thus provide defensible bases for standard quantity calculations, even though in individual years actual marketings might appear to show a different trend.
Such a scheme might come in for a good deal of criticism in a year in which thetrends appeared to diverge, the more so if there were fairly heavy penalties orrewards for deviations from the standard quantities. There is also some doubt whether a scheme based on population figures would be strictly within the agriculture Acts. Nevertheless, we do not feel able at this stage to rule out thepossibility of an effective scheme being prepared on this basis.118. Even if we cannot work on forward estimates or population figures,we consider that standard quantity arrangements with the other feature of the pig &quot; flexible guarantee &quot;-graduated price steps-can be made for cattle and sheep. What form these would take would largely depend on the form of theother changes made in the guarantee arrangements. If these were in any case to necessitate advance and final payments, the final payment could take into accountany adjustment to the guaranteed price made on a fixed scale in the light of theactual number of marketings in the year. Alternatively, if there were to be nosecond payment, adjustments might be made in the guaranteed price at intervalsthroughout the year to take account of increases or decreases in marketings duringthe previous 12 months, using the rolling average technique of calculation. Suchan arrangement would have the advantage of reflecting current trends somewhatsooner: but it also has the disadvantage that anomalies might occur from timeto time because the pattern of marketing in the previous year, which might on occasion be seriously distorted by the nature of the season, would partly determine the rate of guarantee currently payable.119. A standard quantity arrangement does not safeguard the Exchequeragainst having to pay a high rate of subsidy on the standard quantity if the market price is reduced as a result of excessive production. Moreover, the level of thecentral band and the size of the graduated price steps are of crucial importance.Nevertheless, we are in favour of a standard quantity arrangement for cattle and sheep. We recommend that Ministers should direct the Agricultural departments to work out suitable arrangements for standard quantities for cattle and sheep,taking account of their proposals for the revision of the guarantee arrangements.Control of imports120. The meat market has not in the past been greatly affected by excessivesupplies of low priced imports. Nevertheless, recent experience has shown that,with the market amply supplied (partly as a result of the encouragement given to home production), comparatively small irregularities in the marketing of importscan have disproportionately disturbing effects on prices in the home market.Moreover, there are grounds for expecting that more imports, both from new and old suppliers, may seek a market in Britain and, even without a further increasein home production, would tend to depress British market prices. In any case,unless imports are controlled, it will in the view of the Agricultural Departmentsbe out of the question for the Government to carry the farming industry in measures affecting home production.121. Control over imports can be exercised in two broad ways namely, byoperating on prices or on quantities. In general, control through the pricemechanism is preferable because it permits a degree of flexibility that is less easy to secure with quantity control. It does not, however, appear to be practicable in present circumstances to regulate meat imports through the price mechanism,for the reasons explained in the following paragraphs.122. We have considered the possibility of fixing minimum import prices orimposing variable levies designed to maintain the price of imports approximatelyat a given level. Both these devices are open to the objection that in times of surplus they throw the main burden of supply regulation on to imports. If themarket price at home drops below the minimum import price (e.g., throughexcessive home production) the effect may well be that imported meat becomesvirtually unsaleable until the price has risen again. Since meat is a perishablecommodity and since the majority of imports come from distant sources, it wouldbe impossible to carry on trade on this basis.123. Even if this difficulty could be overcome (e.g., through some organisa-tion which would take excessive home supplies off the market), there still remain anumber of practical difficulties. Because of the great variety of meats (chilled,frozen, bone-in, bone-out, whole carcases, sides, cuts, joints, processed in various
forms, and so on), a great variety of minimum import prices or levies would be needed, all properly related one to the other. Some of these would also have to besubject to seasonal variation.124. The structure of the import trade leads to further difficulties. A fixedminimum import price would be impossible to maintain because of the degree ofvertical integration in the import trade. Many concerns operate over the wholeprocess of distribution, buying stock from the producer in Commonwealth countries and the Argentine and retaining ownership until the meat is eventually sold bywholesale or even retail in this country. In these circumstances it is impossible toknow at what price the meat is actually imported. Meat is also sold on consignmentfor what it will fetch, and again control over the import price could not be effective.This difficulty could only be overcome by a complete change in the organisation ofthe trade, e.g., by the centralisation of selling through meat export boards or thecreation of a meat import authority in this country.125. At best, a variable levy scheme could only control import prices in a rough and ready way. Again because meat is perishable, traders would from timeto time be forced to sell meat for what it would fetch if they or the exporters onwhose behalf they were selling had to bear part or all of the levy themselves. the levy would be the more effective as a price regulating instrument the more often therate could be changed. Frequent changes would however create great difficulties for importers who draw supplies from a distance.126. For all these reasons, we have concluded that it is not possible to controlmeat imports by means of a minimum import price or variable levy. Quantitativerestriction on the other hand is technically practicable and, although it would not initself give the assurance that any particular price level would be maintained, it would reduce fluctuations in the market price in so far as they arise from imports. Indeed,the mere fact that restrictions were operating even without a reduction in quantitieswould tend to firm the market.127. We have considered whether something less than a comprehensive system of quantitative restriction would be sufficient to deal with temporarysurpluses of imports, such as the increase in Argentine beef at the beginning of thisyear. The suggestion would be that a limitation (or a complete ban) might be imposed on imports when there was an indication that the market was becomingover-supplied. The difficulty about this is that it is almost impossible to foresee suchcrises in advance. Even if action were taken immediately the market was disturbed,it would be contrary to all international practice to apply a ban on cargoes actuallyaboard ship or contracted for. Because most meat imports come from long distancesthis would mean that it would be 4-6 weeks or more before a ban could be effective.Moreover, any such a ban could not discriminate as between one supplier andanother and this would cause great disgruntlement to suppliers who had not increased their quantities and consequently were not responsible for the difficultieson the market.128. We have come to the conclusion that this would not be a satisfactory way of controlling imports. There could hardly be anything more disturbing totrade than a frequent&quot; off-on &quot; arrangement. Moreover, it cannot be assumed thatin the future all weaknesses of the meat market due to imports will be of shortduration. On the other hand, if a system of quantitative restriction was in force,such short-term weaknesses would be rather less likely to occur.129. The only practicable way of regulating imports of meat seems to be through a comprehensive system of quantitative restrictions by country quotas.Such restrictions are, however, open to considerable difficulties.(i) They tend to freeze the pattern of marketing.(ii) They conflict with our international obligations, such as our obligations under bilateral agreements, particularly with Australia and NewZealand, and our general obligations under GATT. The meatagreements with Australia and New Zealand, negotiated in 1952, extend to 1967 and contain no break clause. They provide for the admissionof meat without restriction of quantity. Our agreement with the irish republic would require consultations with them before we could impose restrictions on imports from that source. A full account of our international obligations on meat is contained in Appendix IV;CONFIDENTIAL
(iii) They would curtail the expansion of the livestock and canning industries of certain colonial territories.130. A system of quantitative restrictions would not bring us any nearer to thepolicy of the E.E.C. for regulating meat imports, though it would not necessarilyincrease the difficulties of ultimate accession, since we should in any event have to change to a different system.131. If it were intended to use quantitative restrictions, the existence of our international obligations and our general commercial interests would make itnecessary for us to enter into negotiations in order to obtain freedom by agreementfrom our contractual commitments and to justify our proposals, e.g., in the GATT.In order to have any chance of getting agreement, it would be necessary for us to convince our suppliers that home production would also be effectively limited.There is already the flexible guarantee on pigs which was strengthened at the latestAnnual Review; and we have recommended the introduction of a suitable form of standard quantity arrangement for cattle and sheep. We might have to be ready toimpose limitations more severe than these in order to secure agreement, but howfar it would be necessary to go could only be discovered in the course of negotiation.If the process of negotiation showed that it was not possible to secure the agreementof our main suppliers, it would then be necessary for Ministers to take stock of theposition and to decide what action should be taken.132. There will be an opportunity to explore how far voluntary restrictions oreven alternative forms of regulation are acceptable when the international trade inmeat comes to be discussed in the GATT forum in the summer. These discussionsmight also help to relieve pressure on the United Kingdom market by opening upalternative markets that are at present closed to exporting countries.133. Meanwhile, it would seem best that the Ministry of Agriculture shouldcontinue the talks already initiated with certain supplying countries with a view toarranging, on an informal basis, for the voluntary regulation of supplies to themarket.Conclusions134. (i) All Departments on the Committee agree that the further expansionof livestock production must be checked. As regards pigs, they hope that the recentstrengthening of the flexible guarantee scheme will be beneficial. Action is stillrequired for cattle and sheep. There is a difference between the Agricultural andother Departments on the emphasis to be given to the control of home production.The other Departments consider that this problem is central to both the Exchequerliability and our overseas relations. They also think that it will be necessary tomake substantial reductions in the guaranteed prices if further expansion is to be checked. The Agricultural Departments, however, while agreeing on the need to check further expansion of home production through reductions in the guaranteed prices so far as this is practicable, regard the control of imports as equally important,both because it will not in their view be possible to control Exchequer liabilityadequately without it and because it will not be otherwise possible to carry the farming industry in measures affecting home production.(ii) All Departments are in favour of amending the guarantee scheme forfatstock in order to increase the influence of the market on farmers&apos; decisions; and recommend that Ministers should instruct the Agricultural Departments to pressahead with the preparation of a revised scheme.(iii) We all also favour the application of standard quantity arrangements tocattle and sheep preferably along lines similar to the flexible guarantee scheme for pigs as a reinforcement for reductions in the guaranteed prices. There is, however,some doubt whether a scheme could be devised which, in the different circumstancesof cattle and sheep, would be effective in regulating marketings in the short term.(iv) So far as imports are concerned, if some regulation is considered essentialthe only effective means of control seems to be a comprehensive system of quantitative restrictions by country quotas. Because of our international obligations and commercial interests it would be essential to obtain the agreementof our main suppliers and this would not be forthcoming unless we could convinceour suppliers that home production would also be effectively limited.
(v) In the view of the other Departments the disadvantages of country quotas(including increased cost to our balance of payments) are such that they could not recommend their introduction. They think that there is some possibility of helping to prevent short-term fluctuations arising from imports. Overseas suppliers, given some assurance about the more orderly marketing of domestic supplies, may beready in their own interests so to regulate their shipments as to avoid disturbanceof the United Kingdom market, which for most of them is their main export outlet.It is, however, unlikely that they would be prepared voluntarily to restrict their total sales to the United Kingdom unless their position were safeguarded both byeffective assurances about the level of our own production and by the control ofimports from other sources.(vi) The international trade in meat is,due to be discussed shortly in the GATTand this will provide an opportunity to explore how far any forms of regulationcould be devised which would be acceptable both to the United Kingdom and to our overseas suppliers.(vii) The view of the Agricultural Departments is that an attempt should bemade to negotiate a comprehensive system of quota restrictions based on countryquotas. They consider that these negotiations could take place in the GATT forumand that we should make sure at the GATT Ministerial Meeting in May that anegotiating group on meat is set up at an early date. Further, the agricultural departments consider that if negotiations show that it is not possible to secure theagreement of our main suppliers to some satisfactory form of the regulation ofsupplies Ministers should take stock of the position again and decide what action should be taken, both as regards home production and imports.(viii) In the meantime the Committee notes that the Ministry of Agricultureare continuing the talks already initiated with the Governments of certain countrieswhich supply beef and bacon to the United Kingdom.PART IV.-HORTICULTUREPresent policy135. For some 30 years horticultural policy has been based almost entirelyupon tariff protection; and in July 1959 the Government gave the following pledge to the National Farmers&apos; Union:&quot; The Government&apos;s policy is to continue to support horticulture withtariffs as the main instrument. The Government recognises that it has an obligation, from which it will not depart, to give the horticultural industry ameasure of support equivalent to that given to the agricultural industry generally.&quot;The protection afforded by the tariff varies widely, however, between differentsectors of the industry. The most highly protected are growers of glasshouseproduce (worth about  30 million a year) and some outdoor flowers and nurserystock ( 10 million). For other sectors the tariff is of considerably less importance:outdoor vegetables ( 60 -million) enjoy the natural protection afforded by heavytransport costs from abroad; soft fruit ( 11 million), that afforded by perishability.Total imports of temperate horticultural produce (excluding potatoes and tropicalproducts, both of which are excluded from consideration in this report) are fairlylarge ( 60 million) in relation to total United Kingdom production ( 160 million):but imports of temperate produce which actually compete with home production are considerably smaller (about  35 million, of which 75 per cent comes fromthe E.E.C.).136. Although the policy of tariff protection has been generally acceptedover a long period, its defects are now becoming increasingly manifest. It has reserved not so much to encourage efficiency as to shelter inefficiency, and this is illustrated by the fact that those sectors of the industry which are most protectedare also the least competitive. Moreover^ continuation of this policy would implythe acceptance of claims from growers for higher duties if competition from importscontinues to increase, as is most likely. Yet the products concerned are not, forthe most part, products of which growers abroad enjoy climatic or other permanent
advantages sufficient to outweigh the higher costs of transport to our market;and the real answer to increased competition lies in greater efficiency rather thanhigher protection. And as for those products, e.g., outdoor flowers, of whichgrowers abroad do enjoy a climatic advantage, it is questionable whether anattempt to redress the balance through a permanent policy of tariff protection canbe justified.137. Dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs is being increasinglyexpressed, both within the industry and outside it, and there is a growing demandfor some new approach. For this reason alone, a review is necessary. It is alsourgent in that a decision must be made as to whether the horticultural tariff hasto be excluded from the field in which concession can be made in the forthcominginternational trade negotiations; or whether, on the contrary, it can be regardedas a valuable bargaining counter in these negotiations. Having regard to the pledge,there would be serious political embarrassment in binding or reducing the tariffunless alternative measures of assistance had been introduced.Proposed future policy138. In these circumstances we should contemplate a move away from areliance on tariff protection, and to put in its place measures to help the industryto increase its ability to stand on its own feet. The particular measures proposedby the Agricultural Departments are described below (paragraphs 150-165). Theycomprise:(i) an extended grants scheme;(ii) the improvement, with grant aid, of wholesale horticultural markets;Both these proposals for grant aid would be restricted to a period of 10 years.(iii) the provision of credit facilities;(iv) the introduction of compulsory grading.It will be some period of years before the industry can begin to benefit from these measures. It will therefore be necessary, at least for sensitive items, to provide fora standstill period in which the tariff could be bound in negotiation but not reduced;(in the Common Market negotiations we asked for a standstill of five years, and itwould be difficult now to contemplate less than this). Sensitive items include themain glasshouse crops (tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and flowers), the main orchardfruits (especially apples and pears), a very few soft fruits and vegetables, and mostof the outdoor flowers and nursery stock.139. We recognise that these proposals are of fundamental importance to thefuture of British horticulture. Their effects would vary for the different sectors of. the industry, and would depend largely on the use made by the industry of the aidmade available: the effects should be comparatively small for outdoor vegetablesand soft fruit, whose profitability in general might however be somewhat increased;the glasshouse industry would almost certainly be reduced in size but much increased in efficiency; production of outdoor flowers, bulbs and nursery stockwould almost certainly be reduced (and growers in the Isles of Scilly in particularwould probably suffer a considerable reduction in income), but the smaller industry which survived could be expected to be healthy and competitive.140. The two aspects of this new policy departure from reliance on tariff protection and the granting of aid towards greater competitiveness would beinterdependent, and would be so presented. It would be necessary to make it plain from the start that the Government reserved to itself the right, in exchange for the aid proposed, to bind or to reduce horticultural tariffs when it was in thenational interest to do so. Equally, the Government could not contemplate a departure from present tariff policy without offering the industry fair recompense.On this basis, it would be necessary for the positive measures of aid to be similarto, and certainly on the same scale as, those which were contemplated in theCommon Market context. Even these measures will almost certainly be regarded by the industry as an unsatisfactory quid pro quo for a change of policy whichwould leave it open to the Government to reduce the tariff protection which theyhave enjoyed. We should not of course present this policy to them as leadinginevitably to the elimination of horticultural tariffs, if only because this would
depend on an assessment of the national interest in trade negotiations. But itwould be made clear to them that the tariff protection for this industry, as for otherindustries, could be the subject of concessions, by way of binding or reduction.Treasury reservations141. While the Treasury accept the desirability of reducing the present tariff protection given to horticulture, and of being able to use tariff reductions in this field as a bargaining instrument in the Kennedy Round, they do not accept thatthis must inevitably be accompanied by the substitution of grant aid for tariff protection. When a major effort is being made to reduce subsides in agriculturegenerally, they feel that there are obvious objections to increasing them for horticulture. They do not accept that the!Government pledge of 1959 necessarilydebars the Government from making such tariff reductions without other formsof compensation. The pledge is clearly limited by the general provision of the agriculture Acts that the Government is only bound to maintain such volume ofproduction as in the national interest it is desirable to produce in the UnitedKingdom. While recognising the political difficulties, the Treasury think it wouldbe wrong to adopt the principle that any tariff reductions in horticulture requiresexpress compensation. The line between horticulture and manufacturing industries is not so sharp that this could be done without danger or repercussions. Neithercan they accept the contention in paragraph 136 above that &quot; the continuation of present policy would imply the acceptance of claims from growers for higher dutiesif competition from imports continues to increase &quot;, nor that, because certain proposals were thought necessary in a Common Market context, this is a goodargument in itself for pursuing them in different economic conditions.Other aspects142. Before the proposed new measures are described it remains to discussthree other aspects of the removal of protection: the special position of applesand pears; the Commonwealth interest; and the effect on the Channel Islands.143. Apples and pears are protected by quantitative restrictions rather thanby tariffs (the tariff on apples is bound at zero in the Northern Hemisphere seasonand at a low level for the rest of the year; that on pears varies between the twoseasons, but is low throughout the year). The United Kingdom is in breach ofthe GATT in maintaining these restrictions, and it will be progressively moredifficult to retain them in the face of increasing international pressure (particularly from the United States). This particular form of protection is therefore likely tohave to be withdrawn in any event. Whatever timetable is adopted for a stand still and subsequent reduction of tariffs might apply also to these quotas, althoughthe Board of Trade point out that there might be difficulty in securing agreement to dealing with them in accordance with such a timetable, having regard to the breach of our obligations that they now represent. Given the new measures proposed, we consider that the orchard fruit industry in general should proveitself able to compete on equal terms with imports.144. Apart from the quantitative restrictions referred to in the previous paragraph, the Commonwealth interest is two-fold. First, there are thosehorticultural items where a tariff which protects the United Kingdom producer hashad the incidental effect of giving a preference to Commonwealth producers overother overseas competitors. There, are, however,, only three items on which theloss of preference would be likely to have a significant effect on the commonwealth interests concerned: they are Cyprus carrots (annual imports value  400,000),Canadian onions (annual imports value  200,000) and cut ilowers from Malta(annual imports value  67,000). The tempo of the application of the new policy to these items would, however, be for further consideration. We do not thinkthat these side-effects ought to be allowed to stand in the way of a change in tariff policy.145. Secondly, there are a few instances among temperate horticulturalproducts where the present tariff does not serve to protect the United Kingdomproducer but is maintained solely to give preference to Commonwealth suppliers,either of fruit which is not produced in quantity in the United Kingdom or of fruitimported outside the home season. The most significant cases are outdoor grapes,where there is virtually no United Kingdom production but there are annual imports
value  400,000 from Cyprus; and Australian and New Zealand apples ( 7-million) and pears ( 1-7 million) which arrive outside the United Kingdom homeseason. The apple and pear preferences (of about 5 per cent) are bound toAustralia and New Zealand (and for pears also to South Africa). There are alsocontractual preferences on peaches, nectarines and plums to South Africa, and onoutdoor grapes to Australia and South Africa (but not to Cyprus). This raises an issue of some difficulty. United Kingdom growers would vigorously protest ifCommonwealth suppliers were left with an advantage denied to the home industry.The Departments concerned are examining this question further.146. The Channel Islands, and particularly Guernsey, offer a furthercomplication. Guernsey&apos;s is virtually a one-crop economy, and that crop glasshouse tomatoes at present enjoys protection in the United Kingdom market.The removal of this protection would undoubtedly reduce returns to Guernseyproducers.International aspects147. If we were prepared to move away from our present rigid policy ofreliance on tariff protection, we should not have to seek to exclude horticulturefrom the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations. It is true that our need for a standstill period for sensitive items would require us to seek some dispensationfor horticulture in the timing of tariff reductions; and we should need also to payregard to our existing trade agreement obligations. But our readiness to bind all our duties at once and to make reductions in some immediately and in others after a time would be concessions for which we could expect to gain credit, either in the kennedy Round or in subsequent multilateral or bilateral negotiations as thenational advantage might require.148. A new policy on these lines would also be a move towards possible futureentry into the E.E.C. Clearly, any reductions in tariffs against the Six would be consistent with this; we also made clear in the Brussels negotiations our intentionto offer to growers and co-operatives grant-aid similar to what we now propose,and, since this aid was not designed to lead to greater production and would operatefor a limited time, we were led to believe that it would be permissible under thetreaty. As for assistance to the redevelopment of markets and the provision of guaranteed credit, these are measures already deep-set in one or more of the Six.And compulsory grading is written into the Community&apos;s Regulation on fruit and vegetables.Proposed new measures149. We turn now to a brief description of the new measures proposed.Grants for growers and co-operatives150. The Horticulture Act, 1960, provides until 1965 or 1966 grants of a third of the cost of equipment (such as cold stores, packing sheds and equipment for grading and packing) required by viable growers and by growers&apos; marketingco-operatives for more efficient storage, transport and marketing. We agree thatthere should be a new scheme providing grants for existing holdings towards:(i) equipment for more efficient production-the replacement of glasshousesand the provision of items such as the automatic control of heating,watering and ventilation in glasshouses;(ii) reorganisation of small businesses (on the lines of the farm business grant in the Small Farmer Scheme);(iii) the initial working capital required to establish growers&apos; marketingco-operatives;. (iv) the cost of voluntarily amalgamating non-viable holdings with otherhorticultural or agricultural land.151. It would be the intention to confine grant-aid to growers who couldbe expected to remain viable. The test applied would be similar to that of thepresent Scheme, under which the business must have not less than four acres ofeligible land (or its equivalent under glass) and be capable of yielding an adequatereturn to an efficient full-time occupier. The latter criterion is, of course, subjective.,
If realistically applied, it should however serve to prevent any serious risk ofwasteful expenditure of public money through giving grants to growers who would subsequently fail (although the complete elimination of such risk would beimpossible).152. Provided that some form of guaranteed credit were available (see paragraphs 159-162) a grant-rate of one-third would be adequate and on this basis the aggregate cost over a period of 10 years might be in the region of 25 million (including the  8 million authorised for the existing Scheme).Treasury reservations153. The Treasury, however, doubt whether the grants proposed will have any significant effect in improving the long-term viability of the firms which receive them. They believe that a substantial contraction of horticultural production incertain lines (e.g., glasshouse production and soft fruits) is clearly needed, while there are perhaps rather limited possibilities of expansion in other directions.They doubt whether this kind of process is likely to be substantially helped bythe grant scheme proposed, it being more likely simply to delay the process ofcontraction, as well as being a waste of public money. They additionally thinkit unlikely that, if such grants were introduced, it would be politically possible to stop them at the end of 10 years.154. In any case, it is the Treasury view that no grants should be given untilthe decision to reduce particular tariffs has actually been taken and that suchgrants should then be limited to firms which produce significant quantities of the commodities affected.Improvement of markets155. Most of the main wholesale markets, which are in general (though notinvariably) the property of local authorities, are obsolete and inefficient. Theindependent Runciman Committee (1955-56) found that this inefficiency adversely affected returns to growers and that, until the markets were improved, other possible improvements in distribution would be restricted. Hence its firstrecommendation was that market authorities should be urged to rebuild orotherwise improve their markets. Since the Committee reported, however, onlybne new market has been built, and there is little sign that much progress willbe made in market improvement in the near future.156. In planning the redevelopment of markets, local authorities face anumber of problems. Although these are not all financial, it is only by offeringExchequer aid for the limited period that we could hope to bring about more rapid progress in market improvement. Such assistance would encourage new development and enable local authorities to reduce the high market rents theywould otherwise have to charge. It would also enable the Government toco-ordinate market developments in the interests of the marketing system as awhole.157. We are therefore unanimous in recommending that some financialassistance should be made available for the rebuilding or improvement of wholesalehorticultural markets, although the Treasury think that no promises should bemade about such assistance until the inter-departmental Committee, which is toconsider the results of the current fact-finding survey of the wholesale horticulturalmarkets, has reported. (The Ministry of Housing and Local Government havebeen consulted and have no objection to the proposed assistance.) We envisagethis would take the form of grants to market authorities as part of the cost ofimprovement, although the extent of such grants, and the conditions that shouldattach to them, require further study. This could be undertaken by the inter-departmental official Committee which will take into account any factors likely to affect the number, size, lay-out and location of new or improved markets (notablyany decision to introduce compulsory grading (see paragraphs 163-165) as wellas, for instance, the spread of direct sales of graded products by growers to largeconsumers, etc.).158. Meanwhile, it has been estimated that the total cost of improvements to all the main existing markets might be about  50 million. It would probably not be necessary, however,.to redevelop more than a selected number of main
primary markets, forming the skeleton of a national markets system. For thosemarkets that were redeveloped the rate of grant might vary, but might need to bein some cases as high as 50 per cent. The total cost to public funds might amountto a maximum of about  20 million over 10 years.Guaranteed credit159. Experience of the Horticulture Act has shown that the response tooffers of grant-aid is limited by growers&apos; inability to raise the remainder of thecost. Existing credit facilities for growers &apos;in the United Kingdom compare unfavourably with those of their competitors abroad, and this contrast hasoccasioned increasing discontent. Indeed, the improvement of credit facilitiesfor growers would probably be the biggest single inducement to them to swallowthe removal of tariff protection.160.  The Agricultural Departments propose:(i) to introduce legislation to enlarge the lending powers of the AgriculturalMortgage Corporation and at the same time to offer it guarantees againstbad debts;(ii) to grant-aid the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the purchase ofunderwriting cover to back the guarantees it offers to the banks.These credit measures, unlike the direct grants to growers and the assistance towards the improvement of markets, would not be limited to a period of 10 years.Subject to periodic review, they would continue indefinitely at a cost not exceeding 200,000 in any one year.161. The Treasury consider that a combination of grant-aid and guaranteedcredit would sacrifice the safeguard afforded by a grower&apos;s having his own stake in a project or having to raise a proportion of the money by normal borrowing.The Agricultural Departments have pointed out, however, that it is misleading tosuggest that the grower would no longer have a stake in his project, since it wouldbe the lender, not the grower, who would be guaranteed against loss. The growerwould still be exposed to all the consequences of any failure to meet his obligations and would have to pay a little more for the facility of the guarantee. Moreover,the organisations concerned would be limited in the total amount of credit they could offer or guarantee. They would be required to continue their present arrangementsfor inspections so as to discriminate among applications for a loan of all or partof the grower&apos;s share (two-thirds) of the cost of a grant-aided improvement.162. The Treasury point out that this would be a new form of assistance and also consider that claims from other industries to demand guaranteed creditmight be difficult to resist. The Agricultural Departments for their part cannotdeny that the agricultural industry would make a similar claim and indeed the farmers&apos; Unions did so during the course of the recent Annual Review, when they made a proposal that would cost  50,000-70,000 a year. But the agricultural departments believe that the repercussion could be held at this point. Thereare few industries outside agriculture and horticulture with collective organisationswilling and able to guarantee their members&apos; overdrafts and, as a condition for doing so, to enquire into the efficiency of those members&apos; operations. Moreover,horticulture is exceptional in the pledges it has received; and if the tariff ceases to be the main instrument of protection, conspicuous measures of assistance willbe needed if the continued honouring of these pledges is to be clearly seen.Compulsory grading163. Only a comparatively small number of growers mainly the biggest andmost efficient grade their produce reliably to demanding standards, and it is clearthat only the introduction of compulsion will effect a rapid improvement in this situation. Compulsory grading would have a number of substantial economic advantages for the industry as a whole. First, it would enable home grown produce to compete more effectively with imports, which are already well graded. Secondly,provided that the requirements of the lowest admissible grade were not pitched too low, compulsory grading would keep off the market much of the inferior producewhich now ruins it for the better stuff. Thirdly, it would be capable of leading to substantial improvement in the efficiency of distribution.  Finally, the consumer
would benefit from knowing what he was buying and should be more ready to buy and it would be easier, too, when all produce was graded, to find out precisely what the consumer wanted and to adjust production and marketing accordingly..164. It would not be practicable to enforce grading at the farm gate of the70,000 or so holdings on which horticultural crops are grown, nor at the point of retail sale in the 150,000 or so shops handling fruit and vegetables. The bestpracticable solution is to require that all produce entering the wholesale trade should first have been graded. This could be enforced by inspection on a sampling basis in the wholesale markets, at wholesalers&apos; premises, or at corresponding points inthe chain of distribution of produce sold direct by growers to supermarkets andother large retailers. Only negligible quantities would escape this net, and the pressure of competition from graded produce would tend towards their eventualelimination. The task of inspection would require an inspectorate of some 150officers (at a cost of about  400,000 per annum). The risk of having their producedowngraded or returned unsold would be the principal disincentive to growers to evade the grading regulations, but it might be necessary to reinforce this by some additional monetary penalty.165. The advantages generally of grading are such that it has been government policy for some time to encourage it. On the other hand, the cost and the benefitsvary considerably among different types of grower (and indeed at different times and seasons); and progress towards wider adoption of grading will be slow andincomplete unless some form of compulsion is applied. It is likely that no effective action in this direction will come from the industry itself, and that only theGovernment can take it. The political difficulty of enforcing compulsory gradingon a reluctant industry is obvious, and the strength of opposition would clearly have to be gauged through discussion with the Unions before a firm decision couldbe taken. We recommend that compulsory grading should be introduced, beginning with a few of the main products, unless the Unions strongly oppose it.     .Surpluses166. The Unions will undoubtedly express concern that increasing productionin Europe will lead to surpluses which may be exported to our market at very low prices and against which they will need continued, and even more effective,protection. If this protection is not to be afforded by specific duties, they may seek the introduction of a minimum import price scheme providing for a ban on imports when prices on our market drop below a certain level. It cannot be denied that the industry will have a strong case for some alternative safeguard againstsurpluses if tariff protection is reduced. The E.E.C. are in fact protecting themselves against very low priced imports.167. The use of anti-dumping powers is not a possible solution, for importsof produce at low prices at times of European surplus would not be dumped inthe technical sense. Two kinds of horticultural surplus can be distinguished: thepermanent surplus which results from too large a productive capacity (e.g., too many apple trees), and the temporary surplus or glut resulting from particularlyfavourable weather conditions. In so far as horticultural produce enters verywidely into European trade, the problems of both types of surplus are Europeanproblems, rather than those of any single country. We cannot look for the adoption by other countries of a code of conduct binding them to hold supplies off our market in time of glut. Only the Dutch are at present so organised as to be ableto do this, and even if others could, we could only hope for agreement to do so aspart of a plan to keep supplies off the European market generally. But it is not unreasonable to expect some progress to be made towards a solution of this sort of problem, as it emerges, on a European basis. We pressed for action in thisdirection during the Common Market negotiations, and the Six showed some signs of a willingness to accept it. Nevertheless, until such action materialises,this Committee should examine the possibility of adopting safeguard measuressimilar to those of the E.E.C. These provide that imports may be suspended, orsubjected to a countervailing charge, if their price at the frontier is below a referenceprice and they are causing or threatening serious disturbance to the market.Conclusions .168. The measures outlined above further grant-aid for growers andco-operatives, assistance for the redevelopment of markets, the provision of credit facilities, and the introduction of compulsory grading could do much to equip
the horticultural industry to meet conditions of greater competition. Even so, theindustry would not regard them as a full recompense for assured tariff protection;and, indeed, if protection were to be substantially reduced after a period ofreadjustment, these measures would not prevent many growers from being forcedout of the industry and many others from suffering a substantial decline in netreturns. Against this must be set the national advantage to be gained from a competitive horticultural industry, capable of supplying the consumer with first-quality well-packed produce through an efficient marketing system.169. The introduction of this new policy &apos;for horticulture in both its aspects departure from reliance on tariff protection and the granting of aid towards greatercompetitiveness is supported by the Committee, with the exception of theTreasury and Commonwealth Relations Office. The Treasury accept the desirabilityof reducing the present tariff protection given to horticulture but question whetherthis should be accompanied by additional grant-aid to growers and co-operativesor the provision of new credit facilities; and they consider that no promise ofassistance towards the redevelopment of markets should be made until the inter-departmental Committee has reported. The Commonwealth Relations Office donot object to the adoption of the proposed new policy, if this is dissociated fromcontractual preferences for Commonwealth countries (see paragraph 145). Ifthese preferences are considered incompatible with the abandonment of tariff protection, the Commonwealth Relations Office reserve their position.170. Ministers are accordingly asked to decide whether a new policy for horticulture comprising all or any of the features outlined in this report should now be adopted; and, if so, to authorise the opening of discussions with the Farmers&apos;Unions on that basis.

Appendix IVINTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ON MEATThis Appendix sets out our international commitments on meat in relation tothe proposals in Part III of the Report. It is not intended to imply that anything wedo which accords with the letter of our obligations would necessarily beinternationally acceptable, nor that there is no way of doing anything which is in anyway incompatible with our commitments. In fact what matters most is the estimatemade by our suppliers of the effects on their interests of changes in our policy taken as a whole. They will in particular look to see how far our arrangements can beexpected to check the rise in our own production so as to enable them to maintainthe volume and value of their trade.General obligations-the GATT2. A variable import levy is in fact a Customs duty, but it is changed muchmore frequently than an ordinary Customs duty. The GATT itself contains no provision on the use of variable import levies. Their use by the E.E.C. has however been sharply criticised by contracting parties on the grounds that the GeneralAgreement presupposes that tariffs will be stable and negotiable and that the way they are used by the E.E.C. pays no regard to the interest of overseas suppliers. Alevy could, of course, be imposed on &quot; bound &quot; items only after negotiating thewithdrawal or modification of our bindings. In so far as provision was made for imports from certain countries to be exempted from the levy, so that the levy becamediscriminatory between supplying countries, this would be in breach of the most-favoured-nation provision of Article I of the GATT unless the levy on each countrycomplied with the anti-dumping and countervailing provisions of Article VI, whichis unlikely.3. The imposition of quotas would conflict with our obligations underArticle XI of the General Agreement. It is not proposed to restrict the quantitiespermitted to be marketed or produced by our own farmers and we could not,therefore, invoke the escape clause of Article XI: 2 (C) (1).4. Article XIV of the GATT describes the exceptions to the rules for non-discriminatory administration of quantitative restrictions set out in Article XIII.Article XIV: 5 provides for the maintenance of preferential arrangements described in Annex A of the Agreement pending the outcome of negotiations. The preferentialarrangements referred to are those existing in the United Kingdom on 10th April,1947, under contractual agreements with the Governments of Canada, Australia andNew Zealand in respect of chilled and frozen beef and veal, frozen mutton and lamb,chilled and frozen pork, and bacon for giving preferences to the Commonwealth bymeans of quotas. Provision is made for negotiations to take place among thecountries substantially involved for the elimination of these arrangements orreplacement of them by tariff preferences. These negotiations have never been concluded and we have, therefore, technically the right to apply quantitative restrictions on beef, mutton, lamb and pork. The &quot; existing preferentialarrangements&quot; are controlled by the Ottawa Agreements of 1932 with Australiaand New Zealand which still subsist in relation to meat, provide for limits on importsof foreign meat and, inter alia, that the Dominions shall enjoy an expanding share of meat imports into the United Kingdom. The Agreements can be terminated at sixmonths&apos; notice. The effect of this provision is to give us, so far as the GATT isconcerned, the right to apply quantitative restrictions at levels for the most partsubstantially higher than current import levels. But this freedom is restricted bybilateral trading obligations.General obligations-the Commonwealth5. We are committed not to impose import duties on the Commonwealth,South Africa and the Irish Republic. Where appropriate, our commitments are described below in greater detail.
Beef and Veal6. The major supplying countries are Australia, New Zealand, Argentina,Irish Republic, Yugoslavia, Uruguay, and Netherlands (veal).GATT bindings7. We have no tariff bindings on beef and veal. There are bindings on offaland associated products as follows:(i) Sweetbreads, not preserved in air-tight containers to Uruguay at zero.(ii) Boiled salted beef udders to Denmark at 15 per cent.(iii) Jellied veal, preserved in air-tight containers to Denmark at 10 per cent.(iv) Sausages and the like, of meat, meat offal or animal blood to denmark and Uruguay at 20 per cent.(v) Pastes exceeding 10s. per lb. to France at 20 per cent; not exceeding 10s.per lb. to Denmark and Uruguay at 20 per cent.Bilateral commitments to major suppliersAustralia8. We are committed to permit entry without restriction on quantity atnegotiated minimum prices until 30th September, 1967, under the terms of the 1952Meat Agreement, which contains no provision for earlier termination.9. We have guaranteed duty-free entry as long as the meat provisions of the1957 Trade Agreement and of the 1932 Ottawa Agreement (which also containsother provisions taken care of until 1967 by the Meat Agreement) remain in force.Both these agreements can be brought to an end by giving six months&apos; notice. Thewithdrawal of duty-free entry might have no substantial effect as long as the MeatAgreement remained in force, since the Australians could argue that the minimum price should be increased to take account of any duty payable.10.  Under the 1957 Trade Agreement we have also undertaken:(i) to give Australia contractual margins of preference on canned meat(except pigs&apos; tongues), ground or chopped meat, other than consistingwholly of pork at 10 per cent and on meat extracts and essences at 10 percent;(ii) to consult the Australian Government before reducing non-contractualmargins (or margins in excess of the contractual level) on items in whichAustralia has an active trade interest;(iii) to accord duty-free entry (other than revenue duties) to goods in whichAustralia has an active trade interest if such goods were free of duty(other than revenue duties) in November 1956.New Zealand11. We are committed to allow entry without restriction on quantity of beef and veal and edible offals thereof until 30th September, 1967, under the terms of the1952 Joint Declaration which contains no provision for earlier termination.12. We have guaranteed duty-free entry under the Ottawa and 1959 trade agreements which can be terminated at six months&apos; notice. (The Ottawa Agreementalso contains other provisions taken care of until 1967 by the Meat Agreement.)13. Under the 1959 Trade Agreement we have undertaken that, shouldcircumstances arise which, in the opinion of the New Zealand Government,threaten serious injury to New Zealand&apos;s meat trade, to consult with the NewZealand Government and consider sympathetically any request for the applicationof remedial measures.14.  In addition we have guaranteed the following margins of preference:(i) Pastes, canned and other than wholly of pork at 10 per cent.(ii) Prepared or preserved meat or meat offal, in air-tight containers, groundor chopped pork with beef or veal at 10 per cent.
(iii) Prepared or preserved meat or meat offal in air-tight containers, beef and veal (including edible offals but excluding tongues and jellied veal,at 10 per cent).(iv) Meat extracts and meat juices at 10 per cent.Argentina15. Our obligations to Argentina arise from the 1936 Agreement on Tradeand Commerce under which Argentina has certain rights to minimum quotasand we have agreed to tariff bindings at Id. a pound on chilled beef and veal,f d. per pound on frozen or salted beef and veal, 20 per cent on boneless beef andveal and edible offals of beef and veal.16. Both Argentina and ourselves have reason to want this agreementterminated, the Argentinians are already in breach of it, and we have Ministerialauthority to take advantage of Argentina&apos;s accession to GATT to terminate it.The agreement can be terminated-unilaterally at six months&apos; notice.Irish Republic17. Under the 1938 Trade Agreement we have undertaken to allow dutyfree entry and not to regulate the quantity of imports of agricultural products fromthe Republic except in the interests of orderly marketing and after consultation.The 1948 Trade Agreement records the contention of the Irish Government thatthe United Kingdom has undertaken to admit without quantitative restrictionsthe goods referred to in the 1938 Agreement and that the United Kingdom doesnot accept the contention. Nevertheless, we undertook with some qualificationsto review from time to time import restrictions imposed oh goods imported fromthe Irish Republic. There exists also an unpublished assurance given to theIrish in 1948 that, with some qualifications, we will not restrict imports of Irishgoods. Under the terms of the 1948 Agreement we also undertook not to putIrish goods at a disadvantage in relation to goods from other sources enjoyingpreferential treatment. Under the 1960 Trade Agreement we undertook to consult the Government of the Republic before reducing or eliminating anynon-contractual margins of preference and to seek in consultation together equitablesolutions for any cases of special difficulty that may arise in trade between thetwo countries.Yugoslavia18.  We have only general undertakings in an annual agreed minute to:(a) Grant the same facilities to imports of Yugoslav goods as to imports fromO.E.C.D. countries and the Relaxation Area, and(b) To consult together with a view to securing the continuation of trade at the highest possible level if any item of interest to Yugoslavia iswithdrawn from O.G.L.Bilateral commitments to suppliers other than major suppliersCanada19. Under the 1947 Exchange of Letters we have undertaken not to applyto imports of Canadian cattle or beef when consigned from any part of the BritishEmpire, any duty or levy which may be imposed on cattle or beef imported intothe United Kingdom and not to regulate the imports of cattle or beef from Canada,unless, after consultation with the Canadian Government, it appears to the UnitedKingdom Government that the effective working of a general scheme for the orderly marketing in the United Kingdom of meat cannot otherwise be secured.20. We are also required to consult with the Canadian Government beforevarying or departing from the strict application of the provision of the Exchangeof Letters.Pakistan21. In a letter dated 2nd April, 1951, we gave Pakistan an assurance that should it become necessary to impose duties on goods then duty-free we wouldgive prior notice of our intentions. Under the 1951 Trade Agreement we have undertaken to extend to Pakistan m.f.n. treatment and any tariff preferences whichare accorded to other Commonwealth countries.
India22. Under the 1939 Trade Agreement we have undertaken to grant duty-free entry and to extend to India any tariff preferences which are or may be accorded toother Commonwealth countries.Mutton and Lamb23. The main supplying countries are Australia, New Zealand, Argentina andthe Irish Republic.GATT bindings24.  We have no tariff bindings on mutton and lamb.Bilateral commitments to major and other suppliersAustralia and New Zealand25. With the exception of the actual contractual margins of preference, thearrangements described in the beef and veal sections of this paper apply equally to mutton and lamb. The contractual margins on mutton and lamb:Australia and New ZealandCanned meat (except pigs&apos; tongues) other than ground or chopped meatconsisting wholly of pork at 10 per cent; meat extracts and essences at 10 percent.New ZealandPastes, canned and other than wholly of pork at 10 per cent.Argentina26. Our commitments under the 1936 Agreement on Trade and Commercedescribed in the beef and veal section apply equally to mutton and lamb on whichwe undertook to allow a tariff binding at zero.Irish Republic, Yugoslavia and Uruguay27. Our obligations described in the beef and veal section apply equally tomutton and lamb.   ((South Africa28. Under the Ottawa Agreement we are committed to make provision forthe importation of South African mutton and lamb in applying any powers forquantitative regulation of imports of mutton and lamb into the United Kingdom.Pork and Bacon29. The main supplying countries are Denmark, Poland, Netherlands, irish republic, Yugoslavia and Sweden.GATT bindings30.  We have the following GATT bindings:Salted or pickled pork other than ham orbaconHams, whole, not in airtight containers(quantity to be imported to be not lessthan 775,000 cwt. a year.

Under the 1933 and 1957 Agreements on Trade and Commerce we have undertaken to allocate to Denmark 68-95 per cent of total foreign quotas institutedfor bacon and 0-4 per cent for ham. Under the 1960 Agreement on Agriculturewe have established a duty-free tariff for bacon, and have an obligation &quot; not toadopt policies likely to deny Danish producers the opportunity to maintain theirmarket in the United Kingdom for commodities of concern to them or to share inany increase in the United Kingdom market for these products &quot;. Under the 1960Agreement we have also undertaken, whilst reserving the right to determine annuallythe guaranteed price for pigs, not to adopt a policy in relation to subsidies, whichwould render nugatory the opportunity given to Danish producers in the UnitedKingdom under the Agreement.Poland32. Our obligations arise from a three-year framework Trade Agreementdue to expire on 30th June, 1963, but expected to be replaced by a further three-year agreement with quotas for the first 12 months. There are contractual obligations to renew particular quotas but there is an understanding between Poland and ourselves that, except in very exceptional circumstances, or at the request of the receiving country, quotas will not be reduced in future below existing levels.Irish Republic33. Our obligations described in the beef and veal section apply equally topork and bacon.Yugoslavia34. Our obligations described in the beef and veal section apply equally topork and bacon.Sweden (I35. We have no special commitments to Sweden, beyond the general provisions of the Stockholm Convention.
Bilateral commitments to suppliers other than major suppliersNew Zealand36. Under the 1959 Trade Agreement we have undertaken to allowunrestricted entry of chilled and frozen pork until 31st May, 1967 (although theAgreement can be terminated at six months&apos; notice). This Agreement also accordsthe right of duty-free entry (other than revenue duties) into the United Kingdomof New Zealand goods which were free of duty on 25th November, 1958, and wehave undertaken to consult before reducing non-contractual margins of preferenceon items in which New Zealand has an active trade interest. There is also anundertaking that, should circumstances arise which, in the opinion of the NewZealand Government, threaten serious injury to New Zealand&apos;s meat trade, wewould consult with New Zealand Government and consider sympathetically anyrequest for the application of remedial measures.37.  We have also guaranteed the following margins of preference:Skinless sausages, canned     ...     ...     ... 10 per centPastes, canned, wholly of pork (including 5 per centbacon and ham)Other prepared or preserved meat or meat 5 per centoffal in airtight containers, ground orchopped pork (including ham and bacon),wholly of pork, canned meat extracts and meat juices other than 10 per centwholly or in part derived from beef orvealAustralia38. Under the Ottawa and 1957 Trade Agreements we have bound free entry(other than revenue duty) and have undertaken to consult Australia before reducingnon-contractual margins of preference on items in which she has an active tradeinterest. There is a contractual preference of 5 per cent on canned, ground orchopped meat consisting wholly of pork.Argentina39. The 1936 Agreement specifies duty-free entry for pork, though in factwe imposed a duty of 10 per cent in 1956 with Argentine agreement (but see beef and veal section for position on the Agreement as a whole).Conclusion40. Thus it can be seen that we have a complicated network of both bilateraland multilateral international obligations on meat, many of which would bebreached by the imposition of a variable levy, of quantitative restrictions, or anyother method of restraining imports. To modify these obligations would require a formidable set of negotiations, and we could only hope to secure freedom toimpose a measure of control by convincing exporting countries that they would bebetter off under the new regime than under the old. The only concession whichwould seem likely to succeed in convincing them would be a firm limitation of home production such as would assure them of maintaining their share of the UnitedKingdom market.
