THE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT ACT AND THE NORTH-east memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for ScienceAt the 7th Meeting of the Population and Employment Committeethe President of the Board of Trade and I were invited to preparememoranda setting out our respective points of view on the question ofmaking the facilities of the Local Employment Act, or any substitutedlegislation, available over the whole of the North-East, or at any rateover the areas round, the cities of Newcastle and Durham which are atpresent not included, as the attached map shows (Annex I).2.     My view can be put very shortly.    My contention is that whetheror not an amendment in the Act is desirable its present provisions are sufficient for the minimum that I require.3.     There is nothing in the Act to debar the President of the Boardof Trade from making these areas or any part of them development districts, and provided they satisfy the two criteria, specified inS. 1 (2) of the Act, in my view it could be argued that he is under a statutory duty to do so.    The criteria are:-(i) &quot;that a high rate of unemployment exists, or is expectedwithin such period that it is expedient to exercise&quot; thepowers of the Act;  and(ii) (in either case) is likely to persist whether seasonallyor generally.The relevant passage from the Act is attached (Annex II).     The powersof the Board are to be exercised in relation to &quot;localities&quot; but there isno definition of what constitutes a locality.    I accept that it isadministratively convenient, though not legally necessary, that thedevelopment districts be determined by reference to the Ministry ofLabour employment exchange areas since these are the units forwhich unemployment statistics are obtained and thus are the only basis on which the rate of unemployment in any place can be ascertained.But the President is not required to treat each of these employment exchange areas separately.    It is perfectly open to him (and on theabove conditions he can be argued to be bound) to take a collection ofthem as a single entity and if the unemployment rate is high for thisentity to make it a development district either under some general des-description or by listing the individual exchange areas comprising it.That is exactly what he has done in the case of the Highlands and islands, and arguably in the case of Tees-side, as opposed toTyneside.-1-C. (63) 64 COPY NO. .v r 5 216th April, 1963CABINET
4.      This is therefore purely a matter of administration.    Forthe North-East as a whole the rate of unemployment is indisputedlyhigh.     There were 5. 5 per cent wholly unemployed in the northern region in March, and if Cumberland and Westmorland are eliminatedthe rate for the remainder is 5. 7 per cent.    Any seasonal improve-ment will be offset by losses of employment in coalmining and ship-building so that I have no doubt - I wish I had - that a high rate will persist.    Nor do I understand that this is disputed.5.     The conclusion is therefore inescapable that both on the lawand the facts the president  can properly make (and at least can be argued to be under an obligation to make) the localities in questiondevelopment districts.    As I understand it the objections to doing so are two.    My comments on these objections are as follows.6.     First, it is said that if such places as Team Valley andKillingworth enjoyed the benefits of the Act it would be impossibleto steer industry to the less attractive parts of the North-East suchas West Durham or the Hartlepools.     This may be true and if sowe may have to do something for these places.    But I cannotbelieve that it is defensible that we should plan for failure bydebarring from aid all the places most likely to profit from it.Indeed under the present arrangements the Board of Trade&apos;s policy on Industrial Development Certificates is to attempt to steer new projects away from places such as Team Valley to existing develop-ment districts.    Such a policy cannot co-exist with anything like a regional plan for industrial development.    Indeed, my mission in this matter presupposes this.7.     S condly, there is the argument that what I propose involves a reversal of the policy on which the Local Employment Bill was introduced and on which the Act has been administered.   But this argument assumes, contrary to the facts, that there has been nochange in the general nature of unemployment since I960.     In1959-1960 high unemployment had, save in parts of Scotland, ceased to extend over large territorial areas but was concentrated on alarge number of relatively small districts.    This was why weannounced and justified the abandonment of the old concept andsubstituted for the nine development areas 60 or 70 development districts.    It was not because the old policy had failed, butprecisely because it appeared to have succeeded.    The real question is whether the situation in the North-East or generallyhas changed since I960.    This it clearly has done, as theattached table shows (Annex III).    We are dealing with generalunemployment over wide areas, as we were before 1959.8.     I am convinced that in the North-Sast at any rate the I960policy does not now make sense.    Whether we consider thegeneral issue of population drift, the admitted need of a regionalplan, or the specific question of the existence and persistence ofa high rate of unemployment over the whole area, the region (or at least its industrialised belt) must be looked at as a whole.    Ido not suggest that we should conceal the change.    We should saypublicly that the problem of the North-East was such that we were convinced it could only be tackled on this basis.    We need not shirkpublicity of this kind.    It would be welcomed in the region and is consistent with, and indeed a logical consequence of, my assignment.
9.     The Budget has effected a further, and crucial, change inthe whole nature of the districts concerned.    Before 3rd April the districts were relevant as being the places which qualified for thevarious types of Government assistance under the principal Act.Apart from increasing these types of assistance the Budget makeslocation within a development district the qualification for &quot;free depreciation&quot; - the effects of which, I am advised, are quite likelyto prove spectacular.    To my mind it is unthinkable that theChancellor intended to exclude Gateshead (Team Valley) orNewcastle, or for that matter Durham from this vital benefit.If that is the intention the result will be to make planning for the region ineffective and investment depend on artificial criteria.V.10.     If there are other areas of the country v/hich are in asimilar situation it may be that we should have to deal with themin a similar way.     I have not looked at the detailed figures inScotland or Wales, or the North-West, and therefore cannot say how far the position of the North-East is unique.    My contentionis that this is the right thing to do in the North-East, and if it isalso the right thing to do for other areas, no doubt it should bedone.    But I am not sure that it is.11.     The regional plan for the Ncrth-East which officials expect to complete during May v/ill make detailed recommendations on our future policy for the stimulation of economic growth in the region.In the meantime the Population and Employment Committee agreed(P. S. (63) 7th Meeting) that we should not await the completion ofthis plan before attempting to resolve differences of view on themanner in which existing legislation should be used in the North-East in present circumstances.    I am sure that this is right andthat we should arrive at an early decision in this important matter.HAILS HAMOffice of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science,       S. W. 1.10th April, 1963.-3-
