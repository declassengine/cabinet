DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(us) 23722ND OCTOBER,  19h7.CABINETPOOD POP europe memorandum by the Minister of PoodThe motion which Sir Arthur Salter and others have putdown for debate on Priday 26th October expresses deep concern about the danger of starvation in Europe during the coming -winter and calls on the Government to take steps to prevent the disaster,  inter alia,  &quot;by increasing supplies of food andother necessaries for Europe through the release of stores ofconsumable goods&quot;,      I will set out in the following paragraphs the line of argument which I suggest the Government spokesmen      -rshould take,2.      Long before De-day stocks of food, were built up in theU.K. and in North America to ship to Europe Immediately afterliberations    Prom D-day to the end of September, 19h7 some850,000 tons of food were supplied to Europe from this countryalone,,    It was recognised, however, that overseas imports couldonly provide partial relief for the countries of North and.western Europe where before the war indigenous productionprovided for well over half their supplies of food.    Unfortunatelynearly all of them have suffered a serious decline in their agricultural production   - the destruction and dislocation causedby the war, the serious shortage of manpower,  fertilisers,fee dingstuffs and machinery and this summer&apos;s drought over wide areas have led to a decline in the agricultural production in western Europe of as much as 20  to 30fi compared with thepre-war level.3.      There is no doubt therefore that some parts of europe will be short of food this winter.    The calorie level per headper day for the average non-farm consumer varies from as lowas approximately 2000 in Prance to nearly 3000 in Denmark.,The comparable figure for the -U.K.  is 2870 but in some european countries differential rations are provided for certain classes;thus in Belgium the normal consumer is entitled to 2800 grams of bread a week but the heavy worker to b-000 and the coal miner to6000,      Nevertheless,  a diet of 2000 calories a day, althoughsufficient, If containing enough protein and other nutrients, tomaintain a reasonable nutritional standard for a limited period,is not high enough to promote anything approaching full physicalvigour for the population as a whole.    Moreover, in the balkans and the ex-enemy countries the position is much less satisfactory.    The present caloric level in the British sone ofGermany is only about 1500,      It will be seen from a paper on thesupply of wheat to Germany aim Austria (which is &quot;being circulated.)that there will be most serious difficulties in maintainingeven this level./ of copy NO./&apos; p

k.     There is therefore a continued need for considerable importsox food into Europe.    Unfortunately the world food outlook for thecurrent crop year is seriously diquieting.    For the twelve month sending June,  191+6 there will be substantial deficits of sugar,meat and bacon, eggs and egg products, fats, milk products, wheat and rice.    These staple foods are subject to allocation by theC.F.B.    The Paying Allied Governments of Europe (and U.N.R.R.A.on &quot;behalf of the non-paying allies) submit their requirements,as does the U.K. , to the C.F.B., and, as members of the commodity committees of the Board, take part in the work ofsharing the limited supplies available amongst all claimants.5*      Under this procedure supplies are now going forward to europe.    Difficulties of shipment and of port facilities havebeen largely overcome.    The great difficulty is world shortage ofsupplies and unless the major exporting countries are able toincrease exports the liberated countries will not receive in full the supplies they need during the coming winter.6.      In these circumstances what further can the United Iu.ngd.om,itself a great importer of food, do to help Europe?     With theobject of reducing our dependence on overseas supplies to aminimum during the current year and thereby making a contribution towards eliminating world deficits and making more food, availablefor Europe,  stocks in the U.K.  are being reduced to the lowestlevel compatible with the maintenance of distribution under present conditions.    It is exprcsted that in the 12 month sending 31st October, 19h7 total stocks in the U.K. will havebeen reduced by approximately l-g- million tons.    It must alsobe remembered that part of our present requirements of some ofthe most important foods can only be obtained from the U.S.A.and our currency difficulties are well known.    Apart from the acute v/orld shortage of most foods we:  now have the added,uncertainty as to whether we can afford to pay for the food,needed to maintain our existing rations.    There is therefore no prospect that we shall be able to spare anything from our existing stocks to send to Europe.7.      It has been suggested, that we should help Europe by reducing our own rations.    The contribution resulting from a smallreduction in the rations of 1+5 million people would, not effect the nutritional standard of the 250 odd millions of western and Central Europe.    It would certainly endanger the health andimpair the vigour of many of our own people.    Such a stepcannot bo contemplated.8.      Others have proposed that individuals should forege^the use of some of their coupons and points in order that therationed food not claimed should be sent to Europe.    Thisscheme presents administrative difficulties which, with thebest will in the world, cannot be overcome under our presentsystem of distribution, and in any case the contribution would be negligble in relation to the needs of Europe.

9.      Some individuals and societies have claimed to be allowedto send parcels of food which they have saved or collected to people in Europe.    This claim,   save in exceptional cases,should continue to be resisted.    His Majesty&apos;s Government has consistently held that procurement in bulk in the supplyingcountry and distribution in the recipient country by . N.R.R.A.  or the National Governments concerned is by far the best way of ensuring that the limited supplies availableare shared equitably between country and country and between individuals in each country.10.    Up to this point I am clear as to the line which shouldbe taken.    The following paragraphs set out a possible lineof    defence against the &quot;Save Europe Now&quot; campaigners if mycolleagues think that by an immediate concession the campaigncan be brought to an end.    It must be remembered that thosewho want to send food to Europe at the expense of thiscountry are only a small minority.    Nevertheless,  if thesituation in Europe becomes very serious,  this minority maywell become influential when it has facts to work upon.Accordingly,  if my colleagues consider it advisable,  I am prepared to make one or any of the following concessions:-(a)    that I will discuss with sponsors of the motion and other interested parties their scheme for sending food to Europe from the U.K.,and will consider making shipping facilities available to take to Europe any cannedfoods bought by consumers with their points and collected and made available for shipmentby those who wish to organise such collectionsprovided that they can satisfy me that it willnot involve waste of food.(b)    that I will further examine whether it ispossible as a result of a reduction in military requirements and for any other reason,to make additional supplies of food availablefor the British Zones in Germany and Anetriaor for U. N, R. R.A.  or some other relieforganisation for distribution to displaced persons and other people in Europe in greatest need (I could use for this purpose without involving any deprivation of the Britishconsumers or reduction of the ration, between and 5 million surplus army packs containinghighly concentrated food prepared for the assault on Singapore and other militaryoperations, 3 million lbs.  of tea,  some meat and vegetable stew,  about A or 5 thousand tonsof dried fruit,  small quantities of cod liveroil,  orange jelly, potato flour, dried cabbage,dehydrated meat,  biscuits,  cereal products andpossibly some potatoes.)B.
