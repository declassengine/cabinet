IllPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.Copy No.    6 9CABINET.SURRENDER OF REQUISITIONED ACCOMMODATION IN LONDON;.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.I wish to call attention to the serious position in London due to the shortageof office accommodation and to the difficulties underlying the fact that GovernmentHeadquarters staffs occupy as offices some 6 million feet of requisitioned space.2. The Headquarters staffs of Government Departments number 183,000compared with 80,000 before the war. 137,000 of these are accommodated inLondon and the remaining 46,000 in the provinces. The 137,000 occupy15-1 million sq. ft. of accommodation in London, made up as follows : Sg. ft.Crown Buildings    ...............      5,000,000Hired Premises      .....    ............      4,500,000Requisitioned Premises    ...      ...      ...      ...      6,000,000The requisitioned accommodation consists of 1,200,0002,800,0001,300,000140,000160,00040,000440,000Total        .........      ......      6,080,0003. The picture is not complete without reference to the 46,000 Headquartersstaffs in the provinces. About 22,000 of these are working in hotels and living inlodgings and boarding houses in Colwyn Bay, Llandudno, Blackpool, Harrogate,Bath, &amp;c. The retention of these hotels has already led to protests, and a demandfor their release in time for the 1946 holiday season will be made and pressedvigorously. It is to be expected that Departments will press for the return toLondon of some of these staffs, but difficulties about. office and residential accommodation are bound to arise in whatever town they work.4. Under the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act, 1945, the maximum period for which requisitioned accommodation can be retained is two years fromthe expiry of emergency powers. These powers will lapse in February next, buta provision has been inserted in the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers)Bill to the effect that the war period for the purpose of the Requisitioned land and War Works Act shall not cease with the expiry of the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act, 1939, but shall include any period after that expiry during whichthe Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act is in force. The intention,unless the provisions in the Bill are amended, is to keep it in force for five years with provision for annual renewal, so that the period for retaining requisitionedaccommodation will extend to seven years and more.5. The continued retention by Government of all the requisitioned spacefor the whole period of transitional powers would cause hardship and much heart-burning and can, I suggest, be ruled out as inexpedient and impracticablepolitically.   Urgent requests for the return of their property are being received[30722]SECRET.CP. (45) 235.18th October, 1945.Offices...Houses        ...HotelsDepartmental StoresShops........Miscellaneous
from private firms on the ground that they cannot conduct their businessesemciently, or expand to meet domestic and export needs, or even adequately housestaffs returning from the forces. These requests are being supported by Chambers- ^-a?31!61,06&apos; tere ls already much dissatisfaction at the lack of offices, but itis dirhcult to see how the position can be remedied for some time to come. the plain fact is that there is not enough office accommodation in London. new building ceased during the war; air-raid damage aggravated the shortage * and heavy requisitionings by Government Departments have had the result of makingthe situation acute.6. In the circumstances the Ministry of Works have been considering how best to meet the situation. Obviously all the requisitioned accommodation neednot, and indeed cannot, be surrendered immediately. Negotiations with owners of requisitioned property may result in tenancies being obtained for750,000 sq. ft., thus providing more permanent tenure on mutually acceptableterms. The 1,300,000 sq. ft. of houses referred to in paragraph 2 comprise oldand large premises with basements. They are used as offices by agreement withthe Ministry of Health and their retention causes no hardship. More old houses,now unoccupied, e.g., the Chester Gate houses by Nash in the vicinity ofRegents Park, could be made available and adapted as Government offices to theextent of approximately half a million sq. ft. In the aggregate it seems,therefore, that, out of the total of 6 million requisitioned feet, arrangements canbe made either to retain or replace by other accommodation some 2-J million sq. ft.without injury to the interests of private householders or of expropriated businessfirms. This leaves 3-^ million sq. ft. of requisitioned space to be surrendered, andthe question is how best to bring this about,7. The first step obviously is to make sure that staffs who served a warneed only are reduced at once to the minimum necessary to wind up the service.The next step is to ensure that accommodation retained is used to the efullest extent. I suggest that all Departments should be instructed to concentrate their staffs so as to surrender not less than 10 per cent, of the total space now occupiedand to co-operate with my Department in making the necessary arrangements.Departments whose staffs are contracting should, even at the price ofinconvenience, arrange to give up a substantially greater percentage of space.This policy of &quot; squeezing up,&quot; to be effective, would require a programme ofreallocation, including rehousing of staffs in less central accommodation; but itis estimated that by this means it would be possible to surrender about1-1 million sq. ft. of space. But a policy of &quot; squeezing up&quot; and reallocation,including the removal of staffs to buildings less modern and less central, cannotbe carried out without inconvenience and even loss of efficiency and, if theGovernment accept this proposal, I must ask for the support of my colleagues in enforcing what undoubtedly will be unpopular measures.8. Even assuming that the above economies of space can be effected, therewill still be leeway to be made up amounting to 2 million sq. ft. of space, andI see no alternative to the erection of temporary office buildings in the suburbsof London if this amount of requisitioned accommodation is to be given up.Obviously the more staff reductions that can be effected the more this temporarybuilding programme will be relieved.9. I put forward with real reluctance the suggestion that standards of accommodation should be lowered, even temporarily, as there is no doubt in my mind that the time is ripe for improving the standard of office accommodation for Government staffs generally. I suggest, therefore, that, when making anannouncement that staffs must concentrate in existing buildings as an interim measure the Government should let it be known that it is their intention, as soonas the supply of labour permits, to embark on a programme, both in London andthe Provinces, for providing more permanent Crown buildings so that CivilService staffs will have, in the not too distant future, modern office buildings with suitable furniture and equipment. ministry of Works, S.E. 1,18th October, 1945.* It is estimated that in the City alone about 25 per cent, of the office space has been destroyed or damaged.   The Holborn Council assess their loss roughly at 20-25 per cent.
