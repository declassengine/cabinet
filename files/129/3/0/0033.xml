Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET.-I     i .&apos;i m...... nCP. (45) 233.16th October, 1945.CABINET.DEFENCE AGAINST DISEASE.Memorandum by the Minister of State.AT their meeting on the 6th September^) the Cabinet invited me to under-take a general review of the position in order to make sure that all possible steps are being taken to assist the peoples of Europe and to protect our own peopleagainst the dangers envisaged from outbreaks of epidemics in Europe duringthe coming winter.I have discussed this problem with those of my colleagues who are mostintimately concerned, and the whole question has also been extensively reviewed by a body of officials.As a result, a number of recommendations have been made and approved and action is being taken as a matter of urgency to put them into effect. these recommendations have as an immediate aim to improve our knowledge of thedanger spots on the Continent and of the preparations to meet outbreaks of disease. A Mission is shortly to be sent to the serious high risk areas, both to report and to improve liaison with the authorities on the spot. Among other measures now in train, steps are being taken to improve the reporting of anyoutbreaks of infectious disease, transport, the sanitary control of movement tothis country in the event of an outbreak, the sanitary control of refugees entering&apos; high risk areas from other parts of Europe, and to deal with the danger fromrats and other pests. It is my hope that these measures will have a materialeffect in assisting the fight against disease on the Continent in the coming months,and will also serve as an additional protection to the people of the UnitedKingdom against epidemics.There is general agreement, however, among all those who have considered this problem that no preventive medical measures can be an adequate substitute for the defence against disease which would be provided by an improvement infeeding, clothing and housing conditions.The evidence at present available suggests that so far as the United Kingdomand the Western European Allies are concerned, the situation is not such as tosuggest that the populations are exposed to an unacceptable risk of epidemicdisease.   In the case of former enemy territory, however, the situation is different.The present objective in the British Zone of Occupation in Germany is a ration scale of only 1,500 calories for the normal consumer. Although special classes of the population receive supplementary rations, the average will be substantially below the figure of 2,000 calories which is generally held to be theminimum reasonable amount. In the case of Austria, the Council of foreign ministers recently laid down a diet of 1,550 calories as the immediate objective,rising to 2,000 and above as supplies become available.There is room for a difference of opinion as to whether a diet of 1,500 caloriesis sufficient to maintain health in normal circumstances. Conditions in Germany,however, are in no way normal. As is well known, housing and sanitary conditionsare catastrophic, and moreover the food-stuffs available will, for the most part, be restricted to bread, potatoes and winter vegetables, that is to say, an unbalanceddiet seriously lacking in fats and proteins.(!) CM. (45) 29th Conclusions, 2nd Minute.12978   [30717]Copy No.7
It is, therefore, impossible to avoid the conclusion that a diet of this level inpresent living conditions in Germany is definitely not sufficient as a protection against epidemics.To remedy this it is clearly desirable to send not merely more food but alsomore varied foods. I recognise the great difficulty, owing to world shortages, ofsparing proteins and fats. If it proves to be impossible to provide a morebalanced diet then it is all the more important to increase the supply of wheat.The present world wheat position has been set out in a paper by the Ministerof Food(2) and was discussed by the Lord Presidents Committee at -their meetingon 12th October.(3) My colleagues are, therefore, fully aware of the difficulties involved. I must, however, emphasise the urgent need of making an improve-ment in the diet.Any change in rations in occupied territory would need to be discussed withthe other occupying powers and, if a change is to be made, it is essential that action should be initiated immediately, since otherwise the increase would come too late.I suggest, therefore, for the approval of my colleagues : (i) that discussions should he opened immediately with the other occupying powers with a view to raising German (and in accordance with therecent recommendation Austrian) rations to the extent that suppliescan be made available, though this should be done without in any wayreducing current British rations and without placing enemy territory in a more favourable position than the Allies;(ii) that the possibility of increased supplies of wheat should be explored inthe light of the (discussion, /at the Lord Presidents Committee on the12th October.P. J. X.-B.Foreign Office.,16th October, 1945.(?) L.P. (45) 181.&apos;(*) L.P. (45) 37th Meeting, 1st Minute.
