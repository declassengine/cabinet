Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.Copy No.   64CABINET.NATIONAL HOSPITAL SERVICE.Memorandum by the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forScotland.THE Minister of Health in his Paper CP. (45) 205 has suggested a radicaldeparture from the hospital service proposals contained in the 1944 White Paper.The broad lines of the organisation of this service in Scotland and in Englandcould not be fundamentally different, and in considering the new proposals I have therefore had in mind especially their applicability in Scotland.2. With the Minister&apos;s conception of a national hospital service I am incordial agreement. In Scotland there is already a small-scale national hospital service, in the shape of the seven hospitals with some 5,000 beds run by theDepartment of Health within the Emergency Hospital Scheme. A completenational service would ensure the best use being made of these units in thefuture. Moreover, nearly 50,000&apos; civilian patients have passed through thesehospitals since they were opened early in the war; the personal experience ofthese patients would be an important factor in securing a public welcome for thescheme.3. My only doubt concerns the proposed exclusion of the teaching hospitals.In Scotland a hospital service of which the six voluntary teaching hospitals didnot form an integral part, would be gravely crippled. These hospitals contain4,000 key beds, rather more than one-quarter of all the voluntary hospital beds inScotland, and have the services sometimes the exclusive services of the mosteminent specialists. Moreover, the exclusion of these teaching hospitals fromthe scheme, despite their admitted need for substantial support from public funds, would weaken the argument for imposing public control on other voluntary hospitals.4. The pre-eminence of these hospitals seems to me a reason for includingthem in the national hospital service rather than for excluding them, if thenational service is not to suffer by comparison. The desirability of leaving aseparate field for innovation and experiment also seems to me questionable. Itmight be taken to imply that hospitals in the national service would be run on suchrigid lines that no such freedom could be enjoyed by the staff working in them&quot;;and, moreover, the need for large resources and a wide sphere of operation hasbeen the argument used in other fields for bringing the State into questions of research and development..5. I agree with the Minister that the State should not control medical education, but I do not see that this need be a consequence of including teaching hospitals in the scheme. The Inter-Departmental Committee on Medical Schools(the Goodenough Committee) which considered exhaustively the organisation of medical teaching, saw no objection to the use of publicly controlled local authorityhospitals as teaching hospitals, and it seems to me that the Committee&apos;s proposals[30647]SECRETCP. (45) 207.5t/t October, 1945.
on organisation would be at least as applicable to hospitals functioning as partof a national hospital service. Account could be taken of the special positionof teaching hospitals, in settling the.composition, and delegated powers of theappropriate District Committees in the Minister&apos;s plan.6.,., I suggest, therefore, that we should consider carefully whether, the disadvantage of leaving the teaching hospitals outside a nationally adniihi^erMservice are in fact outweighed by the advantages in particular, the moderationit might secure in opposition from vested interests. By making the&apos; proposeddistinction between teaching hospitals and other important hospitals &apos;e.g., hospitals run by large and progressive local authorities some of theopposition might indeed be sharpened.G. B.Scottish Office, S.W. 1,5th October, 1945.o
