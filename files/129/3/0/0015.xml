Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECEET. Copy No.CP. (45) 215.9th October, 1945.CABINET.LAND USE BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IN RELATION TOTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.DURING the war the Service Departments have had to make extensivedemands on the use of land for operational and training purposes. Theextent of their holdings in the United Kingdom was given in the Second Reportof the Select Committee on National Expenditure, Session 1944-45. TheAdmiralty were shown as having requisitioned 26,000 acres of land, the WarOffice 600,000 acres of land (actually 470,000 at the time of the Report), and theAir Ministry 253,000 acres. In addition, at that time the Air Ministry owned120,000 acres and the War Office 240,000 acres. The present area held by service Departments is likely to be substantially reduced, but not to anything like pre-war dimensions. It must be expected that there will be a largepermanent land-holding, and in order that Service requirements may be fittedin with other important demands on the limited area of land available in thiscountry, the declaration and close examination of a co-ordinated programme are matters of urgency.2. These questions are of particular moment to my Department. It ismy duty under Statute to see that the best choice is made between competinguses of land; and I desire strongly to press the need for a comprehensive reviewof the projects of Service Departments involving the acquisition or continueduse of land. The issues arising relate not only to the amenity of many areasof great natural beauty, historical association and recreational value, but, on occasions, to the whole way of life of communities and to the future of manydistricts.3. Most of the land is held under requisition, and public demand &quot;for therelease of some of it is becoming insistent. The Service Departments have not so far found it possible to assess their post-war requirements and are reluctant to release land which they may need permanently. In some cases, particularly where substantial works have been carried out, they are taking steps to acquiresites which they now hold, and even to purchase additional land.4. With regard to Service airfields, my predecessor, in a memorandum to the Reconstruction Committee (R. (45) 21), drew attention to the materialbearing of their retention there are over 600-on the future planning of manydistricts. The then Prime Minister, in a note of the 23rd February, 1945(W.P. (45) 110), directed that the Chiefs of Staff should submit a broadappreciation of military requirements for airfields, and an ad hoc CabinetCommittee has been appointed to review the position, airfield by airfield, and determine inter alia how far the needs of civil aviation and aircraft production could be met by the use of Service airfields.5. Decisions on projects in contemplation by the other Service Depart-ments may also have important consequences. It may often be the case that the projects of the Service Department will have to go on, but Local authorities must be informed as soon as possible of the use decided upon by Government,in view of the importance of that knowledge to the discharge of their duty[30668]
in planning properly for the future of their districts. I will give one or twoexamples: (a) The War Office has been in consultation with my Department regardingthe acquisition of sites for anti-aircraft defences, each site involvingsome sixty acres of land. It is understood that the sites so farnotified represent only a proportion of the total. The location ofthese sites is bound to affect the development of adjoining land.(b) A War Office military camp has been established on the south side of theCity of Gloucester. The City Council contend that they are unableto plan this side of the city until it is decided whether, as is in con-templation, this camp must remain after the war.(c) Similarly, the whole basis of the redevelopment proposals for Plymouth&apos; depends on the future proposals for the Dockyard; whether thereshould be extensions, and the extent of them, has a fundamental bear-ing on the future of the town. The proposals involve the resettlement of a substantial proportion of the population and the shift of theimportant Devonport shopping centre. In this case the proposalsof the Admiralty are definite and have been made known to the city council, but the case illustrates the point.6. Moreover, knowledge of the future of Government developments under-taken during the war and of any new developments is necessary not only in orderthat Local Authorities can proceed to plan their districts, but in order that an appropriate choice can be made between post-war Government projects where, assometimes happens, they are in conflict. In illustration of this point I would refer to the establishment of the Aeronautical Research Station at Bedford,involving an ultimate increase of the population of the area by some 10,000 people,to which my Department agreed without knowledge of the fact that it was also proposed to transfer some 2,000 civil servants to the same town, giving a furtherpotential increase of four or five thousand in the population, one result being,for an indefinite period, a strain on the housing resources of the town. More-over, the additional population may have to be accommodated by an extension ofthe town on a scale which is, on various grounds, undesirable, in particular thatit means undue inroads on good agricultural land.7. Several large coastal areas are under contemplation for such purposes has bombing and tank-firing ranges and battle-training schools. In one instance, atleast, the proposal for the extension of an experimental aircraft armament station and proof range at Pendine would involve the exclusion of the public from oneof the finest stretches of sands in the country. In view of the demand for holidayfacilities and for free access to the coast, this is a most important matter andany proposal to devote large areas of the coast permanently to military purposesplainly needs the closest scrutiny from this point of view. Another importantexample which has aroused considerable public agitation relates to the Isle ofPurbeck, and involves an area 11 miles long and 8 miles broad, running fromPoole Harbour in the east to Lulworth Cove in the west. It was an area of exceptional beauty and quite unspoilt. During the war more than half of the island was requisitioned by the military and the population were turned out and accommodated in temporary billets. Grave doubts have now arisen locallyas to whether the War Office intend to release the area. Yet again at Harlechthere is a proposal for the permanent retention of an anti-tank gunnery schoolinvolving a considerable stretch of the Merioneth coast. As a result of itspresence, sailing in Tremadoc Bay is almost impossible, the bathing beach isclosed, the use of the Royal St. David&apos;s golf course is restricted, and the enjoyment of this tourist centre for Snowdonia is seriously endangered.8. It is desirable that, as has already been agreed in the case of airfields,there should be set on foot by the Admiralty and the War Office a broad apprecia-tion of their future military requirements in respect of land use. (The latterin particular hold nearly a million acres of land.) Meantime, as this appreciationmay take some time to prepare, I suggest that the Admiralty and the War office should help provisionally by giving early notice of any acquisitions, whether byagreement or otherwise, that may be under contemplation. There should in allcases be timely consultation with my Department and other Departments con-cerned. Instances occur even to-day where projects are well on the way tofruition and gain considerable publicity (e.g., Purbeck and Harlech) before I am informed. In such circumstances and in the absence of timely consultation, an assessment of the case on merits can be only too easily prejudiced.
9. As soon as the broad appreciation as a whole of their future military requirements by the Admiralty and the War Office is beginning to take definiteshape, it would, I, suggest, on the analogy of the airfields&quot; case, be useful to have some inter-departmental machinery of officials from all Departments concerned,who would consider them in relation to other requirements, see how far the twosets of requirements can be brought into harmony with each other, and call theattention of Ministers to unresolved difficulties. In this connection it seems to methat a guiding principle should be that, in the case of sites, the continued peace-time use of which by the Service Departments would be highly detrimental on general planning grounds, the onus should be on the Service Departments tojustify any permanent retention.10. I appreciate that it may well be the case in some instances that, what-ever may be the effect on the locality, the needs of defence may be overriding. Itis, however, apparent that the detriment to a wide area of such a project as abombing or artillery range may be very serious; and accordingly it would appearto be worth considering whether at least some of the peace-time training establish-ments could not, by consent of the Governments concerned, be located in theDominions or elsewhere in British territory.L.
