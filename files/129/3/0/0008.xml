(this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C R E T0.2. (us) 20 86TH OCTOBER,  19U5.COPY NO.    /CABINETHOUSINGMemo rand urn by the Minister of health i propose to make a comprehensive statement of theGovernment&apos;s policy on housing at an early date.      The occasionwould be on a motion on housing for which the Government would undertake to find time.I propose in advance to lay a Paper before bothHouses setting out the facts of the situation so that members will be acquainted with them in advance.      this paper will set out the number of new houses needed to provide aseparate hp us for each&quot; family f  the additional number needed toreplace slums and relieve overcrowding,  the extent of war damage,and the progress so far made with the housing programme.Policy will be reserved for my: statement.I ask the approval of my colleagues to this procedure,and to the general line of the statement I shall make, whichwill be as follows.1.      I do not propose to make any definite promises.Progress depends on materials and labour and precise forecastingis impossible.      But I shall set targets for the localauthorities.      And I shall publish monthly statements of progress,2.      The programme will have three stages:(l)  750,000 houses to offer a separate house to eachfamily.      These are to make up arrears and to replacedestruction.(2)  500,000 more to complete slum clearance andovercrowding programmes initiated before the war.I should make it clear that this is only a beginning with slum clearance and the  abatement of overcrowding.(3) Thereafter a large scale continuous programme tomeet continuing needs,  to provide a good home foreach family and to secure the much neededredevelopment of our urban centres.      I would pointout that the building of J+ million houses will do no more than eliminate working class houses more than80 years old.

3.      These houses will be permanent houses.      We shall presson with the production of temporary houses in accordance withthe programme which v/e have inherited,  but I must bring out thepoint that at the tine when we took office production was verypoor,  and cost had become fantastic.      We arc preparing a white Paper&apos; as to the facts which,  if my colleagues agree,should be published before my statement is made.      We shall not increase this temporary house programme beyond the allocationsalready made.L.      We shall build in every material and by every methodthat is available or that we can discover.      Some types ofstandardised productions we shall leave to the initiative ofLocal Authorities,  under central stimulus.      Other types mustbe initiated centrally,  and we shall carry out experiments and place orders as necessary on behalf of Local Authorities.5.      We shall rely on the full co-operation of LocalAuthorities and wo know that we shall get it.      But if for any reason any local authority cannot or will not make sufficientprogress I shall not hesitate te exercise my powers to act intheir place.6.      For our immediate programme we look mainly to thebuilding of houses by Local Authorities for letting to thelower income groups.      We must secure provision    for both large and small families,   for old persons ana for single persons.We want balanced communities and Local Authorities will be encouraged to provide some larger houses for letting to higher .income groups,  though actual building of such houses may haveto await the satisfaction of the first priority needs.7.      Houses for letting to the lower income groups musthave the first call on labour, materials and components.Local Authorities will be authorised te issue licences for thebuilding of houses by other persons,  but only so long as theydo not interfere with the pro mess of the maximum programme which the Local Authority      can carry out.      Such licences will besubject to conditions as to size,  selling price or rent andv/o do not propose to introduce legislation for any subsidy insuch cases.6.      Houses built by Local Authorities for the lowerincome groups must be let at rents which these groups can afford.      I am in discussion with the Chancellor of theExchequer about the level of rents to be adopted as a basis forsubs idy.9.      We must secure an improved standard over that providedbefore the war,  both in equipment and in size.      I shalllay down a standard of.not less than 900 feet super for theordinary three bedroomed houses.      This represents anincrease of 100 feet super over the pre-war standard.10.      The financial arrangements, with the Local Authorities&quot;/ill be dealt with by legislation which I shall undertake  tointroduce in the near-future.      How that a sufficient  number oftenders have been obtained to form a proper judgment of thepresent cost of building there is material on which I canformulate proposals  to  the Chancellor of the Hxchequer and consult with Associations of Local Authorities as is customarybefore Legislation is introduced.      These discussions cannot becompleted before my statement on policy is made but I shall  make proposals to my colleagues as soon as possible.-2-

11.      Legislation will be introduced to apply the same procedure as in the Temporary Housing Act,  19kht  for theacquisition of land for the temporary houses,  to acquisitionfor all purposes for which local authorities have compulsory powers of acquisition:    the importance to the housing pro grammeof speedy acquisition- of land on proper-terms will be stressed.12.      The success of the programme rests on the establishmentof a proper range of building prices.      Building has to begin ata time of high prices but. I propose to make it clear that thosemust be regarded as the peak,      I shall refuse to approvetenders which appear to me to be too high and I shall by my administrative action make it clear that a reductionof prices must be secured in the months ahead.      Mycolleagues will appreciate that this action may for a timekeep down the figure of approved tenders and that therefore the gap between programmes and actual construction may widen.But we must&apos;begin as we mean to go on.13*      The establishment of satisfactory house building costsrests not only on the control of building contractors throughtender prices but on the efficiency and keenness of thebuilding operatives,and of the producers of building materials and components.     -I should refer to the following points -(l)  contractors must look for less profit on more houses and not to more profit on fewer houses;(2)  output of the building operatives must be improved;otherwise traditional building may have to give way too th e r s y s tems of c o n s t r uc t ion;(3)  the costs of building materials and components mustbe subject to such control and investigation intocosts as are necessary to secure that production ismade available in the first place for prioritypurposes and in particular for housing-,  and that theprices charged are reasonable in relation to costs  ofproduction;    this  is the responsibility of the Ministriesof &quot; - Worte  and Supper;(k)  ord ore will be placed by the Government for materials and compoBHSnts as may be necessary  in order to s ecureproduction required for the housing programme, andany necessary arrangements made for the distribution and use of these materials and components:    legislation will be introduced to provide the necessary finance for this purpose.      This is the responsibility of theMinistry of Works.lh.      Immediate relief can be secured by progress in the repair of war damage, by the conversion and adaptation ofhouses, and by the requisitioning of unoccupied houses.      I donot propose however to embark on elaborate conversion, whichcould absorb an immense amount of building labour, until new building is well under way..

15.    I am submitting separately to my colleagues my proposals for short term emergency action for facilitatingand securing the use of spare accommodation in occupiedhouses, and I shall refer, to the contribution/ which&apos; canloo made in this way and to the procedure to &quot;bo adopted for this purpose.16.    It may &quot;bo convenient to summarise the matters to &quot;bodealt wit hi by legislation and defence regulation,  though some of these have been referred to in the preceding paragraphs.I,    Legislation(1)    the financial assistance to LocalAuthorities5(2)    simplified procedure for the acquisitionof land,&quot;(3)    to increase the value of houses inrespect of which advances may be made byLocal Authorities under the    SmallDwellings Requisition Acts from 800 to&apos; 1,200;(A)    control of furnished Settings.II.    Dcfenoe Rergilations(1)    to secure continued control of the selling price or rents .of houses erected under licence;(2)    to provide facilities for occupiers ofhouses to malco spare accommodation available;(3)    to prohibit the conversion of houses forother pur-poses without licence.17.      I;shall refer to the intention not to introduceearly legislation to deal with the selling pi rice ofhouses, and to the question of providing grants forthe reconstruction of rural houses.      I have invited theappropriate Committee of the Housing Advisory Committeeto report on this, and I shall look at it again when Ihave their report.Ministry of Health,8 AM.&apos;   6TH 0CTOLLS,  1945.
