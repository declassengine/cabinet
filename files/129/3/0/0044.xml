Copy No.0. -4-B, 1 N.. E . TGEYLOl^^ONReport by the Lord Privy Seal, Chairman of the Colonial_____^_________^____,^-tJAfi^3jLrs CoMnittee_____________________  ^ _______   ^ ____-At its two last meetings on October 15th and october 22nd,  the Committee has had under consideration a draft Statement of Policy on Constitutional Reform inGey Ion submitted by the Secretary of State for theColonies.    The draft Statement (Annex   to this Paper)is intended for publication simultaneously in thiscountry and in Ceylon immediately after approval by theCabinet,  as a White Paper announcing His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s decisions on the recommendations of the Soulbury Commission.    The Colonial Affairs Comm..tteehas carefully considered tho terms of the draft statement in the light of the arguments advanced byMr.  Senaxiayake,  the Leader of the Ceylon State Council,in his recent discussions with the Secretary of State,of the advice tendered to the Secretary of State bythe Governor of Ceylon,  and of the views of the Governmentof. India on the Soulbury Report now received by theSecretary of State for India.    The Committee recommendthat the Cabinet should approve the draft Statement as now revised in accordance with the Committee&apos;s views, andshould authorise its immediate publication, as desired by tho Secretory of State for the Colonies in time for-consideration by the Ceylon Board of Ministers before themeeting of the Ceylon State Council on November 6-th.2.        The following paragraphs explain the genesis of thodraft Statement and summarise the views of Mr. Sonannyako,the Governor of Ceylon and the Government of India,Which have been taken into account in framing its terms.3*        In accordance with the conclusions of the Cabineton the 11th Septembers the Soulbury Report was published on the 9th October simultaneously in this country,  in ceylon and in India,  and on that date copies were givento the Ceylon Board of Ministers and the Governor-General&apos;  executive Council in India,  and released also In theDominions.    In his discussions with the Secretary ofState for tho Colonies, Mr.  Scnanayake put forward theplea that Ceylon Ministers had originally accepted the19h3 Declaration as a basis for interim reforms whichwould enable them to increase the war effort of Ceylon.Now that the war is over, they were no longer preparedto proceed on tho basis of the 19h3 Declaration, butwished to press for the grant to Ceylon of dominion status.    Mr.  Sananayalce made it clear that, although hehad no formal mandate from the Board of Ministers to this^__^___p j____ effect*   CM.

effect, he was expressing not only his own views, butthe views of the great majority of the people of Ceylonin making this plea.    In accordance with the conclusionof the Cabinet the Secretary of State refrained from making any statement to Mr.  Senanayake on the subjectof Dominion Status for Ceylon.If.        Mr. Sonanayake was very disappointed at having toleave this country without having been able to reach any decisions or agreements with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwhich he could show in Ceylon as the  result of his mission.Ho has made it clear both before and since his return to ceylon that he now regards himself as free to adoptwhatever line of action may seem to him best, and theGovernor has reported that Mr.  Sonanayakc.has somewhat -reluctantly .agreed to await the decisions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government before he decides whether he mustalign himself with those elements in Ceylon who are determined to press for Dominion Status at all costs.It therefore appears very doubtful whether without some concession by His Majesty&apos;s Government by which he candemonstrate that his mission to England has not beenfruitless, be will now be willing to sponsor the Soulburyrecommendations before the Ceylon State Council as itwas: at one time hoped.5&apos;        The Committee share the view of tho Secretary ofState for the Colonies that the time is not yet ripe forthe immediate advancement of Ceylon to the constitutional status of a Dominion.    In the Committee&apos;s opinion,  therecon bo no doubt on general grounds that it would be premature for Ceylon to be granted Dominion Status inadvance of India and Durrani    Moreover,  the Sinhalesemajority, whose power under a completely self-governingConstitution would be preponderant, hove yet to provetheir willingness and capacity to operate self-governing institutions in collaboration with the minorities and havingdue regard to their legitimate rights and susceptibilities.Nevertheless the Committee have been impressed by thearguments advanced by Mr.  Senanayako in relation to theconstitutional promise made to Burma of Dominion Status;and the Committee agree with the Secretary of State thatthe chances of acceptance of the Soulbury recommendations by the State Council and people of Ceylon will be remoteunless it is possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government togive some assurance of reconsideration of  the constitutionalissue in the not too distant future.      The Committee therefore recommend that His Majesty*s Government&apos;s decisions should(i)    lay down the general lines of a Constitution forCeylon based on the Soulbury recommendations,  and(ii)    also proclaim His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;intention of initiating a review of theConstitutional issue in consultation with the ceylon Government;,  six years after theintroduction of the new Constitution,  in thelight of the circumstances then obtaining andsubject to such provisions as may be necessaryto satisfy the security requirements of theBritish Commonwealth.    The object of this review

review will be that Ceylon shall take herappropriate place in the Commonwealth with full internal self-government uncler a constitution on Dominion lines.The Committee are satisfied that,  unless some suchintention is proclaimed,  a Constitution on the lines ofthe Soulbury recommendations is unlikely to be acceptedby the people of Ceylon and their leaders: on thecontrary^ we must be prepared for a period of politicalunrest in the island which will make efficientGovernment exceedingly difficult.6.       Before reaching these conclusions, the Committeemost carefully examined the views of the Government ofIndia on the Soulbury Report, which are broifly.summarised below:-(a) The intention to grant a large measure ofself-government to Ceylon is welcomed;(b) The fundamental rights of Indians in respect offranchise and citizenship must be incorporated in the Constitution itself, now that internalautonomy is recommended,  and in view of the attitutand utterances of Ceylon Ministers.(c) The present recommendation for the retention ofthe existing franchise,  which has never been satisfactory for Indians,  is unfair;(d) The arguments which led His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to accept in 1929 the view that theSinhalese majority would not agree to an indian franchise based on residence only nolonger hold good,  since the issue of licences to recruit new labour ceased in 1935 and thoemigration of further labour was stopped by india in 1939*    Indian estate labour is,therefore,  largely stabilised.(e) The Indian franchise must be put on a sound andeasily determinoble basis if representation of theIndian community by 11+ Seats in Parliament isto be secured and maintained.(f) It is urged that franchise on on equal footing with the rest of the population be granted to allIndians who have been reg^idenb in Ceylon &apos;for atotal period of not less than 5 years.(g) The recommendation in paragraph 21+2(ix) of theReport is not accepted.    Any bill likely to affectthe Indian franchise adversely should be reserved.The Delimitation Commission should be directedso to delimit electoral districts as to form the11+ constituencies contemplated in the Report whichwould have a majority of Indian voters.    Thisshould not be left to the Commissionsdiscretion.    In multi-member constituencies,individual voters should be permitted to castall

all their votes cumulatively in favour ofa single candidate.The Constitution should provide specificsafeguards to protect all persons, includingresident Indians, against discrimination inrespect of the acquisition ownership and disposalof property,  the right to hold public office,to carry on any trade, profession,business, etc.especially in view of discriminatory measures against Indians in recent years.Provision for the right of re-entry of personsnormally resident in Ceylon should berecognised and included in the Constitution. .If the above modifications are not made,  a constitution based on the Soulbury.Commissions&apos;aproposals would cause profound dissatisfaction,both in Ceylon and.in India.1*.      The Committee consider that the Government of India&apos;spoint as regards the operation of voting in multi-member constituencies can be mot.    But, as regardsfranchise and citizenship rights, they are unable torecommend the acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s GoVprnmont ofthe variations of the provisions of the Soulbury Reportproposed.    The Committee attach importance to theconclusion reached by the Soulbury Commission afterexhaustive examination of the views of the minorities, thatthe franchise and citizenship rights dealt with in (b)to (g) above arc essentially matters of domestic concern,to be handled by the Ceylon Government if necessary indirect negotiation with the Government of India; and this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that such direct -negotiations on these questions have already taken placein the past.    The Committee consider that it would be most unwise for His Majesty&apos;s Government to attempt toimpose a settlement in a matter on which feeling in ceylon is so strong.The safeguards requested by the Government ofIndia in. (h) above appear to be provided already ingeneral terms under the recommendation in paragraph2h2(iii) of the Soulbury Report, and it would appearundesirable to make specific provision in respect ofparticular categories and subjects.  -As regards the right of re-entry of Indians(see (i) above) Bills dealing with this matter arealready required under paragraph 2h2 (i) of the Reportto be reserved by the Governor in certain circumstances;and the Committee consider that to deprive tho future government of Ceylon of the right to legislate at allon this subject as desired by the Government of india would be a serious encroachment on the powers ofself-government recommended by the&apos;Commission.

8.        The following paragraphs contain explanationsof the remaining points of importance in the draft statement:-(i)    The modifications of the Soulbury recommendationsproposed in paragraph 11 of the draft Statementare the result of the Secretary of State&apos;discussions with Mr. Senanayake.&apos;    TheCommittee agree that these modificationsrepresent the limit to which it is possible togo to meet Mr. Sonanayako&apos;s views, -(ii)    Paragraph 12 deals with the difficult question ofthe three-quarters majority, The Committeeunderstand that, under the terms of the 19*4-3Declaration,  His Majesty.&apos; s Government is not committed to apply the three-quarters majoritystipulation to the recommendations of the Soulbury Commission.&apos;    On the other hand,  therecan be no doubt that very great importance isattached to this stipulation by the minority communities in Ceylon,  especially the Tamils,who may be.expected to protest very stronglyif it is not. applied.    In the circumstances,the Committee consider that the line taken inthe draft statement is the only practicableone for His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt.-Under the terms of the present draft Statement,His Majesty&apos;s Government would be committed toadopt the new Constitution if it were to obtain a three-quarters majority (a most unlikely event)..   If such a majority were not obtained,it would be necessary to consider in.the lightof the results of the voting whether or not thodegree of support in Ceylon were sufficient to-warrant the adoption of the new Constitution witor without modification.    Should theConstitution be decisively rejected,  however,  aGeneral Election in Ceylon (which under thepresent Constitution is due to take place not later than March,  1947) would follow,  unless,the life of the present Council (already extendeto eleven years) were further extended by Orderin Council,  which is clearly undesirable.In that event, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldhave to consider how to resolve the difficulties,and might wish to convene a Round table conference in London in due course.-9.        In conclusion, the Committee cannot stress too strongly the urgency of an immediate decision on thisquestion of the review of the Ceylon Constitution.    the interval between publication of the Report and theannouncement of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decisions isalready

already being used by the extremist parties in ceylon to conduct an island-wide campaign against theacceptance of a Constitution on the lines of the Soulbury recommendations,   and in favour of anuncompromising demand for for more radical concessions.If the State Council were to meet on November 6thwithout an announcement of decisions by His Mojcsty*sGovernment,  this demand would gather strength amongthe members,   and all hope of the introduction of a constitution on the lines proposed would have to be abandoned.10.       The Committee therefore urge most earnestly that theCabinet should give immediate approval to the terms ofthe attached draft Statement of Policy,  the principal features of which are:-;,(i)    His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decision to lay down the general linos of a Constitution forCeylon based on the Soulbury recommendation?&quot; and(ii)    Their undertaking to initiate a review of thaiconstitutional position in six years&apos; time.(Intld)    A.

ANNEX.CEYLON.Statement of Policy on Constitutional Reform.The present Constitution of Ceylon, which is based on the ExecutiveCommittee system of the London County Council, was set up in 1931 as a resultof the recommendations of a Commission presided over by the Earl of Donough-more. The Governor has certain reserved powers, the more important of whichare in respect of Defence, External Affairs and the rights of minorities : and aconsiderable measure of self-government in matters of internal civil administra-tion rests with a Legislature very largely elected territorially on the basis of universal adult suffrage.2. Since the introduction of this Constitution, there has been continuouspressure, especially but not solely from the Sinhalese majority community, forthe grant of a further measure of self-government. On the 26th May, 1943,His Majesty&apos;s Government issued a Declaration on the reform of the Constitution,which reads as follows : 1&quot; (1) The post-war re-examination of the reform of the Ceylon Constitution,to which His Majesty&apos;s Government stands pledged, will be directed towards the grant to Ceylon by Order of His Majesty in Council, of full responsible Government under the Crown in all matters of internalcivil administration.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain control of the provision,construction, maintenance, security, staffing, manning and use of suchdefences, equipment, establishments and communications as HisMajesty&apos;s Government may deem necessary for the Naval, Militaryand Air security of the Commonwealth, including that of the Island,the cost thereof being shared between the two Governments in agreedproportions.(3) Ceylon&apos;s relations with foreign countries and with other parts of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations will be subject to the control and direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(4) The Governor will be vested with such powers as will enable him,if necessary, to enact any direction of His Majesty&apos;s Government inregard to matters within the scope of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this declaration; and his assent to local measures upon these matters willbe subject to reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(5) The present classes of Reserved Bills in the Royal Instructions will be largely reduced under a new Constitution. Apart from measures affecting Defence and External Relations, it is intended that theseshall be restricted to classes of Bills which (a) relate to the Royal Prerogative, the rights and property of HisMajesty&apos;s subjects not residing in the Island, and the trade and shipping of any part of the Commonwealth;(b) have evoked serious opposition by any racial or religious com-munity and which in the Governor&apos;s opinion are likely to involve oppression or unfairness to any community;(c) relate to currency.(6) The limitations contained in the preceding paragraph will not be deemedto prevent the Governor from assenting in the King&apos;s name to any measure relating to, and conforming with, any trade agreements con-cluded with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government byCeylon with other parts of the Commonwealth. It is the desire ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that the Island&apos;s commercial relations should be settled by the conclusion of agreements, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be pleased to assist in any negotiations with thisobject. .(7) The framing of a Constitution in accordance with the terms of this declaration will require such examination of detail and such preci-[30742] B
sion of definition as cannot be brought to bear so long as the wholeof the energies of the Service and other Departments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must remain focused on the successful prosecution ofthe war. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, however, once victory is achieved, proceed to examine by suitable Commission or Conferencesuch detailed proposals as the Ministers may in the meantime havebeen able to formulate in the way of a complete constitutional scheme,subject to the clear understanding that acceptance by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of any proposals will depend : First, upon His Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied thatthey are in full compliance with the preceding portions of this statement;Secondly, upon their subsequent approval by three-quarters ofall Members of the State Council of Ceylon, excluding the Officersof State and the Speaker or other presiding Officer.(8) In their consideration of the problem, His Majesty&apos;s Government have very fully appreciated and valued the contribution which Ceylon hasmade and is making to the war effort of the British commonwealth and the United Nations, and the co-operation which, under the leader-ship of the Board of Ministers and the State Council, has made this contribution effective.&quot;It will be seen that the declared object of His Majesty&apos;s Government in considering further constitutional reform is the grant to Ceylon of full respon-sible government under the Crown in all matters of internal civil administration.The principal subjects which will continue to be reserved to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are Defence, External Relations and safeguards ensuring fair arrangements in Ceylon for the minority communities.3. In accordance with paragraph 7 of the 1943 Declaration, CeylonMinisters were asked to frame a Constitution for the Island, which would then be examined by a Commission or Conference. The Ministers completed their task of drafting a Constitution in February 1944, but owing to a disagreement with HisMajesty&apos;s Government as regards the scope of the Commission or conference which was to examine their Scheme, they withdrew it in August 1944. Thedifficulty arose from the fact that they claimed the Declaration to mean that theCommission or Conference was to be confined entirely to the examination of thequestion whether the constitutional Scheme was in conformity with the 1943Declaration, while His Majesty&apos;s Government took the view that the commissioner Conference should have wider terms of reference enabling it to examine theConstitutional Scheme from all angles, and especially that of its suitability inrelation to the minorities, and to discuss it with the latter.4. Notwithstanding the Ministers&apos; withdrawal of their Scheme, therefore.His Majesty&apos;s Government proceeded in September 1944 to announce the appoint -ment of a Commission with terms of reference as follows : &quot;To visit Ceylon in order to examine and discuss any proposals for constitutional reform in the Island which have the object of giving effect tothe Declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government on that subject dated the26th May, 1943; and, after consultation with various interests in the Island,including minority communities, concerned with the subject of constitutional reform, to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on all measures necessary to attain that object.&quot;The Commission, under the Chairmanship of Lord Soulbury, visited Ceylonfrom December 1944 until April 1945, and its Report was published on the9th October.5. The Constitution recommended by the Soulbury Commission may bebriefly summarised as follows, the reference in brackets being to the SoulburyCommission^ Report: (a) The Government of Ceylon would consist of a Governor-General, withthe reserve powers set out in the 1943 Declaration, and a Cabinet, withan Upper and Lower House.(b) Universal adult suffrage would be retained on the present basis.   (Para-graph 223.)
(So far as suffrage of immigrants into Ceylon is concerned, the Commissionregards this as a matter of internal civil administration, and proposes that the Ceylon Government should be granted the right to determine the future composition of its population with full powers of control in respect of immigration.)(c) A Delimitation Commission would be appointed by the Governor-general in his discretion to define new electoral districts.   (Paragraph 278.)(d) The Lower House would be designated the House of Representatives andwould consist of 95 elected members together with six members whowould be nominated by the Governor-General. (Members of theLower House would be known as Members of Parliament.) (Para-graph 321.)(e) The Upper House would be designated the Senate, and would consist of30 members, of whom 15 would be elected by the Lower House and15 nominated by the Governor-General acting in his discretion.(Paragraph 310.)(/) There would be a Cabinet with Ministers possessing full Cabinet respon-sibility in all matters of internal affairs in Ceylon, subject to the reservations contained in paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the 1943 Declara-tion.   (Paragraph 330.)(g) There would be a Prime Minister appointed by the Governor-General.The Prime Minister would hold the portfolios of External affairs and Defence.   (Paragraphs 325, 330 (ii), 360 (xi).)(7i) Appointments to the Public Services would be made on the recommenda-tion of a Public Services Commission to be nominated and appointedby the Governor-General in his discretion (i.e., after consultation withthe Prime Minister, but without being bound to follow his advice).(Paragraph 392.)(i) There Avould be a Judiciary in which the Chief Justice and Judges ofthe Supreme Court would be appointed by the Governor-Generalacting in his discretion with a Judicial Services Commission toadvise him in regard to subordinate judicial appointments. (Para-graph 407.)The safeguards for minority communities include the proposals for a second chamber and for the Public Services Commission. The first can be expected toprovide an instrument for impeding precipitate legislation and for handlinginflammatory issues in a cooler atmosphere (paragraph 298); while the public services Commission is designed as an impartial and authoritative body, free from the taint of partisanship, on whose advice the Governor-General will exercise his powers of appointment to the Public Service and the promotion and discipline of Public Officers.   (Paragraphs 374, 379, 389.)The Constitution provides the folknving safeguards for minority interests(European and Asiatic) : (a) Classes of reserved Bills will include any Bills which relate to the royal prerogative, the rights and property of His Majesty&apos;s subjects notresiding in the Island, and the trade or transport or communicationsof any part of the Commonwealth,   (Paragraph 332.)(6) The Classes of reserved Bills will also include any Bill which has &apos;&apos; evokedserious opposition by any racial or religious community and which, inthe Governor-General&apos;s opinion, is likely to involve oppression orunfairness to any community.&quot;   (Paragraph 332.)(c) In regard to immigration into Ceylon, the Report recommends that Billsrelating to the prohibition or restriction of immigration will not beregarded as coming within the category of Bills which the Governor-General will reserve for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure,but if any such Bill contains a provision regarding the right of re-entry of persons normally resident in the Island at the date of thepassing of the Bill by the &quot;Legislature, which, in the opinion of theGovernor-General, is unfair or unreasonable, the Governor-Generalmust be required to reserve that Bill. (Paragraphs 332 (ii) (b)and 236.)(d) The Soulbury Commission^ Report further recommends that, in relationto the further class of Bills relating to external affairs which are tocome within the category of reserved Bills, there shall be excludedfrom the category of Bills relating to external affairs &quot;any bill relating solely to the prohibition or restriction of the importation of[30742] B 2
or the imposition of import duties upon any class of goods, providedthat such legislation is not discriminatory in charatcer. (Para-graph 332 (ii).(d).)(e) The Report further recommends that the Order in Council shall provide that the Ceylon Parliament &quot; shall not make any law to prohibit orrestrict the free exercise of any religion; or to alter the constitutionof any religious body &quot; except at the request of the governing authorityof that religious body (Paragraph 334), and &apos;&apos; shall not make any lawrendering persons of any community or religion liable to disabilitiesor restrictions to which persons of other communities or religions. arenot made liable, or confer upon persons of any community or religionany privileges or advantages which are not conferred on persons ofother communities or religions.&quot;   (Paragraph 242 (iii).)The powers reserved by His .Majesty&apos;s Government under the 1943Declaration are to be secured in the Commission^ proposals in thefollowing ways :-(a) Defence.   Any Bills on this subject must be reserved by the Governor-General.   (Paragraphs 332 (i) and 349 et seq.)(b) External Affairs.    Bills  in this category are  also to be reserved.(Paragraphs 332 (ii), 337 and 338.)In both these subjects the Governor-General will have power&apos; himself to enact any measures necessary to comply with the directions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   (Paragraph 337.)(c) Currency.   Legislation  must  be  reserved  by  the  Governor-General.(Paragraph 332 (iii).)(d) Trade, transport and communications affecting any part of the Empire.Any Bill of an extraordinary nature or importance which mayprejudice these interests, must be reserved.   (Paragraph 332 (iv).)6. The principal reaction of the Sinhalese majority community to a constitution on these lines has been to take the line that the 1943 Declarationcan in the post-war situation no longer be regarded as a satisfactory basis fora new Constitution for Ceylon. Issued as it was during the war, it receiveda limited degree of acceptance by Ministers, principally as an improvement on theexisting Constitution which would enable Ceylon to put forward her full war effort more efficiently. Now that the war is over, however, in their view theprincipal reason for the retention by His Majesty&apos;s Government of suchextensive reserved powers, especially in regard to Defence and External Affairs,is no longer operative. Moreover, since Dominion status as soon as circumstances. permit has been promised to Burma, the Ministers claim that Ceylon, in viewof her large-scale and valuable war effort, should now be advanced to the status of a Dominion. By April 1945 the Ceylon State Council had already passed bya considerable majority, including minority Members, the so-called Sri LankaBill, which framed a Constitution on Dominion lines for Ceylon and immediateDominion status is now the object of the Sinhalese majority and their supporters.This demand, they say, need not prejudice the legitimate interests of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in regard to Defence, provided that these can be safe-guarded by an agreement to be reached between His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom and the Government of Ceylon by which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be vested with all necessary powers in regard to Defence.The acceptance of a claim for Dominion status would involve the question of the transference of Ceylon affairs from the Colonial to the Dominions Office.7. The reaction of the Sinhalese majority and their supporters to theindividual provisions of the Soulbury Constitution may be briefly summarisedas follows : The Second Chamber is regarded as unnecessary and undemocratic byan important section.The Governor-General&apos;s Powers as laid down in the Soulbury recom-mendations would establish a system of diarchy on certain subjects whichwould give rise to continued difficulty in practice. The solution to thisis the conclusion of a separate agreement not appearing in the Constitutionbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Govern-ment of Ceylon, by which in effect the normal constitutional procedure wouldbe set aside for a limited purpose.
Minority Safeguards.-J$o objection is. raised to the provision safe-guarding minorities as a whole, but as stated above opposition has been expressed to the proposed Second Chamber which was designed by theCommission to be one of the principal minority safeguards.8. The principal minority community in Ceylon is the Tamil community,the two main divisions of which, Ceylon Tamil and Indian Tamil, together formabout a quarter of the total population of the Island. While the Sinhalese regard the Soulbury recommendations as not going far enough, the Tamils regard them as going too far. In their view, no system of weighted representation combined with powers of&apos; the Governor to reserve Bills can, in practice, provide proper safeguards against the overwhelming power which is to be put into the handsof the Sinhalese community, who will be in a permanent majority in the futureLegislature. Moreover, discrimination against minorities occurs in practicenot so much overtly in the form of discriminatory legislation, as in less obviousadministrative acts. The only satisfactory method of providing for this situation, in view of the Tamil minority, is the system known as &quot; balancedrepresentation&quot; (described in paragraphs 254-264 of the Soulbury Report), underwhich half the total number of seats in the Legislature would be reserved to theSinhalese majority community, the remaining half being divided in agreedproportion between the minorities, the statutory division of seats being extendedto the Cabinet, in which each community would have an allotted representation.9. The scheme of balanced representation is not, however, supported by theremaining minority communities, who are primarily anxious that they should secure adequate representation in whatever new Legislature is set up.Decisions.10. With all these factors in mind His Majesty&apos;s Government have reachedthe conclusion that a Constitution on the general lines proposed by the SoulburyCommission (which also conforms in broad outline, save as regards the second chamber, with the Constitutional scheme put forward by the Ceylon ministers themselves) will provide a suitable measure of constitutional progress for Ceylonat the present juncture. They have carefully considered all the arguments advanced in favour of Dominion Status but they remain convinced that the time is not yet ripe for the grant of such a status to Ceylon. Nevertheless His MajestyhGovernment desire to make it clear that they would not regard a Constitutionon the lines proposed above as the final word in Ceylon&apos;s constitutional develop-ment. On the contrary, it will be the consistent policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to assist Ceylon in her political development until she can sustain the responsibilities of complete self-government in the British Commonwealth, andthe present decisions are, therefore, regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government asdeserving of review after some further experience.His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided that six years after theintroduction of the new Constitution they will initiate a review of the constitu-tional issue in consultation with the Government of Ceylon in the light of thecircumstances then obtaining and subject to such provisions as may be necessaryto satisfy the security requirements of the British Commonwealth. The object ofthis review will be that Ceylon shall take her. appropriate place in the Common-wealth with full internal self-government under a Constitution on Dominionlines. The further period under a Constitution on the general lines proposed bythe Soulbury Commission would provide for the Government of Ceylon anopportunity of proving their ability to undertake increased responsibilities, andwould enable that Government to gain experience, denied to them under thepresent Constitution, of a collective ministerial responsibility to the people of ceylon. Moreover the Sinhalese majority, whose power under a completely self-governing Constitution will be preponderant, will be enabled during this period to demonstrate their willingness and capacity to operate self-governing institu-tions in collaboration with the minorities, and having due regard to the latterslegitimate rights and susceptibilities.11. The main features of the Constitution under which Ceylon will be governed during this period will follow the general lines of the recommendationsof the Soulbury Commission, with the following principal modifications : (a) Life of the Upper House. In view of the proposed reconsideration ofthe Constitution after six years, the provisions as regards the life ofthe Upper House will be changed so that one-third of the Membership
will retire after two years, and a further third after four years, thearrangements proposed by the Soulbury Commission being followedfor their replacement.(b) Reserved Powers of the Governor. In place of the recommendations ofthe Soulbury Commission that the Governor shall be empowered to enact special Ordinances dealing with Defence and External Affairs,His Majesty&apos;s Government will retain the power to legislate forCeylon by Order in Council, and the Governor will be provided byOrder in Council to be brought into operation by Proclamation incase of a public emergency with powers to make regulations for pur-poses such as those specified in the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act,1939. During the operation of the new Constitution the presenttitle of Governor would not be altered, and the channel ofcommuni-cation between the Government of Ceylon and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom will remain as at present through theGovernor and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who will retainhis present ministerial responsibility in regard to Ceylon Affairs.(c) Breakdown of the Constitution.   Any contingency arising in this respectwill be covered by the general power of His Majesty&apos;s Government to legislate for Ceylon by Order in Council which will include, if neces-sary, suspension of the Constitution.(d) Shipping. The Ceylon Government will be empowered to establish andregulate shipping services, both coastal and overseas, provided thatno action is taken without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom, which may be interpreted as subjectingthe shipping of other members of the Commonwealth to differentialtreatment.1(e) Public Services. Tho period of exercise of the right of retirement ofcertain classes of officers specified in paragraph 372 (ii) of the SoulburyEeport shall be reduced from three to two years from the date of thefirst meeting of Parliament under the new Constitution; and the exer-cise of the special right of retirement with compensation for loss ofcareer shall not extend to officers appointed to the Public Services onagreement for a limited period of years.The question of the Three-quarters Majority.12. In Section 7 of the 1943 Declaration His Majesty&apos;s Government made it clear that the acceptance of any constitutional proposals put forward by CeylonMinisters would depend upon the subsequent approval of such proposals by three-quarters of all the Members of the State Council of Ceylon, excluding the Officersof State and the Speaker or other presiding Officer. This condition attaches onlyto constitutional proposals put forward by Ceylon Ministers, and cannot, expresslybe applied to the proposals which have &quot;been put forward independently by theSoulburv Commission. The Commission have made it clear throughout theirPeport.&quot; however, that they regarded the Ministers&apos; Constitution as one of theprincipal basic documents in their investigation, and many of their recommenda-tions follow its proA-isions. His Majestws Government have therefore decidedthat the provisions of the proposed Constitution shall be laid before the state council of Ceylon with a view to their acceptance, if possible, by a three-quartersmajority of the Council on the basis proposed in the 1943 Declaration. they desire it to be clearly understood, however, that they do not regard themselves as bound by this provision in the event of the requisite three-quarters majoritynot, being: obtained.
