SECRET. Copy No.   6 cp. (45) 250.2Uh October, 1945.CABINET.ORAL QUESTIONS.Note by the Prime Minister.MY attention has been called to the excessive length of some replies givento Oral Questions.Unnecessary information takes up the time of the House. Ministers should themselves check the replies submitted to them with this in mind. A promise to circulate in the Official Report instead of an oral reply has a salutary effect on members who seek to combine too many points in one Question.C. R, A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,2Qth October, 1945.----------------------- p/P,Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.
