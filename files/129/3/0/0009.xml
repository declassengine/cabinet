Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy no cp. (45) 209.6th October,-1945.CABINET.BILLETING OF  GERMAN PRISONERS ON FARMS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. I hope to submit at an early date further proposals on the main questionof the employment of Prisoners in the light of the examination of the estimated requirements which I was invited to undertake (CM. (45) 33rd Conclusions,Minute 3 (1) ). Meanwhile, it is most desirable that an early decision should bereached on the proposal to billet German Prisoners on farms which was includedin my previous Memorandum on the general subject of the employment ofPrisoners of War in Great Britain (CP. (45) 172). I then suggested (para-graph 1, sub-paragraph 5): &apos;&apos; As an experiment, arrangements should be made forthwith to billet asmall number of German Prisoners on farms and the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should be invited to submit, in agreement with the StandingInter-Departmental Committee on Security, an early report on the result ofthe experiment; appropriate arrangements should be made in advance, inconsultation with the Minister of Information, to prepare the public mind for this development.&quot;2. The Cabinet reached no conclusion on this particular question, and forthe reasons set out below, I now ask that my proposal be approved forthwith.3. The arguments in favour of this course are set out in full in paragraph 13of my previous Memorandum. Briefly, the position is that any equitable schemefor the repatriation of Italian Prisoners must involve the early departure of thosewho are billeted on farms. Owing to their great value to the farmers, this will inevitably cause difficulties, but these difficulties would be very much reduced if German Prisoners could be billeted in their place.4. The Cabinet have decided that a start should be made with the repatria-tion of Italians (CM. (45) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 2), and it is, therefore, most desirable to allow the billeting of Germans on farms on the experimental basissuggested.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1,6th October, 1945.[30653]
