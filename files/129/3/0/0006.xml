Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 206.5th October, 1945.CABINET.SYRIA AND LEBANON.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ADVANTAGE has been taken of M- bidault&apos;s presence in London for theForeign Ministers&apos; Conference to hold exploratory discussions with the Frenchon the Levant problem, with the object of ascertaining whether it will be possibleto reach a settlement on the lines indicated in Cabinet Paper (45) 123 of the20th August, and in particular whether the French Government would in factnow : be prepared to agree to the simultaneous withdrawal of all French andBritish troops from Syria and the Lebanon.2. M. Chauvel, the Secretary-General of the French Ministry for ForeignAffairs, came to London expressly for the purpose of holding these exploratory conversations, and as the result of his discussions with representatives of theForeign Office the document enclosed at Annex A was drawn up for submission to the French Government and to His Majesty&apos;s Government for their approval.3. It will be seen that it is proposed in the first place that British andFrench military experts should draw up a detailed programme for evacuation by stages, account being taken of the necessity for maintaining in the Levantsufficient forces to guarantee security until such time as the United nations organisation has decided on future arrangements for collective security in thiszone. The French Government are insisting on retaining forces in the Lebanonuntil the United Nations Organisation have reached a decision on this point. Ajoint invitation is, however, to be sent to the Syrian and Lebanese governments to send to Paris or London representatives empowered to discuss the conditionsof the withdrawal of the French and British troops.4. I hope that my colleagues will approve an arrangement on these lines,in order that, if it is similarly approved by the French Government, immediate steps may be taken to prepare the military plan of evacuation, and to address thenecessary communication to the Syrian and Lebanese Governments.5. M. Chauvel handed to the Foreign Office representatives during therecent discussions a memorandum, of which a translation is annexed as Annex B.He explained that, w^hile French acceptance of the plan for evacuation was notconditional on the acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of this secondmemorandum, nevertheless the two documents were in the French view to be read as a whole, as representing what the French have in mind for their policyin the Eastern Mediterranean, for which they hope to obtain British support.M. Chauvel made it clear that the French Government would wish to have, in due course, an expression of His Majesty&apos;s Governments views on Anglo-french -operation in the Eastern Mediterranean, as proposed in Annex B.6. These French proposals for Anglo-French co-operation in the eastern mediterranean raise some very far-reaching questions, and I do not think thatthey could be accepted as they stand. For example, I do not think that weshould be justified in giving a promise to the French Government of our support for the French claim to military bases in the Levant States, when this questioncomes before the United Nations. Nor do I think that we should admit any French claim that they have a special concern in the policy which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may in future adopt in Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine and Egypt.Nevertheless, I consider that, if a general discussion regarding the position inthe Eastern Mediterranean is going to make it easier for the French Government12962   [30645]Copy No.      O f j
to agree to withdraw their troops from the Levant, we should not refuse to enterinto such a discussion. It may prove possible, in the course of conversations,to find a formula which would render it easier for the French Government to&quot; save face,&quot; as they are very anxious to do on account of their prestige in theNear East.E. B.Foreign Office, 5th October, 1945.ANNEX A.Translation of Document agreed with M. Chauvel for submission to theBritish and French Governments.1.   British and French military experts will meet on the 1945,at to draw up the details of a programme for evacuation by stages, with a corresponding regrouping of forces.2. The programme of evacuation will be drawn up in such a way thatit will ensure the maintenance in the Levant of sufficient forces to guaranteesecurity until such time as the United Nations Organisation has decided onthe organisation of collective security in this zone. Until these arrangements have been carried out, the French Government will retain forces regroupedin the Lebanon.3. The French and British Governments will inform the Syrian andLebanese Governments of their intention to withdraw their troops, and will invite those Governments to send to Paris or London on the 1945representatives empowered to discuss the conditions of this withdrawal.4. One of the objects of this discussion will be to fix the date on whichthe withdrawal will begin.5. The discussion will also deal with the measures to be taken in orderto enable the Syrian and Lebanese Governments to discharge their duty ofmaintaining order.ANNEX B.Translation of Memorandum communicated by M. Chauvel,25th September, 1945.At this stage it is important to make it clear that the French government intends to put two conditions to the evacuation of French troops stationed in syria and the Lebanon. These conditions are: evacuation of these countries by the British troops occupying them; and the drawing up by the United nations organisation of the collective security plan which is applied to this zone.In other words, while the French Government is ready to proceed at once to draw up a programme of evacuation by stages and to put this programmeinto operation, it insists on maintaining military elements in the Levant untilthe United Nations Organisation has drawn up the permanent plan of collective security applicable to the region. It considers that, as the Lebanon forms aline of communication which all troops going from the interior will have totraverse, it is in the Lebanon that the last echelon of the French forces in the levant will have to be regrouped, pending the decision of the United nations organisation and whatever the programme of the British evacuation may be.As these are the principles which the French Government has adopted, itsees no objection to Anglo-French talks being held on the question of evacuatingBritish and French troops in the Levant. It nevertheless considers that suchtalks are only justified in so far as they fit into the framework of widerconversations.It readily acknowledges, in fact, that the announcement of a joint with-drawal of French and British troops and the invitation to discuss the detailsof this withdrawal would be likely to encourage the Syrian Government to resumecontact with the French Government, contact which is at present broken. Itinfers therefore that the object desired is not solely military, but essentially of
a political nature, and that it is actually a question not only of avoiding a repetition of untoward incidents, but also of stabilising Franco-Lebanese andFranco-Syrian relations.In the past these relations have been constantly affected by the evolution of relations between Great Britain and the Arab States. It was the liberalnature of this evolution which made the French Government provide for the transition from the regime of the Charter drawn up and guaranteed by Genevato that of a treaty negotiated between the parties concerned and submitted tothe ratification of the League of Nations.It seems obvious that the era in which treaties of alliance of the Anglo-Iraqiand Anglo-Egyptian type could be concluded is now past. The arrangements tobe made between France, on one side, and Syria and the Lebanon on the other,will be established on a different basis. These&apos; arrangements will form a precedent for the other Arab States which they will invoke in their future relations with england.The Syrian and Lebanese Governments are fully aware of this aspect ofthe matter. It is therefore to be foreseen that the French Government will be faced with demands drawn up not only in view of the Syrian and Lebaneseposition vis-a-vis France but also in view of the Iraqi and Egyptian positionsvis-a-vis England. Inversely, the British Government will suffer in Iraq andin Egypt the consequences of concessions made by France in Syria and the lebanon.This inter-dependence of French and British policy in the Arab countries would in itself be sufficient to justify an exchange of information between thetwo Powers. This exchange seems especially necessary on the eve of negotiations between France and Levant States. The French Government, which is readyto give the British Government any explanation of its own views poncerning the levant, wishes the British Government to provide corresponding information on the direction of British policy in Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine and Egypt.It is convinced that such exchanges, if they became usual, would lead to aco-operation, the advantage of which would soon become apparent to the two parties, and which would appear particularly opportune at a time when theBritish Government is announcing constructive action in all economic andfinancial matters.These considerations which have been expressed in connection with a politicalproblem, are equally valid on the military level.The French Government, in fact, does not conceal its desire to assume theobligation, within the framework of the collective security organisation^ forthe arrangements to be made on the territory of the Levant States. The BritishGovernment has been willing to recognise the right of France to a privileged position in these States. The military sphere is, properly speaking, the only one in which France asks to be accorded a privilege. The French Government,therefore, relies on the British Government&apos;s support with the United nations for this claim.But this very claim must be formulated with relation to the framework into which it is destined to fit. The establishment to be anticipated in the Levantmust form part of a plan of regional security rationally conceived. It is thusimportant that this plan should be examined in concert by British and french military experts with a view to drawing up proposals to present to the united nations Organisation.The principle of this collaboration would in short consist of the mutualrecognition by the two Governments of a special interest in what concerns the territories in which they bear, or have borne since 1920, special responsibilities.This interest would take the form of a preferential right which each of the two parties would maintain in its zone with respect to the other party, whether itis a question of military, financial, economic or technical matters. ^ Such anarrangement, which would not be directed against the States nor against othercountries, would help to re-establish an atmosphere of confidence and open theway for a better co-ordination of the efforts of both Governments.
