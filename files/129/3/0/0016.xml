(45)  21610TH OCTOBER,  1945CABINETpal:: st 1MBReport Ly the Lord president of the council the Palestine Committee has  had under consideration the proposal mace by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at the meeting of the Cabinet held on 4th October,194-5 /* for the appointment of an Anglo-American Commissionto which would be assigned the task of examining thesituation of the Jews in Europe as a whole and of making recommendations for its alleviation.The Problem of European Jewry2.      In view of the growing agitation in the United Statesof America as well as in the U.K.  and other countriesover the situation of the Jews in Europewhere many are living in conditions of great hardship, the Committee agrees that it is desirable that we should associate the UnitedStates of America with ourselves in a full examination ofthe problems involved.3.      It is therefore proposed that the U.S.A.   should beinvited to join with us in setting&apos; up a Committee of Enquiryat once under a rotating chairmanship:-(i)    to examine the position of the Jews in europe as a whole as it exists to-day;(ii)    to make an estimate of the number of Jews who cannot bo re-settled in the country from whichthey originated;(iii)    to examine the possibility of relieving the positionin Europe by immigration into other countries outside Europe,  including the United States;(iv)    to consider other available moans of meetingthe needs of the immediate situation.s CM.

i-t-.      The Commitee of&apos;  inquiry &quot;should, in the first place,visit Germany raid other parts of   jurope, in order toinform themselves ox the character and magnitude of theproblem created by the war;    Having done so, they shouldturn their attention to countries of disposal.5.      In the light of,their investigation, they shouldmake recommendations to the two Governments for dealingwith the problem in the&quot;interim until such time  as apermanent solution can be submitted to the appropriateorgan of the United Nations,The n Part to bo PI ayed Jay, .Pr lostine&quot;&quot;&apos;in&quot;&apos; the - Solut 1 on&quot;of &quot;&quot;iha&quot; Problem6.      The Committee&apos;s invostigrtion would also be extendedto Palestine,  and their enquiry would thus include an examination on the spot, involving the hearing of representative Jews and Arabs, of the conditions, politicaleconomic  end agricultural5 which ore at present held to restrict immigration into that territory and the making of recommendations for consideration by the two Governments.Obviously the White Paper cannot be regarded as providing a permanent solution of  the problem and it will be necessaryfor His MojcstyTs Government both to take action with a viewto occur in.- some satisfactory interim settlement and alsoto devise a policy for permanent application thereafter.The latter policy will be placed before the United Nationswhen His Majesty&apos;s Government makes application to that organisation for an Agreement placing Palestine under trusteeship.    The nature of that policy will naturallydepend largely on the recommendations of the Committee ofEnquiry and the United States will thus be placed in aposition of  sharing the responsibility for the policy which she advocates.    She will no longer be able to play the partof irresponsible critic.7.      in the meantime., some temporary arrangement mast be made which will govern Jewish imaii. ration during the periodwhile the enquiry is in progress.    It is most desirable thatthis to-, -por-ai. y arrangement should be one which will notcause widespread disturbance in the Middle Gast and inIndia.    It is  therefore proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould make an announcement on the general lin s laid down:i n G.P.(us) 196, statin-; it to be their intention -to take steps to arrange that, for the timebeing, and possibly pending the receipt ofany ad interim recomraendations which theCommittee may make in the matter, there isno interruption of Jewish immigration at thepresent monthly, rate;to take action.with a view/ to securing- a modification of this rate, either on.our own initiative or should the ad interim recommendationof the Committee show such a modification tobe pl&quot;actic aslo;to prepare- a permanent solution for submission,to&quot; the United Nationsa.8.      The invitation to the United States to co-operate in thework co   the Committee of &quot;Inquiry would be sent simultaneously with the communication statin- Has Majesty-:&apos; s Government&apos; aintention as given above,(a)(b)(c)

9.      Undertakings which have been given to both grabs&apos; and Jews in respect of Palestine policy are set out in Annex 1to this report.    If these undertakings arc to be honoured,we mus t(i)    secure g: ab acquiescence in the course proposed under (a)  in paragraph 7;    and(ii)    consult both Arabs and Jews, before taking thecourse proposed under (b)  in paragraph 7.Inter-racial feeling is deep but risks in this, as in otherpeace problems, must be  taken.    It  is clearly important that every effort should be made to bring grabs and Jews together,to discuss either any interim arrangement which we may have toput forward or any such arrangement which may bo, advanced bythe Committee of Enquiry.    The ground must bo so prepared as to minimise the risk of breakdown, should such a conference be held.But even if a. conference proves to be impossible,  or thecircumstances unpropitious, the fact should not prevent us  fromproceeding on the lines which we believe to be  just.Consultation would then be with the parties separately;    such consultation having taken place, it must be for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to lay down the policy to be pursued.10,    If these recommendations are accepted, the proposed announcement in parliament will require amendment as shownin gnnex II.    In the redraft tin re given, it is assumed thatan immediate invitation will be sent to the United States to associate themselves with us in  the Committee of Enquiry,and that the announcement of the establishment of the committeewill be made simultaneously with the announcement of Palestinepolicy.    There are   groat political advantages in combining- thetwo announcements but there is also a serious danger-.    Theproposal to associate America with us in the Palestine issuewill certainly be greeted with hostility by the Moslem world.President Truman&apos;s view as to the extent of immigration whichshould, be permitted into Palestine is already known to them andmany of the Middle East Government^  a., well as the moslem league and the Congress in India, have protested against his recent statements in the matter.    There is therefore a grave risk that, if America is brought too directly into thePalestine picture at the present  juncture, the /o-abs will,in protest, refuse acquiescence  in any farther jewish immigration,  acquiescence which it is most important for usto secure.    It must be for the Cabinet to decide whether toreap the political advantage of o simultaneous announcementeven at the risk of a possible stoppage of Jewish immigration,(Initialled)    H.M.On behalf of thepales11 no gomini t teeCabinet Of fie e , S .W. 1.10TK OCTOBER,  19^5

ANNEX IUndertakings given in respect of PalestineExtract from the Statement of Policy of May, 1959-&quot;After the period of five years no furtherJewish immigration will &quot;be permitted unless the Arabs ofPalestine are prepared to acquiesce in it........ ..HisMajestyfs Government are satisfied that, when the immigration over five years which is now contemplated hastaken place, they will not be justified in facilitating,nor will they be under any obligation to facilitate, thefurther development of the Jewish National Home byimmigration regardless of the wishes of the Arab) population.&quot;Extract from the notes- of the thirteenth, meeting with&quot;fche Arab delegation to the St James [ s Confer ence*&quot;&quot;of 1939&quot;Jamal Eff.. Husaini said that they had understoodon the previous day that after five years immigrationwould he entirely in the hands of the Arab majority..   it now seemed that the position was dif f different,.. and that furtherimmigration would be a matter of agreement.,Mr. MacDonald replied that there had been no alteration in the proposal.    After five yearswhatever the views of theBritish or the Jews, if the Arabs were not already to acquiesce in it, further Jewish immigration could not take place..Dr., Khalidi said that this proposal was not yet quite clear..   Was it intended that there should be not onesingle immigrant more after the 75,000, and that therewould be no interference from the British or the Jews..Mr.. MacDonald said that this was so, though therewould no doubt be consultation between all parties.&quot;Statement made by Lord Cranborne in the House of. LQrds&quot;I would make it clear that there has been no changein the policy of His MajestyJs Government with regard to palestine, the noble Lord may rest assured that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will not enter into commitments regarding thefuture of that country without prior consultation with all those, including both Arabs and Jews, whom they may judgeto &quot;be concerned,,&quot;(This statement was in reply to a question by Lord Davies).Extract from a personal message sent during 19k5&quot;by Mr. Churchill to King Ibn SauoT&quot;England never had a more faithful Ally, and it wasin the darkest days that Your Majesty&apos;s friendship shonemost bright,,....  I will not fail to keep you informed about the Arab policy we may have in mind in Palestine, andI can assure you that nothing shall ever be put forward byme which offends those rules of justice and equity which arethe foundations of all true friendship.&quot;

(e) Extract from a personal message sent during 19^-5by the late President Roosevelt to King Ibn Saud.&quot;Your Majesty will recall that on previous occasionsI communicated to you the attitude of the AmericanGovernment towards Palestine and made clear our desire that no decision be taken with respect to the basicsituation in that country without full consultation with both Arabs and Jews.   Your Majesty will also doubtlessrecall that during our recent conversation I assured you that I would take no action,  in my capacity&apos;as Chief ofthe Executive Branch of this Government, which might provehostile to the Arab people.It gives me pleasure to renew to Your Majesty the assurances which you have previously received regardingthe attitude of my Government and my own, as chief executive, with regard to the question of Palestine andto inform you that the policy of this Government in t*hisrespect is unchanged.&quot;(f) Extract from a letter dated 17th May 19^5 from^President Truman to the Amir Abdullah of trans-Jordan..&quot;I have given careful attention to the viewsrespecting the queston of Palestine which you outline inyour letter, and I am glad you brought forth your views in this manner.    I know that this is a matter which theArabs regard with the greatest concern, and I fully appreciate the interest which they have displayed withrespect to a solution of the Palestine problem.As regards the question of Palestine, I am glad to renew to you the assurances which you have previouslyreceived, to the effect that in the view of this government, no decision should be taken respecting the basic situation in that country without full consultationwith both Arabs and Jews,&quot;ANNEX ii draft pf proposed Question and Answer in parliamentQuestion.    To ask the Prime Minister what policy His majesty&apos;s government propose to adopt in relation to the future governmentof Palestine.Reply^ The problem of Jewry is a twofold one, although itstwo- parts are in certain respects interwoven.    On the one hand.,there is the general question of the disposition of the remnantsof European Jewry;    on the other there is that particularaspect of that disposition which is concerned with immigration into Palestine.,

SiSince they assumed office, His Majesty&apos;s Government havehad the whole problem under examination and are satisfied thata new approach to it is necessary.Dealing first with the general problem, they have invited the Government of the United States to associate themselves withHis Majesty&apos;s Government in establishing a joint Anglo-american committee of Enquiry which will examine the position of theJews in Europe as a whole as it exists today, make an estimateof the number of Jews who cannot be settled in their countries of origin., examine the possibility of relieving the position by immigration outside Europe and consider other availablemeans of meeting the needs of the immediate situation.In the light of their Investigations, the Committee ofEnquliy will make recommedations to the two Governments both for dealing with the immediate problemmand also for a permanent solution which can in due course he submitted to the appropriateorgan of the United Rations.Turning now to Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government haveinherited a most difficult legacy, and their task is greatlycomplivated by undertakings, given at various times to various parties, which they feel themselves bound to honour.    they propose to deal with the queston in three stages, namely -(i)      They will seek the acquiescence of the Arabs in anarrangement which will ensure that, for the timebeing, there will be no interruption of Jevirishimmigration at the present monthly rate;(ii)      They will explore, with the parties primarily concerned, the possibility of finding a more suitable means of bridging the period until apermanent solution can be reached;(iii)      They will prepare a permanent solution for submissonto the United Nations.They anticipate that, in the second and third stages oftheir task,&apos;they will reap great advantage from the recommenda-tions of the joint Committee of Enquiry.    The investigations tobe made by that Committee will be extended to Palestine, aswell as to other countries of disposal, and will thus include an examination on the spot, involving the hearing of representative Arahs and J&apos;ews, of the conditions, political, economicand agricultural, which are at present held to restrictimmigrate on into that territory.His Majesty&apos;s Government, in making this new approach, wisto make it clear that the proolem is not one which can besettled by force and that any attempt to do so by any party-will be resolutely dealt with.    It must be settled by discussioifand conciliation and there can be no question of allowing an issue to be forced by violent conflict..
