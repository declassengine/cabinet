Looking towards a Commonwealth.THE following important speech on the future constitution of the Nether-lands Kingdom was given over Radio Orange by Her Majesty Queen Wilhelminaon the 6th December : To-day it is a year ago that the Japanese, without previous declaration ofwar, launched their treacherous attack on our Allies. At that time we did not hesitate for a moment to throw ourselves into the struggle and to hasten to the aid of our Allies, whose cause is ours.Japan had been preparing for this war and for the conquest of the Nether-lands Indies for years, and in so doing sought to follow the conduct of its Axispartners in attacking one country after another.    This plan we were able toprevent, thanks to our immediate declaration of war.12967   [30658]
After a year of war, we can bear witness that the tide is turning, and thatthe attacker, who had such great advantages, is being forced on the defensive. Itis true that the Netherlands Indies, after defending themselves so heroically, are for the most part occupied by the enemy; but this phase of the struggle is only a prelude. The Japanese are getting ever nearer the limit of their possibilitiesas our ever-growing might advances towards them from all sides.They have not been able to break China&apos;s courage and endurance, and Japannow faces the ebbing of her power in this self-willed war, which will end with hercomplete downfall.The First Interruption.At this moment my thoughts are more than ever with my country and mycompatriots in the Netherlands and the Netherlands Indies. After an age-oldhistorical solidarity which had long since passed the era of colonial relationship,we stood on the eve of a collaboration on a basi s of equality when suddenly we were both confronted by the present ordeal. The treacherous aggression on the Nether-lands in 1940 was the first interruption in the process of development. The heroicbattle of the Netherlands Indies, followed by the occupation of the major partof this territory in 1942, was the second.At the time when the Indies were still free and only Holland was occupied,the vigour of our unity became apparent, and on both sides a feeling of strongerkinship developed more rapidly than it could have in peace time. Now, however,this mutual understanding has been deepened still further because the samestruggle is shared in all its agony, and the same distress is suffered in all itsbitterness in the Netherlands as well as in the Netherlands Indies. The enemy,with his propaganda for the so-called New Order, has left nothing untried to lurethe spirit of the people and to disguise his tyranny and suppression with the liesof his promises for the future. But these lies and this deceit have been of no availbecause nearly all have seen through them and have understood that our enemieshave as their aim nothing but slavery and exploitation, and that as long as theyhave not been driven out and defeated there can be no question of freedom.Consultative Conferences.In previous addresses I announced that it is my intention after the liberationto create the occasion for a joint consultation about the structure of the kingdomand its parts in order to adapt it to the changed circumstances.The conference of the entire kingdom which will be convoked for this purposehas been further outlined in a Government declaration of the 27th January, 1942.The preparation of this conference, in which prominent representatives of thethree overseas parts of the kingdom will be united with those of the Netherlandsat a round table, had already been begun in the Netherlands Indies, Surinam andCuracao, the parts of the kingdom which then still enjoyed their freedom.Especially in the Netherlands Indies detailed material had been collected for thispurpose, and it was transmitted to me in December 1941 by the Governor-General.The battle of the Netherlands Indies disrupted these promising preparations.We can only resume these preparations when everyone will be able to speak his mind freely, although it is beyond doubt that a political reconstruction of the kingdom as a whole, and of the Netherlands and the overseas territories as itsparts, is a natural evolution.It would be neither right nor possible to define its precise form at this moment. I realise that much which is great and good is growing in the Nether-lands, despite the pressure of the occupation. I know that this is the case in theIndies, where our unity is fortified by common suffering. These developing ideascan only be shaped in free consultation in which both parts of the kingdom will want to take cognisance of other&apos;s opinions.Rights Well Earned.Moreover, the population of the Netherlands and of the Netherlands Indieshas confirmed, through its sufferings and its resistance, its right to participate inthe decision regarding the form of our responsibility as a nation towards theworld, and of the various groups of the population towards themselves and one another. By working out these matters now, that right would be neglected, andthe insight which my people have obtained through bitter experience would be disregarded.
Complete Partnership.I am convinced, and history as well as reports from the occupied territoriesconfirm me in this, that after the war it will be possible to reconstruct the kingdom on the solid foundation of complete partnership, which will mean the consumma-tion of all that has been developed in the past.I know that no political unity nor national cohesion can continue to existwhich are not supported by the voluntary acceptance and the faith of the greatmajority of the citizenry. I know that the Netherlands, more than ever, feel their responsibility for the vigorous growth of the overseas territories, and that the indonesians recognise in the ever-increasing collaboration the best guarantee forthe recovery of their peace and happiness. The war years have proved that bothpeoples possess the will and the ability for harmonious and voluntary co-operation.A political unity which rests on this foundation moves far towards arealisation of the purpose for which the United Nations are fighting, as it hasbeen embodied, for instance, in the Atlantic Charter, and with which we couldinstantly agree because it contains our own conception of freedom and justice forwhich we have sacrificed blood and possessions in the course of our history.I visualise, without anticipating the recommendations of the future con-ference, that they will be directed towards a commonwealth in which the Nether-lands, Indonesia, Surinam and Curacao will participate, with complete self-reliance and freedom of conduct for each part regarding its internal affairs, but with the readiness to render mutual assistance.It is my opinion that such a combination of independence and collaborationcan give the kingdom and its parts the strength to carry fully their responsibility,both internally and externally. This would leave no room for discriminationaccording to race or nationality. Only the ability of the individual citizens andthe needs of the various groups of the population will determine the policy ofthe Government.Axis Fail to. Subjugate.In the Indies, as in the Netherlands, there now rules an oppressor who,imitating his detestable associates and repudiating principles which he himselfhas recognised in the past, interns peaceful citizens and deprives women and children of their livelihood. He has uprooted and dislocated that beautifuland tranquil country.   His New Order brings nothing but misery and want.Nevertheless, we can aver that he has not succeeded in subjugating us, and asthe ever-growing force of the United Nations advances upon him from every direction, we knowT that he will not succeed. In the future the Netherlands indies and the Netherlands, with their fighting men on land, at sea, and in the air, withtheir alert and brave merchantmen, and by their dogged and never-failingresistance in the hard struggle, will see their self-sacrifice and intrepiditycrowned, after the common victory, with the recovery of peace and happiness foitheir country and their people in a new world.In that regained freedom they will be able to build a new and better future.(Translation.)Declaration  by  the  French  Government  on 1^.th  March, 1945,  concerningIndo-China.(Text from Journal Officiel, No. 72 of 25th March, 1945.)The Government of the Republic has always considered that Indo-china was destined to occupy a special place in the organisation of the French com-munity and therein to enjoy a liberty appropriate to the degree of its evolutionand to its capacities. The promise to this effect was made by the declarationof the 8th December, 1943. Shortly afterwards the principles of general scopeenunciated at Brazzaville defined more precisely the will of the Government.To-day, Indo-China is fighting : the troops comprising both Indo-Chinese and Frenchmen together with the elite and the peoples of Indo-China, whomthe intrigues of the enemy could not deceive are resisting with all their couragefor the triumph of the cause, which is that of the whole French community.Thus Indo-China is making good her claim to receive the place to which herdestiny calls her.These events confirm the opinion which the Government has always held thatthe status of Indo-China, upon her liberation from the invader, should be definedwithout delay.
The Indo-Chinese Federation will form together with France and the otherparts of the community a &quot;French Union&quot; whose interests abroad will berepresented by France.  Indo-China will enjoy its own liberty within this Union.The nationals of the Indo-Chinese Federation will be Indo-Chinese citizensand citizens of the French Union. In this capacity without discrimination of race, religion or origin, and on a basis of equality of merit, they will have access to all federal appointments and employments in Indo-China and in the Union.The conditions in which the Indo-Chinese Federation will participate in thefederal organisms of the French Union and the question of the status of the citizen within the French Union, will be determined by the constituent Assembly.Indo-China will have its own federal Government presided over by a governor-General and composed of Ministers responsible to him who will be chosen both from among Indo-Chinese and among French citizens resident in indo-China. Under the Governor-General the Council of State, composed ofeminent personalities of the Federation, will be charged with the task of preparing the federal laws and regulations, and an Assembly elected accordingto the method of voting most appropriate to each of the countries of the Federa-tion, and in which French interests will be represented, will vote all taxes, andthe federal budget and will consider draft laws. Treaties of commerce andfriendship concerning the Indo-Chinese Federation will be submitted to theAssembly for its examination.Liberty of the Press, liberty of association, liberty of meeting, liberty of thought and belief and in democratic principles generally will be the basis ofthe laws of Indo-China.The five countries which make up the Indo-Chinese Federation and whichdiffer from each other in civilisation, race and traditions will preserve their owncharacter within the Federation.The Governor-General will be the arbiter of all in the interests of each.The local Governments will be perfected or reformed in posts and employmentsin these Governments; in each of the territories preference shall be given to the nationals of that territory.&quot;With the help of the metropolitan country and within the framework ofthe general defence system of the French Union the Indo-Chinese Federationwill constitute naval, land and air forces in which all ranks shall be open toIndo-Chinese who have equal qualifications with personnel coming from themetropolitan country or from other parts of the French Union.Social and cultural progress shall be pursued and expedited in the same way as political and administrative progress.The French Union will take the necessary steps to make primary educationobligatory and effective and to develop secondary and higher education. the study of local language and thought will be closely associated with French culture.By means of an independent and efficient inspection of labour and by thedevelopment of trade unions the welfare, social education and emancipation ofIndo-Chinese workers shall be constantly pursued.The Indo-Chinese Federation will enjoy within the framework of the FrenchUnion an economic autonomy which will allow it to attain full agricultural,industrial and commercial development and to bring about in particular theindustrialisation which will allow Indo-China to cope with its demographicsituation. By virtue of this autonomy Indo-China will develop without dis-crimination her commercial relations with all other countries and particularly with China with whom Indo-China, like the whole French Union, intends tomaintain close and friendly relations.The status of Indo-China as thus described will be brought into effect afterconsultation with the appropriate local organisations in liberated Indo-China.Thus the Indo-Chinese Federation will enjoy the peace system of the FrenchUnion, and the liberty and the organisation necessary, for the.development ofall its resources. It will be able to play in the Pacific the role which belongs toit and to make the quality of its elite felt throughout the French Union.
