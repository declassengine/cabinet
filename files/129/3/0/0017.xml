Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy NoPCP. (45) 217.ll^A October, 1945.CABINET.FUTURE OF ELECTRICITY AND GAS INDUSTRIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.1. The electricity and gas industries are, of course, aware that theprogramme on which the Labour Party fought the Election provided for aco-ordinated fuel policy and that their industries, as well as coal, would be nationalised. No announcement has been made, however, since the Governmenthas come into office, and I suggest that the time has now come when the Govern-ment should give some indication of its intentions. Both industries have a rightto know what is the Governments policy and I am satisfied that further delay willhave unsatisfactory effects. In electricity, for example, many local authoritiesare now entitled to buy out the company undertakings in the area and many ofthem may proceed to seek the necessary consents to do so. In the absence of somedeclared policy by the Government, it would be difficult at least in certain cases to refuse to allow such authorities to exercise statutory rights which have beengiven them by Parliament since 1888 and which have been in suspense during thelast few years merely because of war conditions. There are also schemes ofdevelopment which have been put forward by gas undertakings and my Depart-ment find it difficult to make decisions on these schemes in the present uncertainty.2. I would therefore propose that I be authorised to make a brief statement that it is the intention of the Government to put forward proposals during thepresent Parliament for the reorganisation of both electricity and gas industries under public ownership; and that in due course White Papers will be issuedsetting out the general lines of the proposals. The White Papers would make :tclear that the details are not finally settled, that the Government are open toreceive representations in respect of those details, and that an opportunity wouldbe provided for Parliament to debate the proposals.3. As both industries have been regulated by Parliament since their incep-tion, the Nationalisation Bills will have to be drafted against the background ofthe great number of public and private Acts which govern the two industries,many parts of which will be superseded. The Bills will therefore be fairly coin-plicated and the Departments concerned and Parliamentary Counsel will have avery considerable volume of work in their preparation. I assume for this reasontherefore that the two industries will be dealt with in turn electricity, say, inthe 1946-7 session and gas in 1947-8.4. As my colleagues are aware, considerable work was done by committees of the Coalition Government in preparing a scheme for reorganising the electricity industry and I think therefore it would be possible to submit a draft White paper to my colleagues in the fairly near future. The gas industry on the other handis being investigated by a Committee appointed by my predecessor and I would propose waiting for its Report before preparing a White Paper. I have discussed this with Mr. Heyworth, Chairman of this Committee, and he appreciates the significance of Government policy in this matter and has promised to make everyeffort to get his Report ready by November. It should be possible therefore toissue the White Paper on the gas industry not long after the Report is published.It would probably be desirable to defer publication of the White Paper on Elec-tricity so that it would be issued a little in advance of the White Paper on Gas.5. As it is undesirable that necessary development should be held up pendingreorganisation, I propose to follow up the announcement by seeing representativesof both industries and asking for their co-operation in carrying-on till the changestake place.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1.11th October, 1945.[30683]
