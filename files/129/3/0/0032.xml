S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(A5)  25217TH OCTOBER, 19A5CABINETCIVIL AVIATION POLICY &apos;Memorandum^ by the Joint parliamentary under-Secretary of State for scotland i feel bound to submit certain observations for theconsideration of the   Cabinet on paragraph 11  of the memorandumby the Minister of Civil Aviation (C.P,(h5) 222) in which herefers to the position of-Prestwick.2.      Scottish opinion on the subject of Prestwick is strong, but it is not unreasonable.      Prestwick was selectedand has maintained its position through the war as the mainairport in this  country for trans-Atlantic traffic.      Theundertaking given by the caretaker Government and quoted inparagraph 11  of the Minister&apos;s memorandum implicitlyrecognised this and was regarded in Scotland as providing a reasonable working arrangement.3.      If the proposal&apos; now submitted by the -Minister - asit seems to imply - means that on. operational grounds theundertaking may not be implemented/ then Scottish peoplewithout distinction of party, will not readily appreciatewhy the airport should suddenly be found operationallyunsuitable unless more convincing reasons than have yetbeen adduced are in evidence.A.      The Minister suggests that the statement by theCaretaker Government.could be read as requiring all Britishland-based aircraft in passage to and from North America tocall at Prestwick,  no matter what their points of departureand arrival or what routes they might follow.      This wasnot intended and in subsequent correspondence in June last,with the Chairman of the British Overseas Airways Corporation,the then Minister of Civil Aviation made - it clear that theundertaking would apply, for example, to the-northern trans-Atlantic route and not to a flight to America from Hurn via the Azores and Bermuda.5.      In these circumstances I wish to suggest very strongly -that the undertaking given by the CaretakerGovernment should be maintained.T.P.COPY NO.  .   - &apos;Scottish Office,  S.W.I.,17th October, 19A5
