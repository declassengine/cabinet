(45) 40thConclusions, paragraph 3) regarding my memorandum OP. (45) 198 about migra-tion to Australia, I was asked to explain the meaning of the term &apos;&apos; accepted &quot;migrants.The proposed agreement with the Australian Government contains thefollowing clause : &quot; The Commonwealth Government undertake to set up at their own expense the machinery necessary for the selection and medical examinationof applicants in the United Kingdom. The Commonwealth Government will arrange for the United Kingdom authorities concerned to be associated withthe Australian representatives, to such extent as may be mutually agreed in the arrangements to be made for the examination and selection of applicants for free passages to Australia.&quot;The decision whether any individual can or cannot be accepted as a settlerwill rest with the Australian Government, and a free passage can only be grantedto an applicant if that Government are prepared to receive him. The Ministryof Labour and National Service will be responsible for checking his eligibility for a free passage under the terms of the scheme, and any eligible person will beable to apply and may be selected. No ex-service man or woman who has been released from the Forces under &quot; Class A&quot; would be refused a free passage for employment reasons; but in the case of persons specially released from the forces for work of civilian importance, whether under wartime procedure or in&quot; Class B,&quot; their release from their civilian employment would be subject to suchcontrols as may still apply to them on the date when shipping becomes available.A.Dominions Office,25th October, 1945.[30760]
