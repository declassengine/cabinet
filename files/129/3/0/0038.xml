Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 238.20th October, 1945.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I ask for authority, in accordance with ordinary practice, to issue a white paper as in the draft in the annex indicating the Government&apos;s proposals inregard to the seven Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference at its 26th Session in April-May 1944 in Philadelphia.2. My Department has been in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned about the seven Recommendations, of which the authentic texts in french and English were published in Cmd. 6547, and the attached draft white paper represents the result of these consultations. The Recommendations canconveniently be divided into three categories according to the subjectsdealt with : -(a) three Recommendations dealing with Social Security;(b) one   Recommendation   dealing   with   social policy    in    dependent territories; and(c) three Recommendations dealing with employment.3. Social Security. In the draft White Paper it is suggested that decisions on the Recommendations dealing with social security should be deferred for thetime being. This seems necessary because consideration is now being given tothe proposals in Cmd. 6502, Cmd. 6550, Cmd. 6551 and Cmd. 6651 for theestablishment of schemes for a national health service and for social insurance,and until further progress has been made it is impossible to say to what extent the final schemes will embrace the proposals in these Recommendations.4. Social policy in dependent territories. The general principles in Part Iof the Annex to this Recommendation are in conformity with the present policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government and can be accepted. The practical application ofthe minimum standards set forth in Part II of the Annex will lie in many caseswithin the control of the Governments of the dependent territories and cannot bedirected by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In a few instances it may not be practicable in the near future at least to give effect, either in particular territoriesor generally, to some of those minimum standards, but it has been generally accepted by Colonial Governments and by the Government of Burma, all of whichhave been consulted, that the aim of policy should be to introduce them as rapidly as circumstances permit. It is proposed, therefore, now to bring them formally to the notice of those Governments as is required by paragraph 2 of theRecommendation.5. Employment. The Draft White Paper suggests that the Governmentshould accept the Recommendations dealing with employment except for one point. A Royal Commission is enquiring into the problem of equal pay for bothsexes, and it would be improper to prejudge its findings by subscribing to that part of a recomemndation &apos;&apos; to encourage the establishment of wage rates on thebasis of job content without regard to sex&quot;[30726]
6. Recommendation 73 relates to the national planning of public works and to the preparation of long-term development programmes which can be accelerated or slowed down in accordance with the employment situation. Thisis in full accord with our employment policy, but it has been pointed out ininter-Departmental discussions that, under the Charter of the United Nations,the promotion of full employment has been established as one of the purposesof the United Nations Organisation, and it will be one of the primary duties ofthe Economic and Social Council to take action in this field; accordingly thequestion has been raised whether we should, in accepting the Recommendation,make it clear that we are not thereby committing ourselves to any view as to theform of international organisation which should in future deal with matters ofemployment policy.I do not myself think that any note of reservation or qualification of this kind is necessary to protect the position of the Economic and Social Council since thisis fully safeguarded by the relevant provisions of the Charter. Indeed, I thinkit is undesirable to make such a statement in relation to this Recommendationsince it might well carry the implication that, in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the International Labour Organisation has no legitimate interest inemployment policy. I therefore suggest that Recommendation 73 should beaccepted without qualification.G. A.
