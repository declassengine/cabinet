(45) 221.11th October, 1945.CABINET.CIVIL AVIATION POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE Civil Aviation Committee met on Friday, 14th, and on Monday,24th September, to consider the Memorandum by the Minister of Civil Aviation,C.A.C. (45) 3 annexed.2.   The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that:  (a) the Minister of Civil Aviation should be authorised to proceed withthe negotiation of bilateral agreements on the lines recommended byhim in paragraph 8 in his memorandum;(b) the policy of Commonwealth co-operation, as set out in paragraphs 9-11,should be endorsed;(c) the recommendation of the Minister of Civil Aviation for the State-owner-ship of all transport airfields should be approved;(d) the policy recommended by the Minister in paragraph 25 should be approved, namely, that the previous proposals which would permitpre-war operators to re-establish certain services, with a special con-cession to Scottish operators, were not justified on grounds of opera-tional and economic efficiency and that it would be operationally more efficient and more consistent with our general policy if all european and internal services were entrusted to a single corporation.3. The discussion as to the part to be played by private capital in operatingairline services occupied considerable time at the first meeting and was adjourned until the second. Finally, the Committee decided to recommend to the Cabinet,with regard to the services referred to in paragraph 14, that : (a) the British Overseas Airways Corporation, which is entirely financed by public monies, should be the national organisation responsible for commonwealth services and for services to the United States, Chinaand the Far East;(b) two other Corporations should be established, one operating to SouthAmerica and the other operating United Kingdom internal and Euro-pean services. As a matter of urgency, the Committee authorised theMinister of Civil Aviation to arrange for the proposed survey flightto South America by the British Overseas Airways Corporation.4. In view of the considerations urged by the Minister of Civil Aviation,I the Committee recommended that private monies should be entitled to participateI in the Corporations mentioned in paragraph 3 (b), but wished to limit thisI participation to 20 per cent. In this connection it was urged that in view ofi the forthcoming nationalisation of the railways it was not necessary to makeI special provision beyond the 20 per cent, for any railway participation.5. It should be stated that the Minister of Civil Aviation, in view of thel importance that he attaches to the participation of surface transport interests,I was not of opinion that the 20 per cent, participation was sufficient. He takesi the view that he should have authority to negotiate with those concerned, enablingI him to provide for a 40 per cent, participation of private capital in the EuropeanI Corporation and for 33^ per cent, in the South American Corporation.[30689]
6. It was agreed that the Corporation concerned must be responsible fortraining, servicing, maintenance and all matters relating to the provision,management and safety of aircraft.7. It was agreed that there was no need to control Charter Flying but thatthe activities of Charter fliers should be watched to ensure that they did notencroach on the field of scheduled flying; and it was also agreed that the corporations should not be debarred from Charter flying.8. It was also agreed that the Ministry should be authorised to foster the participation of the British interests in the airlines of foreign countries as recommended in paragraph 46.9. Finally, it was agreed that the announcement made on the 6th June as tothe use of Prestwick should be approved, namely, that British aircraft on passage to and from Canada and the United States should stop to pick up and set down at Prestwick until Heathrow was ready. There appears to be some question as to the form of the Committee&apos;s conclusion on this matter, but I gather thatit was accepted that the use of Prestwick should be determined by operational requirements.10.   I ask my colleagues to approve the recommendations set out above.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,11th October, 1945.9

The International Position.1. The International Conference held last autumn at Chicago was attended by delegations from 52 countries. All important countries were representedexcept the U.S.S.R. which, at the last moment, cancelled their acceptance of the invitation on the grounds that unfriendly neutral countries had been invited.2. The work of the Conference fell into two parts : (a) technical regulations governing all forms of international flying, and (b) international relationshipsin air transport development. Before the war international regulation of civilaviation was concerned mainly with (a) and covered such matters as safety regulations, rules of the air, airworthiness, radio and meteorological procedure and the licensing of personnel and aircraft. These matters were not governed by any single International Convention which commanded universal support. the paris Convention of 1919 had been ratified by 33 States, but, among others, theUnited States, the U.S.S.R. and China were not parties to it. The United States,in conjunction with 8 Central American Republics and Chile, ratified the HavanaConvention, 1928, but its application was limited to the American continent, and,unlike the Paris Convention, it made no provision for uniformity in technical matters. At Chicago progress was achieved in evolving technical codes of[30403] b
universal application.   An Interim Agreement to establish a provisional Inter- national Civil Aviation Organisation was signed and has since been formally Iaccepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government and 34 other States.   The Organisation has been formed and will be located in Montreal, where the first meeting of the interim Council is now in session.   A draft of a permanent Convention whichwould establish a permanent International Organisation was also prepared atChicago.  This Convention, if ratified by the necessary minimum of 26 countries,would modernise and supersede the separate Paris and Havana Conventions.Whilst it is difficult to measure the prospects of ratification of the draft Conven-tion by the necessary countries, it is a reasonable assumption that the countrieswhich have accepted the Interim Agreement will also ratify the permanentConvention.  A list of these countries is annexed in the Appendix to this Paper.3. Draft annexes dealing with a wide field of technical subjects wereprepared at Chicago as a basis for further study. These are now being examined in detail by the technical experts of the various countries. The prospects of fullinternational agreement in this field are encouraging. Another important feature of both the Interim Agreement and the permanent Convention is the reafnrmationof the doctrine of sovereignty of the air enunciated in both the Paris and theHavana Conventions. Each country reserves to itself sovereignty over the airspace above its territory, which includes its Colonies and its protected and mandated States. Traffic originating and terminating within State territory,so defined, is technically known as cabotage and is reserved as internal traffic to each State.4. Agreement did not prove possible at Chicago on the provisions necessaryin a multilateral Convention to govern relationships in air transport develop-ment. The United Kingdom, with substantial support, contended for the orderlydevelopment of international air transport in accordance with the policy published in the White Paper Cmd. 6561/44, but the United States delegation could notbe persuaded to accept any arrangements which fettered their right to developair transport on fully competitive lines. These unresolved issues were remitted to the Provisional Organisation for the purpose of continuing the study and making recommendations. Meanwhile, all countries will be obliged to follow thepre-war practice of negotiating bilateral agreements to cover the operation oftheir international air services. The United Kingdom, in agreement with theDominions, have decided to adopt a number of standard clauses, based on theprinciples for which we contended at Chicago,, which will be incorporated in allbilateral agreements with foreign countries. As a result of the recent Common-wealth Air Transport Council Conference, these provisions have been translated into the form of a standard bilateral agreement.5. A large number of countries, including all Commonwealth countries andthe United States, have signed the International Air Services Transit Agreementdrawn up at Chicago. This provides for the reciprocal grant of the right of transit without landing and the right of landing for non-traffic purposes. these rights are known as Freedoms 1 and 2. (We in this country would rather refer to them as Privileges.) The remaining (commercial) Freedoms (or Privileges)are as follows : Freedom 3. The right to disembark passengers, mails and freight from thecountry of origin of the aircraft.Freedom 4. The right to embark passengers, mails and freight destined forthe country of origin of the aircraft.Freedom 5. The right to pick up and set down traffic to and from destina-tions neither of which is in the country of origin of the aircraft.6. The Americans have been energetically pursuing their bilateral negotia-tions with European and Middle Eastern countries. They have already concludedagreements granting them unlimited Fifth Freedom rights with Eire, sweden and Spain. They have also similar unlimited rights in the six countries which,in addition to the United States, have so far ratified the International Air Trans-port Agreement drawn up at Chicago. This Agreement provides for the reciprocal grant of all Five Freedoms and was signed without reservation by15 Latin American countries and 8 others, namely, Liberia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan,Sweden, China, Iceland, Syria and the United States. Holland and Turkey havealso adhered but have reserved their rights as regards the Fifth Freedon. but other countries have turned to us for advice before concluding agreements.   We
have advised them, in accordance with our Chicago policy, of the danger to theirown airlines and to those of neighbouring countries of concluding agreementsgiving unlimited commercial rights to American airlines. In the result,notwithstanding intensive pressure from United States agents, these countries are so far refusing to sign unqualified agreements. These developments recentlyformed the subject of a protest from the State Department of the United Statesand, after consideration by the late Prime Minister and Cabinet, we advised theState Department that many countries had sought our advice and that we hadnaturally advised them in accordance with our own tenets. It was pointed outthat this was a logical corollary of the failure to agree at Chicago.7. There is evidence that, in influential official quarters in the UnitedStates, opinion is veering around to the British viewpoint. Mr. T. P. Wright,head of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, in the course of his Wilbur Wrightlecture, stated, as his personal opinion, that the British policy advocated atChicago, subject to one modification with which we would agree, offered theright solution of the problem of the Fifth Freedom. Also, I have advised by the Civil Air Attache in Washington that Mr. Welch Pogue, head of the CivilAeronautics Board, holds a similar view.8. It is my considered opinion, therefore, that we should be wise to continueto stand firm on our policy of &quot; order in the air.&quot; The difficulties may be largely resolved at an early date by the International Organisation now estab-lished at Montreal.II. The Policy of Commonwealth Co-operation.9. Arrangements for securing Commonwealth co-operation are proceeding satisfactorily. As a result of the Montreal conversations last year, a Common-wealth Air Transport Council has been established to foster co-operation between commonwealth countries in civil aviation matters of mutual interest. TheCouncil is advisory and has no executive functions. At the first meeting, recentlyheld in London, it was decided that a Secretariat should be established in London.10. At the Capetown Conference last March it was decided to establish asimilar Southern African Air Transport Council to provide for the co-ordinationof Commonwealth interests in Southern Africa, i.e.. South of Khartoum. Theactivities of this body, for which a joint secretariat has been established in SouthAfrica, will be co-ordinated with those of the Commonwealth Air transport council by their respective secretariats.11. The proposal to form a Commonwealth Corporation to operate all intra-Commonwealth trunk routes was discussed at Montreal last year, but was rejected by Canada and South Africa who wished to maintain the principle of independentnational operation. The United Kingdom counter proposal that joint operatingorganisations should be formed to operate one or more trunk route services com-manded even less support. Australia, which had advocated the CommonwealthCorporation, declined to subordinate her national flag if other commonwealth countries continued to operate on a national basis. In the result, the principleof co-ordinated parallel operation by independent national airlines was adopted.The resultant arrangements for the use of aircraft of the same type on each route,pooling of revenues and avoidance of duplication of ground facilities will, in fact,secure most of the advantages of joint operation. Arrangements on these line shave already been worked out for the United Kingdom-South Africa and UnitedKingdom-Australia services.III. The Form of Organisation for Operating United Kingdom Air Services.12. By the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939, Parliament created theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation, the &quot; chosen instrument &quot; which amalga-mated Imperial Airways and British Airways. B.O.A.C. alone is eligible forsubsidy in the development of overseas air routes.13. Internal airlines before the war were operated by air transport com-panies under licence from the now defunct Air Transport Licensing Authority.Of the licensed companies eight were owned by or affiliated to the railways and six were independent. In 1940 it was decided that only internal services requiredin the interest of the war effort should be maintained. All these, with one excep-tion, had been operated before the war by the railway &quot; group.&quot; In order to[30403] b 2
facilitate negotiation and management it was arranged that these companies!should become associated in a single consortium called the Associated Airways!Joint Committee. This AA.J.C. has worked throughout the war with commend-!able efficiency and economy. All other companies with the exception of Allied jAirways (Gander Dower), Ltd., a small company operating in the North ofScotland, ceased to operate.14. In considering the type of organisation required for post-war air services, the late Government concluded that a single monopoly was unsuitedto the scale of operations contemplated. Accordingly in White Paper Cmd. 6605my predecessor proposed three main Corporations to operate British civil a&apos;irtransport services, as follows : (a) Commonwealth air services, services to the United States and services to china and the Ear East to be operated by B.O.A.C. (The policyenvisaged that particular routes might be operated by subsidiaries inwhich established steamship companies would be invited to take a minority holding.)(b) Services to South America to be operated by a Corporation to be knownas British Latin-American Airlines Ltd., comprising the main british shipping lines operating to South America and B.O.A.C. Theshipping lines would jointly have a substantial majority holding.(c) European and internal services in the United Kingdom to be operated by a Corporation in which the participants would be the RailwayCompanies, the Short Sea Shipping Lines, the Travel Agencies,B.O.A.C. and such other pre-war operators as desired to participate.(No participant would have a majority holding. Under the capitalstructure subsequently proposed the holdings would be : Railways,43 per cent.; B.O.A.C. 32 per cent.; Short Sea Shipping Lines15 per cent.; Travel Agencies 5 per cent.; Independent pre-waroperators 5 per cent.) The possibility was also envisaged that sub-sidiary companies should be created to operate in particular areas where the Government was satisfied that this was desirable. Operatorswho ran services in these areas before the war should participate inorder to take full advantage of their specialised experience.15. The White Paper proposed that each Corporation should be assigneda schedule of routes which, in the view of the Government, it was essential that united Kingdom airlines should be ready to operate as soon as conditionspermitted and aircraft were available. New routes required as air transportdeveloped were to be left open to the operator whether one of the main Corpora-tions or some entirely new operator who was able to establish before anindependent Tribunal that he was best fitted to operate them.The White Paper also provided for : (a) The establishment of an impartial Tribunal with jurisdiction to considercomplaints on such matters as the adequacy of facilities, and fares and rates of United Kingdom airlines.(b) The condition that the terms of service of employees of the three Cor-porations should be those of a model employer.(c) The right of the Minister of Civil Aviation to appoint members of theBoard of B.O.A.C., to approve the appointment of Directors, includingB.O.A.C. representatives, on the Boards of the other two corporations and to approve the Memoranda and Articles of Association of all thecompanies, both main and subsidiary, which form part of the plan.16.   When the policy was under consideration by the coalition Governmentlast February, the Minister of Labour and National Service stated that he andhis colleagues in the Labour Party recognised that the matter was one on whichthere was a divergence of political view.   They thought, however, that it was most important that the main lines of the plan should be decided during the Ilifetime of the Coalition Government, and they were, in general, prepared toaccept the proposals which the Minister for Civil Aviation had put forward . ...His main difficulty had been over the proposals for the continental services whichwere likely to be the most profitable, but he was satisfied with the scheme proposedby the Minister of Civil Aviation, provided that it was clear that the Government j)would have full power to approve the membership of the Board of Directors Iand would ensure that Directors with a real knowledge of transport matters were Iselected.   He hoped that this company would enter into close relations with I
European countries with a view to bringing together, so far as possible, undera single organisation, all the European air services. The association of Railway,Shipping and Travel Agency interests should save the operating company from having to open separate branch offices throughout the continent and would securethe maximum degree of interchangeability of services.17. Subsequently, however, the plan was modified in the followingrespects : (a) On the 18th May, 1945, at a meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee,it was agreed that the powers of the Tribunal should be extendedto include the granting of licences for routes not assigned at the outsetto the three Corporations, and that any pre-war operator who waslicensed to run an internal air service at the outbreak of war shouldbe entitled to resume the service, provided that he satisfied theTribunal that he could comply with the welfare conditions applicableto pilots and air crews and that he would use British aircraft. (How-ever, in the present circumstances it may be necessary initially touse a foreign type of aircraft, in order to commence operations atthe earliest possible moment.   (See paragraph 42.)(b) At a Cabinet^ meeting held on the 5th June, it was agreed : (i) That services from Scotland to Scandinavia should be withheld from the proposed European Corporation (paragraph 14 (c))and that the Scottish interests should be afforded theopportunity of applying to the Tribunal for licences to operate these routes,(ii) That services radiating from Prestwick would not be assigned to the European Corporation but applications for licences fromother operators would be entertained, and(iii) that there should be a very considerable extension of internalservices to be operated by Scottish Airways (a railway-controlled company at present associated with the A.A.J.C.and which would be a subsidiary of the European Corporation).18. In anticipation of Parliamentary approval of the White Paper policy as amplified above, substantial progress had been made, when the late Governmentfell, with the arrangements for forming the new Corporations. Capital structuresand degrees of participation had been provisionally fixed. Approaches had beenmade to prospective directors and senior executives, and, in certain cases^ theyhad taken an active part in planning. The schedule of routes to be assigned to the European Corporation had been agreed interdepartmentally, and negotia-tions for operating rights in South America, in connection with the services ofthe projected British Latin-American Corporation, had been opened.19. The only legal restraint on anyone desiring to open an airline withinthe United Kingdom is the Air Navigation (Restriction in Time of War) Order.This Order prohibits civil flying, save with an official permit from the Secretaryof State for Air. These restrictions may be removed at an early date and itwill then be lawful for anyone to start a scheduled internal airline. It istherefore desirable to make an early announcement of policy, so that allconcerned may know where they stand. So far as external scheduled operation is concerned,&apos; this would be controlled by the need for an inter-Governmentalagreement to secure the necessary operating rights.PART B.-FUTURE POLICY.IV. Organisation.20. I have considered future policy in the light of the pronouncements ofthe Labour party. The main objectives of the party, as I conceive them, areto secure that measure of Government control which will ensure the orderly,economical and efficient development of air transport in the public interest, bothin its safety and economic aspects. I have also had in mind the limitations imposed by the present international outlook and the need for establishing thenecessary organisation to face the competition of foreign airlines now in the rapidprocess of re-establishment and development.* CM. (45) 5th Conclusions, Minute 5.
21. Most of the countries of the world are unwilling to subordinate theirsovereign control to an international organisation to own and operate theworld&apos;s aircraft. The opposition of important Commonwealth countries rulesout the feasibility of a Commonwealth Corporation to operate intra-Common-wealth routes. These two objectives are, therefore, unattainable at the presenttime and we are left to consider the most suitable form of national organisation to meet this situation.22.   The main desiderata seem to me to be as follows : (i) Wasteful competition must be avoided either in the form of unnecessarymultiplication of operating agencies or unnecessary overheads.(ii) The form of organisation must permit the attainment of standards of operational efficiency, economy and enterprise necessary to establishour position in international air transport.(iii) Uneconomic and competitive subsidies must be avoided.(iv) Remuneration and conditions of service must be such as to attract theright type of directing and administrative staffs and must conform with good employer standards.23. I do not consider that a single monopoly is best suited to the fulfilment of these objectives. There is an optimum size for any operational unit beyond which there is loss of flexibility, and consequently of efficiency. Moreover, ifthe functions of management are entrusted to a single organisation, the resultmay be to place on one small managerial group, responsibility for handlingmatters having great national importance.24. I conclude that the right policy is to create the minimum number of separate organisations, under Government control, necessary to operate nationalair services. I do not favour allowing competing United Kingdom operatorson the same route or serving the same area. I think that at this stage ofdevelopment the White Paper presented by the previous Government has proposed the right number of organisations with the right division into spheres of responsibility. If the creation of these organisations is subject to the safe-guards referred to in (i)-(iv) above. I feel that the effectiveness of necessaryGovernment control will be ensured.25. In my view, however, the modifications proposed since the issue ofthe White Paper, namely, the right of independent pre-war operators tore-establish their pre-war services and the special concession to Scottish operators,cannot be justified on grounds of operational and economic efficiency. It wouldbe operationally more efficient and more consistent with our general policy, if all European and internal services were entrusted to a single Corporation.26. I am satisfied that surface transport interests have a constructivecontribution to make, in the form of experience and facilities. The railways would not have a controlling interest in the European Corporation; in any case they will presumably, in the lifetime of the present Government, pass into public ownership. It was proposed that the shares of the B.O.A.C. and therailways would, together, amount to 75 per cent, of the total capital; inaddition, 5 per cent, of the capital was provisionally assigned to the travelagencies, which are mainly owned by the railways. As regards the B.O.A.C.I see no reason to alter its present status as a Government-controlled under-taking. Its participation in the other Corporations, taken in conjunction withministerial powers to approve the appointment of the Directors of the boards of these Corporations, would maintain Government control over policy. But Ipropose to take early steps to alter and strengthen the Board of B.O.A.C. Thegrant of a controlling interest to the shipping lines in British Latin AmericanAirlines is more difficult to defend and it is for consideration whether their share should not be reduced to a minority interest, the controlling interest being held by the Government Corporation, B.O.A.C.  I favour this.V. Airfield Policy.27. Pre-war policy left the provision and operation of civil airfields inthe United Kingdom, except for three State-owned aerodromes used mainly for international air transport, to local authorities and private enterprise. Themunicipalities provided about one-third of the total civil airfields and theairline companies limited their own provision to areas in which provision wasnot made by other means.    As internal airline operation was entrusted to a
number of unco-ordinated independent companies, the establishment of civilairfields was completely unplanned. Local authorities complained that theywere encouraged to provide aerodromes only to find that airline services didnot use them.28. Exchequer assistance was limited to the provision of Air traffic control and the Radio and Meteorological Services. Without exception civilairfields were unremunerative. Post-war airfields will be larger and, normally,will require hard runways. The resultant increase of capital and maintenancecosts will be considerable and there is little prospect of a commensurate increaseof revenue from landing fees. Consequently, State financial assistance will benecessary if municipal and commercial ownership of transport airfields is tocontinue. The question arises whether all such airfields should be State-owned.It is arguable that the local community obtain certain advantages for which theyshould pay, but taking all considerations into account, I favour State ownership of transport airfields.VI. Future of Prestwick.29. The main international terminal for the United Kingdom, as announced in Parliament, is to be located at Heathrow, near Staines. The siteis already being developed to meet the requirements of Transport Command.The alternative claims of Prestwick have been urged by Scottish interests, butit is incapable of development to the full standards laid down by the Ministryof Civil Aviation and to the standards adopted by the United States. Further-more, the main terminal must clearly be as near as possible to London as the major traffic centre. Prestwick will be used as an interim terminal airportuntil Heathrow . is ready, and thereafter will be available as a bad weatheralternative. The late Minister for Civil Aviation gave an assurance, announced by the then Parliamentary Secretary in the House of Commons, on the 6th June,that all United Kingdom trans-Atlantic services would land at Prestwick inthe interim period, but B.O.A..C. has strongly objected to the imposition ofthis handicap on British airlines. I favour a decision on this issue solely bythe criterion of operational requirements.VII. Charter Flying.30. The late Government proposed to continue the pre-war policy of leaving charter flying (taxi flying) uncontrolled except for air navigation and safety controls, to which all aircraft are subject. There is a legitimate sphere of development for private charter, as distinct from regular scheduled airlineoperations, and at the International Conference at Chicago there was generalagreement that no economic control over this form of flying was necessary unless it tended to encroach on the field of regular airline services. I see no reasonto dissent from these conclusions, but I regard it as important that charterflying activities should be kept under close review by my Ministry, in order to obviate abuses. Whilst charter flying is likely to become the main province ofprivate companies, the regular airline operators should not be debarred fromparticipating in this field.VIII. Private (non-commercial) Flying.31. Private flying does not call for any policy of control except that whichis necessary in the interests of safety as applied through Air NavigationRegulations.PART C.-AIRCRAFT POSITION.IX. Aircraft Programme.32. The civil aircraft production programme can be conveniently consideredunder the following three main heads : (a) Heavy (multiple engine) types for operation on long distance trunk routes.(b) Medium (twin engined) types for services to Europe and internal services in this country.(c) Smaller types for feeder services, charter work, business firms and private owners.
(a) Heavy [multiple engine) types. .  .33.   The production of these types has been planned in three stages :-(i) conversion of bomber types for immediate &quot;stop-gap&quot; use as trans-ports,  revenue  earning capacity being necessarily of  secondaryimportance;(ii) production of interim types. These represent re-designed bomber types and are competitive with current American transport aircraft inperformance and comfort and are almost competitive in economy of operation;(iii) new civil types designed ab initio as such in accordance with the recom-mendations of the Brabazon Committee.35. In category (i) are the York and the Lancastrian, both developed fromthe 4-engined Lancaster. The Lancastrian is a fast long-range aircraft now in service on the route to Australia. While it is aerodynamically a fine aeroplane,it is uneconomic in operation. The York has a fuselage more suitable for trans-port work. A few are already in operation with B.O.A.C. It is intended to use the York on the services to South Africa and to India and possibly on other routes,e.g., to West Africa and to South America, pending the introduction of the tudor II (see below).35. In category (ii), i.e., interim types, are the Tudor I and the Tudor II.Both are based on the Lancaster bomber but have completely new fuselagesdesigned to meet civil requirements. The Tudor I is a fast long-range type forall-the-year-round operation across the Atlantic. Twenty are on order. the prototype has flown successfully. The Tudor II, of which there are 79 on order,is a medium-range aircraft with a fat body and a much larger payload than the tudor I. Pending the introduction of the Brabazon types referred to below, itwill be the backbone of our fleet on the Commonwealth routes as well as on theservice to South America. South Africa, Australia and India have already indicated that they will use it to operate their parallel services to the UnitedKingdom.36. There remains category (iii), i.e., the Brabazon types. The BrabazonCommittee originally recommended that three new types should be developed in thefour-engined class. The first type recommended was a very large aeroplane ofabout 260,000 lb. all-up weight called the Brabazon I which would be capable of operating from London to New York direct. The development of this type hasbeen entrusted to the Bristol Aeroplane Company. There is also under considera-tion another Brabazon type powered with gas turbine engines driving propellorsas a replacement for the Tudors.(b) Medium (twin-engined) Types.37. In this class there are two British types under development, the VickersViking and the Bristol Wayfarer. The Viking is a fast modern aircraft based onthe Wellington but with a completely new fuselage. Its all-up weight is 34,000 lb.It is intended for our main European services, and for those internal services onwhich traffic is heavy.   Fifty-eight have been ordered.38. The Wayfarer (previously known as the Bristol Freighter), of about35,000 lb. all-up weight, has been developed as a private venture by the bristol aeroplane Company. Its main attractions are its low cost of operation, ease ofmaintenance and ability to operate safely from medium-sized airfields. This isimportant. Its speed is lower than that of the Viking, and it is less suitable thanthe Viking for main services on competitive international routes. In speed,however, it compares favourably with the popular American D.C. 3, and it carriesa larger payload.39. As a successor to the Viking, Vickers have submitted a project for an aircraft to be powered with four gas turbine engines driving propellors.(c) Smaller Types.40. The demand for the smaller types, particularly overseas, will be greaterthan for the larger types discussed above, and it is most important that goodBritish types should be available for export. In the immediate future we shallhave to rely on the De Havilland Dominie, which has earned a world-widereputation, and the newest type of the Avro Anson (Avro XIX). Fifty Dominiesare now being produced for civil purposes, and with the Lend-Lease difficulties outof the way, Ansons will also become available.
41. As replacements for these two types the Brabazon Committee recom-mended the production of a twin-engine 8-seater and a four-engine 14-seater,both, if possible, to have the same engines. The 8-seater is being produced by theDe Havilland Company and is to be called the Dove. The 14-seater is being developed by the Miles Company and is to be called the Marathon.X. General.42. The main problem is to bridge the gap on European services until theViking and Wayfarer become available. At present communications between theUnited Kingdom and continental countries are operated on a military basis by110 Wing of Transport Command, which was created for the purpose and witha view to later transformation to a civil basis. All the aircraft used on these services are Lend-Lease types, and owing to the limitations of the Lend-LeaseActs it would not be possible to use these aircraft for civil commercial serviceswithout buying them outright for dollars. This raises an acute problem of dollarprovision, and I have accordingly been considering, as an alternative, the use ofcaptured German aircraft of the Ju. 52 type. A number of these aircraft areavailable in the British zone in Germany, but I understand that they are not supported by the necessary range of spares to ensure maintenance. They exist in sufficient numbers, however, to cannibalise some of them to maintain the others in operation. The Chiefs of Staff had recommended that these aircraft, in common with all German aircraft, shall be destroyed, but I have sought a specialdispensation for captured German transports in view of our possible need of them.Whilst the operators are prepared to accept them for operation on internal servicesthey strongly oppose their use on the European services in competition with American types used by foreign operators. There is also the psychological reaction of the public to the use of enemy aircraft to be considered,but if the dollar position precludes the purchase of American aircraft it might benecessary, notwithstanding the disadvantages, to employ German aircraft until they can be replaced by British types.43. Now that the war has ended I am pursuing with the Secretary of Statefor Air and the Minister of Aircraft Production the possibility of increasing thenumbers and accelerating the production of civil aircraft types of all classes.44. The existing programmes of manufacture take account of the possibility that a number of foreign countries may wish to purchase British types.PART  D.-PARTICIPATION  IN  AIRLINE  DEVELOPMENT   INFOREIGN COUNTRIES.45. It was the policy of the late Government to foster the participation ofBritish interests in the development of airlines in foreign countries seekingoutside assistance. There is a growing tendency in all countries to establishnational airlines and Latin America and the Middle East, in particular, offeropportunities for British participation. The policy offers the following advantages: (i) It stimulates exports of British aircraft and technical skill;(ii) It provides valuable feeder services connecting with British trunk routeservices;(iii) It assists indirectly in trade development and maintaining Britishfriendship in foreign countries.46. In the main, British participation would be carried out through the medium of the trunk route operator responsible for serving the area in whichfeeder development is required. An agreement for the formation of an Anglo-Egyptian Company, Egyptian Airways, in which B.O.A.C. and Misr air work,the national airline of Egypt, would participate, is now in process of negotiation.Successive changes in the Egyptian Government have created difficulties, but it isexpected that the Agreement will shortly be made. An advanced stage has alsobeen reached in the conclusion of Agreements with the Lebanon and Iraq for theprovision by B.O.A.C. of technical advice and assistance. I propose to extend this policy as rapidly as circumstances permit, but availability of British aircraft is at present necessarily a limiting factor.[30-103]c
