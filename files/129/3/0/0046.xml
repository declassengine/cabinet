Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 246.24th October, 1945.CABINET.FUTURE ORGANISATION OF CIVIL  DEFENCE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.WHEN authorising me to prepare a Bill for the suspension of certain provisions of the Civil Defence Acts, 1937-39, the Cabinet (CM. (45) 25th Con-clusions, Minute 2) invited me to review in the light of the discussion the questionof maintaining a nucleus of the local organisation for civil defence; and to submitmy proposals in the first instance to the Lord Presidents Committee.2. I have now consulted the Lord President and, with his agreement, proposeto defer any detailed proposals for the future organisation of civil defenceuntil the results of saturation raids on enemy territory and of the atomic bombhave been studied. It may well prove that the lessons to be learnt from these methods of attack have a decisive bearing on the problem.3. In the Bill which is to be introduced in the near future suspendingcertain provisions of the Civil Defence Acts, I am obliged for technical reasons to include amongst these provisions the requirement laid upon certain localauthorities by Section 1 of the A.R.P. Act, 1937, to prepare and submit &quot; air raid precautions schemes.&quot;4. It is true that the Bill provides that the suspension may be removed byOrders in Council, but it is important that the enactment of the measure shouldnot give rise to an impression that civil defence, and the part which localauthorities have played in it are of historical interest only, or that civil defence is not still an essential part of the social life and obligations of the country. Inmy Second Reading speech I would therefore propose to make it clear that solong as this country is liable to attack, the Government regard it as essentiala duty to make adequate arrangements for the protection and relief of the civilpopulation, for the mitigation of the effects of air attack, and for the restorationof industry and services after attack, as it is that the fighting services shouldbe maintained for the active defence of the country. Defence, in all its forms,like peace has, in fact, become &quot; indivisible.&quot;5. I would propose to add that a careful study was being made of the effects of the most recent forms of air attack and that the civil defence organisation as hitherto known would be reviewed to see what adaptations and modifications were needed to meet the requirements of the future, should the country unhappily be attacked from the air. In the meantime, the Government hoped that localauthorities, conscious of the great services which they have rendered, would bearin mind that in certain circumstances their assistance might again be requiredin the organisation of civil defence. Equally, the Government trusted that manyof the former members of the services would maintain their association with andtheir interest in civil defence. It might be that in some areas there would bespontaneous action by the members to form social clubs. This will be all to thegood and no doubt local authorities would look benevolently on these ventureswith a view to their developing, later on, into civil defence centres at whichlectures and training in new methods could be given to meet the requirements ofthe future. By such methods the advantages of past experience of active serviceand of continuity would not be lost, and when plans for a new organisation couldbe drawn up and the time came to recruit and train volunteers for the newservices, there would be a nucleus of potential officers, non-commissionecl officersand instructors at hand.6.   i&quot; ask my colleagues to agree to my making a statement on these lines.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1, 24^ October, 1945.[30752]
