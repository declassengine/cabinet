Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.Copy NoSECRET.CP. (45) 214.8th October, 1945.CABINET.POLITICAL BROADCASTING.Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet.THE Prime Minister has asked me to circulate to his colleagues the attached memorandum on Political Broadcasting, prepared by the Lord Privy Seal, and tosay that he will be glad to receive any comments they may wish to make at theearliest possible moment.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,S,th October, 1945.POLITICAL BROADCASTING.Minute by the Lord Privy Seal.Prime Minister.You asked me, in conjunction with the Minister of Information and thePatronage Secretary, to look into the question of Political Broadcasting, as youthought the matter might be raised in the House of Commons.We discussed the question with the Chairman and Deputy Director-Generalof the B.B.C., and later with the Director-General&quot; as well, after his return fromleave.At our first meeting, I left with them a short memorandum representing theviews of my colleagues and myself. To-day, at our discussion, they handed me a document representing the views of the B.B.C. The two documents are broadlyagreed by us and the B.B.C., and fall within the terms of the B.B.C. Charter.The principle on which I have gone is that we should agree a scheme whichwould be acceptable to both the Government and the Opposition.Our discussions were of the friendliest character, and the B.B.C. await yourdecision.If the proposals in the two papers meet with the approval of the Govern-ment, the next step would be to approach the Opposition leaders with a viewto obtaining their concurrence, after which the B.B.C. could be informed of this&quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement.&quot;I suggest that we should proceed to a decision without delay, as it is justpossible that, with so many controversial questions in the air, the opposition might try to storm the position by making demands to be heard over the air.On the 4th October, at our discussion with you and the Lord President,several points were raised which are incorporated in the two documents in square brackets.A. G.Gwydyr House, Whitehall. S.W. 1,5th October, 1945.[30665]
POLITICAL BROADCASTING.Aide-Memoire used in Discussion with the B.B.C.1. The British Broadcasting Corporation started to establish a new service.It was, quite naturally, cautious in its approach to its responsibilities, especially as regards broadcasting of a controversial character. Political broadcastingobviously fell into this category.2. As time went by, and experience was gained, tentative experiments weremade in the realms of controversy, including political controversy.3.   Political broadcasting has now become established and generally accepted.4. The time has now arrived when the political aspects should be recon-sidered in the light of the considerable experience which is now at our disposal,with due regard to the public interest and to the place which broadcasting must now take in our national life.5. The B.B.C. is not a political instrument. It is a cultural agency, a medium for entertainment, a means of worship, a forum for discussion, and adisseminator of news.6.   Political broadcasting may be difficult to define within these categories.7.   I think we can analyse the problem from our point of view as follows :- (a) Political news;(b) Discussions of political issues by non-Parliamentarians;(c) The week in Westminster;(d) Broadcasts of occasions when the Prime Minister or other Minister of high rank makes a statement, e.g., 3rd September, 1945, Lord Mayor&apos;sDay, the opening of a National Savings Effort by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.(e) Opportunities for the clash of political  argument between   &apos;&apos; backbench &quot; M.P.s.;(/) Opportunities for leading members of the Government and of the chiefOpposition to come to grips either consecutively or on separate butfairly close dates;(g) Pre-Election broadcasts by Party leaders;(h) Broadcasts by Party representatives during an Election campaign;(i) Responses to invitations from overseas for public personalities to broad-cast abroad.8.   As regards (a) It is clear that political news should be objective.(6) I see no reason why non-Parliamentarians should not have a &quot; hammerand tongs &apos;&apos; debate on controversial issues [but it is thought thatcare should be taken in the - choice of speakers so as to avoidcranks].(c) This, I think, is excellent and should be continued.(d) 0&apos;n high occasions, the air ought to be free to a Government spokesmanwithout any rejoinder by an Opposition broadcaster [where, forexample, it is necessary to give the nation information, or to put the Government&apos;s position when the public interest requires a replyto statements made in foreign countries. On such occasions,Government broadcasters should speak with restraint and avoid giving cause for a demand for a reply from the Opposition].(e) It would be good for the politically conscious to listen to a goodParliamentary &quot; rough and tumble.&quot;(/) There may be occasions when a high-ranking Minister may feel thathe should deal with a controversial problem which he feels hasbeen misunderstood or completely misconceived. It would be right for a political opponent of equivalent rank in public life to reply,but it should be understood that the Government must have theopportunity of a short rejoinder. [It is a matter for consideration whether factual and expository statements should necessarily be madeby Ministers.]
(g) When a General Election looms up, there may be a desire for political broadcasts, as was contemplated this year. [The circumstances priorto the last General Election were special, and it is thought it wouldbe undesirable to drag out election broadcasting for any lengthyperiod. It is, therefore, proposed that we should not suggest a seriesof broadcasts immediately prior to a General Election.](h) It is accepted now that broadcasts are part and parcel of a GeneralElection campaign.(i) This seems to me to be desirable if the invitations come from responsiblequarters.9. Some of the above matters are entirely within the jurisdiction of theB.B.C., but others involve (a) The Government of the day, and(b) T,he Parliamentary system and technique.These should be clearly matters for discussion between the B.B.C. and the Govern -ment (or in many cases, the Parliamentary machine).I am strongly opposed to bringing the Speaker into this picture, as it placeshim in an unfair position.On Governmental (and Parliamentary) matters, the proper method is to use&quot; the usual channels.&quot;   I think we can make this work.I offer a few other observations :  (1) I am utterly against the abuse of the radio by political speakers whoexceed their allotted time.   The radio is not the House of Commons!(2) My own view is that fifteen minutes is the optimum time for a politicalbroadcast, and I think we should aim at this as a maximum.*(3) I regard it as fundamental that whatever Government is in office, it must play fair by the official Opposition and not neglect the claims of otherminorities, and even single personalities. This is a general principle which any Government must accept. I should like this to be generally recognised.(4) Whilst there is an increasing interest in political issues, I should be against attempting to influence the B.B.C. in favour of an inordinateamount of time for political broadcasting. They would rightly resist,and I should agree with them.(5) The new Charter looms before us and all these considerations must, i submit, be taken into account.A. G.2nd October, 1945.B.B.C. PROPOSALS.Arrangements for Broadcasts by Persons of all Ministerial Ranks.Note. These proposals apply to all broadcasting services controlled by theB.B.C. and to all persons of ministerial rank (viz., the Prime Minister,Cabinet Ministers, other Minsters and Parliamentary Secretaries).1. Before any broadcast by a person of ministerial rank is arranged by theB-B.C, reference should be made to whatever Government Department the Prime&apos;Minister prescribes for dealing with such matters. If the initiative for a ministerial broadcast comes from the Government side, the Government Depart-ment prescribed will ascertain the views of the B.B.C. before conveying approval to the broadcaster.* Note.-It is agreed that the fifteen minutes&apos; limit should apply to studio broadcasts.-Exceptions will need to be made in certain outside broadcasts. e.g., the Prime Ministers speech at the Lord Mayor&apos;s banquet.
2. The B.B.C. is at liberty to express its unwillingness to arrange any suchbroadcast. If it is overruled by the Government, the procedure set out inArticle 4 (2) of the Licence will operate.3. When a broadcast has been given by a person of ministerial rank on a subject which the B.B.C. regards as controversial, the B.B.C. is free to arrange a broadcast or broadcasts by any person or persons expressing differing views. on certain occasions the practice of broadcasting a brief rejoinder by the Govern-ment, as in the case of the pre-war Budget broadcasts, should be arranged. [Itis our view that when the Government desires a statement to be broadcast, whichit regards as controversial, it should so inform the B.B.C., who should then invitethe official Opposition to provide a broadcaster. Other persons might, if thought desirable, also broadcast.]4. If the B.B.C. is prohibited by the Government from putting out anybroadcast, the procedure set out in Article 4 (3) of the Licence will operate.5. When a Debate on a major matter of public policy is imminent or actuallytaking place in Parliament, the B.B.C. should not allow broadcasts of ministerialor other ex-parte statements thereon until the Bill has had its third reading inthe House of Commons or the business has been completed. .6. Arrangements which may be privately come to between the political parties in regard to broadcasting on political matters should not override oraffect this agreement.7. While the acceptance or rejection by Ministers of invitations to broad-cast from overseas broadcasting organisations is not a matter for the B.B.C., itis agreed that, in order to maintain the prestige of the B.B.C.&apos;s own overseas services with their listeners abroad, important statements of policy, if broadcastoverseas by persons holding ministerial rank, will be broadcast through theB.B.C.&apos;s own overseas services or be made simultaneously available to them. [This,in our view, is desirable, but arrangements would need to be made with the overseas broadcasting organisations.]2nd October, 1945.
