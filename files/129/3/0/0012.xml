Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No,CP. (45) 212.6th October, 1945.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, PARIS, OCTOBER 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.THE 27th Session of the International Labour Conference will open in Parison the 15th October. The United Kingdom will as usual be represented by a tripartite delegation representative of the Government, workers and employers.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and National service will be the principal Government Delegate and leader of the Government sideof the Delegation.2. The Conference has a number of important matters on its agenda.Discussion has taken place here between the Government Departments concerned and in the following paragraphs I refer briefly to the principal items on theagenda of the Conference and the lines which, following the inter-Departmentaldiscussions referred to, it is proposed that the Government Delegates should follow.The Maintenance of High Levels of Employment during the Period of industrial rehabilitation and Conversion.3. Under this item the International Labour Office has put forward for theconsideration of the Conference a draft resolution suggesting the principles tobe followed in a number of fields, and dealing with such matters as economic controls including price control and the rationing and licensing of consump-tion goods, investment, financial and monetary policy, the sharing of rawmaterials and other matters. The broad lines of the resolution conform to thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as announced in the White Paper on employment (Cmd. 6527) and no objection arises in this respect. Much of theresolution, however, deals with matters which will in due course be primarilythe concern of the United Nations Organisation, certain of its organs (such as theEconomic and Social Council), or of some of the specialised agencies brought intorelationship with the United Nations. Moreover, while the PhiladelphiaDeclaration gave the International Labour Office the responsibility of examiningeconomic and financial policies in the light of their social objectives it was accepted that it was not the function of the organisation to formulate suchpolicies. It would of course be quite impracticable as well as undesirable to abstain from discussing the draft resolution on these grounds. The I.L.O. hasa legitimate interest in employment matters going back over many years, andit has a special contribution to make to the problem as a result of its tripartitecharacter.It is proposed, therefore, that the British Delegates should (1) accept the general principles of the draft resolution and take part in thediscussions with a view to securing such amendments in the text as are desirable in order to make it completely acceptable to HisMajesty&apos;*s Government,(2) point out that much of the subject matter of the resolution will be the concern primarily of other Organisations connected with the united nations,[30659]
(3) seek to introduce into the resolution an addition calling the matters dealt with to the attention of those other Organisations and expressing the hope that the latter will take the views of the Conference intovery careful consideration.Protection of Children and Young Workers. .....    .4. The Office has put forward a number of proposals under this item.It is proposed that the Conference should consider the preparation of formaltexts with a view to drawing up conventions on two special questions (1) Mediccd Examination for Fitness for Employment (Young Workers)and(2) Night  Work  of Children and   Young Persons  (Non-industrial occupations).The procedure is that after the discussion this year a questionnaire will besent to Governments and on the basis of the replies received from Governmentsdraft Conventions will be drawn up for submission to next year&apos;s Conference.Much of the discussion at the present Conference will be concerned with thematters to be covered by the questionnaire to Governments. The Office proposals on these subjects have been carefully examined and appear to conform closely to existing legislation in this country. It is therefore proposed to agree to the suggested procedure.5. In addition the Office has set forth for the consideration of theConference a draft resolution designed &quot; as a comprehensive plan for the generalorganisation of the protection of children and young persons as future workersor as young workers already in employment.&quot; The scope of this draft resolution is extremely wide covering health, social welfare and education. Similar con-siderations apply in this case as in the case of the resolution on employment policy, that is to say, the terms of this resolution accord generally with the policies of His Majesfy&apos;s Government; but some of the questions covered will indue course be primarily within the field of interest of other organisations forming part of or related to the United Nations Organisation, such as the Economic and social Council and the projected International Organisations to deal with health and Education.It is proposed, therefore, that the British Delegates should take the same kind of line as in the case of the Employment resolution (paragraph 3 above), thatis they should (1) accept the principle of the draft resolution, subject to such amendments in discussion as are desirable in order to make it completely acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government,(2) point out that some of the subject matter of the resolution will be the concern primarily of other Organisations, existing or projected,connected with the United Nations,(3) seek to introduce into the resolution an addition expressing the hopethat in so far as the matters dealt with are primarily the concern of other Organisations the latter will take the views of the Confer-ence into very careful consideration.Constitutional Amendments.6. The Office has put forward a large batch of proposals for amending the Constitution which have as their primary objects : -(1) Cutting the existing links between the I.L.O. and the League of Nations.(2) Creating a Constitution which will enable the I.L.O. to be brought intorelationship with the United Nations Organisation without further amendment of the Constitution.Two alternative methods of dealing with these proposed amendments havebeen suggested : (1) that they should be finally settled at Paris subject to ratificationsubsequently in accordance with the rules;(2) that they should be examined at Paris and thereafter, subject to any modifications decided upon there, submitted to Governments for their observations; the proposals would be modified in the light of theGovernments&apos; observations and submitted for discussion and adoption. at the 1946 Conference.
The League appears many times in the Constitution of the I.L.O., and the imminent winding up of the League will necessitate many alterations in thatConstitution. It may be urgent to make some of these alterations before theLeague is wound up, and this is advanced as a reason for taking final action onthe proposed amendments in Paris. Another reason which has been advanced foradopting this course is that the greatest objection which the Russians have to theI.L.O. is its connection with the League and if that connection were finally cut atan early date it might induce a change of attitude on the part of Russia tothe I.L.O.There are, however, strong arguments for moving cautiously. It would be apity for the I.L.O. to raise what would be regarded in some quarters as thestandard of complete independence, while in the United Nations discussions inLondon representatives of the British and other Governments are emphasising the need for a close connection between the United Nations and the I.L.O.; while there is as yet little indication of the nature of the relationship which will beestablished between the United Nations and the I.L.O., it is clear that nothing should be done which would prejudice the closest possible relationship between these Organisations; future discussions and negotiations may necessitate further amendments to the I.L.O. Constitution beyond those proposed to the Paris Con-ference; and the Constitutional Committee of the Governing Body of the I.L.O.,which is also examining the Constitution, may itself propose further changes.Accordingly, in my view, the balance of advantage lies in keeping the position asfluid as possible at present, and it is proposed, therefore, that the British Govern-ment Delegates at Paris should take the line *(1) that only those amendments to the Constitution which are immediatelyessential should be finally adopted at Paris,(2) that final decisions on all other amendments should be deferred,(3) that generally all proposed amendments should be examined from the standpoint that, while assuring to the I.L.O. at least its existingmeasure of independence, they should not prejudice the establishmentof a close relationship between the United Nations Organisation andthe I.L.O.Minimum Standards of Social Policy in Dependent Territories (SupplementaryProvisions).7. Under this item a draft Recommendation, which has been drawn upon the basis of replies received from Governments to a questionnaire circulatedby the Office following the discussion at the Philadelphia Conference last year,is submitted to the Conference. The Recommendation deals with Wages andThrift, Labour Aspects of Land Policies, Social Security, Placing of Workers,Hours and Holidays, Powers of Labour Inspectors, Conciliation, Health and safety in Employment. Its provisions conform very nearly to the replies givento the questionnaire by this country. In general, the proposed Recommendationappears unexceptionable, but there are certain of its provisions to which it willbe necessary to suggest amendments. Subject to these, it is proposed that theBritish Government Delegates should accept the Recommendation in principle.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,6th October, 1945.
