ANGLO-SOVIET RELATIONS.Conversation between the Secretary of State and M. Molotov on the23rd September, 1945.THE Secretary of State had a talk with M. Molotov at the Soviet Embassythis afternoon.   M. Gousev and I were present and M. Pavlov interpreted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE began by saying, that it seemed to him thatour relationship with the Russians about the whole European problem wasdrifting into the same condition as that which we had found ourselves in withHitler. He was most anxious to avoid any trouble about our respective policies in Europe. He wanted to get into a position in which there was not the slightestroom for suspicion about each other&apos;s motives. M. Molotov had quite rightly saidthat he wanted friendly neighbours and security in the east of Europe. Everyonewho spoke to the Secretary of State about the West suggested that the soviet union was suspicious about a bloc directed against Russia. All that HisMajesty&apos;s Government wanted was to collaborate with their neighbours withoutany offensive intention anywhere in Europe and to recover the rights which theyhad enjoyed before Hitler and for which they had fought. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would do nothing secret or enter into any arrangement against the U.S.S.R.with any offensive design of any kind. What the Secretary of State wanted wasfrankness and friendliness. He wanted to know precisely what was the soviet policy in Europe so that every move made by His Majesty&apos;s Government need notprovoke suspicion. If we made a treaty with France as a neighbour we did not want to be accused of creating a western bloc against Russia. We wanted both our neighbours and ourselves to be prosperous.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then turned to the question of Tripolitaniaand said that he had been told by Mr. Churchill that Marshal Stalin had saidthat Russia had no interest in the Mediterranean. He understood that there wasno agreement to this effect but that Stalin had made some such statement. if his Majesty&apos;s Government knew what the U.S.S.R. wanted, the Russians wouldbe told frankly whether or not it was acceptable to us and we would do our best to fit our policy into it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then made two points to illustrate thekind of doubts he felt. He could not understand why M. Molotov could not befrank about the Dodecanese. About the inland waterways all he wanted wasthat we should get back what we had lost, i.e., our international rights. Heended by saying that he was not willing, indeed he would not go on with aconference in which it was impossible to deal frankly and in a friendly way with each other. If M. Molotov would tell him frankly what was in his mind,what we were expected to agree to, the Secretary of State would lay all hiscards on the table with equal frankness.M. MOLOTOV said that he would begin by referring to what the Secretaryof State had said about Hitler, perhaps rightly or perhaps wrongly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE broke in to say that he did not wish thetalk to start with a misunderstanding. He had not wanted to suggest that theU.S.S.R. in any way resembled Hitler. All he had wished to suggest was thatabsence of frankness led to situations which became irretrievable.M. MOLOTOV said that he understood. Hitler had looked on the U.S.S.R.as an inferior country, as no more than a geographical conception. The Russianstook a different view. They thought themselves as good as anyone else. Theydid not wish to be regarded as an inferior race. He would ask the Secretaryof State to remember that our relations with the Soviet Union must be basedupon the principle of equality. Things seemed to him to be like this : therewas the war.   During the war we had argued but we had managed to come to10916-845   [30450-3] b
terms, while the Soviet Union were suffering immense losses. At that time theSoviet Union was needed. But when the war was over His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had seemed to change their attitude. Was that because we no longerneeded the Soviet Union ? If this were so it was obvious that such a policy, farfrom bringing us together, would separate us and end in serious trouble.M. MOLOTOV then turned to the Dodecanese and. said it was an issue ofno importance. He felt sure that there was room for agreement and that greece would get the islands. But what about the bases in Constantinople which theRussians had suggested? When this question had been raised in Berlin their proposals had been flatly rejected. But during the last war we had offeredConstantinople to the Czar. We need not assume that his Government had hador had now any claims on Constantinople. This was not so. Why were we soconcerned about the Straits which were the entrance to an inland Soviet sea andan area of the highest importance to the security of the Soviet Union ? Turkeycould not defend the Straits alone and we did not want the Russians to come to terms with the Turks. Our present attitude was &quot; far worse&quot; than the treat-ment we had given the Czar during the last war. We wanted the Turks tohold Russia by the throat and when the Russians had asked for one trusteeshipin the Mediterranean we had felt that she was encroaching on our rights. Butwe could not go on holding a monopoly in the Mediterranean. Italy was no longera great Power. Prance had dropped into the background. We were alone in theMediterranean. Could we not at least find a corner for the Soviet merchantfleet ?  It was very hard to understand.M. MOLOTOV then turned to the inland waterways &quot;asa purely Europeanaffair.&quot; It seemed to him much better to regard it in the light of a temporarysituation to persist only during the period of occupation and until the peace treaties were signed with the satellites. If it were settled on this basis thesupreme authorities should be the appropriate Commanders-in-Chief. Otherwiseauthority would be divided and friction would occur and things would becomedamaging alike to us, the Russians, the French and the Americans.M. MOLOTOV&apos;s next point was about our policy in the Balkans. it seemed to him that an offensive was being conducted against the Soviet union in order to &quot; unleash antagonism in the Balkans.&quot;M. MOLOTOV then said that we persisted in declining to recognise WhiteRussians and Ukrainians as citizens of the U.S.S.R. although we had agreed tothe Curzon Line. He did not want to dwell upon these questions, but aboutGermany, our common foe, instead of helping them with reparations we were putting difficulties in the way. We did not want any reparations. He wishedthat we did. At the same time we were not allowing the Russians to take any,even in the present case, where our common foe was in question. He did not wish in this connexion to mention Field-Marshal Wilson&apos;s statement which hadbeen hostile to the Soviet Union. Finally, there was the question of the Far east which the British Ambassador in Moscow had raised with him on the 14th August,suggesting that it would be an appropriate matter for discussion in London.But it had not been discussed and it was a subject which called for frank andfrcc discussion in reply, THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he wished to deal with thepoint M. Molotov had made about equality. It was in matters like this thatmisunderstandings arose. Whatever the Germans had thought about theRussians it had never entered his head, in fact, it had never entered the headsof any member of the Labour Party, to regard the Russians as an inferior race.In fact, the Party&apos;s view had been quite otherwise for many years. Neitherhe nor any of his colleagues approached the Soviet Union with any sense ofsuperiority, nor, indeed, with any sense of inferiority. But in this countrythere was a growing feeling that the tables had been turned and that we werebeing treated as inferiors both by the Russians and the Americans.M. MOLOTOV denied this so far as his people were concerned.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that, nevertheless, it was commonbelief here, and he suggested that the subject should be &quot; taken off the agenda.&quot;We would never allow ourselves to think about the Soviet Union in such termsor to approach any common problem with such a thought in our minds. Wasthat agreed?M. MOLOTOV said yes
THE SECRETARY OF STATE then said that he wished to deal withthe Mediterranean and the Straits. He had not discussed the Straits withanyone or investigated the question since he had been in office. what. Molotov had said about the Czar was true. He remembered it well. Therehad been some discussions about the fact that the Turks were mobilised becauseof their fear of Russia which had sprung from alleged press attacks. He was quite willing, so soon as he could, to study this problem afresh. He had not even had time so far to mention it to the Chiefs of Staff or any militaryauthorities. On the other hand, about Tripolitania, His Majesty&apos;s government did not want a monopoly. As M. Molotov has described the position of theStraits as a strangling of the throat of the Soviet Union, the British Common-wealth had a tremendous fear of anything happening in the Mediterraneanwhich might, so to speak, cut the Empire in half. If he had to deal with thisquestion purely in the light of British interests he would give the trusteeshipof Tripolitania to Italy, but he would want the trusteeship of Cyrenaica,because of its vital importance to Egypt, where his responsibilities were great.He was not in search of wealth, for the country was nothing but sand. He wasthin king purely in terms of security.M. MOLOTOV said : &quot; let us agree.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE replied that there had been a decision in the Council, to which M. Molotov answered that he was not aware of any decision and that he was ready to support Great Britain if it was necessary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then turned to Eritrea and said that wehad wanted to group these territories together and to keep them demilitarised,giving Abyssinia an outlet to the sea. That ought not to have been hard. Itwas a purely British interest and that was how he would like to have seen itsettled. He was putting all his cards on the table face upwards. As to the dodecanese he wanted them to go to Greece. Whether or not they weredemilitarised was a question for the Security Council, but he did not want tosee them used by any Power in a way which would cause trouble or suspicionto the Soviet Union. Turning to inland waterways, he explained that thesefree and open waterways had sprung largely from the old 19th centuryBritish free trade policy, just as we had tried to maintain the freedom of thtfseas for everybody. We were a maritime nation and all we asked was that,when a permanent regime was set up, our position would be restored. He was ready to consent to a temporary regime, and that was why he had not discussedM. Molotov&apos;s paper last night. He had thought it better to study it. There-fore, if it were agreed in principle to restore to us, within a reasonable time,what we had lost, say two or three years, his doubts would be at rest. Hethought that to fix the temporary regime to last as long as Allied control wouldbe a mistake, because no one knew for how long this control would exist.M. MOLOTOV replied that it would be well to settle questions of common interest.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then said that M. Mototov had suggestedthat we wanted to stir up the Balkans (M. Molotov broke in to deny this). Hecould give the utmost assurance that this was not so. He had inherited the troubleabout General Radescu. But there had been a feeling that the Bulgarian and roumanian Governments were difficult. There had been many irritations. Thatwas why the other day he had tried, in quite good faith, to suggest some method to clear the situation up. M. Molotov had at once assumed that this suggestion was directed against himself, but this was a mistake. The Secretary of State wouldhave been just as willing to have an independent enquiry in order to see if our policy in the Balkans was wrong too. So when it was proposed that we should base ourselves purely upon the reports of our men on the spot, this seemed to offer no escape, for the reason that our respective and conflicting views were basedupon these reports.M. MOLOTOV suggested that these reports should be checked more closely.We were at liberty to send any men we trusted and who would be dispassionate,but please not one who had harboured General Radescu.THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked whether such a man would be ableto check up with the Soviet representatives on the spot. To this M. MOLOTOVsaid yes, and the Secretary of State added that all he wanted was to dispelirritation.[30450-3] b 2
THE SECRETARY OF STATE then reminded M. Molotov that he had mentioned the White Russians and Ukrainians. Did this include citizens of theBaltic States? M. MOLOTOV said no, this was a separate question whichwould need discussion. THE SECRETARY OF STATE claimed that we shouldhave to limit ourselves to people who were willing to return to the Soviet Union.To this M. MOLOTOV said that the question was whether we regarded these people as Soviet citizens. THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked whether theywere, indeed, Soviet citizens before the peace treaty was ratified. M. MOLOTOVclaimed that they were, and unquestionably so in the light of what we had signed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE immediately asked what we had signed andM. MOLOTOV referred to what had been li signed&quot; in the Crimea. THESECRETARY OF STATE reminded him that we had done no more than to say(that we would support the Curzon Line, and added that he had been advised that until this Line was ratified he could not turn the people in question out.M. MOLOTOV clung to his claim that, having subscribed to the Curzon Line, wewere obliged to recognise these people as Soviet citizens. What did we think thatthey were ? THE SECRETARY OF STATE suggested that they had becomestateless, to which M. MOLOTOV replied that this meant that we were with-drawing our signature and making 13 million [sic] people stateless. THESECRETARY OF STATE asked what he was to do about the people who did not want to go. Was he to drive them on to a ship \ M. MOLOTOV said that what he wanted was that we should declare that we regarded them as Soviet citizens.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he would have the whole thing looked upto-morrow, meanwhile he thought that he had put in a paper on the subject to theCouncil. M. MOLOTOV said that he had received this paper, and that it hadsurprised him, to which THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that it was better to begin by surprise and then to clear the whole thing up. It was not a questionof policy. M. MOLOTOV insisted that it was, because the people concerned wereSoviet citizens. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that, if what M. Molotovsaid about our having signed an agreement about the Curzon Line were correct,he had no answer. If on the other hand our legal position were correct, he found himself in a difficulty. M. MOLOTOV said that our people had played us false,as they had done in the matter of a recent translation, about which there had beena bad, even a dangerous, mistake.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then turned to reparations, and remindedM. Molotov that at Berlin he had agreed to a period of six months.M..MOLOTOV said that two months had already gone by and nothing had happened. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he understood that therehad been some question about the place in which the Commission should work.Moscow had been found inconvenient and Berlin had now been suggested.M. MOLOTOV said he did not want to argue about that, but he must point outthat the Commission so far had not done &quot; a damn thing.&quot; THE SECRETARYOF STATE said that he had instructed his people to finish the job within sixmonths. M. MOLOTOV suggested that they were frustrating this policy, towhich THE SCERETARY OF STATE replied that they would not be allowed todo so. An agreement was an agreement. He had spoken to Mr. Attlee thismorning because the matter was also a Treasury one. Instructions would beissued that the agreement must be scrupulously kept.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then mentioned the story aboutField-Marshal Wilson and explained that he had repudiated the statement that had been made. To this M. MOLOTOV suggested that the Foreign Office waswashing its hands of the matter and he was informed by the SECRETARY OFSTATE that it was being dealt with by the Ministry of Defence. M. MOLOTOVthen asked me whether I could tell the Secretary of&apos; State how a Russian Marshalwould have been dealt with if he had ventured to make a similar statement aboutGreat Britain.  I knew he would have very short shrift.The Far East was the Secretary of State&apos;s next point. The matter was noton the agenda. He had expected it to be raised and had told M. Molotov so, but nothing had seemed to happen about it. M. MOLOTOV recalled that he had raisedit and had been alone in doing so. THE SECRETARY OF STATE rememberedthat he had been in the Chair, but had said that he had no paper to put in. Atthe time things had been moving too fast in connexion with the surrender of japan. He had felt sure that before the Conference was over something wouldbe said. He did not know what had happened, but he fancied there had been some discussion about it.     M.  MOLOTOV asked  whether  His Majesty&apos;s
22rd September, 1945.Government thought that a Control Commission was necessary in Japan. THESECRETARY OF STATE said that it had been suggested and asked M. Molotovwhether he wanted it. For himself he had not been enthusiastic. M. MOLOTOVreplied that he did not think that the Americans could be left in such completemastery in the Far East as to exclude anyone from a share in the proceedings.They could not tackle the matter alone. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he did not wish to be indiscreet, but he would like to know whether M. Molotovhad discussed the matter with Mr. Byrnes. M. MOLOTOV said no, but it wasa very important one. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he would think itover. M. Molotov reminded him that the British suggestion had been to the effectthat the Soviet Union, the United States, China, the Australians and ourselvesshould all have a hand in it. Something on these lines would be acceptable to theRussians, who were convinced that the Americans would be very hard put to itto do it all alone. THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked if M. Molotov had it in mind that there should be no centralised zones. To this M. MOLOTOV saidyes, adding that he was ready to accept something on the lines of the Britishsuggestion.At this point THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he would like togo back to France. M. MOLOTOV said that he had asked M. Bidault to call on him this evening^ THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that the Cabinet had come to no decision about a Treaty with France. We did not want in our approach to this question to cause any suspicion. But we did feel that in theinterests of our two countries which were so close together and had a similarstandard of living and so on, it would be best for everyone concerned, includingthe Soviet Union, if we had a treaty with France on the same lines as that withthe Soviet Union. We did not want to create (and he rejected the term a western bloc. He would say so in the House of Commons. He did not like any kind of slogans western blocs or eastern blocs. Had M. Molotov any objectionto such a Treaty1? M. MOLOTOV replied that he had not and never had had.We should not attach too much importance to what &quot; irresponsible Soviet news-papers &quot; said about this matter; and he reminded the Secretary of State thatthe Soviet Government had consulted us before signing a treaty with France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE reiterated his enquiry whether the SovietGovernment had any objection. M. MOLOTOV replied that he would report tohis Government and that he would like to be able to tell them that the purposeof the treaty would be the same as that of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty -that was tosay against German aggression. He did not foresee any kind of objection. THESECRETARY OF STATE said that no negotiations had been opened with france, but he would soon be asked about the matter in the House of Commons.The Cabinet would therefore have to decide. That was why he had brought the question up with M. Molotov.In conclusion, THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he thought thetalk had been a useful one. M. MOLOTOV agreed, and said that any time theSecretary of State wished to talk he would be glad to join him. He had come tothis country not only to attend the official meetings of the Council, but also tohave such conversations as the present one.A. C. K.
