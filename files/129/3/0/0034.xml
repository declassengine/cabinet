Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 234.Vdth October, 1945.CABINET.NEWFOUNDLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.NOW that the war is over and Newfoundlanders who have served in theForces are returning to their homes, it is desirable that I should make knownas soon as possible the procedure which we have in mind for enabling the peopleof the Island to choose their future form of government for themselves. I annexaccordingly (Appendix A) the draft of a statement which I propose, with theapproval of my colleagues, to make in Parliament at an early convenient date.This follows up, and gives precision to, the general statement of policy made withthe approval of the War Cabinet in December 1943 (Appendix B).The considerations which I have had in mind in preparing my proposed state-ment are set out fully in a memorandum (Appendix C), and I annex also a report made to me by Mr. Clutterbuck, the Assistant Under-Secretary of State concerned,on certain informal talks which he recently had with the Canadian authorities at ottawa at my request (Appendix D).The main points are :  -(1) We should arrange to set up in the spring of 1946 an elected NationalConvention of Newfoundlanders, whose duty would be to review the alternative courses open to the Island and to make recommenda-tions to His Majesty&apos;s  Government as a basis for a national. referendum.(2) At the same time we must recognise that Newfoundlands present favour-able financial position is the result largely of war-time developments and activities, and that it is a very open question how the Islandis likely to fare in the future under normal peace conditions.(3) If therefore we are to ensure that any new Government taking over inthe Island would be able to do so with reasonable prospects of main-taining financial stability in the years ahead, it will be necessary forthe Island to be guaranteed financial assistance for reconstruction and development. Unfortunately, however, there is no prospect, inthe Chancellor&apos;s view, of our being able to find the dollars for thispurpose, nor, in fact, would the Canadians welcome our doing so.It has further been established that the Canadians would not beprepared under present conditions to finance reconstruction in the island themselves.(4) Evidence is, however, beginning to accumulate that there is now a growingmovement of opinion in the Island towards union with Canada. Ithas always been felt here that Newfoundland is too small a unitto be able to stand successfully on its own feet, except at the priceof a standard of living and of administrative and social servicesmuch lower than those on the mainland. Union with canada is its natural destiny. We know, too, that this is recognised byMr. Mackenzie King, who has indicated privately that he wouldwarmly welcome a decision by Newfoundlanders to enter the Canadianfold and would do his best to assure them generous terms.(5) In these circumstances, we must, I feel, adapt our policy to the changed conditions, and since we cannot look ourselves to helping Newfound-land financially, we should now regard union with Canada as the[30721] b
objective to be aimed at. It would, of course, be most important thatno hint that this is the solution which we envisage should be allowedto come out either here or in Newfoundland. The initiative mustbe left entirely to the Newfoundlanders, and we must take care toavoid any appearance of seeking to influence them in any way. Atthe same time, we must say or do nothing which would conflict withthis objective or make it harder to achieve.(6) If this view is accepted, it follows that my statement in Parliamentmust contain a clear warning that in all probability we shall be unableto help financially in long-term reconstruction in Newfoundland. this may be disappointing to Parliament, but any other course would be unrealistic, and unfair to the Newfoundlanders themselves. Moreover,it may be hoped that a warning on these lines would aid the swingof opinion towards Canada.(7) At the same time, I should like to reserve for the present the questionof the remission of the Island&apos;s guaranteed sterling debt (about 17 million). We should, I think, keep clearly in mind that in all probability it will &quot;be desirable for the debt to be remitted as theUnited Kingdom Governments contribution to any settlement whichmay be achieved, whether the choice of the Newfoundlanders is forunion with Canada or for responsible government.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,ISth October, 1945.APPENDIX A.Draft Parliamentary Statement.aSINCE assuming office the Government have reviewed the position inrelation to Newfoundland.Before proceeding to describe the measures which we propose, I should liketo refer briefly to three preliminary points : Eirst, as a result very largely of war-time developments and of the special conditons that have obtained during the war, the financial position of the Islandhas been transformed during the last five years. It has not only been self-supporting since 1941 but has built up an accumulated surplus which now standsat some $25 million.Secondly, under the agreement made with the Newfoundland people in 1933a pledge was given that as soon as the Island &apos;s difficulties had been overcome andthe country was again self-supporting, responsible government on request fromthe people of Newfoundland would be restored. In a statement made in Parlia-ment in December 1943 on behalf of the National Government, it was made clearthat the whole policy of the United Kingdom was governed by this undertaking.Thirdly, such being the general background, it was further indicated in thesame statement that as soon as practicable after the end of the war, machinery would be provided for enabling the Newfoundland people to examine the futureof the Island and to express their considered views as to the form of government they desire having regard to the financial and economic conditions prevailing atthe time.His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, fully endorse the statement ofpolicy made on behalf of the National Government in 1943 and intend to proceed as speedily as possible with the setting up of appropriate machinery for thispurpose. This they consider, after consultation with the Commission of Govern-ment, could most suitably take the form of an elected National Convention ofNewfoundlanders.   They accordingly propose the following programme : 1. Elections to a National Convention will be held in the spring of 1948as soon as climatic conditions permit probably in the month of May. All adultswill be entitled to vote and the elections will be held on the basis of the Parlia-mentary constituencies of 1925 with such variations as may be found desirable in the light of the new census which is being taken in Newfoundland this year.Candidates for election will be required to be bona fide residents in the districtsthey seek to represent.
2. It will be the duty of the Convention to review all the alternative courses open to the Island and to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s government as a basis for a national referendum. It is fitting, therefore, that it should begiven wide terms of reference, and these might take the following form : -&quot; To consider and discuss amongst themselves, as elected representativesof the Newfoundland people, the changes that have taken place in the financialand economic situation of the Island since 1934, and, bearing in mind the extentto which the high revenue of recent years has been due to war-time developments,to examine the position of the country and to make recommendations, for submission-sion to His Majesty&apos;s Government, as to the best means of enabling the newfoundland people at a referendum to express their views as to the futureform of Government.&quot;3. The Convention will be presided over by a Judge of the Supreme Courtof Newfoundland. In order that members may be given adequate guidance on constitutional forms and procedure it is contemplated that an expert adviserfrom the United Kingdom would be available to assist the Convention as required.His Majesty&apos;s Government further propose to prepare and to make available tothe Convention when it meets a factual and objective statement on the financialand economic situation. This would analyse developments in revenue andexpenditure since 1934, give particulars of the cost of maintaining the variouspublic and social services, review the country&apos;s import and export trade and themain branches of economic activity and survey the principal lines of policyfollowed by the Commission of Government and their financial implications. this statement will be made available to Parliament at the same time.4. The intention would be that the Convention should meet immediatelyafter the elections, say in June next. If, as is hoped, the discussions at theConvention should result in a sufficiently marked consensus of opinion to enablerecommendations as to the future course of action to be submitted to the UnitedKingdom Government, the next step would be for such recommendations to beconsidered by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Subject to their being such as to raiseno prima facie difficulty from the standpoint of acceptance by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and by Parliament, the way would then be clear for the holding of a referendum at which the issues could be put to the Newfoundland peoplefor their decision.It is hoped that under this procedure there will be full scope for the wholequestion of constitutional change to be examined by a representative body ofNewfoundlanders, and then decided by the NeAvfoundland people themselves, inthe course of the next twelve months. In the meantime the Commission ofGovernment have been giving careful study to the reconstruction needs of the island. These may be divided into short-term and long-term. So far as theformer are concerned, the Commission have already put in hand a series of measures designed to meet the. more pressing requirements of the next two orthree years. These include a comprehensive scheme which has been received withgeneral approval in the Island, for the rehabilitation of ex-service men, andschemes for fishery development, land settlement and the improvement of communications and hospital services. It is clearly necessary that these schemes should proceed without interruption and provision for implementing them will accordingly continue to be made in the Island&apos;s annual budget. There need be noapprehension, therefore, that progress in re-equipping the Island to meet the needsof the future will in any way be slowed down by the arrangements now proposed for enabling the constitutional issue to be determined. Longer-term measures are, however, in a somewhat different category, since any new Government will no doubt wish to frame its own development policy and care must be taken to seethat it is left the maximum freedom to do so, consistent with reasonablecontinuity. In other words, the aim of the Commission must be to forge ahead with immediate measures but on longer-term schemes to refrain so far as possible from commitments now which would tie the hands of their successors^. TheCommission of Government will, however, be able to advise the Convention ofthe rough order of development and reconstruction expenditure which in their view is likely to be required over the next ten years.It will be the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government, when communicating to theConvention the factual financial and economic survey mentioned above, to make clear at the same time their own position in relation to possible future financialassistance to the Island. In the meantime, I should perhaps sound a warning[30721] $ 2
against any exaggerated expectations on this account. The currency of New-foundland is the Canadian dollar, and we are now so short of Canadian dollarsthat the future financing of imports from Canada essential to the life and welfare of our own people constitutes in itself a formidable problem. I think it rightto indicate these difficulties, since our relations with Newfoundland have been so special and Newfoundlanders have played such a gallant part in the fightingservices that it would, I know, be the wish of us all to assure to any new Govern-ment which may take over in the Island the fairest possible start. But we must,above all, be careful not to promise what we may not be able to perform, and thespecial difficulties of our financial position over the next few years may wellpreclude us from undertaking fresh commitments on this account.APPENDIX B.Statement oe Policy House oe Commons, 2nd December, 1943.THE arrangements made in 1933 included a pledge by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment that as soon as the Island&apos;s difficulties had been overcome and the country was again self-supporting, responsible government, on request from the people of new foundland, would be restored. Our whole policy is governed by this under-taking.Owing, however, to the existing abnormal conditions caused by the war which make it impossible for the Newfoundland people as a whole to come to a considered conclusion as to the Island&apos;s future prospects, there should be nochange in the present form of Government while the war lasts.As soon as practicable after the end of the war, that is, the war in Europe,machinery must be provided for enabling the Newfoundland people to examinethe future of the Island and to express their considered views as to the form ofGovernment they desire, having regard to the financial and economic conditions prevailing at the time. In the meantime the Secretary of State will takesoundings in order to ascertain what kind of machinery would be acceptable tothe Newfoundland people.If the general wish of the people should be for a return to full responsible government we for our part shall be very ready, if the Island is then self-supporting, to facilitate such a change.If, however, the general wish should be either for the continuance of thepresent form of Government or for some change of system which would fall short of full responsible government, we shall be prepared to examine such proposalssympathetically and consider within what limits the continued acceptance ofresponsibility by the United Kingdom could be recommended to Parliament.In the meantime a vigorous attempt should be made to push on with thedevelopment of local government, on which the members of the Mission have made some interesting recommendations, as well as with general reconstruction plans.Every effort should be made to encourage the development of local governmentinstitutions, which would afford a base for an effective central Government.APPENDIX C.Memorandum.POLICY in relation to the future of Newfoundland is at present governed by the statement made in the House of Commons with the Approval of the Wardabinet on the 2nd December, 1943 (Appendix B). This provided that as soonas practicable after the end of the war in Europe machinery would be set up toenable the Newfoundland people &quot;to examine the future of the Island andto express their considered views as to the form of Government they desire, havingregard to the financial and economic conditions prevailing at the time.&quot;2.   The main, factors then in mind were : (a) Under the arrangements made in 1933, it was necessary for twoconditions to be satisfied before responsible Government could be restored. First, the Island had again to be self-supporting. Secondly,there had. to be a request from the people on which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could act.
(b) Newfoundlands economy had been transformed by war-time develop-ments, and since 1941 she had not only paid her way but had built up a modest surplus, the bulk of which she had lent to the UnitedKingdom free of interest for the prosecution of the war. It couldbe claimed&quot; therefore, that the first condition had been met and thatthe Island was again self-supporting.(c) As regards the second condition, however, there was no indication of any widespread wish on the part of the Newfoundland people for a returnto responsible government. On the contrary, it was strongly felt inthe Island that there should be no change in the form of government during the war and that whether a change would be desirable there-after, and the form which any such change should take, would depend to a great extent on the economic outlook for the Island when peacewas restored. In this last connection it was fully appreciated by public opinion that the present favourable turn in the Island&apos;sfortunes was very largely due to war conditions and that it remainedan open question how the Island would fare when war-time activitiesceased.(d) There was also a strong feeling that decisions as to the future of the island could not appropriately be taken while so many of the youngergeneration were absent from their homes on war service overseas.3. In these circumstances it was felt by the War Cabinet that, if the newfoundland people wished to take their time in coming to a decision on theconstitutional issue, it would be unfair to hurry them into snap conclusions;and that the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government should therefore be, while making it clear that the choice would henceforward lie with the Newfoundland people,to set up machinery in the Island after the war which would not only pave theway for a referendum but would enable them to examine and debate the future ofthe Island amongst themselves before the stage of a referendum was reached.4. The considerations which underlay the conclusions of the War Cabinethold good to-day. Newfoundland has continued to balance her budget with ease,her accumulated surplus now stands at some $25 million (or rather more thanone year&apos;s total expenditure), and there is no sign at present of any markedrecession in her general prosperity. At the same time, so far from this leading to a demand for a return to responsible government, there is increasing evidencethat public opinon feels that the constitutional issue should be approached withgreat caution. It is clear that in these circumstances it would be sound policy to adhere to the procedure sketched in the statement of 1943 under whichNewfoundlanders would have full opportunity to ventilate amongst themselves the alternative courses open to the Island before deciding on their future form,of Government.5. As regards the form of machinery to be set up in the Island for thispurpose, it seems essential that any body of Newfoundlanders called on to consider these important issues should be elected by the people themselves rather thannominated by the Newfoundland Government. It is proposed accordingly thatas a first step elections should be held in the Island in the spring of 1946 assoon as climatic conditions permit, say in May, to provide members of a NationalConvention of Newfoundlanders. Elections would be held on the basis of theformer Parliamentary constituencies of 1925, with such variations as might befound desirable in the light of the new census which the Newfoundland Govern-ment are taking this year, and all adults would be entitled to vote. In order toensure full representation of the fishermen and others in the outports, allcandidates for election would be required to be bona fide residents of the districtsthey seek to represent.6. This would give a membership for the Convention of about 50. TheConvention would meet, say in June, under the chairmanship of a Judge of theSupreme Court and its task would be to examine the future of the Island andthe courses open to it and to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment as a basis for a referendum. It would be assisted in this task (a) on theconstitutional side, by an expert adviser from the United Kingdom who wouldbe available for advice as required; (b) on the financial side, by a factual andobjective survey of the financial and economic position which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would prepare and lay before it. This survey would be made avail-able to Parliament at the same time.
7. It is hoped that as a result of the discussions in tne Convention a cleartrend of opinion will become manifest as to the course which the Newfoundlandpeople should be recommended to pursue. In that event the recommendations ofthe Convention would, if all goes well, provide the basis for a national referendum.Subject to the results of the referendum, the change in the form of government might take place at an early convenient date in the following year.8. This procedure should meet adequately the constitutional aspect of theproblem and is generally in accordance with the expectations based on the state-ment of 1943. But it is clear that opinion both in Newfoundland and in Parlia-ment here will expect any new statement dealing with the constitutional issue to deal also with Newfoundland^ reconstruction needs. There has been strong pressure in Parliament in recent years not only for progress in facilitating the resumption of self-government by Newfoundland, but also for the grant to the island of substantial financial help for post-war reconstruction. There has beena general feeling in Parliament that, while the Commission of Government has done much good in the Island, it has never had the funds to go in for any large-scale development policy, and that, if the government of the Island is now to be handedback to Newfoundlanders, His Majesty&apos;s Government should ensure, in fulfilment of their special obligations for its welfare, that sufficient money is put into its development to carry the prospect of making it permanently self-supporting andso avoid the risk of the 1933 chapter of events having to be faced all over again.It was largely on these grounds that the Parliamentary Goodwill Mission of 1943pressed strongly for generous help by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards a long-term reconstruction programme.9. It has similarly been strongly felt by the Dominions Office that witheconomic prospects in the post-war world so uncertain, it would be invitingdisaster if Newfoundland were to be encouraged to return to self-government without at the same time ensuring that it had every reasonable prospect of main-fcaining financial stability. This could, in fact, only be assured if the Island couldcount, even when self-governing, on sufficient financial assistance from the UnitedKingdom to enable it to carry through the measures of reconstruction and develop-ment needed to re-equip itself for the future. A further point was that indefault of the promise of such assistance the Convention might refuse to opt .for self-government and might advocate instead continued association with the united Kingdom under some form of constitution which would be a half-wayhouse. This would be very embarrassing, since all experience shows that in thespecial circumstances of Newfoundland there is no satisfactory half-way housebetween the present form of Government and self-government.10.   At the late Secretary of State&apos;s request, the Commission of Govern-ment worked out last year a provisional programme of reconstruction and develop-ment covering the next ten years.   The total capital expenditure involved was estimated at f 100 million, and it was calculated that this in turn would lead to increased maintenance charges of the order of $3 million a year.   After carefuldiscussion with the Commission a scheme was drawn up providing for capital requirements to be assured through the creation by United Kingdom legislation jof a Newfoundland Development Fund from which grants might be made to the jNewfoundland Government over a ten-year period towards agreed schemes for reconstruction and development.   As regards the increased maintenance charges,it was felt that these might best be met through the remission of the Island&apos;s \guaranteed sterling debt (about  17 million), the conception being that the money at present devoted to payments of interest and sinking fund on this stock should jbe earmarked by the Newfoundland Government for meeting the maintenance jexpenditure resulting from the development programme.   It was felt that there mission of the debt would be a gesture which would be warmly welcomed jjboth in this country and in Newfoundland and would remove at last the damagingsuspicions that have always dogged the administration since 1933, that HisMaiesty&apos;s Government are more interested in acting as bailiffs for the bond-holders than in the true welfare of the Island.11. This scheme has been under discussion with the Treasury since the Iautumn of 1944. At a fairly early stage in the discussions agreement was reached!that the expenditure contemplated was not out of line either with the necessities!of the case or with the assistance approved by Parliament for development ahdiwelfare in the Colonies, and it is understood that, had sterling commitments qnlyibeen involved, no difficulty would have arisen in making the scheme the subject!
7107of a joint recommendation to the Cabinet by Sir John Anderson and LordCranborne. The currency of Newfoundland is however the Canadian dollar, ofwhich the United Kingdom is likely to be acutely short for many years to come,and the fact that expenditure in Canadian dollars would be required has proved a fatal difficulty. Shortly after assuming office, Lord Addison took up the matteranew with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who in reply said that he could see&quot; no prospect whatever &quot; of this country being able to provide the finance requiredfor reconstruction in Newfoundland; the exchange problem which this would present would, in his view, be quite insoluble and he added that, if the money was to be provided, it would have to come from Canada.12. It had, of course, always been plain that before any final conclusionscould be reached as to the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government should follow,it would be necessary to consult informally with trie Canadian Government, whowould naturally be interested from the political as well as the financial stand-point. Accordingly, at the Secretary of State&apos;s request, Mr. Clutterbuck, the assistant Under-Secretary of State concerned, paid a special visit to Ottawa lastmonth for the purpose of comparing notes with the Canadians on the position now reached.  Mr. Clutterbuck&apos;s report is attached (Appendix D).13. It will be seen that the Canadian attitude as now established is in brief(1) that while sympathising with our difficulties they feel that it would be politically out of the question for them to provide the United Kingdom with thenecessary funds for financing a reconstruction programme in Newfoundland;(2) that similarly there could be no question of&apos; their wishing under presentconditions to take on the responsibility of financing Newfoundland reconstructionthemselves; (3) but that if the Newfoundlanders themselves, as a result of theforthcoming Convention, were to opt for joining the Canadian Confederation, theCanadian Government would greatly welcome such a development and would endeavour to effect the most generous settlement possible.14. In this connection it should be explained that though confederationwith Canada was almost brought about in 1867 and again in 1895, there hastraditionally been a strong feeling in Newfoundland that this would not serve the Island&apos;s true interests and a strong desire among Newfoundlanders to main-tain their independence. One of the assumptions under which the scheme for along-term development programme was worked out was that it was most unlikelythat there would be any change in this attitude. There is now some evidencehowever that the traditional hostility towards union with Canada may bebreaking down. This is no doubt due in part to a growing realisation that, withits population of 300,000 and its limited resources, Newfoundland is too small a unit to stand by itself in the modern world, and that it cannot look indefinitelyto be propped up by the United Kingdom whenever it feels in need; yet withoutexternal assistance it is unlikely to be able to make both ends meet except at a standard of living and social services far below that on the mainland. Inaddition, too, the numerous ties with Canada in trade, communications, defence,education and in business activities of all kinds, as well as in cultural and churchmatters have been greatly strengthened during the war. But above all this, and perhaps of overwhelming significance is the new social security programme nowin force in Canada, the chief attraction of which is a scheme of family allowanceson a scale which to most Newfoundlanders would make all the difference betweenpoverty and comfort. Once the full implications of these measures have pene-trated the consciousness of Newfoundlanders in their remote settlements, theresult may well be a rapid swing of opinion towards Canada.15. Should Newfoundland in fact choose to join up with Canada, thiswould undoubtedly be by far the best, and indeed the only permanently satis-factory, solution. The advantages to the people would be immense. The costof living in the Island would be much reduced, since the tariff between Newfound-land and Canada, which supplies most of the Island&apos;s requirements, would disappear; as part of a larger unit, Newfoundland would be assured of muchgreater stability and much fuller employment opportunities for her people; while in the field both of social security and in that of the social services generally she would find herself in the happy position of having most of her needs provided from the Dominion Exchequer on a scale far beyond anything which she could hope to attempt from her &quot;own resources. Newfoundland is a trans-Atlanticcountry not only geographically but also in the outlook and habits of her people.Union&apos;with Canada Is surely her natural destiny.
16.   The position thus reached is in brief : (a) That if His Majesty&apos;s Government are to be assured that, the Islandwill continue to be self-supporting over the next ten years, it willhave to be guaranteed financial assistance for reconstruction anddevelopment.(b) That in the Chancellors view there is no prospect of the UnitedKingdom being able to find the dollars required for this purpose, nor would the Canadians welcome our doing so.   -(c) That the Canadians for their part are not prepared under presentconditions to finance reconstruction in the Island themselves.(d) That there has lately been evidence of a growing swing of opinion inthe Island towards union with Canada.(e) That Mr. Mackenzie King would for his part greatly welcome a decision by Newfoundlanders to opt for entry into the Canadian fold andwould do his best to assure them generous terms.17. In these circumstances it is suggested that the best course would be to adapt our policy to these changed conditions and to regard union with Canadaas the objective to be aimed at. It would, of course, be fatal to take any overtstep to encourage Newfoundlanders in this direction, or even to let it become known that this is the solution envisaged. On the other hand, care must betaken that nothing is said or done which would be inconsistent with this objective or make it harder to achieve. If this is agreed, it follows that it will no longer be possible to pursue the idea of a long-term reconstruction programmefinanced by grants from the United Kingdom Exchequer, and, indeed, that itmust be made clear to the Newfoundland people that, much as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would like to help them, they are unlikely to be able to do so. (Itis considered that the question of the remission of Newfoundlands guaranteedsterling indebtedness should be reserved for further consideration.) A statement on the above lines is likely to create disappointment in Parliament, but any other course would be unfair to the Newfoundlanders. It would clearly be most fortunate if they were to be deterred from looking to Canada by expectationsof assistance from*iis which are unlikely to be realised; on the other hand, ifthey are given a clear warning now that they should not count on help from theUnited Kingdom, this may do much to aid the swing of opinion towards Canada.18. Both Parliament and public opinion in Newfoundland are expectingan early statement from the Secretary of State setting out in full the measurescontemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government for enabling Newfoundlanders tocome to a decision about their future. The draft statement in Appendix Ahas been shown informally to Canadian officials and would, it is understood, giverise to no difficulty from the point of view of the Canadian Government. Itwould, however, be necessary for the draft to be telegraphed to the Commissionof Government for their general concurrence before the statement is made.APPENDIX D.Report by Mr. Cltjtterbtjck.I arrived in Ottawa on the 15th September under instructions from theSecretary of State to compare notes with the Canadians on the Newfoundlandproblem. My discussions were to be quite informal and were to take place againstthe background knowledge that, owing to the difficulties of the dollar position,the Chancellor could see no prospect of the United Kingdom being able to providefinance for a reconstruction programme in Newfoundland.2. After consultation with the High Commissioner, who advised that thebest form of approach would be to lay our cards frankly on the table, discussions were opened with the Senior Canadian officials concerned on the 18th September.Those on the Canadian side were: Mr. Norman Robertson (Under-Secretary ofState for External Affairs), Mr. Hume Wrong (Associate Under-Secretary ofState), Mr. McKay (head of the Newfoundland Division of the Department of external Affairs), and Mr. Scott Macdonald (Canadian High Commissioner in newfoundland). I, for my part, was accompanied by the Deputy High Commis-sioner (Mr. Holmes) and the Senior Secretary at the High Commissioner^ Office(Mr. Garner).
3. As a result of an informal approach made by Mr. Hume Wrong toLord Cranborne at San Francisco and of certain subsequent remarks made byMr. Mackenzie King to Lord Cranborne, we had gathered the impression that the canadians had themselves been giving a good deal of thought to the Newfound-land problem and had certain ideas which they were anxious to discuss with usbefore conclusions as to future policy were reached. This impression was shared by the High Commissioner. Accordingly, at our first meeting, after rehearsingthe plans in view to enable the Newfoundland people to choose their future formof government, I went on to explain that we were most anxious to ensure that any new Government taking over in the Island would have reasonable prospects offinancial stability; with this object in view we had hoped to accompany our pro-posals on the constitutional side by a 10-year reconstruction programme financed by a specially created Newfoundland Development Fund from which grants couldbe made towards agreed schemes, on the application of the Newfoundland Govern-ment, within a specified overall total. Unfortunately, these hopes had now beendashed by the difficulties of our dollar position, difficulties which were bound to persist whatever the outcome of the general financial discussions relating toStage III. The whole Newfoundland situation would accordingly have to bere considered by my Government, and it would be of the greatest help to them toknow how the position was viewed by the Canadian authorities and what was their attitude towards the future of the Island.4. To my surprise, the initial reaction of the Canadian officials to this approach was almost entirely negative. They began by explaining that there was an almost complete absence of interest in Canada in Newfoundland affairs. this applied not only to the Canadian public, but also to Canadian Ministers and officials. The fact was that Canadians had too many problems of their own to concern themselves with Newfoundland. Not a single question had ever beenasked about Newfoundland at the weekly Press Conferences of the Department of external Affairs over the last three years, nor had policy towards the Island been seriously considered either by Ministers or by their official advisers. It was truethat, in connection with the new financial proposals recently put by the dominion government to the Provinces, an attempt had been made by the NewfoundlandDivision to work out what it would cost the Dominion if Newfoundland were toopt for union with Canada, but this was in the nature of academic exercise andnothing more.5. In these circumstances the Canadian officials, while sympathising Avithour difficulties, felt that they could offer little useful comment. We would under-stand that against this general background of lack of interest it would be politic-ally out of the question for the Canadian Government to provide us with thedollars necessary to finance reconstruction in Newfoundland (all the more so as any money provided for this purpose would reduce pro tanto the funds whichwould otherwise be available to us for financing United Kingdom imports from canada); similarly, there could be no question of their being able under presentconditions to make any direct contribution themselves to reconstruction in the island, since this would at once get them into trouble with their own Provinces.They much appreciated our action in consulting them, but they could see no prospect in the circumstances of being able to help.6. I did not conceal my disappointment at this reply and pointed out thatsuch a position would be very unsatisfactory from the Newfoundland point ofview. If we on our side were unable to help her in her reconstruction measuresowing to lack of dollars, while the Canadians, on their side, were not disposed todo so owing to lack of interest, who could be surprised if Newfoundlandersbegan to think seriously of turning to the United States, which now has a definitestake in the Island and is, furthermore, the natural market for the new frozenfish industry it is planned to develop ? Was I to understand that Canada wouldbe quite indifferent to such a development ? There were many aspects-defence,air communications, the development of Labrador in which Canada was surelyvery closely interested and of which account would have to be taken. However,the importance of these from the Canadian standpoint was for them rather thanus to assess. But my Secretary of State would certainly expect me to take backwith me a definite indication of the Governments attitude.7. At this stage the Canadian officials became more helpful, and I was asked what my Governments reaction would be if the Canadian Government wereto indicate to us that they would welcome a recommendation by the proposed[30721] c
National Convention in favour of Newfoundland joining up with Canada. Inreply, I said that any such indication would certainly be warmly received by my government; it had always been felt by those concerned with Newfoundlandaffairs that union with Canada was the Island1 s natural destiny. Finally, after further discussion of the attractions of such a course from both the canadian and the Newfoundland point of view, it was agreed that as the next step I shouldhave a talk with Mr. McKay and Mr. Scott Macdonald and examine with them the financial implications of a decision by Newfoundland to enter the CanadianConfederation. In this connection the Canadian officials explained to me that itwould be very desirable to avoid a situation in which special treatment wouldhave to be given to Newfoundland, since this would certainly create difficulties with the Canadian Provinces and lead to undesirable controversy. Matters wouldbe much easier from their point of view if Newfoundland could make both endsmeet on the same financial terms as were applicable to the Canadian Provincesgenerally.8. For the basis of this examination we took the new proposals in the field of Dominion-Provincial financial relations which have lately been put by theDominion Government to the Provinces. These are now under consideration byProvincial Governments and are to be discussed at a Conference during thewinter when it is hoped that general agreement will be reached. On the basisof these proposals it was found that in all probability there would be a gapof the order of $2 million a year between Newfoundland&apos;s revenue and expendi-ture, after allowing on the one hand for the transfer to the Dominion Governmentof the various services, revenue-earning and otherwise, which would fall withinthe Dominion sphere, and on the other hand for the grants and subsidies fromthe Federal Exchequer which Newfoundland, as a Province, would receive. Itwas felt, however, that this gap would, in practice, be fairly readily bridgeable,eg., through taxes on tobacco, cars and gasoline (which are Provincial matters)and the imposition of a sales tax on selected commodities, of a nature which wouldnot impair materially the reduction in the cost of living that would be broughtabout by union with Canada. In other words, it was thought that there was good prospect that, so far as current expenditure was concerned, Newfoundlandwould be able to provide satisfactorily for her local services as a Province without being given more favourable treatment than other Provinces. In addition, she would be eligible under the Dominion-Provincial proposals for assistance towardscapital expenditure in developing services, particularly health and education,not taken over by the Dominion Government.9. It should be added that these conclusions were based on the assumptionthat Newfoundland&apos;s external debt would be a matter for separate discussion.Accordingly, debt charges were not taken into account in our calculations. Itwas agreed also that there would be no question of the Dominion Governmentclaiming any part of the surplus (now $25 million) built up by Newfoundlandduring the war. The whole of this surplus would thus be available to the newfoundland Government for Provincial purposes.10. We reported these conclusions to the full meeting of the Canadiangroup of officials, and in further discussion, the latter adopted a much more forth-coming attitude. Figures were produced to show that apart from statutorygrants and subsidies Canada would be liable, if she were to take over Newfound-land, for annual expenditure on social security measures alone of the order of$15 million. This included over $8 million for children&apos;s allowances andover $4 million for old age pensions. As against this expenditure andthat on the various administrative services, including the railway, whichwould, be taken over, would, have to be set receipts from customs duties,income tax, post office, &amp;c, The probability was that such receipts would leave the Federal Exchequer substantially out of funds on balance, and to this extent it might be said that Newfoundland would, at the outset at any rate, bea liability rather than an asset; but the Canadian officials were fully prepared Ito agree that, having regard to the benefits, both tangible and intangible,which Canada would receive through the rounding off of the Confederation inthis way, this should not be regarded as a determining factor. They stressedagain, however, that they had no authority to discuss such, a solution with me,even tentatively, and they felt that before continuing the talks it would benecessary for them to obtain Ministerial cover. It was accordingly agreed thatas the next step they should take soundings of the Prime Minister and obtainhis reaction!-!.
11. In the meantime, I had had a very useful private conversation withMr. Scott Macdonald, who as Canadian High Commissioner in Newfoundlandis in a good position to keep his finger on the pulse of Newfoundland opinion.He told me that it was his firm belief that there was now a substantial movementof opinion towards union with Canada, which was gaining rapidly in momentum.He attributed this very largely to the new social security measures, particularlychildren&apos;s allowances, adopted by Canada in 1944. The range and generous scale of the benefits provided under these Acts were now beginning to penetrate New-foundland consciousness, and he himself would not be at all surprised if, once itwas realised by the fishermen and workers of Newfoundland that by joining Canadathey would be assured of these solid cash advantages, a call for union with canada were to sweep the Island. He had reason, moreover, to think that manyof the educated and commercial classes were coming increasingly to look uponunion with Canada as the best hope for the future. It was clear from my talksthat Mr. MacDonald had, in fact, advised his Government in this sense.12. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister was very much preoccupied at thetime, both in dealing with a new Parliament and also in arranging for his visit to the United Kingdom, necessitating in turn the settlement of outstandingmatters before he left. However, a note on Newfoundland was submitted to himby Mr. Norman Robertson and shortly afterwards an opportunity occurred forthe High Commissioner to mention the matter to him personally. The views expressed by Mr. Mackenzie King in conversation with Mr. Malcolm MacDonaldwere clear and decided and may be summarised as follows :  (1) He regarded entry of Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederationas natural, desirable and inevitable. If, therefore, Newfoundlanderswere to express a desire as a result of the forthcoming Convention forunion with Canada, he would very much welcome such a move on their part and would do the handsome thing by them.(2) On the other hand, it would be essential that the initiative should be clearly seen to come from them, and both we and Canada would haveto be very careful to say and do nothing which might look like&quot; bouncing &quot; them, or give rise to suspicions that we were engaged ina conspiracy to achieve this result.(3) He did not think that he himself could very well go further than thestatement he had made some months ago, in which he had indicated that, if they wished to turn to Canada, Canada would meet them half-way. But he would be very ready to make a further statement on similar lines if and when this might be thought helpful. The form and timing of any such statement would require careful consideration.(4) Opinion in Newfoundland moved very slowly, and hs personally doubtedvery much whether it would in fact have sufficiently changed towardsCanada by the time the Convention met to make a move towards union with Canada a likely outcome of its discussions. Even so, however,it was important that Newfoundlanders should take their own timeand not be hurried.(5) At the same time he hoped he might be Wrong, for this would be a grandchance, which might not recur for a long time, of getting- the confederation question settled without it being made an issue in party politics in Newfoundland. Delay, too, might bring other dangers,such as a tendency for the Island to swing into the United States orbit,which would be very embarrassing.13. I reported this very encouraging reaction to the Canadian group of officials, who were obviously much relieved and pleased. They admitted franklythat they had been drifting before with no clear policy, and were delighted thatihey now had a definite objective to aim at. I said that I would report accordingly to my Secretary of State, who was under obligation to make an early statement inParliament. It would, of course, be impossible to make any overt reference toinion with Canada in any such statement, but the Secretaiy of State would noioubt wish to consider how to deal in the statement with Newfoundland&apos;s recon-;truction needs in such a way as not to impede the swing of opinion towards-anada. In this connection the Canadian officials expressed the view that itfould be very desirable to make it clear in the statement that Newfoundland
sihould not count on receiving further financial assistance from the UnitedKingdom. This would accord with the realities of the position and would, they thought, assist Newfoundlanders to turn their thoughts to Canada.14. It was left finally that each side would consider the position now reached,and that when our statement had been made in Parliament it might be useful toexamine between- us possible ways of influencing Newfoundland opinion behind the scenes. I said that the Secretary of State would no doubt wish to have a wordhimself with Mr. Mackenzie King on the matter while he was in London, andMr. Norman Robertson said that he also would be at our disposal in London for afurther talk whenever we should think one useful.P.
