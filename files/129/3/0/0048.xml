SECRETCP. (45)24025TH OCT03ER,  194.5*CABINETDOCKS strike memorandum by Minister of War transport the strike of dockworkers which began at Birhenhead on25th September and has Gradually spread since then, nowaffects most of the major ports and there is little signat the moment of any general resumption of work,Srj &apos; agreement with the Minister of Labour and NationalService^  and the Secretary of State for War, military labour is being employedi so far as the troops are available^ on-certain types of vessels and commodities, namelyVessels containing foodstuffsPersonnel shipsSea Transport vessels (full cargoes of military stores).Liner loadings which include military cargopartly discharged vessels  (17 in number)The number of troops available for this purpose untilyesterday was 10,500,half of whom are skilled in stevedoringwork.      Steps have already been taken to increase the numberof troops available to a total of approximately 20,000, andthis will represent the maximum number we arc likely to beable to employ in view of the extent to which dilution of the skilled troops can be usefully effected.The importation of essential commodities through the ports has,  of course, been seriously dislocated althoughimportant foodstuffs are now being dealt with expoditiously.Exports,however,  are creating much anxiety.      Tho Presidentof the Board of Trade has drawn my attention to the fact thatthe volume of traffic is catastrophically Below recent experience and that even without this confirming evidence,it is clear that there is a serious hold-up which must continueunless steps are taken urgently to clear the exports and alsoto unload the imports of finished goods and raw materials in whichthe Board of Trade are vitally interested.      The presidentpoints out that we cannot sustain interest in exports if itis known that they cannot be shipped, and that in any case,where production is proceeding,  factory floors Will becongested with goods which cannot be cleared.In consequence of; the strike, we are already faced witha shortage of sterling shipping tonnage for fulfilling theimmediate import programmes of essential food and rawmaterials and  this position will be aggravated in November,If the present situation continues it seems inevitable thatdollar tonnage will have to be used to make up the deficiency in sterling tonnage.COPY NQ
