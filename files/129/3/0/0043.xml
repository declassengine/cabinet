Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.13SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 243.22nd October, 1945.CABINET.VICTORY CELEBRATIONS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.THE Prime Minister has been asked Questions in the House (Official Report,the 9th October, col. 23, and the 11th October, cols. 395-6), and enquiries arebeing received in Government Departments, as to the Governments intentionsfor official Victory Celebrations.2. The organisation of celebrations in the capital and elsewhere will necessarily take some considerable time to complete, and I think it desirable toraise the matter now so that my colleagues can consider the procedure which weshould adopt.3. The end of the 1914-18 war was marked by Peace Celebrationsthroughout the country on Saturday, the 19th July, 1919, the Treaty ofVersailles having been signed on the 28th of the previous month. The arrange-ments were in the hands of a Committee of the War Cabinet consisting ofLord Curzon (Lord President of the Council and Foreign Secretary, in the Chair),the Home Secretary and the First Commissioner of Works, and representativesof the Admiralty, War Office, and Colonial Office. This Committee, which wasappointed on the 19th February, 1919, nominated two Sub-Committees, with a naval and a Military chairman respectively, to work out plans for a Navaldisplay on the River Thames and a Military procession.4. Eventually, the celebrations recommendedi by the main Committee, and approved by the War Cabinet, consisted, as regards London, of a Victory Marchin the morning, entertainments for children in the public parks in the afternoon,and a concert and a firework display in Hyde Park in the evening. outside london the organisation of celebrations was left to local initiative.5. I suggest that a small Committee of Ministers should be appointed nowto consider the matter generally. It will, no doubt, be found convenient for themto appoint one or more Committees of officials to prepare plans for their consideration.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,22nd October, 1945.[30743]
