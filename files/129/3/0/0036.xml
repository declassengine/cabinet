Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.   72CP. (45) 236.20^ October, 1945.CABINET.GOVERNMENT CONTROLS AND FOOD policy memorandum by the Minister of Food.THE Lord Presidents Committee considered on the 12th October, 1945, amemorandum which I had circulated on Government Controls and Food Policy(L.P. (45) 196). The Committee approved in principle the proposals which then put forward, including the terms of a draft announcement to be made inParliament (annexed to this memorandum) which they invited me to submit to the Cabinet.Immediate steps will be taken by the Ministry of Food to work out plans,in consultation with the Departments concerned, and when necessary with thefood trade interests, in respect of the procurement, distribution and sale of all those foods which play an important part in the nation&apos;s diet.In this connection the Lord Presidents Committee drew attention to theneed for Government policy in respect of bulk purchase and other forms ofcontrol of food to be consistent with similar aspects of policy regardingcommodities other than food. The President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Supply and of Aircraft Production are accordingly arranging fora report on this issue to be made to the Committee after the necessary inter-departmental consultation.The Lord Presidents Committee were in general agreement that theMinistry of Food should continue as a separate and permanent Department,but I have not included a reference to this matter in the draft announcementas I do not feel that any advantage would be gained by making it public atthis stage.The Cabinet is asked, to agree (1) that an announcement should be made at an early date in the terms ofthe draft given in the appendix;(2) that the Ministry of Food should continue as a separate and permanentDepartment.B. S.Ministry of Food, W. 1,20^ October, 1945.APPENDIX.Draft Announcement.(The following statement might be made by the Minister of Food in reply to anarranged Question, asking whether &quot; he is in a position to make a statement as to the Governments long-term food policy and the extent to which thecontrol of the food trades will be necessary after shortages have dis-appeared.&quot;)During the war the Government exercised control over the procurement,distribution and price of most foods.   This was necessary to ensure that thesupplies available were equitably shared by the whole community, and used tomaintain the health and vigour of the people to the best advantage.[30727]
So long as food shortages continue, the war-time system of food control and rationing must, in the main, be continued.The Governments long-term food policy, as was indicated in His Majesty&apos;sspeech at the opening of the Session, contemplates more positive measures thanthe mere elimination of shortages -necessary as that is. The Government acceptthe responsibility for ensuring that adequate supplies of food necessary to healthare available to all members of the public at reasonable prices, and, in accordancewith the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Food and Agri-culture held at Hot Springs in 1943, the responsibility for raising the standard of nutrition of the people.While it will be the Governments objective to remove as rapidly as possibleall controls which, with the passing of shortages of supply, labour and materials,operate merely as restrictions on consumers, traders and producers without con-tributing to a positive long-term food policy, they will retain and adapt thosecontrols which are necessary to the carrying out of such a policy.In regard to all those foods which play an important part in the nation&apos;sdiet, the Government will undertake such responsibility in respect of procurement,distribution and sale as is necessary to ensure that adequate supplies are avail-able at reasonable prices, and to implement such international agreements onconrmercial and commodity policy as may be concluded. The interest of the con-sumer will be protected; the needs of special classes will be provided for : theposition of the home farmer in producing the goods required by the nation willbe safeguarded : the trader who renders the community a necessary service will receive a fair reward.It would be wrong to assume that there will be an automatic return to all theconditions which existed before the war. Subject to the general principles already indicated, the methods necessary for achieving the Governments long-term foodpolicy will be considered in relation to each food-stuff separately and detailed plans will be worked out.   Consultation with non-official interests will take place.A fuller statement on the Governments long-term food policy will be madein due course.
