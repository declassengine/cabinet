L copy NO,:   IV /O.P.(45)25015th Ootober,... 19450 A B I N g Tlaj3g1ir SHORTAGES&apos; bi B(TLLI)Ii-tg ?lVJjgRIAL ANDcpiSffTjaNTa1^ bidustoibs&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour and National service.     I fully recognise the urgent need for expanding the labour force in thebuilding material and component industries to which the Minister of health and Under Secretary of State for Scotland refer in their joint memorandum cp, (45)225, and-I believe that the stops which arc already being taken will show a considerable improvement in the position in a few weeks&apos; time,    Ianticipate that considerable numbers of men now being released in Glass A willbe ready to return to their previous employment.   Also the numbers released in Class B will rapidly increase as men are brought homo.    The Gloss B schemestarted in mid-July.    The number of applications received in the buildingmatoriel and component industries up to the end of August was 6,820 and upto the end of September 9,490,    Those applications were sent on, without delay to the Service Departments for action.    It must bo realised, however, that ahigh proportion of men in Class B are overseas and that it may take up toten weeks to arrange for the return of a man from Burma.   Wo can, therefore,expect a much larger number to become available from now onwards.2.     I feel confident that with the speed up of demobilisation and thoincreased rate of release from munitions we shall be able to re-build anadequate labour force in those industries, provided the working conditions areattractive.    It is for tho Production Department to discuss with each industry the problem of recruitment and to arrange for an examination of ways and meansof making the industry more attractive.   The alternative is, of course, a&apos; ruthless policy of conscription of labour with the penalty of fines and-1-this DocmjBHT is ctb property op his mimnun mJm;policy:* s Goyagjrayr

imprisonment for failure to obey directions.    Such a policy is in my view unthinkable-.    It would not be supported by industry or by the public,or, I beliovo, by Parliament.    I havo already submitted to thoLord President&apos;a Committee my general proposals for the relaxation oflabour controls in the light of discussions which I have had with both sideof industry and I must ask that any proposal for the extended \i.se of compulsory powers for a particular industry should be examined as port ofthe general question of policy.5.     On the particular reooimiGndations in paragraph 8 of the joint memorandum CP. (45)225, I have tho following comments.--(a) the total number of men to be called up for the Forces inthe second half of 1945 is 100,000.   Wo have already arranged that for the- time being no man will bo called up from ironfoundries.    If, however, wo are to fulfil our programme wecannot extend this protection to all the industries mentionedwithout a  reduction  in tho total number to bo called up.This is a matter which can bo examined by tlx- Man-Power Committee.No decision has yet been taken with regard to the numbers to becalled up in tho first half of 1940.(b) it would cause grave discontent if we woro to transfer menoompulsorily from tho Forces to thoir old employment withoutGlass B benefits.    Wo shall bo ready to consider thopossibility of increasing the Class B releases for these industries beyond the 10,000 now allotted.    This proposal can best be examined by the Inter-Departmental Services Committee.(c) For tho reasons I have already given I must ask that thisproposal for- the extended use of directions should be considered as port of the general policy with regard to the fixture oflabour controls which is now before the Lord President1sCommittee.    I would, however, point out - (0)(i) A proposalto direct ox-operatives back to the industry would have to bebased on a registration scheme if it is to be fair between individuals.    I doubt if workers would respond to a call to register now that tho war is over.

(c)(ii) I do not think public opinion would now stand forthe arbitrary withdrawn! of individuals to go to low-paid and unpleasant work.   Nor Would employers who were to loselabour bo willing to co-operate, as they were when thewithdrawal of labour was necessary for war operations.(0)(lii) Any proposal to direct men over the ago of 30affects a number of industries and must ho considered inconnection with my general proposals.(d) This is primarily for the Production Department, but if menwere directed to employment in these industries it couldonly be to firms who were wholly engaged on essentialproduction.(e) The improvement of conditions is of first importance and Ishall be ready to give every possible assistance to theProduction Department.    The Chief Inspector of Factorieshas already set up a Technical Committee, with both sides of the industry^ to consider improvements in conditions infoundries.G.A.
