Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECEET. Copy No.CP. (45) 202.Uh October, 1945.CABINET.COUNCIL OF FOREIGN MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues the attached record by His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Moscow of a conversation I held with M. Molotov on the1st October on the subject of the deadlock reached in the Council of foreign ministers. In this conversation M. Molotov went further than on any otheroccasion in revealing what lay behind the procedural point which he had raised:E. B.Foreign Office, 4th October. 1945.Record of a Conversation at the Soviet Embassy on 1st October.The Secretary of State called upon M. Molotov this afternoon. The soviet ambassador and I were present.   M. Pavlov interpreted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE began by saying that he wanted to windup the Conference decently and to put things on a more stable basis and withbetter understanding. He particularly wanted to assure M. Molotov that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were building their policy upon the principles of theTehran, Crimea and Berlin Conferences. He had been a party to them all asa member of the Coalition Government. He had taken part in all the talks atthis end on the various telegrams that had been sent to London. He had supported Mr. Churchill in all the decisions that had been taken. There wasone thing about which he wished to clear M. Molotov&apos;s mind. He had hadno ulterior motive of any kind when drafting the resolution of the11th September. If there remained in M. Molotov&apos;s mind any suspicions onthis account they should be dismissed. He had done what he had done in the belief that it was in accordance with the wishes of all those present. If therehad been any objections he would have had nothing more to say.France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE went on to say that he did not want anyone country to be played off against another and that his chief difficulty had arisenabout France. If we were to change the position we had taken France wouldbe put in a difficult situation. On the other hand, he thought that it might bepossible to find a way not to do this. Could not France be admitted as a fullvoting member of the Council after M. Molotov had consulted his Government ?Roumania and Bulgaria.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then turned to Roumania and bulgaria and reminded M. Molotov that he had spoken to him twice about these countries and that he had felt that the chief difficult was about them. With this in his mind he had made a quick suggestion when talking to M. Molotov and Mr. Byrneswith a view to escaping from the difficulty and had suggested an enquiry by acommission or something of that kind. But his real intention had been to12959   [30637] u
suggest the sending of independent people and not to depend upon those on the spot. He recalled that M. Molotov had jibbed at this and that he (the Secretaryof State) had then suggested that the enquiries should be made independently.His purpose had been to ascertain the facts and to see whether the conclusionsupon which the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government had been based were soundor not. If the report which would emerge from such an enquiry proved thatwe had been wrong, the question of the recognition of the two Balkan Govern-ments would be solved. If, on the other hand, the report showed that it was difficult for us to proceed with the recognition of these Governments, there wouldbe no kind of publicity but the matter would be discussed with M. Molotbv in a friendly way and efforts would be made to reach agreement. The Secretary ofState said that in coming to a decision he would fully accept as a basis the claim that M. Molotov had made to the effect that Russia was entitled to friendlyGovernments in the Balkans. But he would assume at the same time that Russiadid not want these Governments to be unfriendly to ourselves. There was anotherpoint. M. Molotov had spoken of elections on the same lines as those that hadbeen held in Finland. But our information showed that the present adminis-trations in the Balkans would see to it that such elections did not take place. Itwas a question of facts. The &quot;British representative whom it was proposed tosend to the Balkans could soon find out the truth without any prejudice.France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then turned to France and said that he wanted M. Molotov to help him solve the problem whether France was to be a party to discussions or to the Council. If M. Molotov agreed to this he would do his best to help in the clearing up of the Balkan situation. He went on tosay that the Government of Austria would be recognised so soon as therecommendations of the Allied Commission were received and that we were about to follow the American lead as regards the recognition of Hungary. He endedby saying that these were his principal difficulties and any other points thatwould arise out of them would be settled automatically.M. MOLOTOV replied that he now wanted to have his say. As regardsprocedure he regarded the whole business as a misunderstanding and, generallyspeaking, of trivial importance. He based his attitude upon his obligation to stand by the Berlin decisions. He thought that all the difficulties about&quot;protocols &quot; might be settled on the basis of Mr. Byrnes&apos;s proposal. If he had understood it aright, Mr. Byrnes had suggested that on the 11th September theBritish, American and Soviet Governments had invited France and China to consult about the peace treaties. He thought, therefore, that the decision of the11th September should not be included in the general protocol. It should beincluded in the protocols affecting what he described as &quot;4, 3, 2.&quot; THESECRETARY OF STATE said that he did not clearly understand, and wouldlike to try to put this in his own way. Was he right when he said that at the headof the treaty with Italy the resolution would read as follows : The Governmentsof the U.S.S.R., United States, France and Great Britain invited China to discusswithout power to vote? And as another instance, when the time came for the balkans, it should be said that the Governments of the U.S.S.R., United Statesand Great Britain had invited France and China, &amp;c. % If this were so, whatwould be the procedure about the general protocol ? Nothing at all ?M. MOLOTOV replied : Nothing at all, and suggested that the present proposal would be much less embarrassing to France than any other solution. Herefollowed some discussion on the embarrassment of France. Then THE SECRE-TARY OF STATE reminded M. Molotov that on the 11th September a resolutionhad been passed. Was it to remain in the general protocol inasmuch as theCouncil had acted upon it ? M. MOLOTOV appeared to agree and then tried toput the problem in what he thought to be a still simpler form: On the11th September four meetings took place, at which the five members of the council were present all the time. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he would think it over.Roumania and Bulgaria.M. MOLOTOV then began on the present position of Bulgaria and roumania and said that it was the main cause of difficulty. If we and the americans were not ready at once to recognise the Governments of these countries theRussians did not want us to hurry. They were quite willing to wait for themoment at which we and the Americans would be ready to recognise.
316France.M. MOLOTOV went on to talk about France and declared that he could do nothing that did not give effect to the decisions of the Berlin Conference; solong as they stood he had no authority to change them. THE SECRETARYOF STATE asked whether M. Molotov would be ready to recommend with him that these decisions should be reconsidered. He did not want France to be thetool of a Western bloc or an Eastern bloc. He wanted her to have full votingpower. This would give great satisfaction in this country and would removemany misunderstandings. He would urge M. Molotov very strongly to co-operate with him in this, for- it was in this that we were mainly interested. Just as theSoviet Union wanted to have good neighbours, Great Britain wanted good neigh-bours too, but did not want such neighbours as might make the Russians feelthat we were doing something wrong. If France, therefore, were admitted as afull member to the Council of Foreign Secretaries all suspicions would be dis-pelled. He could assure M. Molotov that so long as he was in office His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would do nothing consciously to injure Russia, but they would expect the same treatment from the Soviet Union. M. MOLOTOV replied that russia made no claims to any of the rights of Great Britain or to those of any state in which we were interested. Russia interfered in none of our plans. Shewas not intervening in the Greek affair although great pressure to do so hadbeen put upon the Soviet Government, nor indeed in Italy, although here the pressure had been equally strong. As to France, the Soviet attitude was favour-able. He wanted good relations. Russia had recently made a political treaty with France and was in no sense -opposed to the making of a similar treaty between ourselves and the French or between any other democratic State andFrance. It was in no way the fault of Russia if France had got herself intoa mess, if the Government of Petain and Laval had helped Hitler. The SovietGovernment had always supported de Gaulle and had been the first to sign atreaty with him. France was recovering rapidly, but she would take some timeto do so completely. He was convinced that she would, but he thought it wise to wrait to see that happen. It seemed to him that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere getting ahead of the facts. We must be patient and so must France. THEFOREIGN SECRETARY interjected that he was being patient. This provokedfrom M. MOLOTOV a statement to the effect that France had not helped in thebeating of Germany or Italy. Sooner or later she would have to be admitted toequality, but patience was required. THE SECRETARY OF STATE repliedthat if France were let in now it would help to restore her. On thisM. MOLOTOV harped upon the word patience and explained that France hadno army, she must be given time to recover and to get stronger. THE SECRE-TARY OF STATE again urged that M. Molotov should recommend a recon-sideration of the Berlin decision and said that it would be a great thing ifthis were done by all three Governments. M. MOLOTOV said that this wouldbe difficult in view of the Berlin decision, to which the Secretary of State repliedthat it was M. Molotov&apos;s and his job to get out of difficulties. M. MOLOTOVagain suggested that all three Foreign Ministers were bound by the decisionof the Heads of the Governments, but that when he got to Moscow he would report what the Secretary of State had said.Peace Conference.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then asked about Mr. Brynes&apos;s suggestion for a peace conference. This had divided us. Would it not be possible to say something about this, even to the effect that we would call a conference on thebasis of paragraph 4 of the Berlin decision ? He had to think of the Dominions,from whom he had had strong representations, and he thought that, withoutgetting outside the terms of the Berlin decision, a conference could be called in accordance with paragraph 4. M. MOLOTOV said that we must not hurry.The question was a new one. It had not been discussed by the three Govern-ments. When he got back to Moscow he would report it and &quot; take his bearings,&apos;&apos;&quot;and he thought it would be possible to reach agreement in one or two months.That should not be difficult. The proposal had been sprung upon himsuddenly by Mr. Byrnes and had caught him unprepared. THE SECRETARYOF STATE again urged that something should be said to show that the council would call a conference when the treaties were ready, to Avhich M. MOLOTOVsaid that he would speed the matter up when he got back to Moscow, whencehe and the Secretary of State could conduct a correspondence. It ought notto take more than a month and a half. THE SECRETARY OF STATE[30637] b 2
suggested that some reference should be put in the Protocol to our intention tocall the conference. To this M. MOLOTOV asked in reply what sort of aconference we could hold until His Majesty&apos;s Government and the AmericanGovernment recognised Bulgaria and Roumania? It was much better to wait.Nothing would happen in the meantime,Balkans.THE SECRETARY OF STATE then asked about the enquiry to be made about the situation in the Balkans. How would it best be done ? M. MOLOTOVsaid that this was entirely our affair. We were free to do it in the way it seemed best to us. Here followed some banter about who would be best man tosend.The Dodecanese and Tripolitania.THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he had a final point. What aboutthe Dodecanese? Would M. Molotov agree to their being ceded to Greece ?M. MOLOTOV replied that this question was both simple and complex. If we agreed to Russia&apos;s getting a corner in Tripolitania and if we were givenCyrenaica, the question of the Italian colonies could be settled very quickly.Why did we need Tripolitania, which did not belong to us? To this THESECRETARY OF STATE asked in reply what the Russians wanted it for.M. MOLOTOV said that Russia had no place in the Mediterranean for hermerchant ships and from which to expand her trade. After all, a Russiantrusteeship for ten years would do no harm. THE SECRETARY OF state said &quot;I wonder. &apos; I do not think so? &quot; M. MOLOTOV asked who WantedTripolitania. Could not the Russians get it ? It w^ould be for a very short time,only ten years. THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that half the time,five years, would be taken up in the building of a dock. To this M. MOLOTOVsaid that he did not want a dock, he only wanted a harbour. THE SECRETARYOF STATE suggested that it were better made an international region. Tothis M. MOLOTOV said &quot; So you don&apos;t want to give us even a corner in theMediterranean &apos;&apos; and he went on to repeat the remarks that he had made the otherday about the disappearance of Italy and France. We were trying to create a monopoly in the Mediterannean. THE SECRETARY OF STATE replied thatit was not a question of power politics. It would cause a great upset in thiscountry if any new military Power were to get across the lifeline of the BritishEmpire. He wras being quite honest about it. In his position M. Molotov would feel the same. M. MOLOTOV said that it was clear that the Secretary of Statedid not want to come to terms with anybody about anything. He was claimingeverything, even Somaliland. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said he was notclaiming Somaliland, and reminded M. Molotov of Mr. Byrnes&apos;s plan for an inter-national trusteeship for Tripolitania, saying that he would welcome the samearrangement in Somaliland. M. MOLOTOV asked whether it was not possiblefor the Foreign Secretary to meet him in something. THE SECRETARY OFSTATE replied that M. Molotov had met us in nothing. We did not want aninch of territory. M. MOLOTOV then said that Mr. Churchill had agreed toKonigsberg going to Russia and that the new Government did not want to givethe Russians anything. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY replied that he had understood from Mr. Churchill that Konigsberg was the only thing that theRussians wanted.German Fleet.At this point M. MOLOTOV switched over to the question of the german fleet and referred to a memorandum he had sent to the Secretary of State to-day he asserted that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not carrying out their obliga-tions. THE SECRETARY OF STATE protested and said that convertedtrawlers could in no circumstances be called warships. Their duty was to go back to fishing. During the submarine campaign we had turned every trawlerwe possessed into a warship and now they had become trawlers again.M. MOLOTOV said that the Berlin decision contained no such conclusion. THESECRETARY OF STATE said that he did not agree, and M. MOLOTOV saidneither did he. What was being done was a breach of an obligation. Russiamet such breaches at every step. Was it possible to have good relations on this basis? THE SECRETARY OF STATE replied that this was all very well,but one nation seemed to want to make itself the sole judge.   In reply
M. MOLOTOV said that his country wished to be treated on an equal footingand did not like to see us ignoring agreements. THE SECRETARY OF STATEexpressed surprise and said^-that when he had read M. Molotov&apos;s memorandumhe had felt sure that there was a misunderstanding.Procedure.In conclusion THE SECRETARY OF STATE asked if in the event of anagreement on the question about the headings of the &apos;&apos; Protocol&apos;&apos; it would mean that the matter could be finished? M. MOLOTOV replied, &quot;Yes, if we makea change about the resolution of the 11th September.&quot; THE SECRETARY OFSTATE said : &quot; Do you mean a change in form?&quot; To this M. MOLOTOV said :&quot;That is the only way.&quot; On leaving M. Molotov, THE SECRETARY OFSTATE said that he regretted that so little progress had been made.M. MOLOTOV made some incomprehensible noise in reply.A. CLARK KERR.1st October, 1945.
