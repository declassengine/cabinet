Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 219.8th October, 1945.CABINET.RETURN TO GERMANY OF &quot;WHITE&quot; PRISONERS OF WAR from united KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I ask my colleagues to approve the following proposals : A. Authority should be given for the early repatriation to Germany of&quot; white &quot; German prisoners of war to the extent to which they are called forward by the British Element of the Control Commisson for Germany.B. If the Minister of Labour so desires and the War Office can make thenecessary arrangements, an equivalent number of unclassified German prisonersnow held in the British zone of Germany (or elsewhere under British control)should be sent to the United Kingdom to replace the labour hitherto supplied by&apos;&apos; white &apos;&apos; German prisoners.C. The first &quot;white &quot; prisoners to be returned should be those domiciledin the British zone and the British sector of Berlin. But the British Commander-in-Chief in Germany should be instructed at once to inform his three colleaguesoh the Control Council (or, if he thinks it preferable, his United States andFrench colleagues only) of the existence of &quot;white&quot; prisoners in this countryand of the project to repatriate them to Germany, and to invite them to call for-ward to their zones or sectors &quot; white &quot; prisoners domiciled in them but now inthis country.D. &quot;White&quot; prisoners thus returning to other zones should likewise bereplaced by unclassified prisoners sent from the British zone.E. Demands for the return of &quot; white &quot; German prisoners from the british element of the Control Commission should also be met by drawing simultaneously,so far as transport facilities permit, on the pool of &quot; white &quot; German prisonersnow available in the Middle East.F. Parallel arrangements, mutatis mutandis, should be made for &quot; white &quot;Austrian prisoners to return to the various zones of Austria and sectors of vienna. These should, however, be replaced in this country not by other Austriansbut by further German prisoners of war.A rgument.2. These &quot;white &quot; German prisoners are those who have been segregatedfrom the mass of German prisoners in this country and the Middle East andconcentrated where possible in special camps. They have been segregated on thebasis of their political opinions, and consist of non-Nazis and anti-Nazis. Theyhave been subjected to a process of re-education. This work, which has involvedconsiderable expenditure of man-power and resources, is being carried out, by arrangement with the War Office, by the Political Intelligence Department of theForeign Office.3. At the 30th September there were available in the United Kingdom18,972 &quot; white &quot; German prisoners and 2,802 &quot; white &quot; Austrian prisoners. Atthe 31st August there were available in the Middle East 9,847 &quot; white &quot; prisoners.The breakdown of these as between Germans and Austrians is not at present available, but presumably the proportions are much as in the United Kingdom.All &quot; white &quot; prisoners have been classified by trades and professions.12973   [30685]
4. On the 18th May, 1945, the last Cabinet decided that &quot;As many aspossible of the Cerman prisoners now in this country should be put to work.&quot;This was held to mean that no &apos;&apos; whites &apos;&apos; could be repatriated to Germany.5. The British Element of the Control Commission in Germany have long been anxious to arrange for the repatriation of certain special categories of&quot;&quot;white&quot; prisoners, in order that they may take part in the general work ofrehabilitation in the British zone and the British sector of Berlin, and in par-ticular help to ease labour shortages in certain special occupations, e.g., as civilservants, teachers, policemen, postal and railway workers. It is understood thatthe British Element of the Control Commission have already put forward demands for &quot; white &quot; prisoners in various occupational categories amounting in all tosome five or six thousand.6. It is recognised that the loss of &quot;white&quot; prisoners from the labour available in this country, gradual though the process is likely to be, will be ofsome importance; but it is understood that the British Element of the control commission are prepared to return an equivalent number of unclassified german prisoners now held in the British zone to replace those repatriated from thiscountry. I believe that a sufficiently large number of German prisoners are still held undischarged in the British zone to replace not only &apos;&apos; white &apos;&apos; prisonerssent from this country to the British zone, but also &quot; white &quot; prisoners sent toany other zone of Germany or any zone of Austria.7. I am convinced that, quite apart from the useful work which these men might do in Germany, it is of great importance to return to Germany as soon aspossible these prisoners of reliable political views who have undergone somere-education in this country. I consider it important that arrangements for repatriation of &quot; white &quot; prisoners should not be confined to those domiciled inthe British zones of Germany or Austria. The effort that has been put into thesegregation and re-education of these prisoners, dating back as it does to a timelong before the zones of occupation were settled, has not distinguished betweenprisoners from different parts of Germany. If only those domiciled in the two british zones can be returned, then only something between a quarter and a thirdof the total of &apos;&apos; white &apos;&apos; prisoners will be able to go back; and between two-thirdsand three-quarters of the whole effort put into this project will have been wasted.It may be thought undesirable to return British-educated prisoners to the Russianzone at the present time, but I see every advantage in such prisoners being returned at least to the American and French zones.E. B.Foreign Office, 8th October, 1945.
