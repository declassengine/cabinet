Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 239.20th October, 1945.CABINET.THE COAL POSITION IN THE COMING WINTER.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.I recently laid before the Lord Presidents Committee an appreciation of theprobable coal position over the coming winter (L.P. (45) 184). In brief itindicated that, making no allowance for any increased output which may result from my public appeal for an additional 8 million tons of production, I shall be faced, over the six months November-April (inclusive), with a deficit of 8 million tons on a total requirement of 103 - 5 million tons. This estimate assumes no delay in releases from the Services and as rapid progress as possible with technicalreorganisation. On the requirements side, it is based, on the one hand, on thebest estimates that can be made of the course of consumption during the winter,and, on the other hand, on a decision to reduce progressively the distributed stocksof coal to lower levels than have been contemplated before.2. I have every hope that the efforts I am making to secure increased produc-tion, with the fullest co-operation of all the interests concerned, will be successful;but I think the Cabinet should be aware of the outlook.3.   The most acute difficulties will be : (a) the shortage of house coal, disposals of which will be at least 5 per cent.(something over 1 million tons) less than last winter, or 3^ million tons less over the coal year as a whole compared with the last coalyear;(b) the railway-s will be operating throughout at a working stock below thatregarded by the Railway Executive  Committee  as a reasonable, minimum; and(c) there will be constant risk of interruptions in gas supply through the low level of the stocks at gasworks.Towards the end of the winter we shall also be risking occasional interruptionsof work in individual industrial units, as their stocks fall to marginal levels.4. Overshadowing all the supply difficulties is the risk of a shortage oftransport: If there is not transport available to move the coal produced, mydeficit will be greater than 8 million tons. There would be serious effects on production if the extra output for which I have called were forthcoming and couldnot be moved.5. I laid my conclusions before the Lord Presidents Committee in thefollowing terms : &quot; This winter, even if I am successful in obtaining the increased output for which I have appealed, will be difficult; if the additional coal is not forthcoming, it will be much the most difficult the country has yet had to face.&quot;In the meantime, I need the assistance of my colleagues in the following matters : 1&apos;&apos; (i) the utmost speed in the release of miners in Class B;&quot; (ii) the release of civil engineering plant for opencast productionand the supply of the necessary labour from within the building and civil engineering pool;&quot; (iii) securing  labour  for  the mining  machinery  and  equipmentindustries;[30735]
&quot; (iv) the provision of the transport required to move all the coal pro-duced; including the provision of any labour required by therailways to ensure this. Coal transport should have operationalpriority this ivinter;&quot; (v) the provision of the labour and transport required to effectadequate retail distribution of coal; including any necessaryassistance from the Services, especially in London.&quot; Consumers of every kind of fuel will have to exercise the most rigideconomy, which must be inculcated by every means in our power, and therecan be no question of any increase in coal exports to liberated Europe; weshall, indeed, almost certainly have to reduce the tonnage of low-grade fuelalready being exported.&quot;6. Following the discussions of the Lord President^ Committee a meetingof Ministers was convened under the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examineparticularly the labour and transport aspects of the problem, and it was agreedto set up a powerful official Committee with the Controller of the Coal Division,Ministry of Fuel and Power, in the Chair, to follow up the matters on which we decided that action required to be taken. I attach as an Appendix a note of theaction which has been, or is being taken, as a result of the Chancellor&apos;s meeting.E. S.  &apos;Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,20th October, 1945.APPENDIX.Coal Position in the Coming Winter : Action being Taken.A. Labour.1.   Release from the Services.(a) Miners. Position being closely watched by official Committee, to ensurethat there is no avoidable delay. Minister of Fuel and Power to appealpublicly to all ex-miners to return to the mines immediately on release.2.   Use of Service and P.O.W. Labour.(a) For wagon repairs.   Ministry of Labour to discuss again with N.U.R.withdrawal of Union opposition to use of Services and P.O.W. labour.(b) For coal distribution.   Ministries of Fuel and Power and Labour and service Departments concerting plan to ensure that necessary Servicelabour is available.(c) For briquette production.  War Office considering whether they have anylabour suitable for this unpleasant work.B. Railway Wagon Supply.1.   Repairs.(a) Ministry of Supply arranging for wagon repairs to be carried out atR.O.F&apos;s.(&amp;) Ministry of Fuel and Power arranging that collieries should offer torailways any wagon repair facilities at collieries not already fully employed.(c) Repair position generally being investigated by Messrs. Brooks andBulleid (officers specially appointed for this purpose by Ministry ofWar Transport).2.   New Construction.(a) Ministry of Supply examining position of Indian and U.N.R.R.A. wagoncontracts to see how far cancellation can be recommended.(b) Ministry of Supply investigating available wagon construction capacity.Preliminary forecast that up to end of 1946 outstanding home orderscan be overtaken and 10,000 additional wagons built subject to can-cancellation of the Indian Contract.
3121C. Road Transport.Ministry of War Transport report that there is adequate civil transport for coal distribution, and that there is a substantial margin which can be used to relieve rail of traffics suitable for road carriage. War Office examining extentto which, by use of additional military transport, Service use of civil transportcan be reduced, but War Office reserves of suitable vehicles and drivers not large.D. Saturday Unloading.Ministry of Fuel and Power have appealed to coal consumers for maximumeffort.E. Rail Movement Priority.R.E.C. have stated that there is no serious difficulty on the operational side in moving the coal, and essential obstacle to full coal movement is shortage of wagons. Pending increase of wagon fleet by repairs, everything depends on extentto which other rail transport can be reduced to release wagons.F.-Other Rail Traffic.Chancellor has requested Service and other Government Departments toreduce rail traffic to a minimum.   All Departments examining.Ministry of War Transport has instructed railways to make no further increase in passenger services.G. Use of Canals for Coal Traffic.Position being investigated, but little or no room for expansion.H. Railway Coal Stocks.Stock level being closely watched by Ministry of Fuel and Power; it is admittedly dangerously low, but there is little hope of increasing it without anincrease in coal output.
