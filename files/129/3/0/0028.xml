Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 228.13*A October. 1945.CABINET.THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.AT their meeting on the 18th September (CM. (45) 33rd ConclusionsrMinute 4) the Cabinet asked me for a report on the employment situation.2. The general position is still one of shortage of man-power, which mustbe expected to continue. Although it is expected that by the end of the yearnearly 3f million men and women will have been released from the Services andfrom employment on munitions and other war stores, the civilian industries and manufacture for export require more than 4J million additional workers to bring them up even to the levels of mid-1939. And it must be remembered that asubstantial proportion of those released from the Services and war work especially married women will leave industry altogether and that others willnot take up employment at once. The number employed in civilian industries and manufacture for export at the end of the year will probably be at least2\ million below the corresponding figure for mid-1939.3. The general shortage of man-power is reflected in the unemployment figures, which continue very low by pre-war standards. Although the numbers employed on Supply Department work have been reduced by over a million sincethe 1st January, yet the increase in the number unemployed is only some 85,000.On the 17th September, 1945, the insured wholly unemployed in Great Britainincluded 91,881 men, 66,056 women and 14,104 boys and girls under 18 yearsof age, making a total of 172,041. This represents only 1\ per cent, of the totalnumber of persons insured against unemployment in July, 1945, and compares with some 880,000 insured persons wholly unemployed on the 14th August, 1939,representing some 5-7 per cent, of the insured population.4. There is, however, an increasing tendency for local pockets of unemploy-ment to develop. The total number of wholly unemployed insured workers hasincreased by 94,455 from a figure of 77,586 at the 16th April, 1945, the last countbefore VE-day. The increase has been particularly marked in the followingRegions :  Number ofinsured personswholly unem-ployed atPercentage ofinsuredpopulation.17fch September,Increase since1945.16th April, 1945.WalesScotlandNorthernNorth Western38,41133,94224,77423,7135-72-33-111+ 26,303-f 14,9534-15,4324-13,635[30701]

The figures exclude persons temporarily suspended from work and unemployedcasual workers.Some of the percentages of unemployment may be somewhat higher than the truefigures because the unemployed workers include some (registered as unemployed in their home areas) who have been travelling considerable distances to work at,for example, Royal Ordnance Factories, who are counted as insured not in their home Local Office Area, but in the area in which they worked. They do, however,indicate that in some places unemployment is now reaching significant proportions.5. These local increases in unemployment are primarily due to the cessation of war contracts, sometimes involving the closing down of war factories, in areas where one or more of the following factors are present (1) There is a shortage of industrial capacity in relation to the labour available.(2) There are difficulties in converting factories quickly from war work to civilian production.(3) There are difficulties, e.g., shortage of raw material, in restarting civilianindustries which have contracted during the war.(4) Many unemployed workers are not suitable for such work  as the demolition of air-raid shelters and road work, the stimulation ofwhich is dealt with in para. 8 (2) below.6. There are very large demands for workers in a number of industries,including, for example, coalmining, agriculture, all forms of transport, laundries,food industries, cotton and wool textiles, clothing, boots and shoes and theproduction of housing fitments, as well as in the building and civil engineering industries; it might appear at first sight that the unemployed workers ought tobe readily absorbed into these industries. The problem is, however, to fit each individual unemployed worker into a job for which he is acceptable and whichhe is prepared to take. Some workers are either actually unsuitable, or are regarded by the employers as unsuitable, for the jobs in expanding industries which exist in their home areas, and they are either unable or unwilling to move to take up jobs for which they would be accepted in other parts of the country.Others are unwilling to accept the vacancies available on the wages and conditionsoffered.   For example : (1) Many of the unemployed men in mid-Scotland, the Northern Region, WestCumberland and in the South Wales coalmining areas could not standup to the comparatively arduous conditions of, for instance, coalmines,iron foundries and many jobs in the building industry. (Some of thesemen, of course, have been disabled in the course of employment in the coalmining industry.)(2) Many unemployed persons in Lancashire are unsuitable for employmentin the cotton industry. Some of those who are not unsuitable are showing a disinclination to enter or return to the industry.(3) Iron foundries provide another example of important work which isunpopular, largely because it is dirty and not well paid.
7. Within the limits of its powers my Department is doing everything possible to use the available labour to meet outstanding demands (1) Although it is no longer the practice to use the power of direction, save in exceptional cases, vacancies on important work which cannot be filled locally are being widely circulated so that unemployed workers who cannot be placed in employment in their home area can be put intouch with suitable vacancies in other areas. In appropriate casesarrangements are made for employers&apos; representatives to visit areas where suitable workpeople are available for the purpose of explainingfully to applicants the qualifications required and the conditionsoffered.(2) Financial assistance is available similar to that which operated duringthe war to assist workpeople taking up employment away from their homes for example, free fares and incidental expenses, lodgingallowances and assistance towards removal expenses. The WelfareDepartment of the Ministry continues to help workpeople taking upemployment at a distance to find accommodation and to settle down inthe new area.(3) Lack of accommodation, including lodging accommodation is a seriouslimiting factor in organising transfers to many areas, e.g., London.In agreement with my colleagues, I am making arrangements for theNational Service Hostels Corporation to continue in operation with aview to providing hostel accommodation to supplement existing lodgingresources. The use of machinery set up during the war by LocalAuthorities for securing lodgings or billets will still be required, andthe Ministry of Health have been asked to see that this is maintainedas necessary.(4) The difficulties in regard to wages and other conditions which hinder-adult recruitment to industries like cotton and the iron foundries, arebeing tackled by the two&apos; sides of the industries concerned and bytechnical Committees appointed by the Chief Inspector of Factories.(5) Vocational Training. As my colleagues are aware, the fullestpracticable training programme is being developed at the greatest possible speed.(6) So far as the unemployed consist of disabled persons, the steps which arebeing taken to bring the provisions of the Disabled Persons (Employ-ment) Act, 1944, into effective operation will be of increasing-assistance. Registration of disabled persons under the Act has already started, and the obligation on employers to engage a proportion ofdisabled persons (the &apos;&apos;. Quota &apos;&apos; Scheme) will be introduced as soon asthe need for it arises Moreover, the Disabled Persons EmploymentCorporation is pressing forward, with its plans for the establishment ofspecial. workshops to provide employment for severely disabled persons where there is a need8. There are a number of steps required to ensure that full use is made ofthe nation&apos;s man-power which are the responsibility of other Departments (1) In the Development Areas and some other areas which suffered fromexceptionally severe unemployment before the war there is a needfor the establishment of new enterprises, including in many cases thebuilding of new factories. The recent progress report by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (L.P. (45) 170) indicates that a good deal hasbeen clone, but suggests that in most areas there is a good deal still to be done in this way. This is particularly the case in Scotland.Many of the approved schemes will not begin to provide employment for some time yet. If we are to minimise transitional unemployment the schemes must be given high priority and any bottle-necks mustbe identified and dealt with.(2) My Regional Controllers have been instructed to bring at once to thenotice of their Regional colleagues any serious pockets of unemploy-ment with a view to seeing what steps can be taken to get more workgoing in the area, for example, by arranging for more raw materials to be allocated to firms in the area, possibly even at the expense of firms in other areas where labour is not so readily available. So faras Regional efforts do not succeed in disposing of a problem, it is brought to the notice of Headquarters. I rely on the assistance ofmy colleagues in dealing with these situations.
I may mention in this connection that arrangements have recentlybeen made with the Home Office under which the opportunity can betaken to employ suitable labour temporarily unemployed on the demolition of air raid shelters and similar work. Discussions are going on with the Ministry of Health about similar arrangements to facilitate new water supply and sewerage works or maintenance andother work under the control of that Department as opportunity offers. An approach has been made to the Ministry of War transport in regard to road works. Similarly the Ministry of Food are considering whether they cannot divert small quantities of sugar andpacking materials from other producers to manufacturers inLanarkshire where labour is available to enable the production ofbiscuits and sweets in this area to be increased. The co-ordinationof all the other factors entering into production with the availability of labour is clearly necessary if we are to make the best use of all our resources.(3) Everything possible must be done to minimise the delays which occur in releasing and converting war factories for civilian production,particularly where this involves the release of a factory to a newoccupier. There is frequently an interval of some months betweenthe cessation of war production and the full-scale absorption of labour by the new firm. Some time lag is inevitable, but I ask my colleagues to see that it is reduced to a minimum. Factories no longer required should be declared surplus without delay; machinery and stores shouldbe cleared as quickly as possible when a customer for the factory hasbeen found, and the new occupier should be assisted in every possible way to get into the factory smoothly and begin production as quickly as possible.G.
