TEMPORARY HOUSING PROGRAMME.Earlier Statements.1. In October 1944 the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act waspassed authorising the Government to spend up to  150,000,000 on theprovision of temporary houses. In the course of the Debates upon the bill the then Minister of Health said that there&apos; was no question of concentrating on one form of construction for temporary houses-, that &quot;the pressed-steelindustry had been selected for the production of: a temporary bungalowas fulfilling the necessary conditions better than any other, and that providedthat the necessary production conditions could be secured further typeswould be&apos;added. The cost of the pressed-steel bungalow was then estimatedat  600.2. On the 7th December, 1944, the then Minister of Works announcedthat actual production of the pressed-steel bungalow could not be proceeded with until the necessary labour and manufacturing capacity were releasedat the end of the war in Europe. On the 23rd February, 1945, he statedthat since much of the necessary factory capacity and labour could not be released from munitions production, and since the Government had decidedto try to start production of temporary houses at once, they had been-obliged to turn almost exclusively to less highly prefabricated types ofhouses : in the interest of town planning and public economy the Govern-ment had decided to switch over, as soon as practicable, to the constructionof permanent dwellings, and until that time they intended to press forward with the manufacture of temporary houses to the fullest possible extent.3. On the 22nd March, 1945, the then Minister of Health said that theaverage cost of the temporary houses was likely to exceed the target figureof  600 originally mentioned in connection with the steel houses; in deciding upon&apos;the types which had been selected the Government had rejected any type, apart from the aluminium house, which seemed likelyto exceed  800 over all, and it was confidently contemplated that the average cost would work out below that. Owing to the cost of fabrication in the factories the cost of the aluminium house might be about  900.4. The White Paper on Housing (Cmd. 6609), published in March 1945,in a section on Temporary Houses, stated that the Government intendedto press forward during the current year with the manufacture of temporary houses to the fullest possible extent, and the rate of production would belimited only by the supply of labour, materials and capacity; the lengthof time for which production would be continued thereafter would dependon the speed attained in the&apos; production of permanent houses, and the primary objective of the Government would be the provision of the maximum number of dwellings, permanent or temporary, in the emergency period. Inany event the production of temporary houses would continug long enoughto meet the allocations which had been made to Local Authorities, namsiy145,000. About 30,000 houses were expected to be sent by the UnitedStates Government on Lend-Lease terms.American Houses.5. Under Lend-Lease arrangements that part of the cost of; the provisionof an . American house falling upon the Exchequer was about  800(including  210 Customs duty).   With the cancellation of the Lend-Lease
arrangements the full cost of the house amounting to about  1,330(including  210 Customs duty) would fall upon the Exchequer, and itwas therefore decided not to take more than 8,000 houses that had alreadybeen shipped or were on the point of being shipped, and to cancel thebalance originally contemplated.Cost oj the remaining types of Temporary Howes.6. When the present Government took office the Minister concernedasked for a statement of the. probable costs of the Temporary housing scheme. The following table shows the revised figures then produced, andthe increases which had occurred since the earlier estimates had been madein January. These costs include site preparation (excluding land, roads and sewers), supply of hulls, erection and provision of components and fittings:  (1) (2)Earlier revised estimate. Estimate.

The average increase in the cost of the various types as shown inthe above Table, excluding the Phoenix House, is  268. Brief particulars of the increases are set. out below :  (A) Site Preparation.  (i) The earlier estimate was based on the cost of a concrete slabfoundation on a level site plus an allowance for extra workon sites on uneven ground.   The sites handed over by LocalAuthorities to date&apos; indicate that the allowance for uneven. sites was insufficient and should be increased by ...       ...       11(ii) The original estimate for drainage, services, paths and fences. . was based  on the  most  economical of  standards.    Forexample, it was assumed that soakaways would take the surface water. Higher standards of drainage, more pathsand fences have been required.The earlier estimate assumed that the houses would be built on the outskirts of large towns in groups of 200. .Actually the average site in the provinces is for 39 houses .and in London 9 and plant cannot be used to the best advantage. Moreover, the clearing of bombed buildings insites in towns have added to the cost.

(iv) It was assumed in the earlier estimate that,, sites being: onthe outskirts of large towns, local labour would unemployed      &apos;and that subsistence-allowances would not be payable or,u if they were,&apos; that they would be-payable by the Ministryof Labour.

This resulted in an increase ofthe prices ;which manufacturers had originally quoted, tentatively      &apos; 96(C) Fixtures and Fittings-:.. The original estimate, was based on the expectation that, large orders, would be placed with the best-equipped manufacturers, but,in the event, it proved necessary, since such firms were stillengaged on war contracts, to place many orders with smaller orless well-equipped firms and to use all available capacity ...       ...      25(D) Breakages and Losses.No separate allowance for breakages and&apos; losses of housecomponents, fixtures and fittings was made in the original estimate but experience shows that it is necessary to allow     ...       15(E) Contingencies.In the light of experience it was considered advisable toincrease the provision for unforeseeable expenditure by  23,making it 5 per cent, over all ...       ... ...       ...       ...      23(F) Ministry of Works Agency Costs.No allowance was made in the earlier estimate for office andother expenses of the Ministry of Works.

The Tables on pages 6 and 7 summarise the progress which hasbeen made with the Temporary Housing Programme up to the end ofSeptember 1945.Future Programme.9. The Health Department had allocated to Local Authorities 165,000temporary houses before the date when the Lend-Lease arrangements came to an end and at a time when the full number of American houses was still expected.10. Provided that Parliament is willing to make the necessary additional provision the Government are prepared to supply houses up to that totalallocation by increasing the number of British houses, and a provisional
programme has been framed up to ashown in. the following Table :  . : . No. inType.ArconUni-Seco .TarranPhoenixSpooner.-Universal .AluminiumU.S.A.

The cost of this programme would exceed the financial provision made in the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act, viz.,  150,000,000,and the (3-overnment propose to bring forward a Bill to extend the amount.* These figures depend upon the outcome of discussions with regard to the numberof American houses to which the Lend-Lease arrangement will apply.
