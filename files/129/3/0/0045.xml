ISDOCUMENT IS THEOF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETG.P.(k5)  2k52UTH OCTOBER,  19U5COPY NO. b^OCABINETCIVIL AVIATION COMMITTEECIVIL AVIATION POLICYReport by the Chairman-A. At their meeting on the 10th October, 19h7    theCabinet had under consideration the question of the participation of private interests in the proposed european and South American Air Transport Corporations.      TheMinister of Civil Aviation, was invited to ascertain theviews of the Civil Aviation Group of the Parliamentary LabourParty and to formulate revised proposals for considerationby the Civil Aviation Committee prior to their submission to the  Cabinet.2. The Civil Aviation Committee has met, and had before it the attached memorandum setting out the views of theCivil Aviation Group (Annex l) as well as a letter fromthe Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party to theMinister of Civil Aviation (Annex II).3. The Minister of Civil Aviation reported to us thathe had discussed with the Group the points which they had raised.      These may be summarised as follows:-(i) In the view of the Group, Civil Air transport should be operated in accordance with ascheme which can in due course be fittedinto a larger air plan for the BritishCommonwealth and ultimately an Internationalservice;    it is desirable that the Governmentshould prepare at the earliest moment amaster plan covering both home and overseasrequirements from this point of view.(ii) In the preparation of those plans it isregarded as of cardinal importance that theyshould provide for fully socialisedownership,  operation, and control.      TheGroup, however, suggest that scope might begiven to private enterprise in the operationof charter services and feeder air lines.h. As regards the first point, the Minister of CivilAviation explained that the desirability of a singleCommonwealth Corporation has &quot;been fully discussed in thepast with Commonwealth Countries, that these conversationshave shown that it is not at present possible to establishsuch a single Corporation and that the arrangements whichhave been made in these circumstances with commonwealth countries for the operation of services on Commonwealthroutes on a close partnership basis are such as tofacilitate the emergence of a single CommonwealthCorporation as and when Commonwealth Governments agree.35 CM.

5. On the international side, the events of the lastyear have shown that the realisation&apos;of internationaloperating units on any substantial scale is even more remote.      Nevertheless, the steps taken by the Minister ofCivil Aviation, and in particular his policy of negotiatingbilateral agreements with foreign countries in a standardform, will dovetail in with a policy for internationaloperating units when the time is ripe.      We suggest thatit would be desirable in dealing with this point inParliament to emphasise the statement which has alreadybeen made in the House of Lords,  that the present policyis in fact designed to assist the ultimate realisation ofthe objectives stressed by the Group.6. As regards the second point,-which calls for a fully socialised state control of air transport, we have noted with some surprise the Group1s suggestion thatcharter services and feeder air lines might be left to private enterprise.      This in fact leaves a greater openingfor private enterprise to exploit profitable fields thanthe plan advocated by this Committee in C.P.(h5)221 underwhich all feeder air lines would be reserved to the Homeand European Corporation which would be fully controlled by the State.      Our plan also provides for the State  -Corporation to undertake charter services^though not te the exclusion of private chartering.7. On the general question of the participation ofprivate interests we recognise that there is strong feeling in the Parliamentary Labour Party for a completely publicservice and that it will be necessary for a powerful case to be made out for the maintenance of some measure ofprivate interest.      We have given careful consideration tothese political considerations, (and we have a good deal of sympathy with them);but we feel that there are cogentpractical arguments on the other side.      In the firstplace,  government control of the proposed Corporations willbe complete.      The Minister will, retain in his hands theright to appoint and dismiss the Boards of Directors:    thedistribution of profits is limited and the interest of theconsumer is fully protected by the establishment of anindependent tribunal to deal with such matters as fares,complaints, etc.      Further,  there will be enablinglegislation which will permit the holdings of private interests in the Corporations to be taken over at:par valueif and when the Government so decides.      We understand thatit is not the intention of the Government to nationaliseBritish shipping, partly because of the international difficulties to which this might give rise.      Air transportoutside the borders of this country (by far the largestelement so far as this country is concerned) is aninternational undertaking to which similar considerations apply.      We are satisfied that surface transport interests,including the short sea shipping lines, can provide valuableservices to the State in the development of air transportwhich could not be obtained in equal measure, and in timeto be effective, by other means,  including the employmentof surface transport experts.      We would stress theimportance of timing in this connection.      The mereemployment of experts from the surface transport interests would not produce the machinery of ticket agencies and allthe other ancillary organisation catering- for the travellerwhich we must have ready for use if we are not to be seriously handicapped in comparison with our competitors.

8, Accepting that for practical reasons privateparticipation is necessary for the time &quot;being, we havegiven further consideration to the amount of thisparticipation.      We are impressed by the view of theMinister of Civil Aviation that  it will not he possible tosecure the whole-hearted co-operation of the surfaceinterests, and the full and unstinted use of all theservices which they are in a position to offer, unless hehas authority to negotiate with them up to the limits ofin the case of the European Corporation and 33&apos;kfo inthe case of the South American Corporation.     We express the hope, however, which the Minister of   Civil Aviationfully shares, that  it may be possible for him to reach agreement with these interests at figures lower thanthese maxima.Prestwick9. We have given further consideration to the futureuse of Prestwick,  in the light of the discussion at theCabinet and we have taken into account the view expressedby the Under Secretary of State for Scotland that theintention of the Cabinet was that the undertaking given bythe Caretaker Government- should be substantially maintained.10.        We were informed by the Minister of Civil Aviationthat he had had a discussion with the Directors of ScottishAviation both at Prestwick and more recently in London aswell as with the Scottish Labour members, with the AllParty Parliamentary Scottish Committee and a deputation from the Scottish Council of Industry and Commerce.      Hehad explained to all of them that he proposed to designatePrestwick as an international airport and he felt that this had cleared up a good deal of misapprehension.11.        In any public announcement to be made he felt it essential to lay it down as a general principle that if british Civil Aviation is to be able to operate efficiently and economically, the selection of airports in thiscountry must be made in the light of operational and traffic considerations.        Such a statement was vital as agoverning consideration as he had already received andwould continue to receive numerous representations frommunicipalities and other local interests for the e*stablish-ment of airports in their areas now that the government intended to assume responsibility for all transport airfields.This &quot;was as follows :-&quot;It is the intention of the Government, for bothtraffic and non-traffic purposes, to designateairports in -england,  Scotland and NorthernIreland and they intend to designate Prestwickas an airport for all such purposes.      Pendingthe completion of Heathrow and its use as a maininternational airport in the United Kingdom, theGovernment will arrange that British land-based aircraft on passage to and from Canada and theU.S.A.  shall stop to pick up and set down at prestwick.      Even when Heathrow is in operation,Prestwick. will continue to be designated, whichwill enable airlines *  any nationality to pickup and set down passengers and freight at prestwick.&quot;

We are agreed that this principle should heenunciated, and that regards Prestwick itself, we recommend the public statement should be on the following lines:--   (a) Prestwick will be designated as an international.  airport..(b) B.O.A.C have planned for certain services tobe operated via Prestwick, the number to be dependant on traffic demands.(c) Scotland will be able to play its full part inCivil Aviation both as regards services andair ports by the opportunities provided for internal services including services betweenScotland and the rest of the O.K.  and directservices between Scotland and the Continent.We are satisfied that a positive statement on theselines will go far to allay the suspicions   which have grown up in Scotland that there is prejudice in officialcircles against Prestwick.12.Following is the summary of our conclusions:-(a)The recommendations of the Civil Aviation Groupfor a single Commonwealth Corporation and for joint international units are a desirablelong term   aim,, but are not capable ofrealisation at present.      The policy which theMinister of Civil Aviation is pursuing bothin the Commonwealth and International fielddesigned to facilitate long termon the lines proposed by theis, however,arrangementsGroup.Co)In our view the Civil Aviation Group haveunderestimated the important contribution whichcan be made, particularly in the near future,by surface transport interests and of- the vital need for rapid progress.      in our view the safeguards proposed by the Minister ofCivil Aviation fully guarantee complete control by the State and we are of opinionthat the Minister - should be authorised tonegotiate with surface interests,  includingshort sea shipping lines, withinh0% for the European and 33^ for american Corporations.the limits the Southof(c) We consider that in the public announcement aboutthe designation of airfields in this country,the general principle should he stated that if british Aviation is to be able to operateefficiently and economically, the selection of airports   must be made in the light of operational and traffic considerations andthat the announcement about Prestwick shouldbe in the terms suggested at  &apos;X&apos; above.(Initialled)    Aon behalf of theCommitteePinions Office, S.W. 1.,2cth October, -T9h5*

ANNEX 1.Memorandum from Group of Labour Members to the Minister of CivilAviation in connection with the Reorganisation of Air Transport.IT is hoped that the undertaking given in the King&apos;s Speech to submit toParliament legislation in connection with the reorganisation of Air transport will mean early action by the Government in this field, which will involve radical changes from the policy of compromise agreed to by the late Coalition Government.2. If this is so, we wish to submit certain points for your consideration inregard to the new policy to be brought forward by the Government.3. In our view it is essential that our Civil Air Transport should be a modelof efficiency and enterprise, and operated in accordance with a scheme whichcan, in due course, be fitted into a larger air plan for the British commonwealth and Empire, and, ultimately, an international service. This proposal is in line with that laid down in the Labour Party&apos;s policy document (endorsed at therecent Blackpool Conference) and also the attitude taken by the Australian andNew Zealand Governments at the Chicago Conference. In order to achieve this, it is desirable that the Government should prepare a master plan at theearliest moment covering both home and overseas requirements, both now andfor the future.4. In preparing this plan we regard it as of cardinal importance that itshould provide for fully socialised ownership, operation and control, as we feelthat any compromise with sectional interests would jeopardise the efficient andvirile development of the Service. In particular, we think that railway and shipping interests ought not to be brought in on the specious argument that atsome future time it is intended to nationalise these undertakings : to do so wouldmean at a later stage having to buy out these same interests at high valuations.Nor should regard be paid to the claim of the shipping and rail interests that experience in other forms of transport is of any major value in the operation ofcivil airlines.5. This does not mean, however, that no place can be found for private interests, as we suggest that scope might be given to them in the operation ofcharter services and feeder airlines, but they must not be allowed to choose themost lucrative routes and then seek monopoly protection and disguised subsidiesby linking up with B.O.A.C., as was proposed by the Coalition GovernmenfsWhite Paper.6. Though the Minister will, of course, be responsible for implementing the Governmenfs policy, we feel that neither he nor the Department, as at present constituted, could undertake the technical and operational tasks which are involved. To deal with these we suggest the appointment of a Board, consistingof experienced and qualified men who are in direct touch with the world ofcommerce and industry and including some who have wide, practical knowledgeof the running of airlines. In the same way as the Minister has delegated tothe Air Registration Board responsibility for ensuring the required technicalstandards of design, construction and maintenance in regard to aircraft, so itis suggested he should delegate the highly specialised task of airline operation to the Air Transport Board.7. The main duty of the Air Transport Board will be to see that civil air transport, undertaken by the various subsidiary organisations which are hereafterreferred to, is performed adequately and efficiently. The Board, by investigation and advice, would see that the organisations achieved and maintained standardslaid down by the Minister, and it would become a kind of Air Council.for civilaviation, or a high command under which would operate the several organisations to which reference has already been made.8. The fullest consideration should be given to the constitution of this proposed Board, which in our view ought to include people with technical know-ledge of the aircraft and ancillary industries, as well as the operation of airlines,[30749]
and possibly with experience in other methods of transport. It should, too, havemembers with contacts with the Dominions and Colonies, and also representativesof the. consumer to watch the over-riding public interest. Lastly, we submit itshould have on it the Chairman of each of the separate organisations responsiblefor the operation of the various airline routes.9. We turn now to the subsidiary organisations, to which reference hasalready been made, who would be responsible for actual airline operation underthe Board. The method proposed is similar to that used in the T.V.A. scheme,where the main development Board delegated sections of the scheme to subsidiary,organisations.10. We would suggest that there should be five of these operating Groups,each with its board of directors, and its chairman, as previously mentioned, wouldbe a member of the Air Transport Board. The division into Groups would bemade in accordance with areas of operation, types of services offered, and types of aircraft used, and not in accordance with the considerations which dictatedthe divisions set out in the Coalition Governments White Paper.11. Apart from these separate organisations operated as subsidiaries underthe Air Transport Board, there should be one centralised training scheme. we propose the formation of a College of Air Transport, run under the auspices ofthe Air Transport Board, rather in a similar way in which the College of Aero-nautics is to be formed as a State organisation. There should be a close link infact between these two training institutions which in time will no doubt cometo be recognised throughout the world as the most authoritative institutions intheir particular spheres, and to which will be drawn students and staff instructorsfrom all countries.12. In addition to a centralised training scheme there are clearly a numberof other functions, such as documentation and codes, safety regulations, maps,statistical services and some others, which could more efficiently be carried outcentrally by an Air Transport Board. The relations between the Board and the subsidiary corporations would need to be worked out clearly and in great detail.13. Lastly, the existence of these separate organisations of a semi-autonomous character would provide an opportunity for inter-transfer of personnel between them and thus ensure the maximum utilisation of each person&apos;experience and skill.14. Though B.O.A.C., as &quot; the chosen instrument,&quot; has never yet functionedfree from Air Ministry control, as was originally proposed, and may be said there-fore to merit neither praise nor condemnation, it must be recognised that therehas been not only a large amount of public criticism levelled at it, but also serious concern has been expressed by those working within the organisation. A realattempt ought to be made by the new Air Transport Board to ascertain the causes of failure, and thus prevent a repetition of the same mistakes when air transport is reorganised.15. In the new set-up, we feel it is essential that those actually responsiblefor running the various services should be enabled to play their part in deter-mining how the organisations should be run. Only thus can the best brains be attracted to civil aviation and have with their Boards regular staff and manage-ment conferences.ANNEX 2.Copy of a Letter, dated 18th October, 1945, from the Secretary,Parliamentary Labour Party, House of Commons, to the Ministerof Civil Aviation.Dear Lord Winster,The Civil Aviation Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party met thismorning and decided that it was essential to reiterate the two main principles which they consider should influence the Government in deciding its policy on civil Aviation, and I was instructed to bring these to your notice and also submit
them to the Liaison Committee in order that if it should be necessary there shallbe a discussion on the matter at the Party Meeting. These two guiding principlesare as follows : -(1) Civil Air Transport should be operated in accordance with a schemewhich can in due course be fitted into a larger air plan for the BritishCommonwealth and Empire, and ultimately an international service:and in order to achieve this it is desirable that the Government should prepare at the earliest moment a master plan covering both home and overseas requirements both now and for the future.(2) In the preparation of this plan it is of cardinal importance that it should provide for fully socialised ownership, operation and control, as theGroup feels strongly that any compromise with sectional interests would jeopardise the efficient and virile development of the new civil air Transport service. In particular, they consider that railway and shipping interests ought not to be brought in on the specious argument that at some future time it is intended to nationalise these under-takings, as to do so would mean that at a later stage these sameinterests might have to be bought out at high valuations : nor does the Group feel that regard ought to be paid to the claim put forward by shipping and railway interests that experience of other forms oftransport is of major value in the operation of civil air lines.In submitting these two principles, I was also requested to stress that theGroup are utterly opposed to any participation by railway, shipping or other private interests in the operation of civil air lines.*Jf. M,&quot;TV&quot; &quot;TV&quot;(Signed) CAROL JOHNSON,Secretary.
