Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECEET. Copy No,CP. (45) 201.1.9* October, 1945.CABINET.EXPIRY OF THE EMERGENCY POWERS (DEFENCE) ACTS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. The authority of the Cabinet is sought for the making of an announce-ment in the Debate on the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Bill on the 9th October that the Government propose (a) to allow the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts to expire on the24th February next;(b) to move an amendment on the Committee Stage of the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Bill to extend Clause 1 to coverdemobilisation and resettlement and the disposal of surplus material;and(c) to introduce into Parliament, as soon as the details have been agreed between the departments, an Emergency Laws (Transitional Pro-visions) Bill on the lines of the attached draft.2. The Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts were due to expire on the24th August last, but by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1945, the lastParliament continued them in force up to the 24th February, 1946, leaving thepresent Parliament to decide whether they should be further renewed, and if so,for how long. (The Acts may be continued for any period up to a year beyondthe 24th February next on resolutions to that effect being passed by both houses of Parliament.)3. A considerable number of Defence Regulations will be required afterthe 24th February next. Those Regulations which are required for economic and relief purposes will be continued in force under the Supplies and Services(Transitional Provisions) Bill as at present drafted. A number of others,however, will be required which are not within the present limited purposes ofthat Bill. Some of these are required temporarily until, for instance, the armed forces have been restored to a peace-time footing; others it is desired to retainuntil they can be absorbed into permanent legislation.4. When the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill was drafted,it was anticipated that the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts would remain inforce for at least a year later than next February, and that nearly rail the defence regulations, other than those covered by the Supplies and Services Bill andthose suitable for permanent legislation, would expire with the Acts. It wouldthen only be necessary to pass a small and uncontroversial Bill keeping alive a strictly limited number of Regulations.5. In the altered circumstances the Regulations which are not within thepresent Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill as at present draftedmay be dealt with in two ways: (a) One course would be to ask both Houses of Parliament to extend theEmergency Powers (Defence) Acts for a further period (say, a year)by which time the number of Defence Regulations which wouldrequire renewal would have been reduced to the number originallyanticipated. To this course there appear to be strong objections.[30617]   &apos; B
The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, was passed through all its stages in one day on the eve of the war. It would be difficult tojustify the retention of its sweeping powers more than six monthsafter the end of all hostilities, especially as the Government is already taking steps in the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Billto preserve the essential economic controls for a further period.(b) The preferable course would appear to be to allow the emergency powers (Defence) Acts to expire on the 24th February next, to con-sider how far the scope of the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill can be widened to cover appropriate classes of regula-tions which must be continued, and before the 24th February next tointroduce a separate Bill for the purpose of continuing those provisions in the Defence Regulations which are not now within and cannot bebrought within the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill.6. On the assumption that this second alternative will have to be adopted, itis suggested that a new purpose should be added to Clause 1 of the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Bill by amendment at the Committee Stage asfollows : &quot; to facilitate the demobilisation and resettlement of persons and to securethe orderly disposal of war material.&quot;This addition, which should not be controversial, will cover the continuancefor the purpose of demobilisation and resettlement and for disposal of surplusmaterial of an important group of regulations. For the rest, additional legisla-tion will be necessary and the attached draft Bill has been prepared, entitled theEmergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Bill. Its main purpose is to continue in the first instance until the 31st December, 1947, some 50 provisions in theDefence (General) Regulations, and provisions in 27 of the other codes ofDefence Regulations. This date has been chosen in order that such of theDefence Regulations thus continued as will still be required after that datecan be still further continued by the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill of 1947.It is for consideration whether the Bill should renew these provisions to the endof 1947, or only until the end of 1946. The latter alternative might be more acceptable to Parliament, but, on the other hand, this course would involve legislation by Parliament on the same subject twice in one year, and as very manyof these provisions would require to be renewed after the 31st December, 1946, aserious burden would be placed on the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill of 1946.7. The number of separate provisions to be renewed by this Bill may looklarge, but it should be explained when the Bill is introduced that these provisionsform only a small proportion of the total number of Defence Regulations. Therewere in force immediately before VE-Day 342 separate Regulations in theDefence (General) Regulations, apart from the other codes of Defence Regula-tions. About half of the Defence (General) Regulations will have been revokedor will be allowed to expire with the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, andmany others will be continued under the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Bill. Those which it is proposed to continue in the attached Bill are onlya comparatively small remainder.8. Opportunity has been taken in this Bill to make permanent a number of minor amendments effected in the general law by Defence Regulations. these amendments are specified in the Second Schedule to the Bill. None of these islikely to arouse any controversy.9. The Bill also deals with a few war-time Acts, the date of expiry of whichis linked with that of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts. There are about20 such Acts, the majority of which will be allowed to expire with the emergency powers (Defence) Acts, but it is desirable that a few should be continued for a.further period, and provision to that effect has been made in Clauses 2-8 of theBill. It is proposed that in all but one of these cases the period of validity shouldbe extended to the 31st December, 1947, so as to have, as far as possible, a uniform expiry date for all the provisions continued by the Bill. If differentdates are inserted for the expiry of different provisions, encouragement will begiven to the moving of amendments for the purpose of bringing the 1947provisions to an end in 1946. An exception, however, has been made in the caseof the Restoration of Pre-War Trade Practices Act, 1942, which is dealt within Clause 6.   This Act requires pre-war trade practices to be restored within
two months from the end of the &quot;war period,&quot; which is defined to end on a date appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service not later thanthe date on which the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, expires. TheMinister does not wish to appoint this date before next February, on the groundthat trade practices are being satisfactorily restored by agreement, but he feels that Parliament would object to the Act being postponed in its operation forany longer than the end of next year. There may be one or two other cases,particularly that of the Fire Services (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1941, dealtwith in Clause 4, which may give rise to criticism of the proposed continuance untilthe end of 1947, and if Ministers decide that legislation to deal with theNational Fire Service can be introduced and passed before the end of 1946 itmay be thought preferable not to provide for the continuance of the Fire Services(Emergency Provisions) Act beyond the end of 1946.10. An early decision on the question whether the Emergency Powers(Defence) Acts should be allowed to expire on the 24th February next isdesirable in order that an announcement may be made of the governments intentions during the debate on the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Bill, which is fixed for the 9th October. It will be much easier to pass that Bill through Parliament if it is known that there is no intention of continuing the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts after the24th February next.J. C.
