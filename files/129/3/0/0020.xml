(45) 220.llth October, 1945.CABINET.SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT TO SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Mr, EDEN circulated to the War Cabinet on the 10th April a memorandum(W.P. (45) 230) in which he pointed out that several enquiries had been receivedfrom Spain regarding the purchase in this country of various items of warmaterial and equipment of a semi-military character for the use of the SpanishGovernment.2. Mr. Eden, while opposed to the supply of actual weapons of war to spain, recommended that for long-term commercial and political reasons per-mission should be given for the export to Spain of articles of equipment which did not constitute war material proper, though capable of military use.3. The War Cabinet did not take a final decision on the subject but agreedthat an enquiry should be addressed to the United States Government as to theirviews on the subject, coupled with a suggestion that the two Governments should pursue a common policy. Copies are attached of the telegram addressed to HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington on the subject and of the Embassy&apos;s replyembodying the views of the State Department. It will be seen that the state department agreed that actual weapons of war should not be supplied to Spain.As regards the semi-military equipment, they did not express their views onthe general principle, but their observations regarding each particular itemshowed that they agreed to the export of goods for civilian purposes but not to anything calculated to increase the strength of the Spanish armed forces.4. I would suggest for the consideration of my colleagues that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should accept this distinction between goods destined for civilianuse and goods destined for the strengthening of the armed forces as a general principle by which the departments concerned should be guided. The question arises, however, how this principle is to be applied in practice. The machineryby which the export of military and semi-military equipment to Spain can be controlled is the export licensing system provided by the Export of Goods (Control)(7) Order of 1945.5. It will be seen that under this Order, a copy of which is attached, goods of a military or semi-military character are listed in Group 17. Group 17 isvery comprehensive, though it does not cover every possible item which mightbe of use to the Spanish armed forces. Thus some items such as machinery ofvarious kinds are free from export control. I understand, however, that it wouldbe administratively very difficult, if not impracticable, to exercise control oversuch items, while for political reasons connected with the development of our export trade it seems undesirable to reimpose export control on items now free from it, or to extend the list of goods in Group 17.6. In the circumstances, I suggest that it should be the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that all exports to Spain of goods listed in Group 17 should besubject to licence and that, in present circumstances, licences should be refusedexcept in cases where such goods are manifestly intended for civilian use, suchas, for example, civil aircraft and training aircraft not destined for the Spanisharmed forces, and engines for such aircraft.7. If this recommendation is agreed, I would propose to inform the UnitedStates Government of our decision in the matter.E. B.Foreign Office, llth October, 1945.Copy No.12974   [30686]B
ANNEX 1.Mr. Eden to the Earl of Halifax (Washington).(No. 401.   Saving.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, 1st May, 1945.A NUMBER of requests and enquiries have been received during recent months by Government departments and private firms in this country from theService Departments of the Spanish Government enquiring whether varioussupplies could be furnished to them from the United Kingdom. Some of the items desired consisted of war material pure and simple, such as anti-aircraft guns or Bren-gun carriers. Others were only of a semi-military nature or ofa type which, though capable of military uses, were generally of a civiliancharacter. Examples of requests received in respect of the second category of items are as follows :-(a) Supplies, machinery, &amp;c., required for the modernisation of the Spanishdockyards and for the new building programme of the Spanish Navy.(b) Engines for training aircraft and complete training aircraft.(c) Meteorological, blind-flying and direction-finding equipment.(d) Ordinary transport vehicles.2. No war material of any sort has, of course, been supplied to Spain sincethe outbreak of the civil war, and it remains the view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment that they should still continue to refuse the supply of actual weapons ofwar to Spain. The question now at issue is whether the ban on the export to spain of items in the second category, i.e., those of only semi-military character,should be lifted. There are obvious advantages in doing so from the point ofview of our post-war trade and of restoring a favourable trade balance between this country and Spain. On the other hand, to allow the export of such itemsmight be regarded as lending assistance to General Franco &apos;s Government andmight give rise to serious political complications and would certainly exposeHis Majesty&apos;s Government to misrepresentation both in this country and inthe United States.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to follow a common policy withthe United States Government in the matter, and therefore before considering this question further they would be glad to know the views of the United StatesGovernment on the subject and to learn whether the United States authorities would propose to sanction the supply to Spain from United States sources of items of a semi-military nature. We believe, for instance, that the question of thedisposal of surplus United States aircraft which even though originally intended for commercial purposes, might in certain circumstances be of some military value to the Spanish Government to Spain is now under consideration. Do theUnited States Government intend to sanction such transactions and what wouldtheir attitude be in regard to the supply to Spain of items such as thoseenumerated in paragraph 1 above ?4. I should be grateful if you would consult the State Department in thematter and inform me of their views as soon as practicable. In the event of theUnited States Government taking the line that they would deprecate the supplyof items of a semi-military nature to the Spanish Government, I should be grateful for your observations as to whether the United States Government would, in fact,be able effectively to prevent the export of such items from the United States or their sale to Spain from United States-controlled sources. In that event HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be disposed to reach a joint understanding to refrain from supplying such material.ANNEX 2.Earl of Halifax to Mr. Churchill. (Received. 5th July.)(No. 4648.) ^(Telegraphic.) Washington, 5th July, 1945.YOUR telegram No. 401.   Saving.State Department have finally replied to the memorandum based on yourtelegram under reference in the following terms : &quot; Reference is made to Embassy&apos;s memorandum dated 15th May, 1945,relating to the question of furnishing to Spain war material and articles of a semi-military nature or of a type which, though capable of military use, aregenerally of a civilian character.
&apos;&apos; This Government concur with the British Government in. the view thatactual weapons of war should not be supplied to Spain.&quot; With reference to the four classifications of equipment described under(a), (b), (c) and (d) of memorandum under reference, this Governments views maybe expressed as follows : &quot; (a) It has no objection to supplies, machinery, &amp;o, required for modernisa-tion of Spanish dockyards being made available, except when intended for dockyards owned by Spanish Government and any dockyardswhich are engaged primarily in the building of ships for Spanishnavy. It would, however, object to such material being provided foruse in connexion with new building programme of Spanish navy.&quot; (6) There would be no objection to engines for training aircraft and com-plete training aircraft, excepting advanced trainers and engines and parts therefor, being furnished to Spanish Government.&apos;&apos; (c) Only such meteorological, blind-flying and direction-finding equipment as is of a type available for general commercial sale, and unclassifiedby either Government, should be cleared for shipment to Spain.&quot; (d) Ordinary transport vehicles, such as trucks and automobiles, could be furnished to Spain without any restrictions provided they were not designed or equipped in any way for military use.&quot; It is true transport aircraft and light commercial aircraft might be of some military value to Spanish Government even though they are primarily designed for commercial purposes. While this Government would object to the sale to spain of such aircraft for military purposes, it would not object to their sale foruse on regularly operated air lines or for ordinary commercial or private use.This policy would apply to the sale of surplus B aircraft as well as to new aircraft which may be produced in future.&quot;[306861
