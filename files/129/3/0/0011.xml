Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 211.6th October, 1945. &apos;&apos; \ ^ ,&apos;&quot;CABINET.DEVELOPMENTS IN BURMA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.MY colleagues will remember that the late Government issued in May 1945a considered statement of their policy (Gmd. 6635). This statement made itclear that their considered policy was the promotion of full self-Governmentin Burma and it described the arrangements that were in view to bridge theperiod of reconstruction in that country. It set out the practical difficulties,arising out of the Japanese occupation and the confusion which it has created,which preclude the re-establishment, immediately on the liberation of the country,of a Burmese Government as it existed in 1941, and explained that it was proposed that until normal conditions could be restored and elections held,Government should be conducted under the Emergency Provisions (s. 139) of theGovernment of Burma Act of 1935. The effect of those provisions is to vestresponsibility for government solely in the Governor, subject to the control of theSecretary of State for Burma and of Parliament. While, however, the governor would be solely responsible, it was proposed that power should be taken tointroduce, by Order-in-Council modifications to enable the system of administra-tion to be liberalised and, in particular, to make it possible to establish an executive Council which would contain a substantial non-official Burmeseelement, and also, as an interim body pending the holding of general elections,a small nominated Legislative Council. The proposals in the White Paper were approved by Parliament in June 1945.2. At that time we had reason to apprehend that the process of expellingthe Japanese from Burma would be a lengthy and costly one. The collapse ofthe Japanese Empire has materially modified the position. Burma has nowbeen liberated, although there are still substantial bodies of Japanese troopsin the southern districts of the country on the Siamese border which have not yetbeen fully disarmed or taken under control.3. During the summer, both before and since the surrender of Japan, dis-cussions have been proceeding between the Governor of Burma, the supreme allied Commander, South-East Asia Command, and His Majesty&apos;s Government,as to the steps to be taken for the restoration of the Civil Government and theimplementing of the policy laid down in the White Paper.4. The Governor has felt very strongly that politically there are arguments of decisive force for his return to Rangoon and for the reconstitution of theCivil Government, with Rangoon as its headquarters, at as early a date aspossible. The Supreme Allied Commander has strongly urged on the other hand,the importance of the difficulties which will inevitably arise in connection both with the provision of supplies and the provision of the necessary administrativepersonnel once the Civil Government takes over from the military and theresources of the latter are no longer automatically at call. The Governor fullyaccepts the force of Lord Louis Mountbatten&apos;s points. He has felt, however,after full consideration of them, and I share his view, that the risks in question should be faced, and the position has been greatly eased by the generous readiness of the Supreme Allied Commander to make available to the Governor all assis-tance possible consistently with the discharge of his other obligations in respect[30657]
of supplies and personnel. After discussion between Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith and the Supreme Allied Commander it has now been agreed that theGovernor shall leave Simla on the 10th October for Calcutta, and that he shallproceed from Calcutta to Rangoon in H.M.S. Cleopatra on the 12th october and arrive in Rangoon on the 16th October. With effect from that date, theGovernor and his Civil Government will become responsible for the administra-tion of the whole of Burma other than the three or four southern districts, thepresence in which of large Japanese forces necessitates their remaining for thepresent under military administration.5. An Order in Council has now been made by His Majesty, and will bepublished just before the Governors return to Burma, under which the Governoris empowered to establish (1) An Executive Council of not more than 15 members to be appointed byhim, to be sworn as Members of the Executive Council and to hold office as such during his pleasure; and subsequently(2) A Legislative Council which will include all the members of theExecutive Council and will consist of not more than 50 members inall, to be appointed by the Governor and hold office during hispleasure.The duty of the Executive Council will be to aid and advise the Governor(who will, however, legally remain solely responsible so long as Burma continuesto be governed under the Emergency Provisions of the Act of 1935) in theexercise of his functions In the same way it will be the function of the LegislativeCouncil to aid and advise him in the exercise of the legislative powers which also were assumed by him under the Proclamation dated the 10th December,1942, by which he assumed responsibility, pending the restoration of normalconditions for the government of the country.6. The selection of the personnel of the Executive Council and of theLegislative Council is to await the Governors return to Rangoon. It is clearlydifficult for him to reach really firm conclusions about the internal politicalsituation and about the choice wisely to be made of individuals to compose theExecutive Council and thereafter the Legislative Council, until he has been ableto take, soundings on the spot. It is not, however, anticipated that any long delaywill take place in constituting the Executive Council, and while it will needlonger to build up a Legislative Council, and the Governor will have to take more extensive soundings before making his selections, he hopes to be able to constituteit before the end of 1945.7. I should at this point utter a note of warning. The policy that has been laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government has had on the whole a not unfavourablereception. But, as my colleagues are aware, the resistance elements in Burma,though apparently prepared to co-operate on terms, represent a political force the real importance of which is still difficult to assess, but from which it may beanticipated that we shall find ourselves under strong and continuous pressure fora swifter implementation of our long-term policy towards Burma than circum-stances might make possible. It is perhaps questionable whether the leadingpersonalities concerned appreciate to the full the difficulty of a small State suchas Burma standing on its own feet economically, politically and militarily, saveafter the requisite groundwork has been laid, or the time that this must take,even with the best will in the world. Nor can we ignore the possibility thatcurrent events in Indonesia and the very natural desire of the Burmese to bemasters in their own house as soon as circumstances permit, may lead to politicalunrest and even to outbreaks against authority. But while I feel it my duty todraw attention to the existence of the possibilities of danger, I am clear, in agree-ment with the Governor, that we must face them. The Supreme allied commander, to whom (and not, as would in ordinary circumstances be consti-tutionally proper, to the Governor) the G.O.C. in Burma will be responsible whileS.E.A.C. continues to exist, has promised his full support for the civil authority.We cannot, without risk of grave misunderstanding, and without, indeed, therisk that we may produce the very situation of unrest which we are anxious toavoid, delay the implementing of the undertakings in the White Paper. Nor, i feel, could we wisely have delayed the return of the Civil Government. Delay inrespect of either could not but give the impression, either that we had not con-fidence in ourselves or that we had not confidence in the readiness of Burma towork with us and in the capacity of her political leaders to do so.
Extension of the Governor&apos;s term of office. ,8. The present Governors term of office would normally expire in May 1946.The King has approved the extension of his term for a further period of oneyear from that date. That will avoid a break in continuity at this criticaljuncture and will enable the Governor, who has been so closely associated withthe fortunes of Burma during the exile of her Government in India, to preside over the opening stages of her new political development. An announcement tothis effect, together with an announcement regarding the restoration of civil government in the terms of Annexure I, which has been agreed between theGovernor and the Supreme Allied Commander, will be made in the morningpapers of Tuesday, the 9th October, in anticipation of the Governor&apos;s arrival inRangoon.Arrangements in connection with the Governor&apos;&apos;s return.9. The King has graciously agreed to send the message the text of whichis reproduced in Annexure II to this paper, to be delivered on the occasion ofthe Governor&apos;s actual return to Burma. I also propose to send a message frommyself for use on the same occasion. A message of goodwill and congratulationhas also been received from Field-Marshal Smuts, and there is some reason to hopethat we may receive similar messages from some or all of the remaining dominion prime Ministers.10. The Governor, very shortly after his arrival, proposes to make animportant inaugural speech in which he will reaffirm the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards Burma, in terms of the explanations given in parliament in June last by the then Secretary of State for Burma and by Sir Stafford Cripps,which emphasised the elastic nature of the policy and the opportunities whichit offers for development. He has expressed a desire that there should be asupporting statement by the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has beenbeen good enough to agree to this.P.-L.Burma Office,6th October, 1945.ANNEXURE I.At their recent meeting at Kandy, the Supreme Allied Commander and theGovernor of Burma agreed on the desirability of civil administration being-established as quickly as possible in those parts of Burma which have been cleared of the Japanese. They recognised that considerable difficulties stilllie in the way of effective civil administration in view of the general shortage of civilian equipment and supplies, the present lack of adequatecommunications and trained civilian technical personnel. In order to assistuntil such time as their own supplies and personnel are available, the supreme allied Commander has generously offered to afford to the Civil Government asmuch help as he can from military resources, due regard being paid to his otherformidable commitments in the recently enlarged South-East Asia theatre.Having considered the joint views of the Supreme Allied Commander and theGovernor of Burma, His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed that Civil Govern-ment should now be restored in Burma, except for that part of the Tenasserimdivision where the disarmament of the Japanese is not yet completed, which,for time being, will continue to be -(sQEffupt - group)- administered by theB.M.A. The Governor of Burma will return to Rangoon about the middle ofOctober, i
ANNEXURE II.At this moment, when the Governor resumes control of the administration,I send to My people of Burma a message of affectionate greeting and warmsympathy.I know how great have been your sufferings under the scourge of war, and how patiently you have borne them.I know, too, how you have endured the oppression of the Japanese, and howlittle you have been deluded by their false promises of freedom.I rejoice in the liberation of your country by the struggle victoriously wagedby My forces from all parts of the Empire and by My allies, and that in thisstruggle the sons of Burma joined to strike a courageous blow.Through the ever-memorable bravery and skill of the fighting services, andthe hard work of the Military Administration, the day has quickly come whenthe civil Government can be restored. The way is now open for all faithful sonsof Burma, of whatever race, to work together for speedy progress in the peacefulreconstruction of what has been destroyed. This is the road to expandingprosperity and true freedom.My Government in the United Kingdom in consultation with your Governorhave stated their policy towards Burma. It is their purpose that Burma shall,at the earliest possible moment, attain complete self-government as a memberof the British Commonwealth. As a first step to enable a constitution to be planned by representatives of the people of Burma themselves, ministers responsible to a House of Representatives will again be appointed as soon asthe necessary preparations can be completed for holding elections under fair and orderly conditions.In the interval, during which preparations for elections are being made,the Governor will be assisted by an Executive Council to which he will appointmembers as widely representative as possible of political opinion as he findsit on his return. One of his first tasks will be, with the advice of this Council,to constitute a Legislative Council, which will also be as representative as itcan be made before the wishes of the people can be ascertained by a general election.To the hill peoples of Burma, who have with such steadfast couragemaintained for three long years the fight against the enemy, I wish to say aspecial word. Separate arrangements will be made for your administrationso that special care and attention may be given to your welfare and yourindigenous institutions may be developed. I hope that the day is not far distantwhen you too will desire of your own free will to take your place in a self-governing Burma, and My Government will do all in its power to forward this last step in the historic task of the unification of Burma.It is my heartfelt hope that by the united efforts of, all, the many tasks which he ahead may be successfully and speedily accomplished and ensure the lastinghappiness and well-being of the people of Burma in whose progress I shallconstantly take a sympathetic interest.
