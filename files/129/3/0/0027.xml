Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 227.12th October, 1945.CABINET.NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.The Future of the Hospital Services.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I read with admiration what I thought was the brilliant and imaginativepaper of the Minister of Health on the future of the hospital services (OP. (45)205). I was attracted by the order and simplicity of the solution which he offered for a complex and difficult administrative problem. But then I began to havedoubts about some of its wider implications. I recalled, for example, from myHome Office experience the analogous question of the nationalisation of thepolice service. There is a no less strong case for this on grounds of administrative convenience and technical efficiency. Like previous Home Secretaries, however,I decided that in the absence of an urgent and strong public need this alone wasnot a sufficient reason for proposing a nationalised police force, because of theobjections to the concentration of the whole control of the police service in theHome Secretary of the day unless it was imperative in the national interest, and because, too, the objections to weakening the local authorities by reducing the^ield of local government. Both these arguments seem to me to be relevant tothe present issue.2. In the first place, how does the Minister of Health&apos;s scheme differ fromthe alternative of a local authority service, with joint hospital boards, and withthe Ministry of Health as the responsible central Department ? Not so much, Iwould suggest, as may appear at first. Recognising, rightly I am sure, the needfor considerable devolution, he provides for Regional Boards, on which localauthorities are to be represented, and below them District Committees at thelocal authority level. The main difference is that under his scheme the regional boards and District Committees are directly under the Ministry of Health. but here, I think, he is on the horns of a dilemma. If the Regional Boards and district Committees are to be subject to the Ministers directions on all questionsof policy, finance, establishments and so on, then they will be mere creatures ofthe Ministry of Health, with little vitality of their own, and the local authorities will increasingly and loudly complain that the devolution is largely ineffective.Yet it is difficult under a State system to envisage the alternative situation inwhich, in order to give them vitality, they are left free to spend Exchequer moneywithout the Ministers approval and to pursue policies which at any rate in detailmay not be the Ministers, but for which he presumably would be answerable.3. We should, as I have said, be cautious before taking any step that willweaken local government, and it is to be remembered that, while in some directionsthe opportunities for the local authorities will be greater than in the past, theGovernments programme in any event entails the loss by them of some of their economic functions as regards, for example, gas and electricity, probablypassenger transport and possibly water. We should be particularly cautiousin a case like this where there is a risk of major damage to the fabric of localgovernment. The Minister himself, in paragraph 14 (8) of his paper, refers tothe possibility that, as would be logical, the transfer of the hospital services tothe State would be followed fcy the transfer of the other local government health services child welfare, district nursing, health centres and so on. It may be aquestion, therefore, of the loss by British local government of all or most of its responsibilities in this important field in which it has done some of its bestwork and in which,.so to speak, it won its spurs. It is the case that under theLocal Government Act, 1929, which transferred Poor Law Infirmaries from the[30694]
Guardians to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs, great improvements have been made by a large proportion of local authorities in hospital administra-tion, without any specific Government grant-in-aid. And let it not be forgotten that the transfer took place in April 1930, and that only nine years elapsedbefore progress was interrupted by a war which has inflicted grave difficultieson the hospitals.4. This is not in itself a conclusive argument against nationalising the hospitals, but it is a conclusive argument for thinking hard before doing it.It is possible to argue that almost every local government function, taken by itself, could be administered more efficiently in the technical sense under anational system, but if we wish local government to thrive as a school ofpolitical and democratic education as well as a method of administration wemust consider the general effect on local government of each particular proposal.It would be disastrous if we allowed local government to languish by whittlingaway its most constructive and interesting functions, and we must not blindour eyes to the fact that to deprive the local authorities of their public healthresponsibilities would be a very serious thing from this point of view.5. We must also face the politics of the matter. It is not a question of abattle with some of the local authorities, such as, for example, would be entailed by a transfer of functions from district to county councils. All the localauthorities will be up in arms, those not directly affected ranged alongside the others by the challenge and the threat to local government as such. Beside themthere will be the voluntary hospitals, and possibly a substantial proportion ofthe doctors. Our own people will be divided. Labour councils will be asapprehensive as the others, and we shall have to be prepared for opposition from the Government side of the House, and disunity in the party in the counties.The municipal elections are coming on in November and in the Spring andthis would hardly be a resounding platform for Labour to use in capturing thelocal authorities. As to the public, there is a great deal of local pride in the hospitals, both public and voluntary, much sentiment attaches to them, and 1cannot believe that any sufficient enthusiasm would be evoked for what wouldbe represented as a scheme for bringing the hospitals under bureaucraticWhitehall control. And, I would add, we cannot claim to have a mandate forthe proposal : there is nothing in &quot; Let us face the Future &quot; to suggest that we intended to do this.6. I suggest, too, that we should think seriously before embarking on a project which would still further hold up the completion of the scheme for aNational Health Service. For this would be the inevitable consequence of thestruggle with the local authorities and the other interests, and of the prolongednegotiations which would be involved. The National Health Service scheme hasbeen delayed long enough. Only in the last resort should we be prepared tointroduce new delays, and it would be unfortunate to prejudice it at the outsetby creating a needless atmosphere of strife and suspicion by forcing through a measure which would be likely to have few supporters and many opponents.7. I am fully alive to the drawbacks of joint authorities I dislike themthoroughly hut in this case, at any rate for the present, I think that they providethe best way out of an admittedly difficult administrative problem. I recognisethat, judged purely as a piece of administrative machinery, nationalisation maybe superior to a local authority system with joint hospital boards, though, as have pointed out, the Minister of Health&apos;s scheme does not differ so radicallyfrom such a system. Nor do I exclude the possibility that after the National health service has been in operation for a time and experience of its working has beenobtained, it may not be found desirable to revive the idea of nationalisation inmore auspicious circumstances. But I feel sure that any superiority which on administrative grounds the Minister&apos;s scheme possesses is outweighed by itsdisadvantages &quot;in particular the potentially serious consequences to local govern-ment of slicing off one of its most cherished functions, the antagonism andsuspicion which the Government would arouse amongst local authorities throughout the land, and the delay in setting up the National Health Service andthe possible prejudicial effect upon it when it was launched in the end.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,12th October, 1945.
