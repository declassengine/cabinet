(45) 225.\Wi October, 1945.CABINET.,,,  .    LABOUR SHORTAGES IN BUILDING MATERIAL AND-in-!- COMPONENT INDUSTRIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Under-Secretary of Statefor Scotland.irvi WE desire to draw the. attention of our colleagues to the shortage of building materials (e.g., slates, plaster, glass, tiles, &amp;c.) and components (e.g., baths,cookers, grates, &amp;c.) due to lack of industrial labour in those industries. Thecompletion of temporary houses is already delayed owing to the absence of essential components due to shortages of manufacturing labour. Unless thelabour force in the materials industries can be increased there will be unemploy-ment of building operatives in 1946 due to a lack of materials,2. The serious position to which we refer is well known and has beenconstantly before the Departments affected for a considerable time past. Theposition, however, so far from improving is deteriorating in that the number ofadditional workers which is being drawn into the industries producing materials and components is small, whereas new house building is beginning on an increasing scale.3. It will be appreciated that it is essential for labour for these industries to be introduced into the works not less than three months before the materials and components are required for use, owing to the time necessary for manufac-ture, distribution and storage.4. With the help and assistance of the Ministry of Labour the normalarrangements for obtaining labour have been exploited to the full.Designation, First preference and Second preference have been obtainedwherever appropriate. In certain cases the highest possible form of labour-preference has been obtained, namely, &quot; bottle-neck &quot; preference, but it has never-theless been impossible to obtain the labour required. For the information ofour colleagues we attach (Annex) an example of a particular case in point.Nominated workers schemes have been adopted wherever it was thought theywould serve a useful purpose.Application has been made for Class B releases to the full 10,000 allotted to building material and component industries, but up to date approximately,000 only have been released. Prisoners of war have been used as far aspracticable and approximately 2,000 are employed at the present time.A small publicity scheme has been carried out which was not effective.A paper on the shortages of labour for the building material and componentindustries was submitted to the Cabinet (CP. (45) 9) on the 1st June, 1945, bythe late Minister of Works.   No decision was taken on it,5. None of the foregoing measures is producing the labour required quicklyenough and it is necessary for steps to be taken as a matter of urgency to relieve the position.6. The shortage of industrial labour is true over the whole field of industriesproducing building materials and components, but it is particularly marked inthe following industries : asbestos cement, gypsum, gypsum plaster and plaster-board, glass, clay tiles, slates, stock and facing bricks, iron foundries producingcastings for the building programme, cookers and gas meters.7. The following figures will assist our colleagues to appreciate theposition : (a) The present outstanding demands for labour for immediate employmentin these industries is about 9,000.[30704]
(&amp;) The total net increase of labour strength which it is estimated will berequired for building material and component industries up to theend of June 1946 is about 130,000 against an existing labour force inthose industries of approximately 150,000. The increase in thebuilding industry proper during the same period will be from a present figure of 440,000 to an estimated total of 905,000.8.   In order to relieve the position we recommend for the approval of ,our colleagues the following courses of action :  *&apos;(A) Reconsideration of the number of men to be called up in the nexthalf-year for the Services. The call-up of young men is having aserious effect in the building material and component industries.(B) Ex-building material and component emplo3rees who are now in theForces should be recalled and placed on the reserve immediately upto a total of 15,000, with a view to their employment by their old firms.(C) (i) Ex-operatives who have left the building materials and componentindustries since the 3rd September, 1939, should be compulsorilywithdrawn from their present employment and directed back to their former employment.(ii) Workers in other industries who would be suitable for employment in the building materials and components industries should be withdrawn from their present employment and directed:,to: the building materials and components industries. ,,(iii) If the use of these powers of direction is to be effectiveTor-11              the purpose of increasing the labour force, men over the age of 30 willhave to be directed. The powers will have to be used to the full,including prosecution if necessary.: (D) Where firms are manufacturing in the same factory both buildingcomponents and other non-essential articles for civilian use, productionauthorities should direct employers to divert labour from non-essentialproduction to the manufacture of building components.(E) As a matter of longer-term policy every effort should be made to improve the conditions in many of these industries. The Departmentsconcerned should concert together to this end.A. B.G. B.Ministry of Health, S. W. 1,IMh October, 1945.ANNEX.TURNERS ASBESTOS  COMPANY, TRAFFORD PARK.1. The above Company is one of several firms producing asbestos cement flatand corrugated sheets. Practically the whole of the production of the asbestoscement industry in flat and corrugated sheets is being used on the GovernmentsTemporary housing programme. There is a serious and urgent shortage of theproduction of sheets, not only for the Temporary Housing Programme, but forother building work, including bomb damage repair, due entirely to shortage oflabour.2. At Turner&apos;s Works in Trafford Park there is a mill standing idle whichcould be put into production at the rate of 350 tons per week, with the additionof 30 men. The Company have agreed that provided 15 able-bodied men can bemade available they will, by making emergency use of employees already in theworks and engaged on other duties, make up the balance of 15 so as to enable the mill to be got into production.3. The production of asbestos cement was designated and First Preferenceaccorded in January 1945. Bottle-neck Preference (the highest possible Preferencewhich can be obtained under any conditions) was granted on the 13th July, 1945.for 15 men, but the vacancies still remain unfilled.4. At the instance of the Ministry of Labour, the Works was examined bythe Chief Factory Inspector, who reported that the conditions of working were good, and that the wages were not out of relation with other industries in that area.
