SECRETCP, (hb)  2U122ND OCTOBER,   19k5WHEAT SUPPLIES POP GERMANY AND AUSTRIAMemorandum by the Mini ater of Pood- SUMMARYI recently circulated a paper on World Wheat Supplies(LpPpbUtjj 13&apos;!) tc the Lore. President&apos;s Committee.      In his paper G, P, (hi) 253 the Minister of State suggests that thepossibility of increasing supplies of wheat to Germany shouldbe explored.      I -i asi that my colleagues will wish to seethe original paper on world wheat supplies together with this special note, which I have prepared on the impossibility ofincreasing sUigottos of wheat to Germany and Austria.Since the presentation of L.P,(h5) 181  on the subjectof world wheat supplied and requirements the&apos;statisticalposition has detoriorlate&apos;cU      The crop estimates of the fourmain exporting countries have been written down and adverse weather eonehitions in certain importing countries will resultin additional claims:On the basic of the latest estimates Germany and austria could be supplied with no more than 570,000 tons ofwheat up to  the 30th June,  19t!-6 and even this figure can beachieved only if ether claimants are prepared to acceptreductions in their original claims and the four mainexporting countries agree   to reduce their wheat stocks at theend of June, 1 946 to levels consistent with the international wheat Agreement minima,,The balance of IP370,000 tons needed to satisfy theestimated minimum requirements of Germany and Austria can bemade available only by restricting to this extent the amountof wheat fed no animals, principally in the United States.Pending a decision by the four main exporting countries to adopt and Implement the recommendations set outin paragraph 19(h)  of 1,P,(k5)-181  the amount of wheatavailable for export will be  insufficient to meet theminimum needs of claimants other than Germany and austria and any wheat sent to these two countries in the meantimemay be at the direct expense of higher priority claimants.1. In the paper presented to the Lord President&apos;sCommittee on the 12th October (L.P. (h5) 181) dealing with world wheat supplies and requirements, tentative provision was made for the allocation  to Germany and Austria of2,9h0,0CO tons of wheat/flour,      It was shown that this quantity could be mads available on the basis of the current:py ::: - / V&apos;-GABINET

estimates of supplies and other requirements provided thatthe four main exporting countries agreed -(i)  to reduce their wheat &quot;carry-overs&quot; at the30th June,  191+6 to levels consistent with those set out in the International Wheat Agreement;(ii)  to restrict the quantity of wheat fed tolivestock to the extent necessary to meetessential world import requirements for human consumption.2. The Committee agreed to the course of action proposedin the paper to secure these objectives and concurred in afurther recommendation (paragraph 19(h))  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should only agree to wheat or flour being supplied -to Germany or other ex-enemy countries if this could be done without any reduction in the existing-requirements of the United Kingdom or in the minimum needsof liberated areas for human consumption.3. The whole position unfortunately has deteriorated sincethe preparation of L.P.(1+5)  181.      The crop estimates in thefour main exporting countries have recently been revised.The changes made by Canada and the United States practicallycancel out but the crops in the Argentine and Australiahave been written down by nearly ij million tons.      At thesame time adverse weather conditions in Spain, Portugal, Indiaand elsewhere will give rise to claims by these countries for additional wheat imports which will probably amount in theaggregate to about 1-g- million tons.        The whole  statisticalposition therefore is worsened to the extent of about million tons.

5. It will be seen from the foregoing table that evenif the four main exporting countries can be persuaded toreduce their stocks at the end of June,  1946 to levelsconsistent with the International Wheat Agreement minima thetotal quantity of wheat/flour which can be provided for germany and Austria together to the end of June, 1946 is only570,000 tons and that in order to achieve this result itwould be necessary to spend the emergency reserve of 1 million tons to give effect to the arbitrary cuts in certainprogrammes which were suggested in the Appendix toL.P.(A5) 181.6. The position can be summarised up to this point by saying:(a) that Germany and Austria can be supplied with570,000 tons of wheat against their estimated requirements of 2,940,000 tons provided that(i)  other claimants are prepared to acceptthe cuts implicit in the distributionsuggested in L.P.(45) 181$(ii)  the four main exporting countries agree  toreduce their stocks at the end of June,1946 to levels consistent with theInternational Wheat Agreement minima;(iii)  the emergency reserve of 1 million tons is thrown in.(b) that if Germany and Austria are to b6 supplied with the balance of 2,370,000 tons needed tosatisfy their estimated minimum requirements of2,940,000 tons,  the wheat can only be madeavailable by the restriction of the quantityof wheat fed to livestock,  principally in north America.7. Statistically this should present less difficultyin the United States than was at one  time thought becausethe latest estimates of  the corn crop indicated a productionof approximately 6 million tons more than that on which theearlier estimates were made.      But it does not necessarily follow that in practice the larger corn crop will facilitate the diversion of wheat from animal feeding  to export.    Muchof the maize is grown in areas situated many miles away from-the Eastern livestock production areas where the naturaltendency would be to feed locally grown wheat rather than to import maize from a distance.      The movement of maizemoreover, if this could be secured, would be a substantial&apos;undertaking and might well handicap to some extent themovement of wheat for export,  particularly during the winter months.      While,  theoretically,  therefore,   the wheat accountcould be balanced in this way,  it is very doubtful whether in practice the quantity required for the purpose could besecured.      In any event it would be essential before making-allocations against the additional wheat thereby released for export to be quite satisfied that it would be forthcoming.

8, While by the foregoing expedients it might bepossible to male available sufficient wheat to meet thepresent estimates of German and     ustrian need,  there is avery definite limit to the quantity of wheat as wheat whichCan be moved and shipped out of the &quot;exporting countries.This difficulty is aggravated by the reduction in thequantity of wheat which it is estimated can be exported from the argentine.      Claimants who would normally have-been supplied from.the Argentine will now have to draw their wheat from North America,  thus adding to the burden on movement and port facilities in the United States and canada^9i It is estimated that,  given full priority and themaximum use of Gulf and Pacific ports,   the maximum quantityof wheat which could be moved and shipped out of Canada andthe United States during the period from the 1st November,194-5 to the 31st May, 19h7, which includes h&amp; months duringwhich navigation is closed on the St. Lawrence and the GreatMillion TonsLahes is 11.160to which must be added the available supply of wheat for export as wheatfromMillien TonsAustralia &apos; 0.400Argentina + 2. 760_______3.1 6014.320The total quantity of wheat aswheat which it is estimated has been,or will be,  shipped from the four countries during the five months from june to October,  19h7 inclusive is 8.4OOThe total amount of wheat which has beenor can be, moved and shipped from the four countries for arrival daring the 12 months from July,  1945 to June,  1946 is therefore 22.720The &quot;cut&quot; requirements of the world for wheatas wheat,  including the provision of2,940,000 tons for Germany and Austria, buteliminating the original reserve of 1 million tons amount to    - 22.09hThe theoretical movement facilities surplus istherefore .6264- Additional supplies of fuel will be needed in argentina is this figure is to be achieved.10,        On this basis therefore movement capacity is less likely than supply considerations to present a problem and provided -that 2.37 million tons of wheat can be madeavailable by an effective restriction of the use of wheat

for animal feeding, particularly in the U.S.A.   (seeparagraph 6(b)),  it should be possible to ship it.      But the margin is extremely slender ana is arrived at only byassuming that normal weather conditions will prevailthroughout the whole winter period;    that internal movementin Northern America and loading at the ports will proceedwith machine-like regularity and promptitude and thatmaximum use will be made throughout the period of the Gulfand US/Canada Pacific ports.     Even a partial failure on anyof these counts would bankrupt the account.11.        Since all but a small part of German and Austrianneeds can be met only out of savings resulting fromrestriction in the use of wheat for animal feeding,  theproper source of supply for Germany and   Austria is clearly the U.S.A.      It is in that country that most wheat will beused for animal, feeding;    they have good supplies of feeding grain, and their export capacity will be less severely taxed since all their ports can be worked throughout.the winter months.        Canadian wheat available for exportis supplied in the main to the U.K.  and countries for whichthe U.K. has procurement responsibility and it is essentialthat the minimum requirements of these claimants be&apos; metregardless of other considerations.      Moreover the canadian government is known to be anxious about the allocation ofits export wheat and fears that there may not be sufficientto satisfy Canada&apos;s normal customers.      She will be very reluctant in view of this apprehension,   to  supply any wheat to Germany and Austria and there is good reason to thinkthat if she were to be pressed on this issue she would reply that any wheat sent to these ex-enemy countries must be atthe expense of the United Kingdom and of countries for whichthe United Kingdom /has procurement responsibility.12.        I am already experiencing difficulty in buyingsufficient wheat in Canada to meet the minimum requirementsof this country.      The latest offer by the Canadian WheatBoard would reeu.lt in a U.K,  stock at the end of June,  19I4.of only 390,000 tons of imported wheat.      Long before thispoint had been reached, many of the flour mills in thiscountry would have been forced to close&apos; down.    negotiations are proceeding with the Canadian Wheat Board with a view to securing the offer of sufficient wheat to meet our minimum requirements.      If these are unsuccessful it will benecessary to make representations to the Canadian Government.Our case would clearly be prejudiced if,  at this  juncture,we sought to persuade the Canadian Government to provide anywheat for Germany and   Austria.      It is in my view essentialas a preliminary to assure supplies from Canada sufficientfirstly to meet the minimum needs of this country and secondly of those countries for whom we have procurementresponsibility,13. It will be seen that at the best Germany and Austriacan be provided for without most serious prejudice to otherclaimants only out of wheat made available -(i)  by a reduction on the part of U.S.A., Canada,Argentina and   Australia of their wheat&quot;carry-over&quot; at the 30th June,  19h7 to levelsconsistent with -the Wheat Agreement minima.(ii)  by the restriction of the use of wheat for animal feeding preimarlly in the U.S.A.

We do not know whether these countries will be willingand able to agree to these proposals;      There may be seme-reluctance,  particularly on the part of the U.S,iw  to agreeto (i)&apos;. while it may not be possible in the absence of control to give practical effect to (ii).      Until the first proposals is implemented by all four countries,  there will be a veryserious deficiency in wheat supplies for ^countries other&quot;than Germany and Austria;    only when the second proposalalso is implemented will it be possible with any degree of safety to allocate wheat or flour to Germany and Austria.If we are to supply wheat or flour to these countrieswithout prejudice to U.A.  requirements and to the minimumneeds for human consumption of the rest of the world, wemust first be satisfied that the total quantity of wheatrequired for all these purposes is physically available andthis is not the position at the present time.      The U.K;representative on the Combined Pood. Board has already been instructed to press for the acceptance and application bythe U*Si and Canadian    Government of the principles set outin paragraph 19(1)  of L,P,(h5)  181 and the   Governments ofAustralia and Argentina are&apos;;&quot;being approached similarlythrough the appropriate channels.      Pending the, result ofthese approaches it would,   in my judgment, be most imprudentto make any wheat or flour available to Germany and Austriafrom the four main exporting countries since it might well prove ultimately to have been supplied at the direct expenseof the minimum U.K. needs and of the liberated and othercountries.1hl        la view of the world wheat position as set out inthis paper,  it will clearly be impossible this winter toincrease supplies of wheat to Germany and,  unless there isa satisfactory outcome to the approaches which are beingmade to the Governments of the main exporting countries,it will not be possible to maintain our present undertaking.Ministry of Pood, W,1,22nd October, 1945.
