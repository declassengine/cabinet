(45) 210. - - , .. &apos;:;s ;J6th October, 1945. -NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES) BILL.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal. sfml1. The Social Services Committee at its meeting on the 1st October, 1945,was informed by the Minister of National Insurance that, following the publica-tion of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill, he had been informed by a deputation of the Trades Union Congress that unless improvements weremade in certain* features of the scheme, there would be strong opposition to. the&apos; Bill from certain quarters in the House. The Committee thereupon authorisedme to discuss the position further with the Trades Union Congress. Accordingly,I met the deputation on Thursday afternoon, 4th October, 1945. The LordChancellor, the Minister of Labour and National Service and the Minister ofNational Insurance were present.2. The representatives of the Trades Union Congress pressed very stronglytheir contention that the Bill should be amended on the two main points, namely,the rates of benefit and the provision for partially incapacitated pensionerswhose injury makes it impossible for them to return to their former employment.They were for some time unwilling to accept any lower benefits than those forwhich they had asked 55s. a week as injury benefit and 60s. for 100 per cent,disablement and were insistent that some provision should be made for the partial-incapacitated cases often referred to as &quot; engine-driver&apos;s eye&quot; or&quot; compositor&apos;s finger &quot; cases.3. It was clear that a concession on both points would be necessary if theBill is not to meet with strong opposition from the Government side. the compromise arrangement which we reached with the deputation, subject to theapproval of our colleagues, is, I feel, a satisfactory one in the circumstances.It provides : (a) for an increase in the basic rates of injury benefit and 100 per cent.disablement pension, namely, from 40s. a week to 45s. a week ineach case, with no change in the rates of dependants allowancesor death benefits (and with no suggestion for a corresponding revisionof the rates of sickness and unemployment benefit and retirement pension proposed under the main insurance scheme); and(b) for a provision on the lines that &apos;&apos; where a claimant can show that byreason of the injury he is no longer able to follow his previous occu-pation, he may apply to the local appeal tribunal for an additionalbenefit, and, if the tribunal are satisfied he may be paid furtherbenefit amounting to 25 per cent, of the basic rate of 45s. (for adults) &quot;.4. I am advised that with these concessions, the total contributions required from employers and insured persons will be 8d. for men and 6d. for women, ascompared with Id. for men and 5d. for women in the Bill, and 6d. for men and4:d. for women in the White Paper, Part II, of September 1944.5. As regards (a), it will, of course, be realised that there will be asubstantial number of cases where not only women, but also married men witha child or children, will qualify for benefit at a rate higher than their earnings,[30660]
and thus have a financial incentive to delay their return to work and remain onbenefit. I.see, however, no way of getting Sver^lni^dlffieillty. It would seemmost undesirable to introduce a provision that benefit should in no case exceedaverage weekly earnings.ssOK &quot;friigThe clause to give effect to (&amp;) will need careful consideration, and,* whatever its precise terms, it will no doubt come in for criticism, when introduced at the Committee Stage.   The following points in particular will, I think, need to be borne in mind : (i) the additional benefit should be payable only when the disablementpensioner is permanently unable, as a result of his injury, to resumehis former occupation;(ii) the additional benefit would be abated where the full amount would bring the total benefit over the 100 per cent, rate;(iii) to secure a reasonable measure of uniformity it will be essential thatthe decision of. the tribunals should be subject to appeal to theCommissioner.7. I ask my colleagues to approve an announcement of concessions on theselines during the course of the Second Reading Debate on the 10th and11th October..zm a. g.bop: Gwydyr House, S. W. 1,%th October, 1945.
