(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret,(5,4)227 COPY NOcJ2-2^8TH JULY. 1954CABINETSOUTH-EAST ASIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs at Washington we achieved the broad objectives setforth in paragraph 4 of my memorandum 0o(54)207.   we agreed:(a) to inform the French of the type of armisticeagreement for Indo-China which our twoGovernments would be willing to respect;   and(b) to set -up a study group to work out:(i)    the terms on which other governments might associate themselves with such an armistice agreement;    and(ii)    the terms of a collective security pactfor South-East Asia whether or not anagreement is reached on Indo GhinaaA copy of the agreement on (a) is attached,, The agreement on (d) was circulated as C*(54)225o2*     The concluding phase at Geneva will be a critical one9The military committees which were to work out armistice terms for each of the three Associate States and to report back to the Conference by 10th July have not yet finishedtheir work and seem to have made little progress.   As theFrench position in Indo-China deteriorates further and theend of Mr0 Mendes-Francefs 30-day period approaches, the communists are likely to hold out for tough, terras^   Wemust give Me Mendes-France all the help we can to reach an adequate settlement,,3o     If an agreement is reached which meets the terms &quot;which,the Americans and ourselves have said we will respect, thenno serious difficulties will arise,,    Those terms embody theessential safeguards.   But the French will be lucky, to securesuch an agreement and we. should be wise on. our part to maintainsome flexibility^   Neither we nor the Americans have definedwhat our attitude will be if the French wish to settle on termsmarkedly more unfavourably    But the Americans claim that theterms we have^agreed represent for them the minimum tests thatan agreement must pass, if they are to give a public pledge to respect it,.
mlu     Our first aim at Geneva must be to ensure that, whateveragreement is reached, it is one that the Americans willrespect,,    I would propose to use my influence with allconcerned to that end,,5c     If this aim cannot he achieved we may he faced with either of two possible situations:(a) the French conclude an agreement which the americans are unwilling to respect, or(b) no agreement is reached^Either of these situation would place us in greatdifficulty and I might at that stage have to consult mycolleagues again.    It would in principle be undesirable forus to he associated with any agreement over Indo-China fromwhich the Americans dissociated themselves    on the otherhand, if the agreement was one which seemed to us not unreasonable and the Colombo Powers were prepared to underwrite it, we might have to think again.    The actionto he taken if no agreement is reached is to he examinedhy the Anglo-American study group now at work in Washington.A0E0Foreign Office, S.W.1.8TH JULY, 195k*
