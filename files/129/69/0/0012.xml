The Governor is convinced, and I agree, that this is part ofa sustained campaign to undermine our authority and lower our prestigethroughout the Protectorate and to prevent our consolidating the borderareas.    The current attempts may be designed to forestall the consolidation which will come about if the Governor succeeds in persuading the Rulers to federate.3. At the moment two rebellions stirred up by the Yemeni have succeeded in tying up all our available security forces.     One set ofrebels, the Rabizi, are operating within our territory where air action has some chance of proving effective.     The other, the Dammani, areraiding continuously from their sanctuary in the frontier village of as Soma in the Yemen and making intolerable the position of the AudhaliSultan.    He is the most loyal of all the Protectorate Rulers and has expressed himself strongly about our apparent inability to protect hisdomain.    We have not the ground forces to prevent these raids, and effective air action is difficult if confined to our own territory:  targetsare fleeting and scattered and it is hard to tell friend from foe.4. After 15 or more Dammani raids in 6 weeks in February and march, the Governor asked that the Yemen Government be warned that, ifraids continued to be staged from As Soma, we should have to stop themourselves.    He further proposed that if, after 48 hours notice, the warning had not been heeded we should, after due warning to theinhabitants, bomb the property of the chief troublemaker in As Soma.I shared his conviction that this would end the trouble, but I did not atthe time feel able to urge this drastic course on my colleagues untilalternatives had been pursued.      I asked the Governor to examine howfar defensive measures on the ground could be made effective, aided by air action within our borders;  and with Foreign Office assent Iauthorised &quot;hot pursuit&quot; into Yemen territory of raiders caught red-handed.5. The Governor has recommended an increase in the strengthof the Government Guards; he tells me that the Air Officer Commandinghas also recommended the h,qb, M0E0A,F. to increase the ProtectorateSo,-1-
Levies (which the Air Ministry control);  further plans are being worked out urgently to raise rapidly the local auxiliary forces, and a requestis likely for a substantial supply of rifles and ammunition to be flownout for issue through the Rulers to tribesmen of proved loyalty.    TheGovernor, who is returning to Aden on 1st July, is to discuss these andother possible measures with Treasury, Air Ministry, Foreign Officeand Colonial Office officials on 29th June.6. But all this will take time and the Acting Governor has now reported a turn for the worse which makes it urgent to take action.There were 28 attacks of one sort or another between 1st and 24th May(some of which may have been by Rabizi); Aden Territory was raidedfrom As Soma on 20th - 23rd May, when we counter-attacked withoutcrossing the border.    Our Audhali tribesmen, unfortunately butunderstandably in view of weeks of provocation, attacked Beidha in Yementerritory on 5th June on their own initiative;  Yemeni raiders attackedMukeiras on 10th June and were chased back over the frontier;  and on18th June a serious attack was made on Marta&apos;s (the target for manyearlier raids) by 80 regular Yemeni troops and 400 tribal regulars.Fighting lasted all day with casualties on both sides.7. This heavy and exclusively Yemeni incursion, coupled witha number of reports received in the last few weeks that the YemenGovernment is mustering large regular and irregular forces in Beidha,gives me serious concern.    Apart from two squadrons of the R,A.F0Regiment, which are needed in Aden Colony and should not be movedexcept for short periods in extreme emergency, there are available tomeet this threat without prejudice to other current operations some 150assorted men, one machine gun and one 2&quot; mortar.    All the forces inthe area have been under severe and prolonged strain.    The identifi-cation difficulty hamstrings air action within our borders.8. The Acting Governor has therefore urgently renewed theGovernor!s earlier request that the Yemen Government be now warned that any further acts of aggression will be met by air action against the bases within Yemen territory from which Yemen attacks are launched.Suitable targets such as barracks can be found on the outskirts of as Soma and Beidha.    He warns me that failure to demonstrate to thepeople of the Protectorate our determination and ability to take effective action in their support can only lead to a growing lack ofconfidence in us.    The consequences are unpredictable and may well lead to a request for outside assistance.9. Air action on Yemen territory will naturally raise an outcryin which Egypt will join (my colleagues may have read in the Press thatMajor Salah Salem is to visit the Yemen on 10th July to look into theircomplaints against us).    No doubt our facts will be disputed, the counter-raid by the Audhalis will be exploited and, since we do not always manage to control rebels within our own borders, the Yemeniswill protest, as they have done already, that they cannot control theDammani either.    But, as at present advised, I am convinced that theaction proposed is the only course open and that it will have a salutary effect both in discouraging our neighbours and, above all, in hearteningour now doubting and despondent friends.10. I have considered whether there is any gesture of conciliation with which we can accompany a show of firmness.    We are due under the 1934 treaty to negotiate a settlement of the whole frontierproblem some time before 1974, but this is clearly not the moment to start.    We have repeatedly offered to go ahead with the Boundary
Commission which we agreed in 1951 should investigate three limitedareas where the status quo line agreed in 1934 is in dispute;  and this offer could be repeated.    We should not, I think, suggest reference toany international body, nor should we invite &quot;neutral&quot; frontierobservers on the Israel-Kashmir model - for the Egyptians would quicklymanage to get involved.    We might suggest talks between high-levelofficers of both sides and I have asked the Acting Governor to telegraphhis view on this.    But the British Agent has been doing this for years;his opposite number, the Amil of Beidha, is incorrigible and is in fact the main instigator of the raids;   I am not hopeful that much would comeof it.11. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should give the acting Governor the sanction which he seeks - on the understandingthat there would be due warning to the inhabitants before any bombingtook place of a particular target.G.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.28th June, 1954.
