(this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)secret.(54) 207fi&amp;GQnD COPY     copy no.22nd June, 1954CABINETthe geneva conference and the washington talksAfter eight weeks the end of the first stage has been reached at Geneva.    As expected, no agreement was reached about Korea andthis part of the Conference has been concluded.    But agreements havebeen reached on Indo-China enabling military talks to take place abouta cessation of hostilities in each of the three States.    We have won oneof our main points, which was to establish that Laos and Cambodia mustbe treated differently from Vietnam.2. M. Mendes-France can now try to achieve a truce in direct negotiation.    If he plays the hand well, he has a chance of getting asettlement amounting to the partition of Vietnam and the neutralisationof Laos and Cambodia, with perhaps a Communist zone of some kindin Northern Laos.3. I think the Russians and the Chinese want a settlement.But they may have difficulty in restraining the Vietminh who are in aposition to demand a high price.    It may prove even more difficult to persuade the Americans to accept whatever settlement can eventually be reached.4. So far as the visit to Washington is concerned, I see our taskas being the following(a) We must persuade the Americans to give the Frenchat least a chance of reaching a settlement in thenext few weeks.(b) We must continue to make it clear that we cannotconsider intervening in Indo-China and we must do our best to restrain the Americans from doing so.    We can stress that our main role is in malaya.(c) We must again make it plain that we can acceptno further commitments in regard to &quot;unitedaction&quot; in South-East Asia until the outcome of Geneva is known.Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs
(d) But we can express willingness to examine atonce and in secret how best we can proceedto strengthen our common defences.(e) We should discuss how the principal Asianpowers in that area can best be associatedwith this work.(f) But we should not agree, before Geneva is over,to any wider and more publicised meeting,at which Siam and the Philippines would bethe only Asian coimtries present, to plan and proclaim an anti-Communist alliance.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.21st June, 1954.
