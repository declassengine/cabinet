(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 239. COPY NO.19th July, 1954CABINETCRICHEL DOWNNote by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesI attach for the information of my colleagues the sectionfrom my speech for tlie debate on Crichel Down relating to the reportof the Woods Committee.T.L.D.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,S.W.1.17th July, 1954.
2&amp;oREPORT OF WOODS COMMITTEE ON TRANSFERS29.        However there remains the question what action may benecessary in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of departments.    The Government have thought it right that the need forany such action should be further reviewed.    My right hon. Friend thePrime Minister has therefore arranged for this aspect of the matter tobe swiftly reviewed by a small advisory committee of experienced personswho have now completed this task and presented a report.    Thiscommittee were asked to consider whether, in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of Departments, any of the officers whoseconduct was called in question in Sir Andrew Clark&apos;s Report should betransferred from their existing duties to other posts.    They were askedto take into account both the public interest and the efficiency of thePublic Service and fair treatment of the individuals concerned.    Theywere not, inany sense,asked to review Sir Andrew Clark&apos;s findings.30.        The committee consisted of Sir John Woods, a formerPermanent Secretary of the Board of Trade and now a director of theEnglish Electric Company and other companies, Sir Maurice Holmes, a former Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, andSir Harry Pilkington.31.        The report of the committee is now available in the Vote Office.But it may be convenient if I indicate briefly its substance.    Thecommittee state that there are five Civil Servants whose actions arecriticised with varying degrees of severity in Sir Andrew Clark&apos;s Report.Having studied the Report, having read the observations submitted to theMinister by these five officers and having interviewed them, they reachedthe conclusion in the case of Mr. Eastwood, the Permanent commissioner of Crown Lands, that his usefulness as a public servant would be impaired if he were to remain in his present post.    They recommendtherefore that he should be transferred to other duties.    Three of thefour other officers involved are not now employed on the work on whichthey were engaged when dealing with the Crichel Down case, and thecommittee recommend no action in regard to them.32.        I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the three membersof this committee for undertaking so swiftly the task of familiarisingthemselves with the details of this matter and for tendering their considered advice as to the action which should be taken.    The Govern-ment fully accept this advice and will take early steps to give effectto it.    They are confident that Parliament and the public, as well asthe Civil Service, will accept the review by this committee of experiencedand impartial persons as disposing of this aspect of the matter in a proper and fair manner.
