(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 221 COPY NO.6th July, 1954CABINETFUTURE OF THE AGRICULTURAL LAND commission memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesConstitutionThe Agricultural Land Commission was established under the agriculture Act, 1947.     It consists of a Chairman and four members (allappointed by the Minister), including an experienced private landowner, agood practical farmer and a highly-qualified land agent and valuer.2.        It has two main functions:-(a) the management and farming of land vested in theMinister and placed under its control;  and(b) advising and assisting the Minister in matters relating to the management of agricultural land.For Wales and Monmouthshire these functions have been delegated to the welsh Agricultural Land Sub-Commis sion.3.     . The Commission may not buy or sell land.    These powers arereserved to the Minister.    But, subject to financial control, it carries out its management functions as an independent body.Management and Farming4.        The Commission manages some 227,000 acres of land.     this includes land originally acquired in connection with afforestation (some90,000 acres);  disused airfields (about 26,000 acres);  land accepted in lieu of death duties (about 40,000 acres);  and land previously requisitionedand later acquired to ensure efficient agricultural use (about 29,000 acres).Nearly all the Commission^ land is let to tenants.    It is the Commission^policy not to farm land direct except as a temporary expedient.5.        Most of the Commission^ land is poor with an average rentalvalue well below the general average for England and Wales.    TheCommission is responsible for bringing the land into a state of efficientagricultural management.    It has had to spend large sums on the repair,improvement and provision of fixed equipment.    In consequence itsaccounts have inevitably shown a loss.    During its first five years thenet loss (before charging interest on capital) has amounted to some 70,000 on its management and farming activities.
6.        I consider the Commission is fulfilling a useful function in bringing into a satisfactory state of management land which has been handed over toit for that purpose; and in continuing to manage State-owned agricultural land which, for one reason or another, it would be difficult to sell back intoprivate ownership (e. g. agricultural land inter-mixed with forestry commission properties, and disused airfields).7.        But under the previous Government the conception of theCommission was that it should retain the management of properties even after these had been put into a satisfactory state and could be sold.    Thisis contrary to our philosophy.    I therefore decided last year that, whereland has been put into a satisfactory state of management and can suitablybe sold into private ownership, this should be done.     I am proposing to announce this in the debate.8.        It was not possible to make a start on this policy until a decision was reached and announced on the question of disposal of land to former owners.    But a good deal of preparatory work has been done.    TheCommission has supplied lists of properties suitable for sale, and I amalready making arrangements for the sale of some 35 properties,comprising some 9,000 acres of land and with an estimated book valueof  390,000.9.        A good deal of the land must remain under the management of theCommission because it is not suitable for sale into private ownership;  andother land must remain with it for some time because work still has to bedone before I could sell it without incurring the criticism that I was notfulfilling the rules of good estate management with which I expect privatelandowners to comply.    But I shall press on with the policy of sale as soonas possible in all suitable cases.10.       I should draw the jSttention of my colleagues to the fact that theprice realised on sale will normally be considerably less than the cost of buying and improving a property.    This is partly because agricultural landvalues have fallen in recent years, and partly because it is impossible torealise on sale the full cost of improving agricultural property.    Moreover,the sale of the improved properties is likely to cause a bigger loss in theCommission&apos;^ accounts, since the Commission will be left with the poorerproperties on which money still needs to be spent to bring them into asatisfactory state of management.Advisory Functions11. In addition, I consider that the Commission still has a usefulfunction to perform on the advisory side.    Although I do not propose infuture to ask the Commission to consider possible cases for acquisition bythe State, it can perform a very useful task in surveying problem areas and making recommendations on what, if anything, can be done to improveconditions in those areas.    For example, the Welsh Sub-Commission isnow engaged on a survey of a large area in mid-Wales.    This was announced in the White Paper on Rural Wales (Command 9014) issued inNovember, 1953.    The main Commission is engaged on a similar survey of an area in the Somerset Moors.    Impartial surveys of this kind areof great value.
T.L.D.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,S.W.I.6th July, 1954.12. To sum up, I consider that the Commission is fulfilling a usefulfunction in -(a) bringing into a satisfactory state of management land which has been handed over to it for that purpose, and continuing to manage State-owned agricultural land thatwould not be suitable for sale back into private owner -ship;  and(b) surveying and reporting on &quot;problem&quot; agriculturalareas.
