The following (see my immediately following telegram) has been agreed after intense consultation.Advantage of this declaration of Anglo-American unity outweighs, in our opinion,the inevitable difficulties of defining, by general principles, the infinitely variedworld conditions. We consider that these difficulties have been solved in the best possible way. Following the precedent of the Atlantic Charter, we are referringthis document for Cabinet approval and we earnestly trust that our colleagues willrealize the difficulty of making amendments at this stage except for what they feelare the gravest reasons.Plan is to publish to-day a statement of immediate policy on certain aspects ofour discussions and reserve this declaration till 4-30 p.m. B.S.T. to-morrow,June 29, in order to mark its exceptional distinction.Telegram No. 1307 from Washington to Foreign Office dated 28th June, 1954My immediately preceding telegram.Following is the text of proposed declaration by the President and myself:  As we terminate these days of friendly and fruitful conversations on subjects of mutual and world interest, we again declare that:  (1) In intimate comradeship, we will continue our united efforts to secure world peace based upon the principles of the Atlantic Charter which, in so faras they are still applicable, we reaffirm.(2) We, together and&quot; individually, continue to hold out the hand of friendship to any and all nations, which by solemn pledge andconfirming deeds show themselves desirous of participating in a just and fair peace.(3) We uphold the right of self-determination and will earnestly strive by every peaceful means to secure the independence of all countries whosepeoples desire and are capable of sustaining self-government and independent existence. We welcome the processes of development,where still needed, that lead toward that goal. We will not be a partyto any arrangement or treaty which would indefinitely hold any
formely sovereign state in bondage, or unwilling subordination. In thecase of nations now divided against their will, we shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the united nations to ensure they are conducted fairly.(4) We believe that the cause of world peace would be advanced by generaland drastic reduction under effective safeguards of world armaments ofall classes and kinds.(5) We will continue our support of the United Nations and of existing inter-national organisations that have been established in the spirit of the charter for common protection and security. We urge the establish-ment and maintenance of such associations of appropriate nations aswill best, in their respective regions, preserve the peace and the indepen-dence of the peoples living there. When desired by the citizens of theaffected countries we are ready to render appropriate and feasibleassistance to such associations.(6) We shall, with our friends, develop and maintain the spiritual, economicand military strength necessary to pursue these purposes effectively. in pursuit of this purpose we will seek every means of promoting the fullerand freer interchange among us of goods and services which will benefit all participants.Telegram No. 3064 from Foreign Office to Washington dated 29th June, 1954Your telegram No. 1306.Following for Prime Minister from Chancellor of the Exchequer:  The Cabinet were most grateful for the opportunity to comment on the pro-posed declaration. They warmly congratulate you upon the success of your visit.Yesterday&apos;s statement has been well received over here.We have only one point of substance on the proposed Declaration. We are seriously concerned about paragraph 3 and in particular about its first sentence.We assume that this paragraph is mainly aimed at the Satellites but it may also havegrave repercussions for the British Empire. You will remember that the sametrouble arose over the Atlantic Charter and that your speech in the House ofCommons on September 9, 1941, made it clear that even the more guarded words of the Charter did not apply to our Colonial Empire. We have consistently refusedto acknowledge anything so vague as a &quot; right of self-determination.&quot; ThisWilsonian doctrine has caused enough trouble in its time and we would not have thought that a Republican Administration would insist upon it. Even PresidentWilson qualified it in his speech to Congress on February 11, 1918. Paragraph 3of the Atlantic Charter was much more guarded and so was Article 1 (2) of the charter of the United Nations. If this right is conceded will it not apply to anyseparatist movement anywhere? Will it not embarrass us in Cyprus? And whatof the position which we have so strenuously maintained at the United nations with regard to Colonial territories ? Its effect in North Africa just at this momentwould surely be serious. For all these reasons we think it most important thatthe Declaration should not contain the words &quot; uphold the right of self-determina-tion.&quot; We recognise that it may be difficult at this stage to propose a mere deletion.If so, the first sentence of this paragraph might be amended to read: &quot; We upholdthe principles of self-government and will earnestly strive by every peaceful means to secure the independence of all countries whose peoples desire and are capableof sustaining an independent existence.&quot;Telephone Message from Washington dated 29th June, 1954Personal for Chancellor of Exchequer from Prime Minister.All your amendments and suggestions accepted. Please thank our colleaguerfor their prompt and helpful reply.
