SECRET Copy.No..C. (54) 24622nd July, 1954CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1954-55 session memorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductionThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 5th May, 1954 (C.C. (54) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 5), appointed a Committee under my chairmanship to consider, in the lightof the Cabinefs discussion, the provisional legislative programme for the next session set out in my memorandum C. (54) 157, and make recommendations thereonto the Cabinet.   I report, on the Committee&apos;s behalf, accordingly.Approach to the programme . The Committee agreed to base their recommendations to the Cabinet onthe working hypothesis that the next session would be the last session of the present parliament. They recognised the consequent need to relax so far as possible, in thenext session the Parliamentary pressure to which Government supporters in theHouse of Commons have been continuously subject since the present government took office, and the likelihood that, for this and other reasons, the time availablefor legislation would be more limited than in some recent sessions. They were,therefore, convinced of their importance of ensuring that the programme for next session should not become overloaded.3. The Committee considered Departments&apos; proposals for legislation on thebasis of the lists of Bills annexed to C. (54) 157. They agreed upon some recastingand amendment of these lists which have been revised accordingly. Revised listsA to H are annexed to this memorandum.Proposed programme. The Committee inclined to the view that the programme ought probably to comprise four main elements, in the following order of priority:  (1) Essential Bills.(2) Economy Bills.(3) Bills to enable emergency powers to be dispensed with.(4) An essential minimum of social welfare and other useful Bills.Each of these proposed elements of the programme is discussed in detail below.Essential Bills5. So far as can be foreseen at present, all the Bills included in List A willdefinitely need to be passed during next session. The Chancellor of theExchequer has, however, undertaken to explore all possible administrative meansof avoiding the necessity to legislate on so controversial a subject as the emolu-ments of the Governor of Northern Ireland. In addition, at least some of the bills included in part (i) of List B are also likely to become unavoidable.Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1954
Economy Bills6. The Committee on Civil Expenditure have now reported to the Cabinet,in paragraph 18 of C. (54) 232, that, of the economy measures which they have recommended to the Cabinet, legislation would be needed for changing the basisof rural water and sewerage grants, and the amortisation period of pre-fabricatedhouses (these two possibly being covered in a single Bill), and for the impositionof a levy on flour. The necessary Bills for these purposes have accordingly been included in part (ii) of List B annexed hereto.Bills to enable Emergency Powers to be dispensed with7. The Cabinet, at their meeting on 5th May already referred to, also invited the Home Secretary to arrange for his Committee on Emergency Legislation to investigate the possibility of dispensing altogether with emergency powers beforethe end of the present Parliament, and to report to the Cabinet. The HomeSecretary has now reported accordingly in C. (54) 247.8. The Home Secretary&apos;s report shows that, to complete the process ofdispensing with these powers, it would be necessary to pass next session, apart fromthe two Food and Drugs Bills which may fail to pass this session, some seven otherBills, of which particulars are given in List C attached. The case for proceeding with such a project must be judged on the basis of the Home Secretary&apos;s report.Suffice it to say here that, if the project should be embarked upon, there will clearly be time for no other legislation apart from essential Bills (i.e., Bills in Lists A and B,and possibly one or two unexpected Bills for which a compelling case can be madeat the time). Indeed, it might be unwise to assume that, even on that assumption,all the Bills included in List C could, in fact, be passed in the time likely to beavailable, but it would not seem necessary to rule out altogether on that accountan attempt to dispense with as many as possible of the remaining defence regulations in particular, Regulation 55.An Essential Minimum of Social Welfare and other Useful Measures9. It might appear from the immediately preceding paragraphs that, if theCabinet should approve an attempt to make possible in the next session theabandonment of all remaining emergency powers, there would be no room in theprogramme for any Bills falling in the above category. This, however, is not thecase for the reason that List A (Essential Bills) includes several measures of this character notably the Pensions and National Insurance Bill, which will on anyreckoning rank as the main item of social welfare legislation for next session.10. If the Cabinet should decide against embarking upon the general project of dispensing with all remaining emergency powers in the next session, there shouldbe room in the programme for some additional Bills apart from those in Lists Aand B and such proportion of the Bills in List C as may be agreed to be theessential minimum required to sustain the Government^ claim that it is pursuingits intention to dispense with emergency powers, wherever possible. For thispurpose a choice would have to be made from the Bills included in List D. Inparticular, an early decision would be necessary whether or not to proceed with a major Road Traffic Bill, which, if it were introduced, would clearly become a prominent feature of the programme.Other Bills11. Whatever may be the Cabinefs preference as between List C and List DBills, there will clearly be no time available for any of the Bills in Lists E and F,save possibly for a particular Bill for which a compelling case may arise at a later date and whose claim to introduction would then have to be considered on its strictmerits.Scottish Bills12. The list of proposed Scottish Bills List G is sub-divided into sections-(a) to (/)-to correspond with Lists A to F of United Kingdom Bills, and theviews expressed above in regard to the latter apply mutatis mutandis to the scottish bills in the corresponding sections of List G.
Bills suitable for private members.13. The Committee approved the annexed list of possible Private Members&apos;Bills List H-on the understanding that the Ministers concerned would seekapproval for the policy of such Bills in the normal way.Conclusions14.   The Cabinet are accordingly invited:  (i) to approve the inclusion in the programme of the Bills included in List Aand such of those in List B as may in due course prove to be necessary;(ii) to decide, in the light of the separate report by the Home Secretary(C. (54) 247), what proportion of the Bills included in List C shouldbe approved for inclusion;(iii) in the light of their decision under (ii) above, to decide whether any and,if so, which of the Bills included in List D should be included;(iv) to agree that, broadly speaking, time cannot be found for any of the bills included in Lists E and F;(v) to agree that the Scottish Bills in sections (a) to (/) of List G should be handled pari passu with the United Kingdom Bills in the correspondingLists A to F;(vi) to take note of the suggested Private Members&apos; Bills in List H.H.
