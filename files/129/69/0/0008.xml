Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1954CONFIDENTIAL CA R.    .       ,, . Copy. No.C. (54) 208 RECORD COPY25th June, 1954CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPE: DRAFT EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON the peaceful SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTESMemorandum by the Minister of state the ProblemA draft European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes (Annex)is under discussion by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. it contains provisions for Compulsory reference to the International Court of legal disputes between member States of the Council of Europe (Chapter I);Submission of non-legal disputes between Member States to a ConciliationCommission (Chapter II);Compulsory arbitration for non-legal disputes between Member States(Chapter III).Certain amendments to Chapter III have been proposed by the Swedes.background. The Convention was drawn up by a Committee of legal experts on whichthe United Kingdom was represented. The Committee of Ministers of the Councilof Europe ordered this Committee to be convened in May, 1951, following a recommendation by the Consultative Assembly in November, 1950. The initiativecame originally from the Irish. It will not however be possible to raise the partition issue under the Convention, since Article 29 expressly excludes disputesrelating to facts or situations prior to its entry into force.3. An earlier instrument of this kind was the General Act of Geneva of 1928,which covered the same ground. As the Act contains various references to theLeague of Nations and its organs, it is doubtful how far it is now operative. Ithas in fact been little used. Her Majesty&apos;s Government accepted all three chaptersof this Act in 1931, the deciding reason being a desire to produce an atmospherefavourable to the Disarmament Conference of that year. The then Opposition,including Mr. Eden, strongly opposed the arbitration chapter.Substance of Draft Convention4. Under the present Convention signatory States may accept Chapter I only,or Chapters I and II only, or all three Chapters. We must decide what attitudethe United Kingdom should adopt. The main problem concerns Chapter III(Arbitration).Chapter I (Submission of legal disputes to the International Court)5. We have already made a declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court in disputes with States accepting the same obligations,and it is in our general interest that as many States as possible should be brought
in. This chapter will allow States which are members of the Council of Europebut not of the United Nations (i.e., Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany andthe Irish Republic) to come under the Courfs jurisdiction on the same terms asUnited Nations members. It may also induce Greece and Iceland, two united nations members who have not yet accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of theCourt, to do so. This chapter is therefore acceptable to the United Kingdom andit would be to our advantage that it should be adopted.Chapter II (Conciliation for non-legal disputes)6. This Chapter is based on the corresponding portion of the General act of 1928, which the United Kingdom accepted. We have also agreed to conciliationprocedures in more recent instruments, notably the Brussels Treaty. Such pro-procedures are little more than a form of good offices and there is no obligation on either party to a dispute to accept any proposals for a settlement which the Concilia-tion Commission might make. The Colonial Office wish to exclude disputesconcerning colonial and dependent territories from the operation of this chapterand Chapter III). Providing this can be done (probably by a reservation underArticle 37), we can also accept this chapter.Chapter III (Arbitration for non-legal disputes)7. The text agreed by the experts provides for the compulsory submission to an Arbitral Tribunal of all non-legal disputes (except those subject to the limita-tions in Articles 28 and 29 (b)) which conciliation has failed to settle. Thealternative proposals (in which the Swedish Foreign Minister, M. Unden, has taken a marked personal interest) are designed to substitute for the limitations containedin Articles 28 and 29 (b) a system of political safeguards against unwelcome arbitra-tion proceedings, by providing for a prior appeal to the Committee of ministers of the Council of Europe on the question whether the dispute should go to arbitration or not.Arguments For and Against Accepting an Arbitration Chapter8. The arguments in favour of our accepting some form of arbitration chapterare:  ia) The effect on public opinion. It is desirable that we should at all timessupport the rule of law.(b) We accepted an arbitration chapter in the General Act of Geneva (subjectto certain reservations which could also be inserted into the presentConvention). We never suffered any embarrassment as a result.Indeed we cannot trace any instance of the arbitration chapter havingbeen invoked against us. Moreover we may still be liable to compulsory arbitration under this Act.9.   The arguments on the other side are:  (a) Our acceptance of the General Act in 1931 was influenced by our desireto assist the Disarmament Conference. There are not the same impel-ling political considerations now. It is unlikely that after this lapse of time the General Act will be invoked, even if it is still valid,(b) If we accept some form of arbitration chapter, it is difficult to exclude thepossibility that we might have to submit some matter on which ourlegal rights were unquestionable to an Arbitral Tribunal, whosedecision would be based on equitable grounds. Though this may not give rise to difficulties in a strictly European context, it might afford an opening for pressure (e.g., at the United Nations) to make us do thesame in places where we must rely upon our strictly legal rights(e.g., Egypt, Persia, Gibraltar, Cyprus). In this respect, adherence toan arbitration chapter goes beyond the strict rule of law and indeedmight be said to tend to overthrow it.(c) We do not know what issues may come within the sphere of arbitration in the future; and the extent of our commitment under the chaptercannot therefore be foreseen.
Alternative Courses of Action10.   There are therefore two possible approaches to the arbitration chapter :  (i) to decide now not to accept it;(ii) to try to get sufficient safeguards written into Chapter III so as to make its final form acceptable to us.11. If we follow course (ii), we should support the Swedish proposal forprior appeal to the Committee of Ministers and try also to protect our position,where it is not possible to do so by amending Chapter III, by reservationsunder Article 37 as regards disputes affecting the following:  Domestic jurisdiction (if the present Article 29 (b) has been dropped).Questions which have been the subject of an international legal decision(if the qualification at the end of the present Article 28 has been dropped).Colonial and dependent territories.Territorial status, including territorial waters.Currency questions.Questions affecting national security.12. Course (ii) has the advantage that, even if we finally fail to get all we want and therefore have to reject Chapter III, our action will be easier to defendin Parliament.Conclusions13.   I therefore seek authority from the Cabinet:(a) to accept Chapter I in due course;(b) to accept Chapter II in due course, providing disputes affecting colonial and dependent territories can be excluded from its operation;(c) as regards Chapter III, to adopt course (ii) in paragraph 10 above and make further efforts to work out a suitable text incorporating(i) the Swedish proposal for prior reference to the Committee ofMinisters; and(ii) the safeguards proposed in paragraph 11;id) if we fail to get these safeguards, to decline to accept Chapter III.S.
