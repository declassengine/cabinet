Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1954SECRET Copy No.C. (54) 2152nd July, 1954CABINETROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationDisposal of the British Transport Commission^ road haulage assets has notprogressed as rapidly as might have been hoped and it is, I think, still too early to attempt any close estimate of the final outcome. But this is an opportune timeto take stock of the position.2. Subject to certain limitations set out in the Act, the Commission areentitled to retain some of these assets in the form of wholly-owned companies,and I have already given preliminary approval to their general proposals forretention. On this&apos; basis they will keep about 3,500 vehicles, as set out inAppendix A, with an appropriate quota of premises. This leaves about 32,500vehicles to be sold, together with a large number of garages, depots and other premises.3. By the end of June some 14,500 vehicles had been offered for sale in aseries of lists, and in respect of about 13,000 tenders had been received and decisions taken. The number sold was about 6,000, comprising 4,500 (or 73 percent.) of the vehicles offered without premises and 1,500 (or 18 per cent.) of thoseoffered with premises. More detailed figures are given in Appendix B.4. From the results so far it is quite clear that there is no general demandfor units with premises. (In the view of the Disposal Board the abortive butunavoidable attempt to sell premises as part of units has delayed the disposaloperation some three months.) The reason for this, the Disposal Board tell me,is that the overwhelming majority of purchases are made by people adding to existing fleets and not by people starting up anew. For the future, therefore,premises for which it has proved impossible to obtain a reasonable offer whenput up as part of a transport unit will be sold off separately and not with the vehicles. I have given my consent to this arrangement as required by the Act.Although fhis separate sale of premises may take some considerable time I do notthink it should present us with any serious problem, because their retention mean-while by the Commission does not affect other hauliers. The crux of the matterlies in the disposal of the vehicles.5. The response to List No. 4 revealed a falling-off, but that to List No. 5shows a recovery almost to the excellent standard of List No. 3. We cannot yet be certain, therefore, that the peak of the market to which these lists have been addressed, namely the small man, has passed. However, the Disposal Board areinclined to think that, while the market has not yet been exhausted, it retains nohidden possibilities,6. The Board base this view not merely upon the percentage of sales achieved in each list but upon analysis of the tenders (and the people making them) and upon their general experience of the operation so far as it has gone. The Board areinclined to think that there is insufficient capital at the disposal of the small investorto buy more than some 10,000 vehicles at prices which it would be reasonable forthe Board and the Commission to accept; while the large investor is deterred bothby the speculative nature of the industry and by the threat of re-nationalisation.46419
7. The Road Haulage Association are rather more optimistic, but their view is coloured by their claim that the Commission and the Disposal Board are settingtoo high a &quot;reserve &quot; price on the units and that many more vehicles would be soldif they would lower their sights. I have examined this criticism in discussion withthe Commission and the Board, and I am satisfied from the figures of the bidsoffered and accepted to date that no substantially, greater number of sales wouldhave been made unless the Board had been prepared to accept prices so low as tobe indefensible in relation to the &quot; reasonable price &quot;required by the Act. At thepresent stage, therefore, I do not think anything would be,gained by a deliberatepolicy of lowering the sights.8. I have also discussed with the Board and the Commission the following further suggestions as possible ways of making a positive effort to stimulatedisposals: the possibility of publishing &quot; reserve&quot; prices; the possibility of negotiating with bidders whose offers are nearly, but not quite, acceptable, insteadof merely rejecting the bid without trying to bridge the gap; the possibility of launching an active sales campaign.9. As to publishing &quot; reserve &quot; prices, the objection is that the Board do notin fact work on a system of &quot; reserve &quot; prices decided in advance. The only advancefigure available is the Commission^ combined valuation of the vehicle and the &quot; A &quot;Licence, but the Board have already scaled down this valuation very substantially inpractice, so that it could not be used as a &quot; reserve &quot; price. Starting from thisscaled-down valuation, the Board&apos;s practice is to decide what would be a reasonable price for a given unit in the light of the quality of the bidding for that unit or for similar ones, and of any other considerations which emerge when they examine alist of units and the tenders made for them. I agree with the Board that it wouldbe wrong to settle prices before seeing the bidding and that it is right that thebidding itself should be a major influence in deciding what prices are reasonable.10. The Board and the Commission agree with me that in certain cases itwould be helpful if they could negotiate with individual bidders, and they haverecently decided to go as far in this direction as they possibly can within the frame-work of the Act. However, there is a definite limit to what can be done in discus-sion with individual bidders, since the Act permits no negotiation over price,except in sales by the Company method, which is unsuitable for the small-manmarket. Although this sounds like a flaw in the Act, we must remember that therewould have been widespread criticism of any proposal to take a discretionary powerto negotiate privately.11. As regards the idea of launching a sales campaign, I have come to theconclusion that this is not a practical proposition, even if it were desirable. TheAct itself assumes that it will not be necessary to do more than publish advertise-ments of what is up for sale, and I think myself that anyone likely to be interestedis very well aware of what is being offered. This is also the view of the DisposalBoard, who do not think that opportunities of sale are being lost because possiblebuyers do not know what is going. The scope for anything in the nature of activesalesmanship would be restricted by the requirements of the Act as regards publictender, which rule out personal negotiations, and there seems no necessity for any large advertising campaign merely to stimulate public interest, since the subject isalready featured very prominently in all the trade journals, and the disposals pro-gramme gets plenty of support from representatives of the Road Haulage Associa-tion and other protagonists of de-nationalisation in public speeches and statements in the Press.12. 1 conclude, therefore, that the sales have been going as satisfactorily asthey could be made to go and that there are no further measures that can be taken for the immediate future to improve them. For the &quot; vehicles only &quot; units thestandard achieved so far (Lists Nos. 1-5 and Lists R.1 and R.2) is reasonably satisfactory (73 per cent/vehicles sold); but I think we must take warning from theDisposal Board&apos;s analysis of the shortage of interested capital and, despite thegood results of the last list (List No. 5), not count on selling more than 10,000vehicles as small units.13. The Board and the Commission can claim that everything has been done so far to meet the needs of the small man, and, while they will continue to look after his needs in future lists, they have announced that they are about to makefinal decisions about the grouping of larger units or companies with the larger
Jinvestor in mind (Board&apos;s Second Report, May, 1954, paragraph 29). From theinformation they have so far been able to glean they think it would be over-:optimistic to expect more than 7,000 vehicles to be sold in this way (including the4,000 vehicles in the present parcels service, the sale of which as a whole to asingle buyer would be desirable but is by no means certain), i .,, .14. On present indications therefore, some 15,000 vehicles will be left unsold.This would be a somewhat better result than what I foreshadowed as a possibilityin my paper T.P. 14 of 18th September, 1952, to the Committee on transport policy, in which 1 suggested that an even greater number might be left unsold.None the less, 15,000 is a large number, and if this is a true estimate of theposition, it will be necessary soon: or later perhaps in the autumn, by which time the situation will have become generally known to decide whether the vehicles are to be sold as chattels (i.e., without carrying any right to an &quot; A&quot;Licence) or whether they are to be left with the Commission for the time beingwhile steps are taken probably involving legislation, to deal with the situation.15. A possibility which has been suggested in some quarters is the formationof companies in which the Commission would retain a substantial interest up to50 per cent, and possibly supply the management. This could actually be donewithin the letter of the existing law if the Commission made a sale by the com-pany method and immediately brought back a substantial interest in the companyunder Section 2 of the Transport Act, 1947, but it would be quite contraryto the spirit and intention of the 1953 Act, which clearly stipulated that the shares in any company offered for disposal should be sold in toto as one parcel. while we should not close our minds to this possibility for the future I am sure thatany such operation would at present be strongly criticised as being entirely contraryto the original intentions of the Government, and I do not think we can entertainit for the time being.16. The upshot is, I suggest, that it is too early to come to any definite conclusions. I shall continue to keep the closest watch upon progress and will report again to my colleagues as soon as the position has crystallised sufficientlyfor me to put forward specific proposals for their consideration.A.
