(,-IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY*S GOVERNMENT)SECRETAjC.(54) 224 COPY NO. r-8th July, 1954CABINETTHREAT TO THE SECURITY OF THE ADEN PROTECTORATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesSince the Cabinet discussed C. (54) 212 on 1st July(CoC0(54) 45th Conclusions, Minute 2) I have had further discussion with theSecretary of State for Air, the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Chief of the Air Staff.2. The Foreign Office are arranging urgently for the despatch ofthe protest which the Cabinet decided should be sent to the Yemen Govern-ment.    This will probably take the form of a letter to the Yemen minister in London in reply to an oral message which he left with the Foreign Officelast week (see Annex).3. The letter will be published and the Foreign and ColonialOffices will concert suitable publicity measures to be taken as soon as the note has been delivered.4. The note will include acceptance of the Yemen Minister *suggestion that the frontier authorities on both sides should meet together,and the Governor of Aden is being invited to arrange immediately for hisrepresentatives to play their part.5. If, despite these measures, the raids continue, we agree thatfirm measures must be taken not excluding air action, over Yemen territory.The alternative of using ground forces, such as Commandos from the canal zone, which the Prime Minister asked the Minister of Defence to study,is being studied by the Chiefs of Staff to-day and their views should beavailable for the Cabinet on Thursday.6. If they should recommend that air action is preferable to groundaction, and if air action is authorised after consultation with the foreign secretary, we consider that it should take the form of deliberate action byprecision attack with rockets against specified targets after warning to theinhabitants 24 hours, and again 2 hours, in advance.    This is the methodrecommended by the Governor and normally employed against insurgentswithin Protectorate borders: according to the Governor it breeds no lastingresentment.    We have considered whether the extension into the air of the&quot;hot pursuit&quot; already authorised on the ground would be a possible alter-native but we do not think that it would be practicable.We prefer the deliberate course.    It would be less likely to leadto loss of life than &quot;hot pursuit&quot; and we believe that a deliberate step, therightness of which we had confidently proclaimed in advance, would alsobe easier to defend politically.-1-
7. We conclude that-ihe Governor should be told that if, after theprotest has been made and the talks between the frontier authorities havebeen initiated, raids continue and he is satisfied that further talks concerningthe frontier will be ineffective in stopping them, he may seek my authority(which I should not give without the agreement of the Foreign Secretary)forair action against military targets to be recommended by him at the time.O.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.7th July, 1954.ANNEXGist of oral message delivered to Foreign Office by Yemeni on1st July, 1954.(a)  That the Yemeni Government were sincerely anxiousto restore tranquillity on the frontier.    As they had saidbefore, the Dammanis were not in the Yemen but in Aden.If that sub-tribe had an assurance of better treatmentfrom the Aden authorities, perhaps the situation wouldbe easier all round.    Would it not be a good idea if the aden authorities arranged a truce for one year betweenthe Audhali Sultan and the Dammanis ?(b) That the Yemeni authorities on the frontier had been ordered to take no action except in self-defence.    TheBritish Charge&quot; d Affaires at Taiz had agreed that thefirst attack came from Aden; and the Yemeni Governmentwere positive that the last attack, on 18th June, had alsocome from the Aden side.    On that date, moreover, anR.A.F. aircraft had machine-gunned Yemeni barracks.(c) That the Yemeni Government agreed that the frontierauthorities on both sides should at once consult together.In respect of (c) above, the Yemeni Minister added the personal suggestion that the frontier authorities might themselves be&apos;ableto arrange the suggested truce between the Audhali Sultan and the Dammanis.
