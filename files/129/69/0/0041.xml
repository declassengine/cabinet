THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER-BRITANNIC MA TESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 241 COPY NO.19th July, 1954CABINETREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CIVIL expenditure memorandum by the Minister of food am sure that we should be making a grave mistake if weimposed a levy on flour as recommended in paragraph 7(i) of C. (54) 232.I see at least five weighty objections to it:-(a) It would be a new tax on a major food.(b) It would require complex and detailed legislation.(c) This legislation would be highly controversial and the levy would be shown up in Parliamentary debate for what it was: a device to tax food.(d) The proposal for a levy is based on a false analogy withthe pre-war situation: bread is now heavily subsidised;flour prices are high;  and the levy can only be sustained by rivetting the ramshackle bread subsidy more firmlyon the economy.    Paragraph 7(i) does not make clearthat the levy must be imposed on all flour, including thatwhich goes into the national loaf.    The cost of the lattermust, however, be offset (unless the price of bread is torise further) by letting the bread subsidy revert to the 40 millions mentioned in paragraph 7(h), thus giving anet yield of  8 millions mentioned in paragraph 7(i).(e) Any saving from this source that we regard as politicallypracticable can be secured more simply and directly by reducing the subsidy on bread.2. The Committee on Civil Expenditure required a total saving from my Department of the order of  23 millions.    I have already offered roughlythat amount but without the imposition of a new tax on food or the employ-ment of more officials to administer it.G.LL-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1.19th July, 1954.
