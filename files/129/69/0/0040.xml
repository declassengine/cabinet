secret.(54) 240 COpY no.17th July, 1954CABINETREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CIVIL. expenditure memorandum by the Minister of health in paragraphs 7(a), (b) and (c) of C. (54) 232, the Committee on civil expenditure make the following recommendations in relation to the national health Service:-(a) The expenditure on hospital capital account forecast for England and &quot;Wales for 1955/56 should bereduced by  6 millions, i.e. , from  16 millions to  10 millions.(b) The expenditure on hospital maintenance account fore-cast for 1955/56 should be reduced so as to allowonly  1 miHion for new developments for Englandand Wales, thereby saving  3 millions.(c) Patients should be required to pay Is. Od. for eachitem on a National Health Service prescriptionform instead of Is. Od. for each prescriptionform.    This would yield an annual saving of 5 miUions -  4^ millions for England and Wales.2.        The hospital service has long been starved of adequate capital development.    But, in view of the financial difficulties, I feel I mustreluctantly accept the proposed reduction in capital expenditure (1(a) above)for next year, without prejudice to later years.3.        It is not possible at this stage to arrive at firm conclusions aboutthe sum required on hospital maintenance account (1(b) above) for 1955/56.The hospital authorities1 own forecasts, which should enable a more   -informed assessment to be made of the amount required, will not bereceived until the end of November, 1954.    The points I must stress at thisstage are that next year we must not only meet the cost of certaininescapable increases, including those arising from developments and improvements introduced this year, but also -(i)   meet the net additional expenditure arising from payincrements and new distinction awards in 1955/56.This may well be of the order of   j million andmust, of course, be met;(ii)   meet the cost of bringing into use new buildingscompleted in 1955/56 and introducing otherurgently required developments and improve-ments - many of the improvements resultingsimply from progress in medical science and sobeing, for all practical purposes, also inescapable;
(iii)   make good some undesirable economies, such assevere and uneconomic cuts in buildingmaintenance which some hospital authoritieshave found it necessary to make this year inorder to keep within the restricted allocation.The  1 million suggested by the Committee would, as I understand,have to cover items (i) - (iii).    I have no doubt, however, that more than this will be required for these purposes.    How much more it is as yetimpossible to say; it will have to be settled after the usual examinationof the hospital authorities1 own forecasts submitted next November.    I shall,of course, be very ready to co-operate then in keeping the amount requiredto the minimum.4.        The difficulties about the proposed alteration in the prescriptioncharge (1(c) above) are almost entirely political.    I proposed a similaralteration last year, but it was rejected for the time being by the Cabineton 10th February, 1953, (C. C. (53) 8th Conclusions, Minute 3) on variousgrounds, including the decision to appoint the Guillebaud Committee on theCost of the National Health Service.    That Committee is, however, not likely to report much before the middle of 1955 and, if the saving has to bemade in the next financial year, a decision will have to be made without their recommendations.    If, despite this and the political difficulties, theCabinet now favour the alteration, no serious practical problems are fore-seen in giving effect to it.    The saving would begin to arise one month after the alteration was introduced; and before its introduction some preliminary discussions with the professions would be necessary.I. MiMinistry of Health, W. 1.16th July, 1954.
