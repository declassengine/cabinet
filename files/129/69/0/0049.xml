UNITED KINGDOM DEFENCE policy memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffI. IntroductionWe were invited by the Minister of Defence to review our defence policy inthe light of changes in the political and military spheres which have taken place during the last two years. We were instructed in particular to take into account the rapid development of weapons of war which has resulted from the applicationof new scientific knowledge, both in the Western nations and Soviet Russia, andthe need to reduce the present level of defence expenditure.II. Aim of United Kingdom policy . More than ever the aim of United Kingdom policy must be tc preventwar. To this end we must maintain and strengthen our position as a world Powerso that Her Majesty&apos;s Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counselsof the world. Certain new factors affecting this aim are discussed in succeedingparagraphs.III. Weapon developments the Hydrogen Bomb3. The world situation has been completely altered by recent progress in thedevelopment of nuclear weapons. The Americans have exploded a weaponapproximately 1,500 times more powerful than the &quot; nominal &quot; atomic bomb andwe have every reason to believe that they are now putting into production weapons of this order of power. There is no theoretical limit to the destructive power which can be achieved with the latest techniques.4. The biggest Russian explosion to date is estimated to be about 50 timesmore powerful than the &quot; nominal&quot; bomb, but the Russians are expected toimprove on this considerably in the near future. Although we believe them tobe well behind the Americans at present, we must reckon that within one or twoyears they will have weapons of devastating power, even by American standards.5. A provisional estimate of the effect of 10 bombs dropped one each on10 selected cities in the United Kingdom indicates that, if they are of 100 times&quot; nominal&quot; power, the death roll would be 5 millions, and, if 1,000 times&quot; nominal &quot; power, 12 millions. It is therefore clear that a country which can equipitself with the means of delivery needs only a comparatively small stockpile of suchweapons in order to be able to deliver a devastating attack on an enemy.6. Another factor of immense significance is that these weapons can now bemade with much smaller quantities of fissile materials than was originally thought.Thus the availability of fissile material is no longer a critical factor. The cost of producing these weapons should not be beyond our financial capabilities.Means of Delivery from a Land Base7. There are three possible means of delivering these weapons by air from aland base.(a) Manned aircraft.(b) Unmanned aircraft.(c) Ballistic rocket.The unmanned aircraft is likely to be much more vulnerable than the other two;and, although the United States have three types under development, we do notthink this means will be a primary method of delivery. For the other two,^ thequestion of range is critical and we therefore examine the cases of Russia vis-a-vis the United States and Russia vis-a-vis the United Kingdom separately.
2^0Russia vis-a-vis the United States8. The United States has at present the great advantage of the use of advanced bases in Allied countries. For purposes of attack, therefore, she is closer to Russia than Russia is to her. The following table shows the dates by which we estimate either side could launch an effective attack on the other.MethodManned aircraftBallistic rocketBy theUnited StatesNow1965By Russia19581970Russia vis-a-vis the United Kingdom9. Here Russia is in a better position since it is she who has the use of advanced bases in Eastern Germany and satellite countries.MethodManned aircraftBallistic rocketBy the United kingdom on present forecasts we could have X bombs by 1959 andY by 1960, if production were started nowNot before 1965By Russia19551960Other Means of Delivery10. (a) From aircraft carriers. The United States may develop the capacity to deliver these bombs from carrier-borne aircraft. The Russians have no aircraft carriers and show no sign of constructing any.(b) From submarines. It may be possible to develop ballistic rockets withhydrogen heads and with a limited range of about 400-500 miles for use fromsubmarines. The rockets could be developed by both the United States or Russiawithin the next few years but the operational problems of despatch from anunstable platform are very difficult and may require much longer for solution.(c) Clandestine methods. We consider it improbable that the Russians would use merchant ships for this purpose but we cannot ignore this possibility or the useof submarines. The explosion of one of these bombs in a submarine in the com-paratively shallow water of a port or harbour or their approaches would cover the surrounding district with radio-active material, cause heavy casualties and put thearea out of action for a considerable period.Defence11. The main danger is from the air. The effect of these weapons is sodevastating that no country could withstand the effect of more than a very fewexploding on or near their target. Their power is so great that errors of even three miles are not particularly significant, against which guns are valueless and even thecapabilities of fighter aircraft and guided missiles will be limited. In theory, itmight be possible to develop, during the next ten years, an air defence system whichwould destroy a very high percentage of attacks by manned aircraft. It would consist of large numbers of supersonic fighters armed with air-to-air guided weapons supported by, and possibly eventually superseded by, long- and short-range ground-to-air guided missiles; the whole depending on a much elaboratedControl and Reporting system. It is however unlikely for practical reasons that even a project of this magnitude and great cost could give the complete protectionnecessary against these weapons. Furthermore, except for the Control and Reportingcomponent, the system would be valueless when the ballistic rocket threat develops,and even this component would itself be of no use until a method of active defence against the ballistic rocket had been developed.   No such method is yet in sight.Russian Air Defence12. It is some consolation that Russia&apos;s air defence problem is even lesshopeful of solution than our own. The advantage which she derives from herability to disperse industry is off-set by the corresponding need to disperse thedefence forces available to protect that industry. Her long frontiers and enormousareas of undeveloped territory make the provision of complete radar cover,backed by adequate defences, a formidable problem.   There is no reason to
suppose that for many years to come the Soviet air defence system will be able toprevent jet bombers making shallow penetration raids by day and deep penetrationraids by night, with relative immunity.Smaller Nuclear Weapons13. The United States have developed a large variety of weapons involvingsmaller nuclear components which have important applications in all types of operations. We must presume that Russia has done the same but the stockpile ofthe Western Powers must be much greater than that of Russia and would go someway towards redressing the balance of numerical superiority which the Soviet land forces will always enjoy.14. A weapon of the V-l type with a small nuclear head could be developedwithin the next few years. It is conceivable that Russia might use submarines tomake sporadic attacks on cities on the American seaboard with such weapons.Other Weapon Developments15. Important new developments are in prospect in such fields as aircraft,guided weapons and electronics: but, except in so far as they are concerned withthe delivery of the hydrogen weapon, their effects v/ili not be relatively significant.Deductions16. (a) Short of sacrificing our vital interests or principles, we must goeverything possible to prevent global war which would inevitably entail theexposure of the United Kingdom to a devastating nuclear bombardment.(b) The abiiity to wage war with the most up-to-date nuclear weapons willbe the measure of military power in the future.\c) Our scientific skill and technological capacity to produce the hydrogenweapon puts within our grasp the ability to be on terms with the United Statesand Russia.IV. Likely Form of a Future Global WarPossible Restrictions on Nuclear Warfare17. We have given much thought to the highly speculative question whether,if global warfare should break out, there might initially be mutually acceptablerestrictions on the use of nuclear weapons. We have come to the conclusion that,if war came in the next few years, the United States would insist on the immediateuse of the full armoury of nuclear weapons with the object of dealing the Russiansa quick knock-out blow. We must therefore plan on the assumption that, if warbecomes global, nuclear bombardment will become general.The Threat to the United Kingdom18. The Russians will, we believe, appreciate that, apart from its importance as a strategic base, the United Kingdom is the major political target in western europe; and that the extinction of the United Kingdom would quickly lead to the disintegration of Western Europe and the break-up of the Commonwealth andwould greatly strengthen the Soviet position in any negotiations which they might hope to open with the United States. We therefore consider that, whatever theRussians&apos; ability to attack the United States and for the next few years they arenot likely to be able to deliver more than sporadic attacks the United kingdom will be the primary military target for initial attack in any future war, and will be subjected to devastating attack by a large part of the Russian bomber efforttogether with any ground-to-ground missile capacity which she may possess.19. Our defence system within the foreseeable future will not be able toprovide the complete protection necessary against air attack employing weapons of mass destruction. Though we can count on the allied strategic air forces being able to strike an immediate and crippling blow at the sources of attack and centres of control, we cannot be certain that this counter-offensive would be in time. Thus,if war did break out, we should have to expect that the United Kingdom would bedevastated in the opening days to such an extent that it could no longer functionas a main support area. Indeed, the real problem might well be one of merephysical survival.
V. Likelihood of War22. Soviet Russia and China are at present employing the technique ofsubversion, backed by supply of arms and financial aid, as opposed to overt attackor invasion. They are being successful in this, and we believe that they are liikelyto continue to aim at extending the Communist sphere of influence by infiltrationand disruption of the existing Governments of free countries. None the less, thedanger of war remains because the fundamental aims of both sides are in conflict.23. After examination of the intelligence material available, we have reachedthe following conclusions:  (a) Russia is most unlikely to provoke war deliberately during the next fewyears, when the United States will be comparatively immune fromRussian attack.(b) The danger the United States might succumb to the temptation of pre-cipitating a &quot; forestalling &quot; war cannot be disregarded. In view of the vulnerability of the United Kingdom we must use all our influence toprevent this.(c) Careful judgment and restraint on the part of the Allies on a united basiswill be needed to avoid the outbreak of a global war through accidentor miscalculation resulting from an incident which precipitated or extended a local war.(d) A possible danger is that China might reach a position where it would bedifficult for her not to resist by force pressures resulting from UnitedStates policy. Such circumstances might lead to a local situation whichmight in turn lead to global war.(e) Even when the Russians are able to attack North America effectively, the ability of the United States to deliver a crippling attack on Russia willremain a powerful deterrent to the Soviet Government.(/) It is most probable that the present state of &quot; cold war &quot; will continue fora long time with periods of greater or less tension.24. Our general conclusion is that, provided the Allies maintain their unity and military strength, global war is unlikely and should be avoidable particularlyduring the period of United States superiority. Therefore, in considering changes which might be made in our defence effort, we would be more justified in takingrisks during the next four or five years, than at a later period. This means thatduring the next four or five years, the military means to exert our influence as a world power and to meet our &quot; cold war &quot; commitments must take priority overpreparations for global war, wherever they conflict.Progress of Global War20. We can expect that, concurrently with strategic air operations, majorattacks will be made by Soviet naval, land and amphibious forces, supported by part of the Soviet nuclear potential, against Western Europe and our sea com-munications. We must also expect offensive campaigns in other theatres. Anattack by Russia against Western Europe would entail preparatory moves whichshould be detectable and thus afford us some period of warning. The scale and progress of these offensive operations will depend on how quickly the Alliedstrategic air forces could bring the full effect of their offensive to bear.Deductions21. (a) If war becomes global, the employment of nuclear weapons willbecome general.(b) It is of the utmost importance to the United Kingdom that the Alliedstrategic air forces should be capable of hitting back immediately without any limitation on targets or weapons.(c) We must be prepared for the United Kingdom to receive such damage from nuclear bombardment in the opening days of a war that it cannot continue to function as a main support area. Our policy for the organisation, equipment andmaintenance of our forces overseas and the provision of material reserves at homeshould be adjusted accordingly. Equally we must review our present plans for theorganisation, equipment and employment of our reserve forces.
VI. United Kingdom Strategic Policy25. All that has been said leads to the over-riding conclusion that, short ofsacrificing our ,vital interests or principles, our first aim must be to prevent globalwar. We must therefore strengthen our position and influence as a world powerand maintain our alliance with the United States. To that end the objectives ofour strategic policy should be:  (a)-To possess the means of waging war with the most up-to-date nucleari , weapons.      ,.(b) To play our part with the Commonwealth and our Allies in stopping andturning back the spread of Communism.(c) To preserve security and to develop stable government in our colonial territories and overseas dependencies and to support our world-widetrade interests.In the ensuing paragraphs we examine the minimum requirements which are involved.Contribution to the Deterrent26. Nuclear. The nuclear threat is the main deterrent to war. Moreover,an immediate and overwhelming counter-offensive with the most powerful nuciearweapons offers the only hope of preventing the enemy from completely devastatingthis country. We must contribute to the deterrent by producing a stockpile of nuclear, including hydrogen, weapons and the means of delivering them.27. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The maintenance of thepolitical unity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and theprovision of a shield of land and air forces in Western Europe and of naval forces for the protection of Allied sea communications is an essential complement to themain deterrent. We are under an obligation to retain land and air forces on theContinent and to contribute to the naval and maritime air forces in the Atlantic,the Mediterranean and the Channel. Any large and precipitate reduction in theforces which we have allocated to the support of the N.A.T.O. would have a disastrous effect on the resolution of the Continental countries, particularly at this time when the stability of France is in question. We believe, however, that, fromthe military point of view, some reductions in all three Services could be justifiednow in those forces which, though allocated to the N.A.T.O., will not be availableimmediately on the outbreak of global war. Two factors would justify further reductions in our contribution to the land and air forces deployed in Europe.They are:  (a) a German contribution fully equipped and trained; and(b) the existence in Western Europe of a Allied stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons markedly superior to that of the Russians.Containment of Communism28. Far East. The Far East is the present focus of Communist aggression.To ensure an effective defence of the area, we should do everything possible topromote the creation of a South-East Asia Defence Organisation, including the participation of Asian states. We should encourage the Commonwealth countries to join it and to support it with armed forces. Its creation would strengthen ourposition in the Far East generally. We should undoubtedly be expected to con-tribute United Kingdom forces to the support of the organisation; but, in view ofthe heavy burden we are shouldering in Malaya whereby we are already making a major contribution to the security of the whole area, we should do our utmost to ensure that our present commitment in South-East Asia is not increased. Weshould aim to withdraw our forces from Korea as soon as circumstances permitand to reduce our forces in Hong Kong to an internal security basis, relying onindirect means to prevent that place from being attacked.29. Middle East. In the Middle East we must maintain a semblance ofmilitary power in order to check the spread of Communism, to support our treaty obligations, to protect our political and other vital interests in the area, and toprovide the back-bone of a defence organisation. We should aim at achieving a settlement with Egypt which will allow us to withdraw our combatant forces from the Canal Zone and to re-deploy our forces in the Middle East accordingto plans already approved by the Cabinet.
VII. Financial Considerations31. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has indicated that he wants expenditureon defence to be reduced to  1,500 millions annually and we recognise fully the absolute necessity for defence expenditure to be kept at a level compatible witha sound national economy. We are advised, however, that the above figure means a cut of at least one-eighth in our planned rate of defence expenditure and we are convinced that a reduction of this order cannot be effected by administrative economies or minor modifications to our plans. It can only be achieved byradical changes in defence policy, which will involve the taking of risks. even then, if disorganisation, inefficiency, and waste are to be avoided, the reductionwill have to be spread over a considerable period of time.VIII. Consideration of Possible Changes in Defence Policy and Plans in theLight of our New Strategic Concept32. A small number of the latest nuclear weapons can achieve a devastatingeffect. Moreover, during the next decade, means of delivery against which thereis no foreseeable defence will be developed These two factors are creating anew military situation which will reduce progressively the value of certain con-conventional war preparations and weapons. It is here that risks must be taken. Theproblem is to identify the precise weapons and preparations which we can abandonor scale down with the least risk to our world influence, security, and ability to conduct limited war. The solution will in many cases have to be based onjudgment rather than fact. It will also be necessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to weigh the interests of economy against the maintenance of public moraleat home, our prestige abroad and the cohesion and confidence of our Allies. Theeffect on the morale of the Services must also be taken into account.33. We set out in the Annex to this memorandum the issues which werecommend that Ministers should consider, together with our preliminary viewson the immediate action which might be taken to secure early savings in expenditure.(Signed)      R. McGRIGOR.J. HARDING.W. F. DICKSON.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,31st May, 1954.30. Preservation of Security in Colonial Territories and Dependencies. TheUnited Kingdom is at present ultimately responsible for maintaining the territorial integrity of, and internal security within, our Colonial territories and dependenciesoverseas. In order to quell subversive movements, we have had to send UnitedKingdom forces or reinforcements during the last few years to Malaya, kenya and the Caribbean. Recently, for political reasons, a small detachment has hadto be stationed at Sharjah. Although these commitments fair primarily on theArmy, the other Services inevitably become involved. These commitments tendto grow and become permanent and result in uneconomic dispersion of our land,sea and air forces. Colonial Governments should be put in the way of providing the necessary police forces, intelligence services and local military forces to ensureinternal security. The military responsibility of the United Kingdom should belimited to holding forces centrally, with air transport, to enable them to be despatched as reinforcements only in the event of a grave emergency. It isessential that Colonial Governments should progressively accept responsibilityfor their own internal security, and that existing United Kingdom commitmentsshould be reduced to facilitate reduction in the size of the Army.
ANNEX TO PART VIIPossible Changes in Defence Policy and Plans in the Light of our NewStrategic ConceptRoyal Navy1. The primary task of the Royal Navy in peace will be the support ofHer Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs foreign and commonwealth policy. Preparations forthe control of sea communications in war are not only reduced in priority but maywell be altered in form.2. The support of foreign policy has in the past and will in the futureinvolve not only the support of British world-wide interests but also contributions to N.A.T.O. forces and action with the United Nations. Experience in operationssince 1945 has shown that a balanced fleet including ships of all types exceptbattleships is necessary.3. The support of colonial policy includes the ability to make a show of forcein troubled areas. For this purpose no type of ship is so valuable or economicas the cruiser.4. The world-wide commitments of the Royal Navy have not sensiblychanged over the past few years. Nevertheless, by making full use of the readymobility of ships the Admiralty has already effected certain reductions in ships in commission. The active Fleet is hard pressed in fulfilling its present tasks, andthere can be little hope of any further substantial reduction in this field withouta greater sharing of the burden among the countries of the Commonwealth or some contraction of our overseas commitments.5. The kind of preparations which should be made for the protection of oursea communications in war needs re-examination. It is clear, for instance, thatthe emphasis on minesweeping is now reduced. Again, the scale of importsnecessary if the country is devastated may be so reduced as to justify a review ofour escort plans. This problem will be largely affected by the national plans forstockpiling, distribution and protection of food and oil stocks in the country.6. We suggest that the Admiralty should be instructed to undertake as amatter of urgency a review of the strength and composition of the Fleet requiredin peace and war, and report the effect of this review on our existing commitments to N.A.T.O., and also on the present shipbuilding, aircraft, modernisation, andequipment programmes. The size and composition of the Reserve Fleet shouldalso be reviewed; it should eventually consist only of those ships which theAdmiralty plan to have in commission shortly after mobilisation.7. In the meantime the Admiralty has decided to reduce manpower further and also to reduce the number of ships to be kept in active commission including one operational aircraft carrier and has suspended certain parts of the shipbuilding and modernisation programme.Army8. To meet our minimum long-term requirements, including a strategic reserve in the United Kingdom, and to maintain the minimum balance betweenoverseas and home service, we need an active Army of eight divisions plus certain minor formations and garrison units. Our aim should be to reduce the activeArmy to that level as quickly as practicable. At present the run-down already planned has been delayed because assumed reductions in commitments have failedto mature. The first step therefore in reducing the size of the Army, apart fromAnti-Aircraft Command which is dealt with in paragraphs 15 to 17 below, is toget the run-down already planned under way.  To do that we must:  (a) Redeploy the forces in the Suez Canal Zone.(b) Withdraw from Korea and Trieste.(c) Reduce our forces in Hong Kong.All these measures are at present held up for political reasons.  The soonerthese matters can be decided the earlier the run-down of the Army can proceed.
2 tL-LjIn any case the inescapable drop in the man-power available to the Army willbefore long make it impossible to continue to fulfil all existing commitments.After the steps mentioned at sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above have been takenany further run-down below eight divisions will be dependent on a reduction inour commitment to N.A.T.O.9. The Territorial Army at present comprises llf divisions plus certaincorps and army troops. Of these divisions only four are in process of being provided with modern equipment and war reserves. Two. are earmarked asreinforcements for our forces in Western Germany, and two for the Middle East.In the light of the probable course of events and state of the United Kingdom inany future war it is doubtful whether forces that had not left this country during any period of warning that occurred before war began, could be despatchedoverseas. We consider therefore that the amount of modern equipment and war reserves to be provided for the Territorial Army should be reviewed on the basis that it should not exceed the amount required for about two divisions. A numberof non-divisional units of the Territorial Army and the Army Emergency reserve and the Beach Brigade will be urgently required on mobilisation to ensure thatactive army formations already overseas can be maintained and supported and forother special duties. These should be retained at a high state of readiness. Therest of the Territorial Army could then be reorganised on the minimum basisnecessary for home defence. We suggest that the War Office should be instructedto make a detailed examination of the implications of such changes and the economies that might be effected thereby.10. The above reductions in the commitments of the active Army and in thescale of equipment of the Territorial Army would mean that planned productionof warlike stores and equipment would, in future, be for ten divisions plus certain minor formations and garrison units including the elements of the Territorial Armyand the Army Emergency Reserve mentioned in paragraph 9 above instead offourteen divisions as at present. We therefore consider that, as an immediate step,no further orders for equipment should be placed beyond what is required forten divisions and for the minor formations and garrison units mentioned above.We recommend that the War Office should consider the possibility of re-phasingthis reduced programme over a longer period.11. The high price and complexity of modern army equipment and itsmaintenance affect the total cost of the Army in both money and manpower. an examination of the possibilities of streamlining the organisation, equipment andmaintenance system of the Army has been taken in hand by the War Office and isbeing energetically pursued. The need is for increased mobility, both tactical and strategic, without damage to fighting capacity. This involves simplification of weapons and their maintenance and improved methods of land and air transport.These are long-term measures and though none the less important on that account,no early economies can be looked for in this direction.Royal Air ForceStrategic Air Force12. Our medium bombers constitute our only strategic fighting force andthis must be of sufficient strength to be demonstrably effective in the eyes of theworld. In determining the size and rate of build-up of this force, the following factors must also be considered:  (a) The size and rate of build-up of our nuclear stockpile.(b) The need to avoid disclosing to either friend or foe the actual size of ournuclear stockpile.(c) The need for us to be able to attack targets of critical importance to theUnited Kingdom.13. We suggest that the Air Ministry should be instructed to make a detailed examination of the size and build-up of the medium bomber force to meet therequirements in paragraph 12 above.Transport Command14. In order to meet our cold war commitments with forces of reducedstrength it will be necessary to increase their strategic mobility. We therefore consider that plans for increasing the capacity of Transport Command should go forward.
15.   We believe it to be a reasonable risk to reduce the Air Defence Systemof the United Kingdom to a lower level than at present planned, provided it remainsP   an efficient fighting force, satisfies public opinion and demonstrates to the Russiansthat an attack against this country would require a substantial effort on their part.16. We have instructed the Air Defence Committee to make a detailed examination&apos; of&apos; the reductions which might be made in the Air Defence system and to report to us by 30th June, 1954.This examination will include:  (a) Air aspects of the expansion planned for Fighter Command.lb) The planned development of the Control and Reporting system.(c) The present deployment and strength of Anti-Aircraft Command.(d) The modernisation programme for the equipment of Anti-aircraft command.(e) The present and planned scale of holdings of materiel reserves behind theAir Defence System.17. Pending the completion of the examination of the Air Defence System,we would propose that no fresh commitments should be undertaken under the headings in paragraph 16 above. For example, further orders for Swift andHunter aircraft would be suspended.Research and Development18. We consider that the Research and Development programme should be reviewed, with particular reference to the following:  (a) The revision of our present programme in order to eliminate so far as ispossible those improvements and items designed to cover the period between now and 1960 only, so that greater effort can be placed onlonger-term projects.(b) Various special projects, particularly offensive chemical and biologicalwarfare.(c) The closer co-ordination of our programme with those of the Common-wealth and the United States. This would not lead to substantial economies in the short term, but in the long term might avoid a steeprise in our own expenditure.Production19. We consider that the three Service Ministries should be instructed to reconsider their production programmes with a view to reducing or eliminatingitems of equipment which by 1958 will be obsolete or obsolescent.Materiel Reserves20. We recommend that the planned scales of reserve stocks of supplies andequipment for global war in all three Services should be examined with a viewto effecting economies and reducing the rate of their build-up. This might best be done by a working party under the chairmanship of a representative of theMinistry of Defence.North Atlantic Treaty Organisation21. A large part of the forces of all three Services are committed to N.A.T.O.We believe these forces are capable of considerable reduction, but we realise thatany immediate decrease in the size of our contribution to N.A.T.O. would be likelyto jeopardise its unity. It will be for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to decide on theearliest approach to our Allies concerning possible reductions, bearing in mind thefinancial consequences of delay.Other Fields in which Economies might be Effected22. There will be other fields such as the role of and preparations foramphibious warfare in which changes and economies may be effected, although these are unlikely to lead to large savings or be susceptible to early achievement.We are therefore examining, as a matter of urgency, where further economies maybe achieved and we will recommend directions in which further expenditure mightbe stopped or curtailed where we Consider that the risks involved are justified.
