Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1954SECRET Copy No.  ^ 1C. (54) 22910th July, 1954CABINETAUSTRIAN SPECIAL GENDARMERIEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsWhile the Austrians are not allowed to form an army until the conclusion ofan Austrian Treaty or unless otherwise authorised by the four Occupying Powers,they are authorised to have an ordinary gendarmerie. In the Western-occupiedzones of Austria this gendarmerie has been expanded and special detachmentshave been organised. This special force, at first numbering 5,000 and now being brought up to a strength of 8,000, is equipped with light infantry weapons andhas been trained secretly. It was established in 1950 with the agreement and assistance of the Western Occupying Powers and was originally designed to dealwith any Communist-inspired Putsch in the pre-Treaty period. It was also hopedthat it would provide the nucleus for the Austrian army which would be formedafter the conclusion of a Treaty.2. There is unhappily no immediate prospect of the conclusion of a Treaty.Meanwhile, this force of Special Gendarmerie is in existence and could be ofmaterial assistance to the forces of the Western Occupying Powers in the eventof war. The Allied Military Authorities in Austria have accordingly recommended (a) that a stockpile of heavier weapons than at present issued should be built up in the Western Zones for the use of the Special Gendarmeriein the event of war;(b) that selected members of the Special Gendarmerie should be given trainingin the use of these weapons.3. I have considered these recommendations and I have authorised her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Vienna to agree with his French and United Statescolleagues to these proposals, subject to the concurrence of the Austrian ministers concerned and subject also to the following safeguards:  (i) The weapons in the stockpiles would be limited to such types as couldbe justified as defensive in character and suitable for the preservation of internal order. The War Office consider that heavy machine guns,3&quot; mortars and bazookas would fall within this definition.(ii) Until an emergency arose these weapons would be held under guardby the Allied troops and would not be issued to the SpecialGendarmerie, who would continue to be equipped with only rifles,bayonets, pistols and some light machine guns as at present.(iii) Training of selected individual members of the Special Gendarmerie inthe types of weapons included in the stockpile would be carried outin secret in the American Zone.4. Soviet propaganda in Austria constantly accuses the Western Allies of seeking to remilitarise Austria. The safeguards set out above are designed toenable the Allies to argue, in reply to Soviet accusations of this kind, that thegendarmerie are equipped only with weapons proper to a gendarmerie and thatthe training which they carry out is normal gendarmerie training.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th June, 1954.46460
