(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(5U) 2288TH JULY, 195kEXPENDITURE ON THE OVERSEAS information services 1955-5b&apos;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth RelationsIt is the considered opinion of the Committee on civil Expenditure, of which I am the Chairman, that expenditure on the Overseas Information Services should bereduced from  10^ millions, included in the forecast estimates for 1955-56, to  9i millions02,     This is contrary to the recommendations of theDrogheda Report; but the views of the Home Secretary&apos;s Committeeon this Report (as stated in C0(5k) 185) expressly did not take account &quot;of any economies which may have to be undertaken asthe result of other deliberations&quot;,3o     We think that the reduction we recommend should be achieved in a selective way: priority should be given to expenditure on propaganda directly helpful in the &quot;cold war&quot;, on economic information including Commonwealth co-operation and the promotion of exports,&apos; and on British Council expenditure in asia, including the Middle East, where this can be effective;certain other branches of expenditure we think should be curtailed, such as the commissioning of films, exhibitions, andBritish Council activities in Europe,h.     We shall suggest, in our report that some body, underMinisterial supervision should be set up to achieve the recommended reduction&apos; in expenditure on the lines we have indicated,,5a     I hope that the full report of the Committee on civil expenditure will be available to my colleagues early next weekcIt will then be possible for the Cabinet to assess the merits of our recommendation for economy in the Overseas information services in relation to our other proposals for economies,and I suggest that a final decision on expenditure oh these services from 1955 onwards should be deferred until the suggestions we shall make for economies can be seen as a whole.Not/ that the debate on the Services has taken place, theredoes not seem to be any overriding urgency for an immediate announcement of a Government decision on this subject,,SWINTONCOPY N08CABINETCommonwealth Relations Office, S, W. 1 * *8TH JULY, 195^.
