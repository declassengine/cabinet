Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1954SECRETCopy No.C. (54) 20926th June, 1954RECORD CCCABINETTHE B.B.C. AND THE FORTNIGHT RULEMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Rule and its OriginIt was in 1948 that the so-called &quot; fortnight rule &quot; was settled, by agreementbetween the two major political Parties and the B.B.C., in its present form,namely:  &quot; No broadcasts arranged by the B.B.C. other than the normal reportingof Parliamentary proceedings are to take place on any question while it isthe subject of discussion in either House.&quot;At the same time it was agreed that this rule should be interpreted as meaning:  (a) that the B.B.C. would not broadcast discussions or ex pane statements onany issues during a period of a fortnight before they were debated in either House;(b) that, while matters were subjects of legislation, M.P.&apos;s would not beinvited to take part in discussions upon them.The rule actually dates back to 1944 when it was originally introduced by resolution of the Board of Governors of the B.B.C., with the object of bringing to an end a practice which appeared to be growing up of Ministers asking to broadcast in orderto advocate measures which were about to be debated in the House of Commons.The View of the B.B.C.2. The B.B.C. have for some time been restive about the restrictions which the rule imposes upon them. Its rigid application inevitably necessitates last-minutealterations of programmes for reasons of which the public are unaware, and whichconsequently expose the B.B.C. to ill-informed criticism. The Corporation considerthe matter to be one which they are fully capable of handling themselves as partof their recognised responsibility for the handling of political broacasting generally.They have undertaken, if the rule is dispensed with, to act in a manner which they believe will avoid the dangers to which abandonment of the rule has been thought likely to give rise. Thus, they have undertaken to refrain from using Members of either House in broadcasts during the fortnight before a debate, and to takeparticular care to avoid ex parte statements or discussion programmes on highly controversial questions of the first importance during the same period.The View of the Political Parties3. It has hitherto been the view of the Leaders of both the Conservative andLabour Parties that it was important to maintain the rule as a safeguard againstundue influence being brought to bear upon Members in respect of debates throughbroadcast programmes, and against any reversion to the practice whereby Ministers46384
sought to advocate in broadcasts measures which were about to be debated inParliament. The B.B.G.&apos;s position in this matter has been held to be quitedistinguishable from that of the newspapers, whose coverage is small and whose views are usually varied and conflicting; and the -Corporation have, of course, been at liberty to explain their position vis-a-vis the Parties when alterations of pro-grammes became necessary.issue of a Notice JL^Jt^.:4. The Corporation clearly indicated that they would be unable cto- continueto observe the rule except on the basis of a formal Notice to them to do so, issuedby the Postmaster General under Clause 15(4) of their Licence, which runs asfollows:  &quot; The Postmaster-General may from time to time by notice in writingrequire the Corporation to refrain at any specified time or at all times from sending any matter of any class specified in such notice; and the Postmaster-General may at any time or times vary or revoke any such notice. TheCorporation may at its discretion announce or refrain from announcing thatsuch a notice has been given or has been varied or revoked.&quot;5. The Home Affairs Committee, therefore, considered the matter (H.A. (54)12th Meeting, Minute 3) and agreed that the issue of such a Notice by thePostmaster-General would be justified if this should prove to be the only means ofmaintaining the rule, and provided it would have the support of the Opposition.They invited the Postmaster-General, however, to endeavour to persuade theB.B.C. to accept in place of a formal Notice a statement in Parliament about the rule, which would be made by agreement with the Labour Party. Such a state-ment would not be open to the objections which have been seen to a formal Notice for example, that Notices to broadcasting authorities to refrain from broad-casting particular matters should be used only in cases of emergency but woulddemonstrate to the general public that the B.B.C. were not themselves responsiblefor the rule. The Postmaster-General has accordingly discussed the matter withthe Chairman of the Board of Governors and the Director-General of the B.B.Cand has pressed them very hard, but they have adhered to their view that a formalNotice must be issued to them if &quot; the fortnight rule &quot; is to continue. Theagreement on which it is based is a matter of arrangement only, and there is nothing to prevent the Corporation from declaring it at an end to-day if they choose todo so.conclusion. At the invitation, therefore, of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (54)15th Meeting, Minute 2), I seek the Cabinefs authority for an approach to theOpposition Leaders to secure their support for the issue to the B.B.C. under clause 15(4) of their Licence of a formal Notice requiring them to continue to observe &quot; the fortnight rule.&quot; A similar Notice would, no doubt, have to be issued in due course to the Television Authority under Clause 7 (2) of the Television Bill.H. C.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W. I,25th June, 1954.
