GAT WICK AIRPORT - REPORT OF PUBLIC inquiry into LOCAL OBJECTIONSThe objections raised at the inquiry may be conveniently consideredunder two heads:-(a) those relating to the effects of the proposal on the locality and its residents; and(b) those relating to the general location and suitability of the site from the operational standpoint.2.        The main points made under (a) are concerned with damage to thecharacter of the area, loss of agricultural land, noise and hardship to owners and occupants resulting from the taking of the land, from the depreciation of property values and from interference with businessactivities.3.        Of these, by far the most serious are the last two - noise andhardship.    The damage to agriculture appears to be relatively slight, and though the coming of the airport will undoubtedly mean a big change in thegeneral character of the neighbourhood, there appear to be no sufficientplanning reasons for saying that this cannot be allowed to happen.4.        Noise is referred to by Sir Colin Campbell &quot;as a substantialpoint against the proposal&quot;, and objection on this ground was made by nearly everyone opposing the scheme at the inquiry.    This was, of course,inevitable since nuisance from noise has to be reckoned with as apermanent factor, even though its effect may be mitigated by various safe-guarding measures which the Ministry of Civil Aviation have undertaken to carry out.    On the other hand, the same objection would arise in what-ever inhabited area the airport might be sited and the real problem is oneof degree.    The area around Gatwick can hardly be described as a heavilypopulated one.    The future population within a nine-mile radius isestimated at 75,000 people, the great majority of whom will of course beliving   in Crawley New Town, a mile and more to the south.    The newtown should not, however, be much affected if the circuit holding arrange-ments promised by the Ministry of Civil Aviation are strictly enforced.There are in fact only two areas that are likely to suffer severely: theseare Lowfield Heath on the southern boundary of the airport, and Charlwoodvillage on the west side (but only if and when the northern runway isconstructed).    But the number of people in this unhappy position isfortunately not great.5.       As to hardship, there can be no doubt that this will occur and for particular individuals it may be very severe.    The problem is primarilyone of compensation, and Sir Colin Campbell has suggested that, incertain circumstances, special action going beyond the appropriatestatutory provisions should be taken, if necessary, to ensure equitabletreatment.    Bound up with this is the question of Government assurances that Gatwick would not be developed, in reliance on which properties are said to have been acquired in this area.    Apart from this, however,there appears to be nothing exceptional or peculiar in the extent to whichcases of hardship are likely to arise in the Gatwick area; they areindeed no different from what might be expected almost anywhere else.
6.        The objections raised under head (b) of paragraph 1 above (those relating to the general location and suitability of the site from an operationalstandpoint) covered a wide range of matters of varying importance.    but three seem to stand out as matters of substance in the light ofSir Colin Campbell&apos;s remarks.    These are:-!(a) whether it is essential for the airport to be locatedbetween the traffic routes known as Amber 1and Amber 2;(b) whether the site, with its admitted physical limita-tions on expansion, is likely to be big enough for future needs; and(c) whether the evidence on weather conditions atGatwick is adequate to justify selection of the site for the purposes required.7.        In connection with (b) and (c) above, attention should be drawn tothe criticism of cost that was also made at the inquiry.    The contentionwas that  10 millions (for the whole scheme) was an excessive sum to pay for an airport which, in the objectors1 opinion, would fall short of the idealin many respects.    A more realistic way of putting the point is whetherthe Government are satisfied that the nation will get value for its money in the longer run if the Gatwick scheme is carried out.8.        The questions raised in paragraph 6 are technical matters onwhich the report could not, of course, express any opinion.    their importance is, however, underlined by the fact that Sir Colin Campbelldid in effect say that, subject to satisfaction on these matters, he considered the case for Gatwick being a suitable site had been established.

REPORT OF INQUIRY HELD TO HEAR AND REPORTON LOCAL OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSEDDEVELOPMENT OF GATWICK AS A MAJORAIRPORTTo the Right Honourable Harold Macmillan, M.P.,Minister of Housing and Local Government.Sir,1. On the 29th January last you appointed me to hold the above Inquiry,in these terms:  &quot; The Minister of Housing and Local Government hereby appointsSir Colin Campbell, O.B.E., to hold a public local Inquiry, on theterms of reference set out below, into local objections to the proposeddevelopment of land at Gatwick, in the County of Surrey, as a majorairport.Terms of reference the purpose of the Inquiry is to hear and report on local objectionsto the proposed development of Gatwick as a major airport. Localobjections mean objections relating to the suitability of the site chosenfor the purpose or to the effect of the proposed development on local interests. In addition, it will be open to objectors to suggest detailedmodification of the scheme on the site as now proposed.It will not, however, ibe open to them to question the need to providea major airport to serve as an alternate to London Airport, nor to make proposals as to how that need should be met.&quot;2. In pursuance of this Instrument of Appointment, I have conducted apublic local Inquiry at Horley, Surrey, which extended over a period of fifteen days between 16th March and 8th April. I also subsequently in-inspected the area from the air and visited all the places and buildings whichthe parties suggested I should see.Introduction3. Before proceeding to summarise the evidence which was put beforeme at the Inquiry it would, I think, be well for me to review the circum-stances antecedent to its holding.4. It appears that the question of the use to which Gatwick Airport,an airport whose earlier history is set out in the Appendix to this Report,shall be put in the future, has exercised the minds of Ministers of CivilAviation for some years.5. It emerged from the evidence given to me that after the Ministry ofCivil Aviation had in 1946 informed the Ministry of Town and country planning that they intended to limit the use of Gatwick to charter and privateflying, the latter Ministry, apparently in reliance of this information, byOrder in February, 1947, authorised the developing of a New Town atCrawley close to Gatwick Airport. Later, in 1947, an extension of userof Gatwick again came up for examination (by the Ministry of Civil Aviation,when it was opposed very strongly by the Crawley Development Corpora-tion, and the Ministry decided &quot;to drop all idea of developing Gatwickfor scheduled services &quot;, but expressed the hope that it would be kept open for private and charter flying.
6. In March and again in June, 1949, statements were made in the Houseof Commons by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviationthat it was not the Governments intention to develop Gatwick.7. In November, 1950, the Ministry of Civil Aviation discussed with theDevelopment Corporation proposals for the greater use of Gatwick at a capital cost in the neighbourhood of  2* m. The Development Corporationagain strongly opposed the extensions and asked your Ministry to secure their abandonment.8. In December, 1951, however, the Minister of Civil Aviation told theHouse of Commons that &quot;consideration is being given to the developmentof Gatwick as a bad weather alternate for London Airport and as a base for some transport activities&quot;, and on 30th July, 1952, he announced inthe House of Commons that the Government had decided to develop gatwick airport as an alternate to London Airport. Some details of the Ministry&apos;sproposals were subsequently supplied to local authorities and to other interested parties, and were discussed with them, when apprehension con-cerning the Ministry&apos;s intention was expressed. Subsequently, in July, 1953,the Minister of Civil Aviation presented a White Paper to Parliamententitled &quot; London&apos;s Airports &quot;, Cmd. 8902, and reaffirmed the Government&apos;decision to develop Gatwick as the main alternate for London Airport, ata capital cost for the first stage of about  6 m. spread over seven years.A second stage was later added to the proposals contained in the white paper, which were at the same time modified, and the total cost of theproposals put before me is estimated to be  10 m.9. I heard strong complaints from the Surrey County Council, who arethe Planning Authority for the Gatwick Area (excluding the Crawley NewTown) that they had been treated by the Ministry of Civil Aviation withscant courtesy whilst the future user of Gatwick had been under considera-tion, and that the Ministry had completely ignored the procedure for con-sultation between Government Departments and local Planning authorities which had been laid down by your Department. They informed me thatthey had been aware of the several occasions previously referred to whenthe question of developing Gatwick had been under consideration, but thatit was not until July, 1952, that they were given any direct information.From that time they made their complaints and objections quite clearly in correspondence which they had with the Ministry, and they pressed for apublic local Inquiry at which they could present their views.10. The County Council also protested to me in strong terms that theintention now to proceed with these proposals involved a breach of &quot; solemnGovernment assurances &quot;, given in 1946, 1947 and 1949 that Gatwick wasto be used in future only in a minor degree. This protest was supportedby almost every objector appearing at the Inquiry, and I call attention toit now, not only because of the vigour with which it was expressed but also because of its bearing on matters to whioh I shall refer later.11. The opposition of individual local people to the Airport extensionproposals resulted in the formation of the Gatwick Protest Association,which was described as &quot; an Association of residents and owners of property in and around Horley, Crawley and Charlwood, and is representative ofsuch local interests &quot;. By the good offices of the Members of parliament for the constituencies affected, the Association secured the attendance of theMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation (Mr. A. T. Lennox-Boyd, M.P.)at a public meeting held at Gatwick on 5th November last, when he ex-
plained his Department^ proposals at some length and replied to manycriticisms of them. At this meeting, the Minister promised that the fullpublic local Inquiry for which the Surrey County Council, the GatwickProtest Association and others had asked, would be held, and the InquiryI have now conducted is the fulfilment of that promise.The Inquiry generally12. The terms of reference of the Inquiry permitted, it will be observed,an investigation into the suitability of the site chosen for the purpose, intothe effect of the proposed development on local interests, and into thepossibility of detailed modifications of the scheme proposed. On the otherhand, they precluded consideration of the question of the need to providea major airport to serve as an alternate to London Airport, and also themaking of proposals as to how that need should be met. An exceptionwas made in the latter prohibition in order to permit of the considerationof a site at Home, which is within a few miles of Gatwick, but in factno party to the proceedings at the Inquiry asked that Home should besubstituted for Gatwick.13. The prohibition against the making of proposals for the use of sitesalternative to Gatwick created certain difficulties for the objectors and formyself. Mr. Geoffrey Lawrence, Q.C., for the Surrey County Council, inhis speech at the conclusion of his case, expressed himself in these words&quot; I am conscious that most of what I have said, if not all of it, has beendestructive, but that unfortunately has been forced upon us by the natureof this Inquiry. ]jf I had been allowed to canvass the possibilities oftransference to another site or sites, I could have developed a part of mycase which would have been helpful and constructive. Throughout thewhole of this Inquiry the difficulty has been here, from my point of view,and I conceive also from my learned friends&apos; point of view, that in the absenceof any possibility of canvassing other sites you have been left without acriterion or touch-stone. Suitability after all is a relative term, the onlytouch-stone or criterion against which we have been able to measure Gatwickhas been the ideal, because that is something all of us on either side couldconceive without relation to any specific site.&quot;14. The only comparisons which it was possible to make in these circum-stances were with the ideal, and with London Airport, for which, if it isextended, Gatwick will be used as an alternate. If the terms of referencehad permitted comparisons to be made with other sites it is, I believe,likely (that much useful information would have emerged. On the otherhand, in the absence of spokesmen representing the areas chosen for the comparison, it might well have been that other Inquiries would subsequentlyhave had to be held and the investigations would have become inordinatelyprolonged.Case for the proposals as submitted by the Ministry of Civil Aviation15. The Ministry of Civil Aviation, by their Counsel and expert witnesses,gave very full and frank information concerning their proposals, and muchknowledge which before the Inquiry was not in the possession of the objectorsbecame theirs during its progress.16. The Ministry&apos;s case, which was that &quot; Gatwick is a suitable site &quot;,was put forward substantially on the basis of the facts set out in the white paper previously mentioned. The White Paper states that the increase ofair traffic is proceeding rapidly and that a very important problem is arisingout of it, namely, the control of aircraft in the air near London.   It also
emphasises that &quot; the control organisation is already heavily burdened, and unless radical changes are made it will, in a few years&apos; time, be unable toprovide a safe and efficient service for the increased traffic. It is essentialto simplify the pattern of air traffic, and this can only be done by re-organising the system of Airports near London.&quot;17. The/White Paper suggests that London Airport in good weather shouldbe able to deal for many years to come with all the traffic expected, exceptfor some charter flights and except in summer when travel is at its height.In summer, an additional Airport will be needed to take some of the seasonalservices now operated from Northolt and to cater tor charter flights whichare expected to increase considerably. Furthermore, in bad visibility therewill be times when some ox all aircraft will have to be diverted away from london Airport. The additional Airport, &quot;therefore, must &quot;ideally havegood visibility when London Airport has bad; should have convenient and rapid access to London ; should Me on the main air routes serving thecapital; should pose no intractable traffic problems and should create as little disturbance as possible to property, amenities and agricultural land.&quot;As most of the air services converge on London from the south and south-east the main alternate should be south of the Capital.18. The White Paper summarises the advantages and disadvantages of the six minor airports, including Gatiwiek, operated by the Ministry of CivilAviation in the London area, and for the reasons given in the Paper comes to the conclusion that Gatwick alone meets substantially all the requirements,and therefore that it as the most suitable place for developing as London&apos;main alternate and over-flow airport.19. The three uses to which the White Paper specifically suggests that an extended Gatwick would be put are as follows : 1(a) to be the main alternate Airport for diversions from London Airport;(6) to take over from London Airport and Northolt certain services,particularly to the Channel Islands and near Continental points which operate to seasonal peaks ; and(c) to serve as a base tor charter flying.20. It was for these uses that the Ministry of Civil Aviation at this Inquirycontended that Gatwick, extended as proposed, was suitable.21. Mr. MICHAEL ROWE, C.B.E., Q.C., in opening the Ministry&apos;s caseoutlined their proposals as follows:  Stage I of the proposals covers the user of 660 acres of land on whichwill be constructed the southern runway of 7,000 feet, a MaintenanceArea and a Terminal Area. A considerable diversion of the mainLondon-Brighton road (A.23) and of a few minor roads will be neces-sary, a land drainage scheme involving the diversion of waterways mustbe undertaken by the Thames Conservancy, substantial railway worksmust be carried out, and between 60 and 70 dwellings destroyed. All(this, and other work and acquisitions will, it is estimated cost  6m.Stage II provides for the acquisition and incorporation of 400-450 moreacres of land, the construction of a northern runway of 6,000 feet anda subsidiary runway of 4,000 feet, running north-east/south-west betweenthe two main runways, at a total estimated cost of  4m. The total areaof the aerodrome would then be about 1,100 acres. An outline Map(Appendix VI) of the proposals is attached to this Report.
22. The [Ministry propose to put Stage I in hand as soon as possible,and to complete it in 1958. As to Stage II, they were unable to saycategorically whether the northern runway would ever Ibe required, but they suggested that for the purposes of this Inquiry I should assume that it would.I readily concur in this suggestion because I believe that the growth of air traffic will compel the provision of facilities in Gatwiek or elsewhere in thevicinity of London much greater than an enlarged London Airport andStage I at Gatwiok will make available. I have, therefore, assumed that allthe works envisaged in Stage II will, if approved, be undertaken.23. (Mr. Rawe emphasised that the first essential for a new Airport wasthat it should fit into the Air Traffic Control system operating in the partof the country where it is to be situated. Air Traffic Control is a termwhich covers all safeguards required to ensure safety in the air. Underthis heading come the avoidance of danger to aircraft using the aerodromearising from the crossing of flight lanes from other aerodromes or crossingany main airways; the provision of a control zone above and around the aerodrome in which aeroplanes can safely assemble prior to landing; airspace for a stacking or holding area for the use of planes waiting to land;the avoidance of danger areas created by the proximity of zones usedintensively for Service purposes ; approaches free from major obstructions ;and the site situated in an area which has not been heavily built up.24. Other requirements, to ensure safety on the ground as distinct fromsafety in the air, include a reasonably level site ; runways of the lengthrequired to take every type of aircraft likely to use tihem; the ends of dierunways to be free of obstructions ; the weather, in so far as diversionarytraffic is concerned, to be different from that of the mam airport; the aero-drome to foe situated as near to the main air routes as possible, and to beable to provide maintenance service ; good communications for the conveyance of passengers to and from London toy road and by rail; and adequate terminalfacilities.25. The question of cost must also be regarded seriously, and under thatheading is included the purchase of land and of buildings to be demolished,the cost of drainage, of road and stream diversion and of lay-out generally.Another important matter for consideration is the effect of the extension on agriculture of the taking of land from food production.26. As to the effect of the extension on amenities, the (Ministry admit thatit will make the neighbourhood appreciably noisier, but they undertook to diminish the annoyance as far as it is possible so to do. On the planning of the area, the Ministry submitted that there would not be such an intensify-ing of building at the Airport as would change the character of the neighbour-hood, nor such an increase in industry as to put the general plan ofdevelopment of the area out of bounds.27. If and when Stage I of the scheme is carried out, it is- anticipated thatthe working population at the Aerodrome, now approximately 570, will beincreased ito 1,150, and if and when Stage II is completed, the total workingforce will foe approximately 2,000. The provision of housing for theseemployees and their families will involve some additional building, and theCrawley Development Corporation have promised to assist in this connection.28. On the question of breach of assurances, the Ministry admitted that definite statements had been made on behalf of the Government of the time that it was not proposed to develop Gatwick as a major airport, and Mr. Roweexplained the Governments change of attitude by pointing out that when the assurances were given it was believed that a period of peace was likely to be
ahead. Since that time, the rearmament programme has commenced andStansted Aerodrome, (which it was hoped would be used as an alternate for london Airport, is now practically unusable for civil aircraft. Secondly, thegrowth of air traffic to the south-east of London has been very much greaterthan was anticipated at the time the assurances were given, and the problemof the provision of an alternate airport has had to toe reviewed in the lightof those circumstances.29. The following is a summary of the evidence given (to me by witnessescalled toy the Ministry:  30. Captain V. A. M. HUNT, B.A., Associate Fellow of the RoyalAeronautical Society, Director of Control and Navigation on the Aviation sideof the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, described the air traffic control service which operates in toad weather to ensure the safe andexpeditious movement of air traffic. The system, with its traffic tunnels orairways, its control areas and its control zones, is complicated, and the onecontrolling admission to and exit from London Airport has taken many years to perfect. When a decision was taken in March, 1949, to close Northoltfor civil flying and to concentrate traffic on (London Airport, a revised controlpattern had to toe devised. This revised pattern is to foe brought into operation in 1955 independently of whether Gatwick Aerodrome is or is not extended.With this air pattern decided upon, the Ministry endeavoured to bring into it routes to and from Gatwick, and Captain Hunt stated that this can bedone satisfactorily, avoiding the crossing of other routes; permitting of theprovision of a control zone and a holding area, and avoiding service zones.Gatwitik is on the main route from the Channel Islands, its use will conflictlittle with traffic to and from London Airport, and it will not interfere with london local traffic. Some fifty sites were examined before a decision wastaken to develop Gatwiok, but in only two oases (Gatwiok and Home) wasa pattern of aircraft control worked out. About forty were abandonedbecause it would have been impossible for a satisfactory pattern to be evolved,and the remainder discarded for other reasons. Captain Hunt emphasised that from an aircraft control point of view, he had to confine himself to thearea to the south-east of London Airport, which lies between two airwaysserving that Ainpoitt, known as Amtoer 1 and Amtoer 2, and which are fixed by the routing of traffic from the Continent. The Service Authorities andthe Ministry of Supply had approved the new air traffic control pattern.31. Captain Hunt stated that, in order to minimise the nuisance fromnoise, the Ministry proposed to keep aircraft from the touilt-up areas adjoiningthe Aerodrome, and not to permit them to circle toefore landing. aircraft will toe controlled in flight in good weather as well as in toad, which isexceptional procedure, and no aircraft will toe channelled across the built-up area of Crawley New Town, nor will aircraft diverted from Gatwiok toLondon Airport follow such a route. If the second Stage of the schemeis proceeded with and the northern runway is constructed, it is intended tocontinue the use of the longer southern runway by the bigger aircraft inorder to reduce noise in Chiarlwood, a residential village which adjoins thewesterly end of the Aerodrome.32. Captain Hunt stated that the Gatwick site is a suitable site from an air traffic control (point of view for the purposes of a major alternate airportto London Airport.33. Mr. GEOFFREY W. STALL1BRASS, O.B.E., an Associate of theRoyal Aeronautical Society and (Director of Aerodromes (Technical) at theMinistry of Transport and Civil Aviation, testified on matters affecting the
mtechnical design and development of State owned and civil aerodromes. TheMinistry&apos;s proposals are: &apos;A southern runway comprising a length of paved surface of 7,000 feetx 200 feet, and (in the second Stage of the scheme) a northern runwayof 6,000 feet x 200 feet with a subsidiary runway diagonally betweenthe two of 4,000 feet x 150 feet. The distance between the eastern endof the southern runway and the London-Brighton Railway will be,600 feet and between the eastern end of the northern nunway and theRailway 4,100 feet.34. From a tabulated statement submitted of types of aircraft likely touse Gatwick, it appeared that one or two types when fully loaded require a longer runway than the 7,000 feet proposed for the southern runway: thisdisadvantage could be met by reducing the weight of the aircraft by reducingthe quantity of fuel carried in that type without affecting efficiency or safety.Most aircraft using Gatwick would, however, find 6,000 feet of runwaysufficient, and for those requiring more, the southern (7,000 feet) runwaywould be available.35. Aircraft taking off from the northern runway in a westerly directionwill not pass directly over the village of Charlwood, but at a distancevarying between 500 and 2,000 feet from it. The effect of air traffic to andfrom that runway upon Crawley New Town will be negligible, on Horleyit will not make it noisier than it is at present.36. An International Agreement to ensure safety in take-off and landingpublished by the International Civil Aviation Organisation was put in by thiswitness. In this document are set out &quot;Standards and RecommendedPractices &quot;, a Standard being a safeguard which is considered to be necessary,and a Recommended Practice being one which is recognised as desirable inthe interests of safety, and the only departure from these Standards and practices proposed at Gatwick is to permit objects not projecting more than25 feet above the normal approach gradient at Russ Hill to remain. Thisslight relaxation can be made without endangering air safety, as aircraft will pass about 300 feet above the obstructions, and it has been discussed with users of the Airport, who have expressed themselves as satisfied.37. U it became necessary, the southern runway could be extended tothe west from 7,000 to 8,000 feet, in which event the adjoining road clearancewould be reduced from 130 feet to 65 feet. If this were done, the loppingof some additional trees at Russ Hill would foe necessary for increasing safety.The northern runway could, if necessary, be extended to the east by 500 feet,but the flying height over the London-Brighton road would then be reduced from 230 feet to 175 feet.38. The subsidiary runway is necessary to enable aircraft to land when,because of the strength of the cross wind, they cannot use one of the mainrunways. It will enable some 5 per cent, more landings of small types of aircraft to be made in certain cross wind conditions than would be possible without it, and will augment facilities for landing so that a minimum of98 per cent, of the aircraft expected to use the airport can land in those conditions.39. On weather conditions, Mr. Stallibrass&apos;s evidence was that by Inter-national Agreement, and in this country by Regulations, Standards of mini-mum requirements of cloud base and forward vision for the take-off orlanding of an aircraft are stipulated by its owners. A study of the minimachosen by owners for London Airport indicates that average conditions
below which a pilot must not land there are a cloud base lower than between200 and 300 feet and forward vision of less than 440 yards. Above theseminima aircraft are likely to land at London Airport or at any other goodaerodrome with first class navigational aids.40. Mr. Stallibrass stated that the investigation into sites alternative toGatwick was serious and complete, but where a site was inadequate foreven one runway of the minimum size required, or where it was impossibleto proceed with it on air traffic control grounds, it was not investigated withthe same thoroughness for other objections as was Gatwick. All possiblesites were considered under three main headings: Air Traffic control;Topographical features ; and access to and from London.Of some 56 sites considered 49 were ineligible on air traffic control grounds,in 46 cases the sites were unsatisfactory and in 29 cases difficulties of accessprohibited their consideration. Considerable detail had been obtained inrespect of two other sites, namely, Home and Blackbushe.41. Weather conditions were considered after a site had met the threeprimary requirements before-mentioned, but if it failed on weather condi-tions the site would then be rejected. In his opinion, within a radius of30 miles of London the weather would not be significantly different at mostof the sites.42. As to the design of the airport, Mr. Stallibrass stated that he had accepted the requirement that the Airport must be capable of handling prac-tically all types of aircraft expected to use London Airport. He admitted that, with a distance between the two main runways of 3,200 feet, there iscramping from the point of view of the best principles of design, but he didnot agree that there was a cramping in the length of the 7,000 feet runway.He did not admit that the Airport is squeezed into an undesirably confinedspace, and he asserted that the scheme is entirely acceptable to him.43. Mr. Stallibrass agreed that within a strip of land about 150 yardswide at the eastern end of the Airport, there would be situated the easternface of the terminal building, a (bridge to the railway station, the trunk road A.23 and a four-track heavily used railway system, over which aircraft would be flying almost at right angles. He emphasised, however, that air-craft would be about 250 feet above ground on coming in and probably400 feet on take-off, and that there are several aerodromes in Englandwhere the minimum clearance over roads is 50 feet and that the normalrequirement is that there shall be a minimum clearance of 70 feet abovevehicles on the road. At Northolt the main road runs closer to the runwaythan A.23 would be to the Gatwick runways, and at Gatwick there wouldbe over the road a clearance three times as great as that recommended by international Civil Aviation Organisation. He did not regard the close proximity of road and railway with the end of the runways at Gatwick asan undesirable feature.44. The number of properties to be demolished within the boundaries ofthe airport is 63 or 64, and in areas immediately beyond there is an obliga-tion on the Local Authority to consult the Ministry of Civil Aviation beforepermitting the erection of buildings at a height in excess of 10 feet. Inother areas there is a restriction on buildings of more than 35 feet in height,
both, of which restrictions are limited to requiring notification to the Minis-try of a proposal to erect and are not necessarily a prohibition of actualbuilding. Mr. Stallibrass would not agree that these prohibitions were suchas seriously to hamper building development.45. On the question of noise, Mr. Stallibrass said there would be verylittle increase of noise in Crawley New Town. In Lowfield Heath, it wouldbe noisy when the southern runway was used, and it would affect the efficient use of a Primary School there, and although not as noisy as at present when a large aircraft takes off, the noise would occur more frequently. Noisefrom aircraft engines on the ground or being tested would be increased inLowfield Heath, but shielding would be done and with engine testing bedssilenced, it should be capable of reduction to a reasonable level. The schoolwould not be affected toy the use of the northern runway. The residents ofCharlwood would not suffer if only the Stage I southern runway is used,and maintenance area noise would not affect Charlwood. If and when thenorthern runway is used, Charlwood would be noisy when aircraft aretaking off towards the west, the noise being equivalent to heavy road traffic in a town, but he would not expect vibration in buildings. On the southernoutskirts of Charlwood and in Lowfield Heath, life would be considerably more uncomfortable than it is today.46. Noise from the Stage I southern runway would not affect Horley, andnoise from the maintenance area would affect Horley only at night, and only if it were not shielded. Some parts of Horley would have less noisethan they have at present. Baffle walls or acoustic walls are of limitedvalue, but it is hoped that a bigger reduction in noise by these methods willbe effected in future. Night maintenance work would be limited to theminimum essential for rectifying small faults in time for the following morning&apos;s flights. Mr. Stallibrass knew of no place close to London wherethere would be less disturbance of residential development by noise than atGatwick.47. Mr. Stallibrass agreed that the principal purpose of Gatwick would beto receive traffic diverted from London Airport, as was indicated in theWhite Paper. Jets coming to the aerodrome would be only those diverted from London Airport, and aircraft using Gatwick would normally be about half the size of those normally using London.48. On the question of the proximity of an electric railway to the approaches to the aerodrome, Mr. Stallibrass did not agree that the tele-communications system would be adversely affected, and stated that inother parts of the world electric railways approach runways much more closely. The presence of a busy railway line and station buildings is avery slight detraction and of no importance based on experience at othersites.49. Mr. Stallibrass stated that London Airport complies with all theInternational Civil Aviation Organisation Standards and with about 99 percent, of its Recommended Practices. What is proposed to be provided inGatwick is better on average than exists at all the major airports in theUnited Kingdom except London Airport. Although Gatwick would fall short of the ideal, in certain respects, these shortcomings did not make itan unsuitable site, and in the south eastern quadrant it was impossible tofind a site as a whole as good as Gatwick.50. Mr. ALFRED CHARLES BEST, M.Sc, a senior Principal ScientificOfficer in the Meteorological Office of the Air Ministry, gave evidence onweather.
51. Mr. Best had studied the weather aspects of the Gatwick Airportproposals, and he submitted some Statistical Tables showing the meteoro-logical suitability of Gatwick and other places as an alternate to london airport. The statistics which were included in the Tables were derived fromthe only exhaustive examination made into weather conditions at Gatwickbefore the Governments decision to extend it was made.52. Mr. Best made comparisons between the weather at London Airportand at Gatwick and other possible alternatives with the object of demon-strating the percentage of times when, with bad weather at London Airport,it was better at places which could be used as alternates. The statisticswhich he produced in this connection were for a total of 21 winter months in four periods between January, 1948, and February, 1954, and were taken only in day time, but the addition of night observations comparable with the day observations recorded would not materially alter his conclusions.Such observations to be useful would be needed over a minimum periodof four years, but day observations over two years were satisfactory.53. These statistics showed that, on 346 occasions when forward visionwas below 440 yards at London Airport, it was possible to use Gatwickon 51 per cent, of those occasions. Other standards of bad weather were examined in the statistical tables which appeared to confirm Mr. Besfsopinion that, within the limits of the statistics available Gatwick would,from a weather point of view, be available for diversions from London Airporton one in every two occasions when diversion was necessary.54. Mr. Best concluded that, as an alternate cannot be near the coast, andas it must be away from the close vicinity of London where smoke is worst,from a weather point of view &quot; it does not matter much where you go foran alternate, provided it is within a reasonable distance of London, becausethe variations from one Airport to&apos; another are small, generally less than5 per cent.&quot;. Because of the smallness of these variations he thought thata decision should not be made on meteorological grounds.55. On the question of weather from the point of view of Gatwick&apos;s useotherwise than for.diversionary purposes, Mr. Best provided more statistical information, again of limited character. The statistics covered observationstaken over the two calendar years 1948 and 1949, during which period, winter and summer, day and night, about 4,000 hourly observations were taken.They showed that at London Airport low cloud and/or poor visibilityprevailed on 800 occasions in winter, when in Gatwick they prevailed on606, but that in summer those conditions prevailed at London Airport on41 occasions and in Gaitwick in 105: i.e. weather at Gatwick is rather betterin winter than at London Airport and rather worse in summer. From the statistics available it was not possible to say whether the weather generallyat Gatwick is better or worse than at London Airport.56. Another Table submitted by Mr. Best was designed to indicate the frequency with which aircraft would be hampered by poor visibility at certain airfields within a reasonable distance of London at different hours ofthe day. Summarising his views on the information given in this Table,Mr. Best stated that the weather at Gatwick was somewhat better than someof the places mentioned, but there was &quot;nothing much in it.&quot;57. Mr. Best agreed that visibility at London Airport is affected appreciablyby pollution from the built-up area of London, and he agreed also that conditions of visibility at Gatwick might be worse when Crawley New Townis built, up.
58. Mr. Best asserted that, despite radiation fog (which is probably more likely at Gatwick than at London Airport) and apart from the possibilityof pollution from Crawley &quot; I should be perfectly happy to see the Airportput at Gatwick.&quot; So far as pollution from Crawley might arise, withoutobservations to assess its possible extent, he was unable to say whetherit would have any serious effect. He stated that he was not prepared todraw any inferences from the site conditions, because in his experience localvariations are liable to be wide.59. Captain PETER E. BRESSEY, a Captain in the service of british european Airways Corporation, and a Pilot since 1936, gave evidence. he emphasised that he was not a spokesman for his employers but, as a Captain,was giving his views on technical matter. He was a member of the CentralTechnical and Air Safety Committee of the British Air Line Pilots&apos; Associa-tion, and was also authorised by that Association, which had 1,200 members,to state their views on the technical aspects of the Gatwick Airport scheme.60. Captain Bressey said that the Committee had given careful considera-tion to the proposal at three meetings at which he was Chairman, and that three members of the Association had also met officers of the Ministry on two occasions to discuss its details.61. Captain Bressey stated that his Association and he considered theMinistry&apos;s proposals to be reasonable in every way from the point of viewof air safety. The views of the Committee were placed before the central board and the Central Board approved of them. On this Board are represen-tatives of &quot; long-haul&quot; pilots, and they were present when the Committeewere considering the views it should give on the Gatwick proposals. Hewas a &quot; short-haul &quot; pilot, flying Viscounts, previously having flown Vikings.62. Every member of the Association receives a notice of meetings ofthe Central Board and would receive notice of the meeting at which theGatwick proposals were discussed and at which he was deputed to express the views of the Association. He stated that only one member had dis-sented from the views of the Association, and he was given a hearing atthe Safety Committee&apos;s next meeting when the Committee confirmed their previous conclusions.63. Captain Bressey said that Russ Hill was no disadvantage at all fromthe safety aspect, although there might be some slight operational disadvant-age in the amount of weight that a large long-distance aircraft could take outof Gatwick taking off to the west. He did not regard the presence of RussHill as a danger to aircraft coming in from the west on to the southernrunway if all proper navigational aids proposed were available and working.On an approach to the southern runway from the east, Captain Bressey con-sidered that there was ample clearance of Russ Hill available in the eventof over-shooting, with a cloud base of 300 feet. It would not be necessaryto increase that cloud base in respect of any known type of commercialaeroplane flying to-day.64. Captain JOHN WOODMAN, Chairman of the British Air LinePilots&apos; Association and a &quot; long-haul&quot; pilot, also gave evidence on behalf ofthe Association. He stated that he was a strato--cruiser pilot employed by,but not authorised to speak for, British Overseas Airways Corporation.Captain Woodman said that he would be prepared to accept for landing on the southern runway at Gatwick from the west, when all facilities wereinstalled, a cloud base of 300 feet. Similarly, he would accept that base for landing from the east.   He had not found an occasion where in the
main he did not agree with the minimum cloud base and forward visionset by operators. He estimated that Instrument Landing System equipmentwas not working about 10 per cent, of the time, and if it were not available at Gatwick, he would regard 500-600 feet cloud base with forward visionof 1-2 miles as appropriate minima there.65. Captain Woodman said that, prior to leaving the United States hewould not put Gatwiok on his flight plan as his diversion if London Airportwere unusable, but on approaching London Airport he would, if giveninformation that London was below the minimum and Gatwiok above, be quite prepared to proceed to Gatwick.66. Captain Woodman was of opinion that the Regulations under whichaircraft are certified to operate preclude Russ Hill being a danger. Themeeting of the Board of his Association, at which the project was discussed,unanimously agreed that they had no technical objection to the proposeddevelopment of Gatwick.67. Mr. J. W. L. IVIMY, Head of the Division of the Ministry of Trans-port and Civil Aviation responsible for the general policy and planning of London, Northolt and Gatwick Airports, then gave evidence.68. Mr. Ivimy confirmed the history of the consideration of Gatwick&apos;s usergiven in the Introduction to this Report. He estimated that, assuming an index figure of 100 as the air transport movements in the London area in1949, in 1960 the index figure would be 183. There is congestion now inthe air pattern at London and Northolt, and Northolt is soon to be aban-abandoned for civilian traffic. The problem at London Airport would be to dealwith traffic at peak hours and peak months, and during bad weather con-ditions, and some relief for it must be provided by 1958.69. Mr. Ivimy stated that his Ministry were satisfied that a runway of 7,000feet is adequate for all types of aircraft which are at present foreseen. Therewas no intention of extending either of the main runways proposed, but itwould be possible to extend them if the necessity arose. It would not bepossible permanently to use the existing maintenance buildings, and it was proposed to erect buildings in two compact areas, one for terminal purposes and one for maintenance purposes. When the new maintenance buildingshad been erected, the present maintenance area would not be required andthe site would be disposed of. The new maintenance area would not be greater than was necessary for the user of the Airport for the purposesmentioned.70. Little use would be made of existing facilities at Gatwick, and theproposal is substantially for the use of an undeveloped site. Use would,however, be made of certain facilities until new ones were provided, and electricity and water were also in the site and the surface of the presentrunways would be of use.71. Mr. Ivimy stated that there was no question of transfer of headquartersor major element of B.E.A. operations to the new Airport. B.E.A.&apos;s main-tenance organisation is at London Airport, and if they moved any major partof their fleet to Gatwick they would have much dead flying between Londonand Gatwick.72. On the question of diversions, Mr. Ivimy stated that in 1952 there were404 and in 1953 557 diversions from London Airport, comprising both long-haul and short-haul. He anticipated that the short-haul traffic as comparedwith the long-haul traffic, at present 5 to 1, would in future become 7 to 1,and that diversions would follow the same ratio.
73. In Stage I 245 acres of agricultural land were involved, in Stage IIanother 405 acres, none of which is understood to be top grade agricultural land, although quite good.74. For the construction of the southern runway 2,743 trees and saplingswould be felled or lopped, for the subsidiary runway 1,315, and for thenorthern runway another 3,275, making a total of 7,333 out of a total in thearea affected of 60,000.75. The employment of labour at the Airport would be as outlined in Mr.Rowe&apos;s opening statement. Mr. Ivimy stated that, apart from maintenance of aircraft, it is not proposed to have any industry sited within the confines ofthe Airport.76. Mr. Ivimy submitted a Table giving details of the sum of  6 m.which is the estimated cost of Stage I, and  4 m., the estimated cost of stage II. There would be a saving at Northolt, Bovingdon, Croydon andStansted, all of which would be closed, and which in 1951-1952 incurredrunning costs of  955,000. The additional annual cost of running london airport and Gatwick would be  445,000, and the saving estimated thereforewill be  510,000 per annum. Revenue estimated at  60,000 might be lost onthe transfer, and the net saving is estimated to be  450,000 per annum. Mr.Ivimy pointed out that the capital expenditure on hangars and other build-ings in the maintenance area would produce rents payable by operators, whichwould assist in meeting interest and sinking fund charges on that expenditure.77. Mr. Ivimy said that an expenditure of  6 m. on an Airport merely to be used for diversionary purposes would be unjustified, but that thetriple user of Gatwick, which would increase in volume, would make theexpenditure an economic proposition, as well as helping to rationalise the aerodrome plan for the London area. The principal purpose of Gatwickwould be to act as an alternate to London, which was the original reason why it was decided to seek another airport. Subsequently, it was decided that itwould be economic and convenient to use the same airport for over-flowtraffic from London and for charter operations. He expressed the opinionthat the availability of Gatwick on 50 per cent, of occasions as a bad weatheralternate for London was quite good, and he asserted that the expenditureof  10 m. on a scheme which would meet these three purposes, was justified.78. Mr. Ivimy agreed that originally there was considerable emphasis onthe primary purpose of the Airport being the reception of diverted traffic,and that at that time the estimate of maximum movements for all purposeswas 170 a day at peak periods. At that time also it was estimated that theChannel Islands&apos; Service in winter would in 1959 comprise 16-20 movementsa day, but it was hoped that the services would increase in later years. Itwas expected that B.E.A. would use Gatwick as a regular terminal forChannel Islands&apos; and other Services all the year round, because it wouldnot be economic to move them elsewhere in winter, and the Corporation^user of the Airport would be substantial. They were transferring all their services gradually from Northolt to London Airport at the present time.79. Mr. Ivimy agreed that if the weather at Gatwick were not good by comparison with other sites, it would be a factor telling against its selectionas a major Airport.80. Mr. Ivimy anticipated that charter operators would carry out thewhole of their maintenance at Gatwick, and admitted that complaints had arisen at London Airport as to noise, which the Ministry was doing its best to reduce.
81. On the question of danger at the point where aircraft would fly overthe railway, Mr. Ivimy said that the British Transport Commission had asked for an indemnity against accidents, and that this request had been refused.&apos;82. Mr. Ivimy said that the terminal area could be completed and the airport opened by the Spring of 1958. The maintenance area buildingswould be erected during the period 1958-1960 and the existing maintenancebuildings would be used until then. Baffle walls would not be erectedfor the purpose of shielding from noise during those two years, but theposition between 1958 and 1960 would be no worse than it has been in thepast. Having regard, however, to the opinions expressed during the inquiryhis Department would endeavour to advance the construction of the main-tenance buildings. The alignment of the main runways in the positionnow proposed would not be varied unless there was substantial objectionto it.83. Mr. Ivimy agreed that the Governmenfs decision announced in 1952to develop Gatwick was contrary to the decision that had been previouslyagreed, and he confirmed the explanation of the Governmenfs change of mind given in Mr. Michael Rowe&apos;s opening statement.84. Mr. Ivimy would not agree that there had been a complete failure on the part of the Ministry of Civil Aviation to observe the spirit and letterof the Ministry of Town and Country Planning&apos;s Circular 100, requiringconsultation between Planning Authorities and Departments of State, or thathis Department had treated the Dorking and Horley Rural District council with studied discourtesy throughout. He expressed regret for the incon-venience which had been caused to the Rural District Council and othersby the delays which arose because of the time taken by the Government incoming to a decision on the future of the Airport.85. Mr. Ivimy agreed that in 1952 the Ministry had informed the rural district Council that plans for the disposal of sewage from Gatwick would bediscussed with the Local Authorities at a suitable date, that in fact plans were not discussed with Dorking, and that in 1954 Dorking were informedthat agreement had been reached with Crawley Development Corporation toreceive domestic sewage. Again, Mr. Ivimy apologised at the Ministry&apos;sfailure to keep their promise, and he undertook to re-open the question andto consult with Dorking.86. Mr. Ivimy agreed that there were a number of small traders on A.23who, if the road is diverted, would lose the whole of their livelihood, andthat his Ministry appreciated that there was no provision for their beingcompensated. He agreed that before the announcement of the government&apos;s intention to develop at Gatwick, searches in any Registry would have produced the answer that Gatwick was not to be developed, and that thatdecision must have affected the values of property which had been boughtbefore that date.87. Mr. A. S. WISDOM, Deputy Secretary and Solicitor to the ThamesConservancy explained the interests of that body in the scheme, which is within the Thames Catchment area and under the control of the Conservancy.The Conservancy were concerned only on the question of land drainage, andthey appeared neither as supporters nor objectors to the scheme.88. The Conservators had since 1951 been considering the land drainageaspects of Gatwick Airport Extension schemes and had considered severalalternative methods of dealing with such drainage, as a result of which the
Conservators are satisfied that a proper and economical scheme can beprovided at an estimated cost to the Ministry of Civil Aviation of about 120.000.   This sum does not include the cost of draining the Airport site.89. Mr. R. V. W. STOCK, O.B.E., MICE., M.I.Mech.E., B.Sc.(Eng.)London, Chief Engineer to the Thames Conservancy, gave details of seven schemes which he had prepared. The River Mole and its three tribu-taries would have to be diverted or culverted and improved in order toprovide efficient drainage for the area, and improvements to the streamwould be made which would lower flood levels further along its course.Many places alongside the stream below the Airport would be improved and none worsened. Mr. Stock stated that the land in the Gatwick area is at saturation point during the winter, but he knew many wetter sites.90 Mr. Stock said that three alternative schemes were still under con-sideration. One of them provided for the diversion of a stream from landlying between the eastern ends of the two main runways and trunk road a.23, and if this diversion could be avoided about  90,000 would be saved.The total cost to all parties for Stages I and II of the Gatwick schemewhich had been under consideration, was  287,000,  120,000 of which wouldbe payable by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and a substantial part ofthe remainder by the Crawley Development Corporation. The Surrey CountyCouncil would also pay a part of the cost of the drainage scheme in respectof the widening and deepening of the stream below the Airport.91. Mr. JOHN W. MONCUR, C.B.E., M.I.C.E., Director of Works inthe Directorate General of Works in the Air Ministry on permanent loan tothe Ministry of Civil Aviation, gave testimony in reference to civil engineeringworks which the Ministry would have to carry out in connection with thescheme.92. The Gatwick site in winter is a very wet one, and it would have tobe drained. Sewage would be pumped to existing works and disposed of bythe sewage works owners, agreement having, on the initiative of the Ministry,been arrived at informally with the Crawley Development Corporation forthis to be done. Mr. Moncur had not been aware that the Dorking rural district Council were about to lay a sewer which could take sewage fromthe aerodrome, and he undertook to look into the question of disposing of the airport sewage in this way. Contaminated matter would be treatedat the Airport.93. Discussions have taken place with the Thames Conservancy in refer-ence to surface water, and a scheme had been prepared to discharge surfacewater into outfall points and into streams made available and suitable bythe Thames Conservancy. Land drainage on a considerable scale wouldbe carried out on the aerodrome which would have beneficial effect not onlyon the aerodrome but on surrounding land. He was satisfied that the works in contemplation, which he estimated would cost  110,000, and those of the thames Conservancy would be adequate to make Gatwick a properly drainedaerodrome in winter and in summer.94. Mr. JAMES OREIGHTON BROWN, A.M.I.C.E., a senior official inthe Divisional Road Engineers Office for the Metropolitan area of the Minis-try of Transport and Civil Aviation, whose area covers the whole of Surrey,gave evidence concerning the road aspects of the scheme. On the questionof diverting A.23, which runs through the area proposed to be incorporated in the Airport, Mr. Creighton Brown stated that a scheme had been preparedto divert A.23 so as to form part of the proposed London-Brighton radial17
(If) \cfjroad to the east of Gatwick Airport and the railway, but it had been dropped on account of cost, estimated at  902,000. In its place, a proposal had been evolved which diverts A.23 only sufficiently to take it around the extended Airport west of the railway. The proposal is a temporary expedient, and it is not a substitute for the radial road, which is not likelyto be constructed in the next seven years or even longer. The total com-parafole cost of this smaller diversion is  369,000, which provides a 30&apos;carriageway and a footpath within a total width of 60&apos;. The land required would be approximately 21 acres, whereas the bigger proposal connectingup with the radial road would involve an acquisition of 72 acres.95. Two minor road diversions would also be necessary if the Airport isextended, the estimated cost of which total  88,000. The total estimatedcost of road works is, therefore,  457,000.-96. Mr. Creighton Brown agreed that he would prefer not to have aircraftcrossing a main road at low altitudes in the way which would occur onA.23, because of the obstruction which they might cause. On the questionof towing aircraft across A.23, he had been advised that this operation would occur ten or twelve times a day for about two years until the newmaintenance buildings had been constructed, and he estimated that on each occasion it would hold up traffic in much the same way as traffic lights,probably about 60 vehicles would be affected; at Blackfoushe the sameoperation holds up traffic from 1 to 1  minutes.97. Mr. Creighton Brown said that in 1938 on a Sunday in August, 17,000vehicles traversed A.23 in sixteen hours, and because of the building upof Crawley New Town, the addition of Airport traffic, sightseers and thenatural growth of motor traffic, this number was likely to be exceeded infuture.98. Mr. Creighton Brown agreed that the road diversions which would beeffected at a Cost of  457,000 would all be on account of the construction ofthe Airport, and that when the London-Brighton radial road was constructed, 212,000 of this might be regarded as abortive expenditure.99. Mr. Creighton Brown agreed that the selection of the Gatwick siteinvolved the diversion, in close proximity to the Airport and to the railway,of one of the oountry&apos;s most important trunk roads; a substantial increasein volume of traffic on that road, and capital expenditure on roads amountingto nearly  ^m. He added that the Surrey County CounoiTs suggestion of a greater road diversion joining the proposed London-Brighton radialroad was very attractive, but too expensive, and the minor road diversion was better from Crawley&apos;s point of view than the longer diversion.100. Mr. C. \VYNNE-DAVIES, Assistant Commercial Superintendent ofthe Southern Region of British Railways, gave evidence of British Railways&apos;proposals for improving rail services between the Gatwick area and london in the event of the Gatwick Airport being extended.101. It was intended to close Gatwick Airport Station, and to alter andenlarge Gatwick Racecourse Station sufficient to make it suitable for a majorAirport Station. From this enlarged station, British Railways would runfast trains to London twice an hour, the journey occupying 38 minutes. Inaddition, there would be two semi-fast trains per hour, occupying 50 minutes.The capital works involved were considerable, involving the installation of a
new signalling system on the Brighton line, the provision of sidings atGatwick, etc., and the estimated expenditure is approximately  lm., towardswhich the Ministry of Civil Aviation would make a substantial contribution.An improved service would be provided for other places in the locality bymeans of this expenditure.102. British Railways would expect considerable passenger traffic fromthe Airport, as otherwise this expenditure could mot be justified. They hadbeen supplied by the Ministry of Civil Aviation with a figure of 340,000passengers in the first full year of operation, and of this figure it was estimated that 75 per cent, would travel by rail. The bulk of the traffic would come from British European Airways, but others, i.e., charter,diversions, etc., had been taken into account in making the estimate.103. This completed the evidence called in support of the case of theMinistry of Civil Aviation.STATEMENTS AND EVIDENCE BY OTHER INTERESTED PARTIESNOT OBJECTING TO THE MINISTRVS PROPOSALSBritish European Airways104. The following statement by Lord Douglas of Kirtleside, the Chairmanof British European Airways, was made to me by the Solicitor and Secretaryof that Corporation:  &quot; I wish the legal representative of British European Airways to refutecertain statements that have been attributed to me during the course ofIfche Inquiry, some of which it would appear result from a report published in the &apos; Manchester Guardian&apos; in September, 1952. I understand thatit has been said several times during the proceedings of the Inquiry thatBritish European Airways intend eventually to set up their headquarters at Gatwick. No such statement has ever been made by me, and this iscertainly not my intention. The &apos; Manchester Guardian&apos; reported thatin my view in the more distant future Gatwick would be available forBritish European Airways&apos; Continental Services, and perhaps Gatwickwould become the terminus for these services eventually. The word&apos; terminus&apos; as applied to Gatwiok means the building at which respon-sibility for handling passengers begins and ends. At Gatwick it wouldbe possible, in view of the efficient rail services to that place, to do away with our responsibility for handling passengers in London. It is british european Airways&apos; policy to do this wherever and whenever possible.It has been stated during the Public Inquiry that British european airways and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation have different views on the use of Gatwick for British European Airways. This isnot so. It is British European Airways&apos; object to continue to maintain our base at London Airport, and to operate as many of our services aspossible from there. With this in view we have already invested over 2,000,000 in our engineering base. By 1958 we expect congestion to arise at London Airport in which case British European Airways willtransfer their Channel Islands&apos; Services to Gatwick and perhaps inaddition a small proportion of their short cross-Channel services. british european Airways&apos; interest in Gatwick, apart from the important diver-commisionary aspect is therefore as an over-flow for those services which wecannot accommodate at London Airport.&quot;
Crawley Development Corporation105. Evidence was then called on behalf of the Crawley development corporation:  106. Lieut.-Colonel C. A. C. TURNER, O.B.E., T.D., F.R.I.C.S.,F. Land Agents&apos; Society and A,Inst of C.A., Chief Executive Officer of theCorporation since 1947, gave evidence on the attitude of the Corporationtowards the proposal, and as to the conditions and safeguards which theCorporation desired in their interests.107. The Corporation was established by an Order of the Minister of town and Country Planning in February, 1947, and it intends to develop aNew Town with a population of 50-60,000 persons within an area of 6,000acres. He gave this information in reference to the New Town: 175 acreshave been developed or are now under development for industry ; 27 factories are already in production employing over 3,500 persons ; seven more factories are in course of construction which will employ a further 1,900 people, andarrangements are being made for seven additional factories. The establishedindustry embraces engineering, woodwork, printing, electrical, foodstuffs, etc.,and none of it creates much smoke. Colonel Turner said that employment has been or is being arranged for 8,400 persons. The Corporation havealso completed 2,800 houses, and they will complete upwards of 1,200 housesa year for the next few years, which will probably increase the populationby not less than 4,000 people per annum. The population of Crawley hasincreased from 9,000 in 1947 to 20,000 in 1954. The Corporation^ capitalexpenditure totals  12,900,000, with  3 m. more in immediate prospect. Inaddition, industrialists have expended upwards of  3 m. in the New Town.108. Colonel Turner recalled the history of the consideration of Gatwick&apos;suser given in the Introduction to this Report, and stated that the corporation had always objected to its becoming a major airport, because its juxtapositionwith the New Town was irreconcilable in principle. Their objections were based on a study of conditions at Airports near built-up areas and the belief that disturbance by noise, the reactions of residents to accidents, and thememory of the effects of war-time bombing would seriously affect the develop-ment of and the living conditions in the New Town.109. In a memorandum dated 23rd October, 1952, and prepared aftermuch further consideration of the matter, the Corporation^ views were asfollows:  (a) &quot; that the Corporation adhere to their opinion that the close juxta-position of a major Airport and a New Town is unsound inprinciple ;(b) if the Government policy for civil aviation has to take precedenceand the development of Gatwick has to proceed, then the safe-guards and undertakings asked for are essential to the continuedsuccessful development of Crawley. Subject to these safeguardsand undertakings being satisfactorily implemented, the Corporationconsider that the existence of the Airport could be of value toCrawley because a town carrying a major Airport would gaindistinction and importance . . . and the Airport would be a centre of suitable employment for 1,000-2,000 persons which would benefit the town.&quot;110. After studying the White Paper, in which the Government had said the development of Gatwick was essential in the national interest, thefinal decision of the Development Corporation on 30th October, 1953, was
ISOa reluctant acceptance of the Governments decision. The safeguards andconditions which the Corporation then sought, and which the Ministry in negotiation with them appear to have substantially conceded are set outlater (at page 22) in the speech of Mr. D. Walker-Smith.111. On the question of surface water drainage, Colonel Turner statedthat the Corporation offered no objection to the Thames ConservancyBoard&apos;s proposals, provided they did not prejudice the works to be done for the Corporation and that no additional cost fell upon the Corporation.On the question of domestic sewage, Colonel Turner stated that their offer to take domestic sewage from the Airport was made with the object ofbeing helpful, but that they would have no objection to the Ministry entering into discussions with the Dorking Rural District Council. On housing,the Corporation will do their best to make available accommodation suited to the needs of the workers.112. Colonel Turner stated that the Corporation^ original apprehensionshad to some extent been proved false by events, e.g; the fear of anticipatedlabour difficulties, and the fact that, despite the knowledge that the Airportwas proposed to be extended, industrialists had continued with their develop-ment proposals; but that the contemplated advantages of better rail com-munications, stable employment, the advancing of the construction of theBrighton radial road, etc. could be realised if the conditions sought were accepted.113. Colonel Turner stated that the Corporation still considered that thejuxtaposition of the Airport and the New Town was bad planning, butthey now believed that the national need of civil aviation must over-rideplanning considerations, despite their previous strong opposition.114. Sir THOMAS P. BENNETT, C.B.E., F.R.S.A., F.R.I.B.A., theChairman of the Corporation also gave evidence. Sir Thomas stated thatthe Corporation^ opinion from 1947 to 1952 was that it would be disastrous to Crawley for Gatwick to be extended, and it still considers that it isbad planning to make an Airport next to a town of 20,000 as close toGatwick as is Crawley. Having, however, studied the White Paper of1953, the Corporation considered that the Government had over-ridden thetheoretical considerations of planning principles because of the national interests, and the Corporation came to the following conclusions on 30thOctober, 1953:--&quot;After studying the White Paper and having regard to the Ministerof Civil Aviation&apos;s statement to the House of Commons the Corporationconsider that it must be accepted that the Government and their predecessors had in their respective spheres and in the opinion of thepresent Cabinet fully reviewed all possible alternatives and the con-sidered advantages of Gatwick as a southern alternate Airport toHeath Row. In these circumstances, the Corporation consider thatthe development of Gatwick must be accepted as being essential to civil aviation and the national interests. This memorandum is thereforerestricted to setting down the Corporation^ views on those matters arising from the development which should receive attention in orde?to safeguard the interests of the inhabitants of the Crawley area.&quot;115. Sir Thomas stated that from the point of view of Crawley, the Airportwould be better elsewhere, and the safeguards sought were for the benefitof those working and living in Crawley. In the past few years therehad been no diminution in the flow of industrial applications or industrialiststo Crawley, and no indication of people endeavouring to stop away because21
&apos; of the possible advent of the Airport, and in one or two respects there hadbeen an indication that some industrialists thought the Airport might be advantageous. On the question of employment, what might have beendisastrous in 1949 before development had proceeded far with the NewTown, namely, the employment at the Airport of 2,000 people, might, in1959, be a great advantage.   .116. Sir Thomas asked that the safeguards asked for by the New Townshould be made as binding as possible.117. Mr. D. WALKER-SMITH, M.P., then made his speech on behalfof the Corporation. He explained the changed attitude of his clients inthe same way as it was explained by Colonel Turner and Sir ThomasBennett, i.e. that between the Autumn of 1952 and the Autumn of 1953an intensive re-examination by the Government of the siting of an alternateAirport for London had taken place, and that that re-examination had com-pelled the Development Corporation to conclude that Gatwick Airport mustbe accepted in the national interest, despite their firm opinion that on generalplanning principles the juxtaposition of a major airport and a New Townis undesirable.118. The Development Corporation therefore appeared neither as sup-porters nor as objectors, but as &quot; acceptors &quot;, subject to the imposition ofthe following safeguards and conditions asked for by the Corporation:  (1) that the road diversion of A.23 shown in the proposals be carriedout. At the same time the Corporation endorse the view expressedby other Authorities of the necessity for expediting the constructionof the Brighton radial road ;(2) that the improved rail services proposed shall be provided ;(3) that the alignment of runways shall be as is proposed in the scheme,so that aircraft will not be channelled across the New Town. Theywould, however, prefer a re-alignment of the subsidiary runwayso that aircraft would not pass over the New Town in the vicinity of Ifield;(4) that the permanent maintenance area shall not be used by british european Airways&apos; aircraft for prolonged engine running at night,and that the only maintenance to be carried out in the presenttemporary maintenance area shall be of the type carried out atpresent; that there shall be the most complete code of safeguardsto diminish noise, that if possible the new maintenance area shallbe ready for use at the same time as the opening of Stage I ofthe Airport; thus avoiding the necessity for towing aircraft acrossthe diverted A.23 ;(5) that industry of a non-flying character shall be excluded from the airport;(6) that the revision of the Safeguarding Map which has been agreed between the New Town Corporation and the Ministry of CivilAviation shall be adhered to ;(7) that the Ministry of Housing and Local Government shall approve of the Corporation^ assisting in the provision of dwellings; and(8) that the Development Corporation shall be consulted in regard tothe processing of the Airport constructional works.
West Sussex County Council.119. Mr. T. C. HAYWARD, C.B.E., B.A., the Clerk of the West SussexCounty Council stated that the County Council were neither opposing norsupporting the Gatwidk proposal. They regarded it as not good planning to place a major airport in close proximity to a New Town, but they alsofelt that &quot; it is bad planning probably to put a major airport anywhere inthis congested island. It would of course be difficult to find a site wherethere would not be the objections which we have already heard at this inquiry.&quot;120. The West Sussex County Council considered that the diversion of A.23as now proposed was very bad and should not be allowed to persist longer than was absolutely and vitally necessary, and in no oircumstances beyondfive years, and held the view very strongly that the construction of theBrighton radial road was the only satisfactory system for the diversion ofA.23 at this point.. The County Council also considered that the towingof aircraft across the road should be avoided. Finally, Mr. Haywardemphasised that whilst his Council considered it to be bad planning to put an airport at Gatwick, they did not consider themselves qualified to say whether it should go there or not.STATEMENTS AND EVIDENCE ON BEHALF OF OBJECTORS TOTHE MINISTRY^ PROPOSALSSurrey County Council121. The first witness called for the Surrey County Council was Mr.ERNEST GOLD, C.B., D.S.O., O.B.E., F.R.S., and M.A., formerly deputy director of the Meteorological Office, who served in that Department from1910 until 1947, a past President of the Royal Meteorological Society, etc.122. Mr. Gold stated that the meteorological elements relevant to a con-sideration of the selection and lay-out of a second airport for London werevisibility, cloud and wind, of which the outstanding element is visibility infog.123. Mr. Gold stated that the great majority of inland fogs are radiationfogs. This type of fog is due to the radiation of heat upwards from theground as the ground cools and to the consequent condensation of watervapour in the air near the ground, thus forming dew or radiation fog. Thecooling ds greatest on low ground. Smoke, some coming from the burningof coal, and water vapour coming from the burning of coal and coke andfrom gas fires, intensify radiation fog. Wet ground increases the probability of radiation fog and dry ground reduces it124. The ideal situation of an alternate airport to London should be highenough to minimise the intensity and frequency of radiation fog, not so high as to be near to the cloud base, and not near a large town. It alsoought to have runways orientated so as to avoid the danger inherent in landingwhen there is an appreciable cross wind or component of wind across the runway.125. Mr. Gold expressed the opinion that, before approving an aerodromesite, the character of the surrounding country from an orographical point ofview should be considered. From this point of view, he pointed out thatGatwick is at the bottom of a saucer of about 9 miles square and in thecentre of it. It is difficult for cold air inside the saucer at Gatwick to escape from it, and in consequence the area is more liable to the formation andretention of radiation fog.23
A 1126. From the aspect of radiation fog, in Mr. Gold&apos;s opinion Gatwick wasabout as bad a site as could be imagined. For the whole of the winter theground holds as much water as it could be expected to hold, i.e., it is atmaximum saturation point, although there would be some slight improvementfrom the drainage scheme proposed. He said that the rainfall at Gatwiokwas about 30 per cent, higher than at London Airport, there being 24 in.at London Airport and 31 in. at Gatwick.127. Mr. Gold pointed out that there were no records of night temperaturesat Gatwick Airport, nor of the frequency and duration of radiation fog, nor ofwind gusts, on which to ascertain facts. If two years&apos; observations hadbeen available, this information could have been provided, and in their absence his evidence on these matters was based on inferences drawn fromthe laws of physical science.128. In Mr. Gold&apos;s opinion the air from Crawley New Town would cometowards the Airport and, if polluted, would contribute towards the formationof radiation fog. Although he had made no calculations as to the ultimateeffect, he estimated that an increase in the size of Horley and Crawley would add 50 per cent, to the occasions when Lowfield Heath and Charlwood wouldhave visibility below 440 yards.129. Mr. Gold stated that from statistics supplied fey the meteorological office he had ascertained that Gatwick had had 138 hours with low cloudbelow 600 feet in certain daylight periods in 1948 and 1949 and in 1952-53,whilst London had had 77 hours under those conditions. He thought itnecessary to regard 600 feet of low cloud at Gatwick as strictly comparable with 300 feet at London Airport, because at London Airport there is nohigh ground comparable with the high ground at Gatwick, and on that basis the difference became 138 hours at Gatwick to only 16 at London.Mr. Gold fixed 600 feet for Gatwick Airport without reference to thefact that navigational aids would be available if the Airport were extended,although he accepted that the London operational minima of 300 feet hadbeen fixed having regard to navigational aids available there, and he didnot know that Gatwick Airporfs minimum, which he had been given bythe Ministry of Civil Aviation as between 400 and 700 feet, was on thebasis that it had no navigational aids. Even with equal navigational aids,he thought that the same critical height should not be applied because ofthe physical presence of surrounding hills at Gatwick.130. Mr. Gold put in Meteorological Tables which he had prepared onthe basis of Gatwick being used as an alternate to London Airport. HisTable 1 appeared to confirm that Gatwick was fogbound in day time on very nearly half the occasions when London was fogbound, tout Table 1 (a)showed that during four months from October, 1953 to January,. 1954,with visibility below 440 yards at London Airport on 42 occasions, ononly 11 occasions was visibility above that limit at Gatwick. Table 1 (b)indicated the number of times that certain aerodromes were usable on the302 occasions when London Airport was not. So far as Gatwick is con-cerned, it corroborated the 1 in 2 ratio previously referred to, but it alsoshowed that other airports were better.131. On the question of weather from the point of view of the use ofGatwick for regular services, Mr. Gold&apos;s Table 2 based on day-time observa-tions taken in 1948, 1949 and in 1952-53 showed that London Airporthad visibility below 440 yards on 302 occasions, whereas Gatwick had
t^ilar conditions on 207. Mr. Gold commented that when Crawley wasdeveloped, the position at Gatwick would deteriorate and probably thenumber 207 would come up to something near 300-not very different from london Airport.132. Mr. Gold&apos;s Tables 2 (a) and 2 (p) were prepared to show the numberof hours in winter that London, Gatwick and other aerodromes were belowlimits, but as the calculations were made on the basis of 300 feet cloudbase at London Airport and 600 feet at Gatwick they are, in my opinion,of little value.133. Mr. Gold&apos;s Table 3 was designed to show the number of days in winter, for the periods previously referred to, in which visibility between440 and 1,100 yards occurred at seven Airports including London Airportand Gatwick: at London Airport it occurred on 99 days as compared withGatwick&apos;s 59.134. On the question of wind, Mr. Gold stated that most of the strongsurface winds at Gatwick come from the south-west quadrant. In hisopinion, substantial cross winds would blow more frequently than theyshould at an airport to be used regularly by all-service aircraft.135. On the question of wind turbulence, Mr. Gold expressed the opinionthat the presence of Leith Hill, a hill 1,000 feet above O.D. about 7 miles west of the Airport, would cause eddies in high winds, which eddies might reach an intensity sufficient to upset an aircraft on take-off or landing.If Leith Hill were covered with cloud, a dangerous situation might be created, as a consequence of eddies, although he was not able to say whether an accident had ever occurred as a result of its presence.136. Mr. Gold expressed the opinion that it would be necessary to diverta substantial proportion of aircraft to airfields other than Gatwick becauseGatwick would on average be below the operational minimum on more than half the occasions of diversions from London Airport, and in exceptionalwinters on three-quarters.137. Mr. Gold summed up his opinion of Gatwick that it was not merelynot ideal but was thoroughly bad as a site for an airport, whether as analternate or in its own right, but primarily as an alternate. As a majorairport in its own right, to be used in all types of weather, it was not asgood as sites which could be found in southern England, but as a minorairport that could be used primarily when the weather was good, there wouldbe no objection to it.138. Mr. Gold agreed that London Airport is a reasonably satisfactorysite, with less low cloud than Gatwick, but in his opinion it was notmeteorologically good. He agreed that in respect of visibility in daytime,Gatwick was better than London and that it was better for visibility andcloud base than London during winter days in a particular statistical period.He also agreed that Gatwick was better in that period than several aero-dromes in use for all purposes. As to conditions at night, he only knew that Gatwick, in view of its situation, was &quot;practically certainly worserelatively to London Airport or any other airports at night than it is in theday-time &quot;. Mr. Gold agreed that Gatwick had been used for many years by civil aircraft of varying types, but it did not affect his opinion as to itsunsuitability in bad weather. Mr. Gold accepted the broad proposition, thatGatwick would, on average, be &quot;in&quot; on approximately 50 per cent, of theoccasions when London was &quot;out&quot;, but he would not say whether he was holding himself out as competent to express an opinion as to whether a50 per cent, availability is reasonable for an alternate aerodrome.
139. Mr. Gold said that he ceased to be President of the MeteorologicalSub-Commission of the International Commission for Aerial Navigationin 1946, and he would not say that he had kept himself completely in touchwith matters aeronautical since that year. The Sub-Commission advised themain body on weather matters, which required consideration in the design of aerodromes. He expressed the opinion that an airport with one runwayor runways parallel was not as safe, because of cross winds, as it could bemade. Mr. Gold admitted that there had been a change since 1947 in the capacity of aircraft to stand cross wind components, and he conceded thathe had not studied the internationally accepted recommendations in referenceto the determining of cross wind components which an aircraft is able to: withstand, nor had he ever been called in to advise an Aircraft company or anyone else on this matter.140. Dr. L. E. C. HUGHES, Doctor of Philosophy, B.Sc.(Eng.),A.M.I.E.E., and a past President of the Institute of Electronics, was nextcalled. Dr. Hughes had acted as technical adviser to certain Residents&apos;Associations who had made representations to the Ministry of Civil aviation on the subject of damage to amenities and property in the neighbourhood ofLondon Airport, mainly on the question of noise.141. Dr. Hughes said that he had made a study of the incidence of noiseand vibration in relation to the movement of aircraft when flying low overresidential property. Noise is measured by a meter and is recorded in unitscalled phons. The response of an average ear to noise provides a level fromwhich the measurements are calculated. Where a normal noise level wasabout 60 phons, at 70 a specific noise would cause considerable interference,at 75 it would be serious and at 80 it would foe devastating.142. If there was no obstruction in the path of sound it dissipated itself,but an obstruction checks its diffusion. At London Airport noise from the running of engines at the end of a runway had not had serious effect, but from running up in the maintenance area at night it had been serious, anda baffle wall had been built. This wall had been reasonably effective againstpiston engine noises, but not against jets. It was possible to protect, withbaffle walls or by the use of the walls of a hangar, areas adjoining an airport,but the walls would merely reflect the sound in other directions.143. Dr. Hughes expressed the opinion that aircraft flying over built-built-up areas at over 1,000 feet did not interfere with ordinary noise level to any significant extent in the day-time, but at night-time they might awaken alarge number of people. In the day-time aircraft flying at 300 feet in theneighbourhood of a built-up area would cause considerable apprehensiveness,especially amongst children, and they would certainly interfere with telephoningor intellectual work. At night such noise would be extremely dangerousin the sense that people would not be able to sleep if aircraft came over,perhaps 12 times an hour. At night-time aircraft above 300 feet wouldnot constitute a serious disturbance to people on the ground.144. Dr. Hughes estimated that the noise level at Lowfield Heath whenpiston engines are tested prior to take-off and at full power would be over 0 phons inside the School; with windows closed it would be about 70 phons.He thought that children could stand such noise for a long time, but that the strain on the teachers would be very severe indeed. If such a noise werein the vicinity of offices, noise measuring 75 to 80 phons would bring officework to a stand-still and telephoning or dictation would be impossible. at night in those conditions it would be impossible to sleep. At Charlwood,which would be in the path of the northern runway and over which aircraft
would fly at probably 350 feet in day-time, there would be a considerabledisturbance of amenities, and at night the noise would be devastating, &quot; Theycould not live there at all&quot;. It would have the same effect as running avery heavy main road through the village.145. On maintenance area noises arising from the running of engines for testing purposes, Dr. Hughes said that at Cranford, the day-time main-tenance noise was negligible, but at night it had occasioned many complaints,and the properties there cannot be sold and the amenities of the area arespoilt. The effect of maintenance area noise on Crawley, if the factory areagoes up to the county boundary, would be such as to upset operationsinvolving delicate work, although he understood that high precision engineer-ing was being done in and around hangars at London Airport. The residentialarea of Crawley within one to one and a half miles would also be affected bymaintenance area noise at night, but it would not be noticed during the day.146. From piston engines the maintenance area noise at the LowfieldHeath School would be of the same density as the main road traffic outside(i.e., the continuous noise of heavy traffic plus the occasional noise ofparticularly heavy vehicles) but the jet noise would be greater. Elsewhere,at one mile it would be insignificant.147. On the question of damage from vibration at Cranford, Dr. Hugheshad found that plaster had cracked and windows had been broken in houses.He was satisfied that damage to property can be and is caused by vibrationfrom passing aircraft, but the Ministry of Civil Aviation did not accept this opinion, although the Minister has stated that he is satisfied there is anaccelerated deterioration damage. If the subsidiary runway is used, aircraftgoing over Horley would be so high that vibration would not cause actualdamage. Dr. Hughes stated that the maximum damage which he had seencaused by vibration had been the bringing down of a ceiling. He did notthink that Charlwood would be affected by vibration, but in Lowfield Heaththere might be actual material damage to houses.148. Summarising his views, Dr. Hughes stated that with the proposedalignment of runways there was no likelihood of actual damage from vibra-tion, except in Lowfield Heath, but the surrounding built-up areas would suffer severely from the diffusion of noise.149. Sir WILLIAM GRAHAM HOLFORD, Planning Consultant,F.R.I.B.A., Fellow of the Institute of Landscape Architects, Associate of theRoyal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, President this year of the town planning Institute, a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission and of the historical Buildings Council for England, was next called.150. Sir William said that the Gatwick extension was not provided forin the Surrey County Development Plan because those familiar with thispart of Surrey considered such a proposal incompatible with the future ofthe locality and utterly unsuited to it, and because the planning of this area had been influenced by Government assurances in the past that the airport would not be extended.151. Sir William expressed the opinion that the only advantage to thelocal population would be the possible extended train service betweenGatwick and London, and in other respects that they would lose a greatdeal. Surrey should be kept as a County in which people could convenientlyand effectively live and work and carry on productive occupations, and asa place where an increasing proportion of people could retire. There was an obvious clash between the Airport proposals and the planning proposals
for the preservation of the area, and although planning had to be a matterof compromise there ought to be a clear and overwhelming case for thescheme on national grounds, before all the local disadvantages should beaccepted. He was of opinion that the road diversion, the railway altera-tions, protection from sound and drainage were all costly projects, and thatthe site was a &quot; squeeze &quot; with no room for expansion beyond Stage II.152. From the point of view of the national interest, the County Councilquestioned the wisdom of developing an airport in an area in which notless than 75,000 people would be intimately affected. On the question ofthe physical suitability of the site, he pointed out that it is in a plain orbasin of fairly heavy clay, practically surrounded by hills, has a high watertable and is subject to flood. From a planning point of view, land of thiskind should be left to agriculture or forestal use, whilst higher land,heathland, etc., of no agricultural value, should be used for airfield develop-ment. If Gatwick were not extended it would be possible to maintain anadequate belt of open country. Whilst site drainage could be provided, itwould be costly in capital and in maintenance, and the diversion of theroad A.23 would be costly and a &quot; very clumsy piece of development&quot;, which ought to be avoided by re-aligning it with the proposed Brighton radialToad. The proposed diversion would never be a suitable permanent additionto the radial road, and from the planning point of view the road proposals were unsound, unsafe and uneconomic. The congestion in the narrowpiece of land adjoining the easterly ends of the runways might be dangerous,and the road traffic hazards there, which air flight distractions might increase,were considerable.153. In reference to the effect on particular localities, Sir William statedthat Charlwood was one of the old villages, a part of whose Parish Churchwas built in 1080, and in which some buildings have been continuouslyoccupied for 400 years. If any substantial extension beyond Stage II were carried out, Charlwood would be destroyed.154. Sir William detailed the effect on the area created by the impositionof restrictions on building and on increasing the height of existing buildings,which would follow the Airport extension. Many buildings would not be purchased by the Ministry, but they would depreciate in value and no com-pensation would be payable to the owners.155. Injustice also arose in this connection by the inclusion for com-pulsory purchase of certain properties and the exclusion of others immediatelyadjoining.156. On noise and vibration, Sir William expressed the opinion that noiseis probably the largest single deterrent to air development, and he did notthink that the residents would be satisfied that it would be possible to mitigate noise from night maintenance work.157. Sir William agreed that it was extremely difficult to find a site satis-factory and ideal from every point of view, and that Gatwick did in factappear to meet many of the requirements of the White Paper.158. Finally, Sir William said that if this Airport were extended it meantan end of planning in the area, that the project was &quot; too much for Surrey,and I doubt whether it is good enough for a National Airport&quot;,159, Mr. GEOFFREY LAWRENCES final submission pointed out thatthis Inquiry had aroused public interest over the whole of the country, thatit was a novel Inquiry, in the nature of a grand inquisition at which all parties had the responsibility of affording the utmost assistance to theMinister charged with making a decision.
160. Mr. Lawrence denied the accusation that the Surrey County council were taking a parochial view of the matter, and that they were there toprevent the coming of the Airport into the County, whether or not itwas in the national interest for it to come. With the devastation, theupheaval, the hardship and the nuisance and annoyance which a majorAirport would bring, wherever it was situated, they would be glad to see it elsewhere. But if &quot; at the end of all things, contrary to our view, weshould fail, and the decision was taken to put this Airport here, the CountyCouncil for whom I have the honour to appear, would loyally co-operate in that decision and do their level best to make it work.&quot;161. Mr. Lawrence stated that upon mature and careful consideration,however, the County Council were satisfied and convinced that the imposition-tion of this Airport at Gatwick would not merely conflict with local interests,but would be wholly at variance with the national interest itself, and thatif public money were spent upon this site it would be largely wasted andin a few years&apos; time regretted.162. Mr. Lawrence then turned to the position of the County Council asthe Planning Authority, which they had been since the - Act of 1947was passed. He pointed out that the County Council were not takeninto the confidence of the Ministry until August, 1952, when a plan anda memorandum were sent to them. A meeting on 6th October, 1952,followed, at which the Chairman of the County Council said that neitherhis Council nor its constituent authorities were in a position to put forward at that meeting considered views on the proposals which they had onlyreceived in August. They therefore wished to consider them with theother Authorities in their area, in order to decide whether to oppose thescheme or to accept it subject to amendment in detail.163. Mr. Lawrence then contrasted this attitude with the attitude of theCrawley Development Corporation who had been given information aboutthe Ministry&apos;s proposals which the Surrey County Council had not received,and he reviewed and criticised at length the attitude of the development corporation, who ought in his submission to have appeared in oppositionat this Inquiry.164. Mr. Lawrence then came to the question of the assurances previouslyreferred to given from time to time by the Government in reference toGatwick. He pointed out that the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviationhad made public reference to the fact that to develop this site in the wayproposed involved a breach of solemn Government assurances. He pro-tested in strong terms against the morality of such a breach within a fewyears of the assurances having been given, and submitted that the frequentstatements of the Governments intention not to develop this site for a major Airport ought to tell very strongly against it.165. Mr. Lawrence then proceeded to discuss the suitability of the sie and in this connection to consider the extent of its proposed user. he pointed out that the principal user was for diversions, in respect of which figures had been given at the Inquiry that for thirteen months in 1950-51there were 109 diversions for 14,000 landings, or diversions of less than per cent. He agreed that with greater traffic at London Airport morediversions would be necessary, and that diversions might also occur in good weather because of congestion. He noted that, of the 109 diversions,46 went to Hum, and he suggested that the site chosen should be capable(of handling all types of aircraft which were expected to use london airport and which might, therefore, have to be diverted.   The second
purpose was the regular use of the new Airport for scheduled services. TheWhite Paper said an additional airport will be needed to take some ofthe seasonal services now operated from Northolt to places such as theChannel Islands and near Continental resorts. It would appear, however,from the evidence given at this Inquiry that more and more british european Airways regular services would use Gatwick if it were extended,and he quoted from Mr. Ivimy&apos;s evidence that there would be a substantial and regular user of Gatwick by British European Airways all the yearround. He also referred to the written statement put in at the Inquiryby the Chairman of British European Airways in which it was stated thatthey hoped to avoid the responsibility for handling passengers in Londonand that Gatwick would permit them to do this. He submitted, therefore,that an extended Gatwick would be used by a substantial number of diver-sions and a substantial regular and probably increasing user by british european Airways. He also suggested that a large number of charteroperators would use the Airport, and he expressed the opinion that theextent of the user of the Airport would certainly be very much larger than that which was indicated in the White Paper,, and that the real ques-tion for consideration was whether Gatwick was suitable as a site fora major London Airport in its own right for all those purposes and all those uses.166. Mr. Lawrence then commented on the expenditure involved in thescheme, i.e.  6m. on Stage I with an additional  4m. for Stage II, and he submitted that it could not be justified on the construction of a new Airportwhich was utterly unsuitable for the uses proposed, when one consideredthe Standards which ought to be complied with at the present time.167. Mr. Lawrence dealt with unsuitability under three heads:  (a) weather, which he suggested ought by itself to be fatal to the project;(b) the natural limitations of the site sub-divided into:  (i) too small;(ii) danger; and(iii) natural disadvantages which could be removed only at great cost;(c) planning.168. If weather was not of itself fatal, then the cumulative effect of allthe other objections, in Mr. Lawrence&apos;s submission, demonstrated thatGatwick was unsuitable for the combination of purposes for which an airport was required.169. On weather, Mr. Lawrence suggested that the objectors&apos; evidence atthis Inquiry was new matter, and he referred to the Ministry of CivilAviation&apos;s memorandum to the Crawley Development Corporation of 1950which stated that &quot; Gatwick&apos;s weather is normally quite distinct from thatof London Airport, and it is seldom indeed that both are fogbound at thesame time &quot;. At the time the memorandum was written, the Governmenthad data in respect of two winters, 1948 and 1949, and that data indicated that Gatwick was available on fewer than half the occasions when london was fogbound in the winter of 1948. He pointed out that the White Papercalled for an Airport at which the weather would be different from thatat London Airport, and in the Appendix to the White Paper it was saidthat the weather was sufficiently different at Gatwick from that of london airport &quot; when visibility there is poor, to make Gatwick suitable for
/Godiversions save in exceptional conditions&quot;. He submitted that the evidenceindicated that the position would better have been described by saying&quot; except on about 45 per cent, of the occasions &quot;. He commented on thefact that the Government, although apparently wanting Gatwick, never asked the Meteorological Office to carry out any comprehensive observations ofits weather, and that the statistics which had been available were statisticswhich must be looked at with considerable caution. There were no nightobservations at all, there was an absence of simultaneous observations atGatwick and other places and the statistical picture was incomplete. Ithad therefore been necessary for him to call attention, in the absence ofthese statistics, to the natural features of the site and the known laws of physical science. He emphasised the experience of Mr. Gold in these matters,and commented on the orographical situation of Gatwick at the bottom ofa depression, from which the only exit was quite insufficient to drain awayduring the night the cold air which was the accompaniment of radiationfog. He also called attention to Mr. Gold&apos;s evidence that rainfall at Gatwickwas about 30 per cent, higher than at London Airport, that from a radiationfog point of view Gatwick was a site which was about as bad as couldbe imagined, and that fog was likely to persist at Gatwick longer thanit would elsewhere. In the absence of night observations, Mr. Gold&apos;sdeduction must be borne in mind that night fogs were highly likely atGatwick, and that it would be worse in that respect than London Airport.He submitted that this evidence could not be brushed aside, that it hadnot been disputed factually, and that if it was right the site was badlychosen.170. Mr. Lawrence summarised that Gatwick was an inherently foggyplace, that it was liable to be worsened by the proximity of a built-up area,that during night-time fog would be worse than during the day, and that therefore the site could not be suitable for use as a major airport either for diversions or for regular services. If Gatwick were usable for diversionson only one half of the occasions when London could not be used, Gatwickshould be regarded as a very poor site, but if statistics had been available for 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m. and the prospective Crawley pollution takeninto account the Gatwick percentage would foe much less than 50 per cent.171. On the question of the value of the statistics in reference to cloudbase and forward vision at Gatwick as compared with London Airport,Mr. Lawrence submitted that it was not possible to disregard the surroundinghills at Gatwick, and that higher minima should operate there than atLondon Airport.172. As to cross wind components, Mr. Lawrence suggested that therewould be a hazard from eddies in certain conditions, and that the risk was too high for an airport which was intended for use by regular services. he also commented on the proximity of Leith Hill and the added danger which its presence produced.173. On the question of the natural limitations of the site, Mr. Lawrencesubmitted that a site of 1,000 acres was too small for a modern airportto be constructed at the present time. This area left little room for expansion,and its design and lay-out had been dictated by its confining smallness. the site limitations were admitted by the Ministry when they stated that it wouldhave been preferable to have had greater separation between two parallelrunways. The putting of these runways close together would produce an airport which would become increasingly inadequate for the purpose forwhich it was built, and it provided only very limited room for extension.Mr. Lawrence pointed out that the approach surface of 1 in 50 could not
be provided fully at Russ Hill, and the safety margin would in consequencebe reduced, again because of the limitations of the site. As regards obstruc-tions, e.g., Russ Hill and the railway, the Ministry were considering themin relation to normal landings and normal take-offs, with every navigationalaid in full working order. He suggested that they should be considered inrelation to abnormal conditions, when something had gone wrong and whenaccidents would occur, which would not occur if obstructions were not present. He submitted that the border line between danger and safetywas moving too often at Gatwick nearer to the wrong side, and in thatconnection he commented on Captain Kyle&apos;s evidence when he expressedthe view that &quot; he did not like Russ Hill and would not feel happy about it&quot;.174. On the question of the juxtaposition of road, railway and airport,Mr. Lawrence commented that an added risk to users of all three existedat a time when the peak of all three activities would coincide. He suggestedthat in the summer months there would be an enormous concentration ofair traffic when the railway and the road would be heavily used. He alsocommented on the distraction to drivers on the road caused by aircraftpassing over between 200 and 300 feet in height, and submitted that the diversion of A.23 on this route was bad.175. Mr. Lawrence then commented on the natural features of the sie and the work which would have to be done before the construction of the airport could commence. Works of diversion of rivers and streams were estimated to cost  250,000, the diversion of the trunk road would costapproximately  500,000, of which  212,000 would be abortive, and at thesame time it would import hazards to road users where the road ran parallelto the airport. The demolition of dwelling houses and other buildings wouldbe costly, and he suggested that almost  lm. would be expended beforepositive construction work commenced.176. On planning, Mr. Lawrence quoted Sir William Holford&apos;s words that&quot;this proposal is completely opposed to all canons of good planning in thispart of the county, that it cannot possibly be justified on planning grounds,that the interests of planning are irreconcilable with the proposal&quot;. TheMinister would probably say that the national interest was so predominantthat it must prevail against planning, but Mr. Lawrence suggested that theMinister should pause to consider whether the site had so many advantages that that disastrous result must foe accepted. In the County CounciFs view,however, the site was unsuitable in the national interest, and it was not inthe national interest to require an Airport to be developed on a site whichwas unsuitable for it and which would do irremediable violence to localamenities, local characteristics and local necessities.177. Mr. Lawrence again referred to the effect of noise on the neghbour-hood, and criticised the placing of a modern Airport in proximity to some75,000 people who would be prejudiced by the noise and inconvenienceswhich it would cause without there being any guarantee that the noisecould or would be silenced. He suggested that, owing to these features, itwas undesirable to use the site, and it should foe possible elsewhere withinthe desirable segment to find a site which did not do such irremediable violenceto established interests. Referring to the Ministry&apos;s submission that thealternative Airport must be sited between the two air traffic lanes servingLondon Airport, Mr. Lawrence said &quot;If that is the inescapable hypothesis,I cannot imagine that there can be any other candidate for the honour exceptGatwiok.&quot; But he challenged that basis and suggested &quot;that traffic routesmust be designed to fit in with the convenience of Airports and that it wasnot beyond the capacity of the Department to arrange traffic routes so that other sites could be considered.
i78. Finally Mr. Lawrence submitted that the Ministry of Civil AviationfrnmSmCe/-947 ,Tanttd to,.develoP Gatwick, that they were then prevented from so doing, but that they pressed again and again for it, and that thevough now to undertake some fresh and original thinking. He suggestedthat they should haye sought a site which avoided substantial radiatkfn fogSv^w9 11CVf ^W uClou  that a site in the south-east of iMolmight have been found, and that Gatwick fell so short of the ideal that itcould not be said to be suitable for the purposes of a major airportGodstone Rural District Council179. Mr. W. B. HARRIS made a statement on behalf of the GodstoneRural District Council. He made tihree points, first that Home could notbe considered as an alternative, but should be dismissed summarily from consideration ; secondly that if the Gatwick Airport were extended the tideof urbanisation would flow into the Godstone rural area, and the countryside,already suffering from the presence of Biggin Hill, would be ruined ; and thirdly that if the aerodrome were permitted to be constructed the depre-ciation in values of property would be considerable, and would be a matterof the gravest concern.Dorking and Horley Rural District Council180. Mr. FREDERICK MATTAR made a final submission for theDorking and Horley Rural District Council. He said that the Rural DistrictCouncil and the Parishes of Charlwood and Horley regarded the site ascompletely unsuitable and wished to see the Airport &quot; expelled from theCounty &quot;.181. Mr. Mattar pointed out that the planning of the area since the war had been based on assurances given that it was not intended to extend the airport, that if the extension were proceeded with there would be a con-tinuous and unbroken line of development between Redhill and CrawleyNew Town, and that the occupiers of about 450 Council houses on theHorley Gardens Estate would suffer serious disturbance. He emphasised the Charlwood Parish CounciTs objections, one of which was that the diversion of the main Brighton road would substitute three miles of circuitousroute for the present one mile, that five rights of way would have to be stopped up, with no diversions possible, and that if Gatwick Airport station were closed people would be compelled to walk nearly a mile further to the.new Airport Station.182. The Horley Parish Council complained of the proposal to move themaintenance area to the north and thus nearer Horley, and they criticised,the proposal to absorb agricultural land for industrial purposes. They alsofeared the effects of noise and vibration.183. Mr. Mattar emphasised his clients&apos; views on the danger of a site1so near to a trunk road and a railway, and suggested that such a risk should,not be undertaken.184. Mr. Mattar referred to a request from the Crawley Development-Corporation that there might be a reorientation of the subsidiary runway in :order to avoid flying over the Ifield part of Crawley, and protested against such a reorientation which, if it were granted, would have the effect ofaligning traffic over Horley, where there are 512 houses occupied by nearly1,800 people. 1
185. Mr. A. W. LAIDMAN, Clerk of the Horsham Rural District Counciland Clerk of the Crawley Parish Council, both of which areas are in theadministrative County of West Sussex, expressed the view of those bodies in opposition to the proposals. The people of Crawley considered that the pro-posal to construct a major Airport at Gatwick was contrary to all soundprinciples of planning and had created disappointment, disquiet and uneasi-ness in their minds. He recapitulated the assurances that had been given at different times that Gatwick would not be extended, and asserted that if theproposals were proceeded with the character of Crawley would be alteredand the town&apos;s attractions diminished.186. Summarised, the views of the two Councils were as follows:  (1) On planning grounds, the proposal to impose a new major Airportis fundamentally wrong;(2) if the scheme goes forward, positive measures must be taken toensure that noise and danger from aircraft and ancillary works will not arise to the detriment of the New Town ;(3) in the interests of road safety the Brighton radial road, or at least a section of it, should be constructed at once to take through trafficaway from the New Town ; and(4) there should be no readjusting of the funnelling of the runways to add further detriment to the New Town.Gatwick Protest Association187. On behalf of the Gatwick Protest Association, MR. PERCY LAMB,Q.C., called Captain M. A. Kyle, who is a pilot employed by British Over-seas Airways Corporation. His flying experience extends from 1938 inCanada, with the Royal Air Force during the War and with British overseas airways Corporation since. He normally flies Constellations on Transatlanticflights.188. In December, 1953, Captain Kyle purchased and occupied a house on Russ Hill in the knowledge that a proposal to extend Gatwick Airportwas under consideration, but in his personal belief that it was not suitablefor a major airport of any description.189. On the question of Gatwick&apos;s use as an alternate, Captain Kyle statedthat before leaving America, the pilot had to specify the alternate to whichhe proposed to go if his destination was not open on account of bad weather. He would not name Gatwick as an alternate for London Airport,because it is too close to London and would be affected by the same weather conditions, and because Gatwick is not a suitable alternate &quot; owing to the hills, the surrounding terrain, etc.&quot;190. Captain Kyle pointed out that a pilot&apos;s knowledge of an alternateis limited, and he would require better conditions than he would in respectof an airport which he used regularly. A cloud base of 800 feet andforward vision of 2 miles were the minimum conditions under which hewould be prepared to bring a large aircraft into an airfield to which hewas not accustomed. At London Airport, the minimum cloud base is 300feet and the forward vision 1,200 yards.191. In his opinion, British Overseas Airways Corporation would lay down a minimum for Gatwick of about 700 feet cloud base and 2 milesforward vision if they were not normally using that Airport, but if they
were using it regularly it might drop to 600 feet and l\ miles, these figuresbeing his own personal estimates for strato--cruisers and Constellations. he did not purport to represent British Overseas Airways Corporation^ viewson this matter.192. Captain Kyle&apos;s objection to Gatwick arose substantially from thepresence of Russ Hill, which he regarded as the biggest obvious drawbackand which, despite all the modern aids and the 7,000 feet runway, wouldmake him &quot; unhappy &quot;. From the end of the runway to the hill is between1 and \\ miles, which is covered in about 30 seconds, during which timethe plane might be affected by wind and drift. He regarded Russ HiU asa difficulty, both for taking off and for landing for both of the main runways.193. Captain Kyle agreed that the Recommended Practice of a 1 in 50gradient is not achieved at all the aerodromes which he uses, but he wasnot satisfied with this gradient at Gatwick because of Russ Hill, although he had no criticism of the proposed Airport in good weather conditions.194. Captain Kyle said that he would be able to climb between 300 and400 feet in a heavy aircraft in the time required to traverse the 9,200 feetfrom the end of the strip of the northern runway to the highest projectionon Russ Hill and that the height between those two points is just over200 feet. He agreed that on Prestwick Aerodrome there are hills 172 feethigh at a distance of 7,200 feet from the end of the strip, which is worse than just over 200 feet at a distance of 9,200 feet at Gatwick. He wouldnot, however, agree that it was unnecessary to ask for a cloud base of700 feet at Gatwick, although 300 feet is the British Overseas airways corporation^ operational minimum at Prestwick.195. In Captain Kyle&apos;s opinion, the presence of the railway was a dis-advantage owing to the effect it would have on the Instrument LandingSystem. The presence of road and rail traffic, station and bridges would all tend to affect the safety equipment, but Russ Hill would affect the pilotmore.  .196. He stated that on probably 50 per cent, of occasions, he found the instrument Landing System at Airports not working.197. Captain Kyle is a member of the British Airline Pilots&apos; Association,but he spoke only as an individual member of that body and not for it.He was not aware that the two Pilots&apos; Organisations were satisfied withthe Gatwick proposals, and he did not know that British Overseas airways corporation had made no representations against them.198. Captain Kyle stated that, in his opinion, Gatwick would never be asuitable alternative to London Airport, because conditions would need tobe at least two and a half times better at Gatwick than&apos; at London, andthey would not be.199. Mr. Lamb then submitted written evidence on behalf of the Associa-tion. He put in a map showing the farm units affected by the proposal,which comprised in all eleven farms, plus a smallholding, and land occupiedby the Greyhound Racing Association. The total area in acres is 589,and full details of the production which comes from the different farms aregiven in a schedule attached to the Map.200. The written statements of the following persons were then read:  201. (a) Mr. E. G. PASSMORE, the County Secretary for the SurreyCounty Branch of the National Farmers&apos; Union testified that approximately600 acres of agricultural land would be taken into the Airport, and another100 acres used for new roads, and he gave estimates of the potentialproduction either of wheat or of milk of the several farms.
3202. (b) Mr. W. J. RUSSELL, past County Chairman of the national farmers&apos; Union, a member of the South Eastern Land Tribunal and of theSurrey County Council Agricultural Committee, supported the views on.land productivity expressed by Mr. Passmore.203. (c) Mr. E. A. DEWHURST, who farms Timfoerham Farm of 81acres stated that he purchased the farm in the Autumn of 1949 when theusual searches made by his Solicitors failed to reveal any mention of thepossible extension of Gatwick Airport. He poured much capital into the farm which is now a highly productive unit, all of which will be taken if both stages of the Scheme are carried out.204. id) Mr. JOHN EDWARD COOMBES testified that he purchasedthe Tea-Cup Cafe on A.23 in May, 1952, as a means of livelihood at a costof  8,030, partly financed by a mortgage, of which  3,000 is still outstanding.Mr. Coomtoes stated that he had no idea whatever when he acquired theproperty about the possibility of these developments. The road diversionwould ruin his business because it depended entirely on traffic on theBrighton Road, but his property would not be acquired nor would he be compensated.205. (e) Mr. SAMUEL CHARLES REEVE, who is the founder-proprietor of &quot;Sam&apos;s HalfHWay House&quot;, which he acquired and established as a wayside transport cafe in March, 1930. In 1952-53 he had a turnoverof  17,000 and provided full employment for seven people, with additionalhelp in the summer months. The road diversion would completely ruin his business, which depended entirely on traffic on the Brighton road, and hewould receive no compensation. His premises could only be sold at greatsacrifice and his efforts during the last 24 years and bis hopes and prospects for the future would be set at nought at his present age of 72.206. (f) Mr. GILBERT, who is the owner of the Aero Cafe at LowfieldHeath, a &quot; pull-in &quot; the bulk of whose trade is derived from main road traffic, and whose Cafe will be on a part of the diverted A.23 leading toa cul-de-sac. In 1953 the maximum nuimtoer of teas sold was 1,392 per day and the maximum number of teas per week in that year was 7,607. Thecertified turnover for 1953 was  8,000 with a net profit of some 10 per cent.He purchased the business in 1950 for the sum of  3,000 and he has sincespent  500 on enlargements and $fractional improvements and in fittings.The business will toe ruined, tout the property will not be purchased, norwill compensation be paid.207. (g) GATWICK MOTORS, Lowfield Heath, is another property whichwill be deprived substantially of its business, because it is on a part of thedisused A.23, near to the Aero Cafe. The property will not be purchasednor will compensation be paid.208. (h) iWJJNDMILL SERVICE STATION, Lowfield Heath, the purchaseof which was initiated by Mr. C. Brewer-Barclay in October, 1951, and completed in April, 1952. Between those dates Mr. Brewer-Barclay heard ofthe projected development of the Airport, tout his solicitors checked with theLocal and County Authorities, who stated that &quot; they were not aware ofany development plans&quot;, after which the property purchase was finally agreed. This diversion will cause a loss of 90 per cent, of his trade, and business failure will be inevitable.
209. MR. PERCY LAMB commenced his final statement by reading the objection of 2,500 to 3,000 persons whom he represented. In that objectionthe nature of the representations to be submitted on their behalf at this inquiry was that&quot; the proposed development should be abandoned on accountof the unsuitability of the site and of the effect of its proposed development on local interests.&quot; Mr. Lamb pointed out that after the Local authorities had objected to the proposals in 1952, substantial alterations had been madein them. He suggested that the Ministry should, in the light of the furtherobjections, think again and clear their minds of any pre-iconeeived notionthat Gatwick was the only place which could be used as an alternateaerodrome for London. On the evidence given, Mr. Lamb asked that thequestion of Russ Hill should be kept in mind and that Captain Kyle&apos;sevidence should be carefully considered, particularly his Observation on theuse of the airport for diversions. He also emphasised Captain Kyle&apos;s opinionthat the cloud base at Gatwick ought to be a minimum of about 700 feet withforward vision of 2 miles for pilots not normally using the Airport, witha reduction to 600 feet and 1-J- miles for pilots who use it as a main airport,and pointed out that Captain Woodman agreed that if the Instrument LandingSystem was not working properly at Gatwiek, he would expect the minimumcloud base to be 500 or 600 feet. Mr. Lamb also submitted that the AirLine Pilots&apos; Association had merely decided that they had no technicalobjections to the Gatwick development, as distinct from approving of it,and suggested that the Ministry&apos;s case was based largely on the absence of criticism from operators and pilots rather than on positive evidence of satis-faction with it. On the question of the weight penalty under which the biggest aircraft might have to operate on leaving Gatwick, Mr. Lamb saidthat no evidence had been forthcoming that British Overseas airways corporation would be prepared to operate their aircraft under such ahandicap.210. Mr. Lamb also commented on the limited meteorological recordsproduced in support of the Ministry&apos;s case, although Lord Douglas had statedthat meteorological records compiled &quot;over the past 10 years show thatGatwick has appreciably better weather than either London Airport orNortholt&quot;. If the only exhaustive examination into weather was that pro-vided in Mr. Best&apos;s evidence, and if the Minister had relied on other recordswhich he believed to exist, the matter ought to be reconsidered. He alsosubmitted that there was no evidence available to the Minister on the nightweather conditions at Gatwick, although British Overseas Airways Corpora-tion&apos;s Time-table showed that out of 73 arrivals and departures in one week,27 arrived in the night period. He suggested that the Ministry&apos;s case hadbeen put forward on the basis that the use of the aerodrome at night wouldbe limited, and against that point of view he quoted from British european airways&apos; Time-table, which showed at least 145 arrivals or departures each week during night hours. In the absence of witnesses from British overseas airways Corporation and British European Airways who were expected to operate from Gatwick, he suggested that &quot; there is insufficient fact and insuf-ficient data to justify this expenditure of money, the destruction of this district and the destruction of so many homes and agricultural fields &quot;.211. Mr. Lamb next quoted from a speech by Mr. Profumo in the Houseof Commons on 3rd December, 1952, in which discussing airports in thiscountry, he said &quot; it behoves us as a nation to provide the best possiblefacilities . . .&quot; which Mr. Lamb submitted Gatwick did not provide. Thetwo main runways had, because of site limitations, been placed closetogether, thus departing from the best principles of design, and the maximum
capacity could not be got out of therm the northern runway had also beenreduced by 1,000 feet. It was also proposed not to allow aircraft to come within five miles of the Airport below 2,000 feet without communicating with the aerodrome. This was an application of bad weather procedure toall types of conditions, which Mr. Lamb suggested was proposed becauseof certain shortcomings at Gatwick. Again, whilst strato--cruisers could takeoff at full load from London Airport and from Prestwick, they would notbe able to do so at Gatwick. London Airport, the only Airport to be builtsince Recommended Practices and Standards were agreed, complies withthose Recommendations and Standards, but Gatwiok would not.212. Mr. Lamb emphasised again the danger arising from the presence ofRuss Hill, and also suggested that Leith Hill was a danger about which no one had previously thought. Mr. Lamb also submitted that if thenorthern runway were used by heavy aeroplanes taking off in a westerlydirection, &quot; the life of, fear of and danger to people living in Charlwoodwill be so great that this project should be dismissed and not allowed togo forward &quot;.213. On the question of the proximity of the railway and the diverted A.23,Mr. Lamb stated that this matter was regarded as of great importance byhis clients, involving as it did, in his submission, risk from over-shootingand risk to people using the road and line.214. On the question of Home being a possible alternative to Gatwick,Mr. Lamb pointed out that his clients did not suggest that Home should beused as an airport, but they did emphasise that any disadvantage whichHome had was equally attributable to Gatwiok. In support of this statement the quoted from Captain Hunfs evidence that from the air traffic controlaspect, &quot; Gatwick has nothing that Home has not got&quot;. He also quotedfrom a letter from the Ministry of Civil Aviation dated 20th August, 1953,which stated that the main reasons for rejecting Home were that its develop-ment would cause insuperable air traffic control difficulties. These difficultiesaccording to Captain Hunt arose out of Biggin Hill, and Captain Hunt saidthat Gatwick was similarly situated to Biggin Hill in this respect. He also suggested that the runways from Home would involve low flying over or nearLingfield, Horley and Crawley, and that Horley and Crawley were similarlysituated if Gatwick were used. Comment was also made by the Ministrythat access to London from Home was inferior to that of Gatwick, and itwould be extremely cosdy to provide rail connections and to build an aerodrome at Home because, amongst other things, no use of facilitiesthat exist at Gatwick could be made. Mr. Lamb called attention to thefact that the only existing facilities at Gatwick appeared to be those in thepresent maintenance area, which it is proposed to abandon. If, therefore,Home and Gatwick were to be considered for the same purpose, the reasons give by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for refusing to go ahead with home, were fallacious or, in so far as they were accurate, are &quot; insufficientlygood reasons for embarking upon the Gatwick proposal &quot;.215. Mr. Lamb assumed that the Minister of Agriculture^ views wouldbe taken on the evidence submitted to this Inquiry on agricultural land,and he called attention to an expression used by Sir William Holford inevidence which does not appear in the shorthand note that &quot; wedges ofagricultural land between spreading centres of population, for example,Crawley, are absolutely essential&quot;. He submitted the land to be used wasnot bad agricultural land, and he suggested that when thrown into thebalance with the other submissions which he made, this agricultural land should not be used for the purpose of providing an enlarged Gatwick Airport.
On compensation, Mr. Lamb said that no Minister could shut hiseyes to the sad story of aged men who had saved up and spent their capitalon businesses which depended entirely on main road traffic, which businesseswould be destroyed by the road diversion. He suggested that there shouldbe a method devised for paying proper compensation to the people whose property would be taken, and that compensation he suggested should be assessed on the value of the property at the time when it was not proposedto develop Gatwick. In respect of the properties which were not to be acquired, he suggested that compensation should be paid for the destructionof businesses by a national scheme to be carried out for the national benefit.217. Finally, Mr. Lamb asked that an opportunity should be given fordiscussion in Parliament on this Report before a Government decision was finally taken.Country Landowners&apos; Association Surrey Branch218. Mr. JOHN H. WALKER, Secretary of the Surrey Branch of theCountry Landowners&apos; Association, made the following submissions withoutcalling evidence. The Association opposed the extension on the following grounds: - (1) the taking of approximately 700 acres of agricultural land would constitute a serious loss to Surrey ;(2) the Association regarded the preservation of the green belt area as ofthe utmost importance ;(3) they considered that the proposed Airport would bring a con-siderable increase in population, with the necessity for providingaccommodation which would further occupy open spaces and agricultural land.219. The Association asked the Government to consider alternative siteswhere less valuable agricultural land was available and where less damagewould be done to amenities.Crawley Industrial Group220. The objection of the Crawley Industrial Group was submitted byMr. OUTTRISS, A.C.I.S., the Chairman of that Group, without callingevidence. Mr. Cuttriss explained that the Group was an association ofindustrial undertakings operating in Crawley, with a membership of 35,whose undertakings offered potential employment utimately to 8,500 persons,and a combined capital investment of  3m. More than half the membersof the Group had either moved to Crawley or had made arrangements tomove before the announcement in 1952 of the proposals for developing the airport. They considered that the development was contrary to the under-taking made public when the New Town was adopted, and that they had beeninduced to undertake substantial capital investment under false pretencesif the amenities of the New Town were destroyed. In their view, the airport project would bring with it civil and war risks to industry and itsworkers, as well as distressing living conditions, industrial development would be arrested and disorganised, and road traffic congestion on A.23would be aggravated and would impede goods transit to and from CrawleyIndustrial area. Finally, the Group reiterated their complete opposition tothe proposal, which constituted a threat to the expectations they held whenthey undertook to come to the New Town; but if the development mustproceed in the national interest, they asked that safeguards on linesformulated by the planning experts should be made in the scheme and maintained in perpetuity.
Bowthorpe Holdings Ltd. and Mr. J. Bowthorpe224. Mr. JACK BOWTHORPE, Chairman.and Managing Director ofBowthorpe Holdings Ltd. and the owner of Lowfield Park, was called byMr. Harold Williams. Bowthorpe Holdings Ltd. have offices and factoriesat the north-east tip of Crawley New Town, where some 355 people are engaged in the production of products of the general nature of electrical engineering. Mr. Bowthorpe stated that his Company were established inCroydon before the War, that in 1939 they were advised by the Ministryof Aircraft Production to leave that area, whereupon they went to Oxford.Because of increase in business after the War he sought a bigger factorythan the Oxford premises provided, and ultimately he purchased the factory at Crawley in January, 1948. Before purchasing, Mr. Bowthorpe had dis-cussions with the Crawley Development Corporation and was told by themthat Gatwick would remain a small town Airport: if he had not had thatassurance, his Company would not have come to Crawley. Since pur-chasing the factory, the Company had spent  40,000 on buildings and roads,and had had plans prepared to build another factory on their adjoiningland at a cost of about  65,000, which he had delayed putting into executionuntil a decision had been arrived at on Gatwick.225. Mr. Bowthorpe stated that on three occasions since November lastyear, the noise from heavy aircraft made work in the office block im-possible for ten minutes at a time. The present degree of noise did not affect the work of the factory, but he feared that if jet aircraft used the aerodrome in the future a certain process carried out in the Company&apos;stool room would be &quot; quite out of the question&quot;, because a sudden airshock or a sudden movement by the operator would produce irreparabledamage. His apprehensions arose from the fear of jet engine noise fromthe maintenance area.226. Mr. Bowthorpe did not agree with the Crawley Development Cor-poration that the Airport would assist industrialists in disposing of products,nor did he regard the facilities of air transport as being of value to hisCompany.221. The objection of Gatwick Ltd. was submitted by MR. J. B. EVANS,Solicitor, without calling evidence. Gatwick Ltd. are the freeholders of theGatwick Racecourse and their holding comprises 360 acres of land with aGrand Stand and a number of other buildings used for race meetings.222. The land had been used as a Racecourse since 1891, a substantial part of it was requisitioned in 1940 and the Company have had virtually no use out of it since that time, although part was derequisitioned in 1942and more in 1949.223. Mr. Evans pointed out that a substantial part of the deviated A.23would pass through the Company&apos;s land, a substantial part would be requiredfor the terminal Airport in the first stage of the Scheme, and more would betaken when Stage II was carried out. Mr. Evans suggested that the noiseof aircraft, as soon as Stage I was completed, would make it impossibleto hold race meetings at Gatwick, that none of the Company&apos;s land wouldthen be of any practical use to them as Racecourse proprietors, and asked that the whole of the Company&apos;s land should be acquired on payment of adequate compensation.
&apos;. .227. Mr. JOHN S. LAVENDER, F.R.I.C.S., and a partner in the firm ofBernard Thorpe &amp; Partners, Estate Agents, etc., amplified the objection ofBowthorpe Holdings Ltd.228. Mr. Lavender produced a plan which showed that within a 9 milesradius of the Gatwick Airport there will in the near future be a population of162,000. Mr. Lavender expressed the opinion that with this density of population and from a planning point of view, it would be hard to find aless suitable position.229. Mr. Lavender said that the distance from the Bowthorpe factory tothe nearest point of the present Airport, i.e., the present maintenance area,was about 300 yards, and its distance from the proposed maintenance area would be about 1,000 yards. He, however, envisaged maintenance workvery different in future from that at present carried out. The factory would suffer from noise and vibration, and had he known that this extension was contemplated he would have advised Mr. Bowthorpe against the purchase ofthe factory in 1947.230. Mr. Lavender was of opinion that noise and vibration would lead tointerference with industrial processes and depreciation in the value of thefactory property, and that restrictions on the future development of the site,discomfort to the employees of the factory in and out of their working hours and the effect on the amenities of the district, would all seriously prejudice the Company. He agreed, that fast electric trains which set up a vibration,ran alongside the factory, and he also agreed that he had no information about the disturbance in the working of the factory created by the existingmaintenance area. Mr. Lavender was aware that certain general industries are carried on in the area of Airports, but he had seen communications fromindustrialists in the Heath Row area who complained bitterly about noise.231. Mr. Lavender produced a plan showing the situation of LowfieldPark, the private residence of Mr. Bowthorpe, which comprises a valuabledwelling-house, out-fbuildings, a garage, a tithe barn, the latter built in theearly 17th century, the house also being very old. All the buildings wouldbe demolished if the extension proceeded.232. Mr. HAROLD WILLIAMS, Q.C., LL.D., then made his submissionson behalf of Bowthorpe Holdings Ltd. and Mr. Bowthorpe. He emphasised that the Company made their first offer for the factory at Crawley in 1948,when they had been told that Gatwick was to remain a small airport,assurances which were given to them at a meeting with the development corporation, and which were published in the Development Corporation^Annual Reports in 1949 and 1950.233. Mr. Williams was very critical about the breaking of the solemnassurance by a Minister of the Crown which he submitted was involved inthe extension proposals, he called for the observance of the assurance, and submitted that the fact of its existence ought to end a consideration ofthese proposals.234. On the effect of noise at the factory of Bowthorpe Holdings Ltd.,Mr. Williams said that it might well be that it would be virtually impossibleto carry on work there, and a situation would arise in which they mightjustifiably say that by being brought there they had been defrauded.235. On Lowfield tPark, Mr. Williams referred to it as being a very lovelyhouse, built in the early 16-17th centuries which ought not to be destroyedunless the public interest required it, and he submitted that there was no
i jevidence whatever that the public interest did require such a sacrifice, andthat it was possible for an alternative site to be found. His clients con-sidered the scheme to be unsound, to be bad planning and not required inthe public interest.Povey Cross Motor Co.236. The objection of the JPovey Cross Motor Co. was submitted byMr. J. C. LYDDON, T.D., M.A., F.R.I.C.S., F.L.A.S., of Messrs. CharlesFox &amp; Co. Mr. Lyddon stated that the garage and petrol service stationowned by the Povey Cross Motor Co. sited at the junction of two mainroads A.217 and A.23 were acquired by them in 1945. One half of thebusiness came from the passing motorist and the other half from regularlocal customers. The property would not be acquired compulsorily, butthe business would suffer severely.237. Mr. Lyddon suggested that the proposed re-alignment of A.23 shouldbe amended in order to join the present line of that highway at Povey Crossinstead of further to the north. He submitted a plan which illustrated theamendment and asked that it should be submitted to the Ministry of transport for their consideration.Milton Mount College238 The objection of Milton Mount College was submitted by Mr.E. D. JEFFS, A.I.A.S., Secretary and Bursar. This College is an independentPublic School for Girls, founded in 1871, and is situated at Worth Parknear Crawley, where it has been since 1920. It has a population of 275using the premises, and the objections of the Board of Management are:  (1) that noise will interfere with the teaching work of the school;(2) that there will be danger to the school from the use of the Airportat all hours and in all weathers, and particularly in the event ofwar; and(3) the near proximity of the school buildings to the Airport, approxi-mately three miles, will seriously prejudice entry of pupils to theschool.Mr. S. R. Walker239. Mr. S. R. WALKER appeared in person to submit his objection.He is a Civil Servant, working in London, who purchased and made his homeat the Cottage Farm, Lowfield Heath in 1947, shortly after the time whenthe Government gave assurances to the Crawley Development Corporationthat Gatwick would not be developed. The farm is situated to the southof the southern boundary of the Stage I extension and to the north of theroad from Lowfield Heath to Charlwood. Mr. Walker pointed out that hisfarm is a part of a strip of land running the whole length of the southernrunway about 150-160 yards deep which lies between the Airport boundaryand the Charlwood Lowfield Heath road, that the few houses on this land would be completely isolated from Horley, to which place the occupierstravel for schools, shopping and all other amenities. At the most the houses would be about 300 yards from the runway, his own house being 280 and290 yards south of the runway and half way along its length. Mr. Walkerasked that the boundary of the Airport should be moved south to follow the line of the Charlwood Lowfield Heath road and include the area towhich he referred as land to be compulsorily acquired. Mr. Walker wasspeaking only for himself, and his request was that his property, at anyrate, should be acquired.
Miscellaneous Representations240. Written representations were received from the following, but noone appeared before me to amplify them:  London and South Eastern Regional Board for Industry.Mrs. Lydia Waghorn.South Eastern Electricity Board.Greyhound Racing Association Limited.The Automobile Association.The Royal Automobile Club.Mr. G. A. Hanscomb (for Ellis Farm and Hotel Company Limited).London Transport Executive.The Guild of Air Mots and Air Navigators of the British Empire.air work General Trading Company Limited (Works Committee).Airports Limited.241. The points raised in the representations, whether in support of or in opposition to the proposals were, I think, covered substantially by theparties who did appear, and I have no further comment to make on them.MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION&apos;S FINAL SUBMISSION242. Mr. MICHAEL ROWE commenced his concluding speech byreferring to the case of Mr. Walker, whose evidence was last heard. he stated that if I thought fit to mention the question of the basis of compensa-tion and the fact that no compensation is payable merely for injuriousaffection, and if I stated that, in my view, there is a case for consideration&quot; that is something which we shall certainly not seek in any way to prevent&quot;.On the question of Mr. Walker&apos;s land, he pointed out that the Ministry was bound to exercise due economy in promoting the scheme, but if I thoughtit proper to comment on the case and suggest that the land lying betweenthe present proposed southern boundary of the Airport and the Charlwood-Lowfield Heath road should fee acquired, the Ministry of Civil Aviationwould raise no objection.243. Mr. Rowe then commented on the forcefulness with which Counselfor Objectors had attacked the Ministry&apos;s case on the ground that thedevelopment of Gatwick was a breach of faith. There was a full realizationby the Government in office in 1950 and by the present Government thatassurances had been given that Gatwick was to remain a small Airport.But the necessity and the justification for the change of intention arose fromthe fact that, owing to the international situation, Stansted, which had been intended for use as the Civil alternate for London, had had to be developed for military aviation. In this situation the Government were forced to theconclusion that Defence requirements compelled the abandonment ofStansted for civil aviation purposes, and the selection of another site in its place became necessary.244. Mr. Rowe referred to the acrimony which had been displayed betweenthe local authorities and the Crawley Development Corporation, and hesuggested that because of the feeling which had been created by theCorporation ceasing to be objectors to the development of Gatwick, somefailure to take into proper and full account the national implications ofthe proposal as opposed to the local ones had occurred.
245. Mr. Rowe then dealt with the criticism that neither British european airways nor British Overseas Airways Corporation had appeared at the inquiry in support of the proposals, and he called attention to the fact thatthe Inquiry was for the purpose of hearing objections, and suggested that support, or at any rate acceptance, must be assumed unless an Organisationappeared as an objector.246. Mr. Rowe submitted that the problem for consideration was abalancing of the arguments in favour of and against the Gatwick extension.What the Ministry claim is that Gatwick is the best possible for the purposes specified, which had been described by Mr. Lawrence as: &quot;There will be a substantial use of Gatwick for diversions plus,a substantial and regular and probably increasing use for shortscheduled services with seasonal peaks, and there will also be use byoperators of chartered aircraft.&quot;It had to be accepted that a major airport was necessary for the purposesrequired of Gatwick, and it was clear that an aerodrome such as was proposed at Gatwick (less than London Airport with an acreage of 2,870and greater than Northolt with an acreage of 432) could be regarded asmajor. The Ministry considered that for some time to come one runwaywould suffice, but it was probable that expansion would be necessary, andthat a second runway and a subsidiary would be provided. If these runwaysproved to be insufficient for aircraft of the future, two runways could belengthened slightly, but beyond that nothing was contemplated, and if air traffic congestion in southern England became so great that further, facilities-must be provided, a totally new problem would arise, which would haveto be met in other ways.247. On the question of suitability, Mr. Rowe repeated his view thatGatwick was not ideal, but he claimed that it was suitable. The dominatingfactor in determining suitability was the question of air traffic control and,however perfect a site might be in other respects, it could not be considered at all unless it could fit in properly and safely with the air pattern oversouthern England. He recalled that Mr. Lawrence, in his closing speech,,stated that if the airport must be sited between Amber 1 and Amber 2&quot;I cannot imagine that there can be any other candidate for the honourexcept Gatwick.&quot; Mr. Rowe pointed out that Captain Hunt&apos;s evidenceindicated that the air traffic control plan for the new Airport must fitinto a picture without disrupting the air pattern of London Airport, which meant, amongst other requirements, avoiding the crossing of main airways,and the provision of a control zone and a holding area reasonably close to the Airport. When Captain Hunt was cross-examined about the 50 ormore alternate sites which had been examined, he pointed but that for about40 of them it was not possible to work out a satisfactory air traffic controlpattern. Others were eliminated on other grounds, and at the end of the irreview of alternatives the choice was reduced to an area between Amber 1and Amber 2 because of traffic control reasons. Mr. Rowe suggested thatthe question of air traffic control was crucial and that Gatwick must, inthose circumstances, be the right choice.248. On the question of suitability of Gatwick on the ground as opposedto in the air, Mr. Rowe replied to the criticisms that the lay-out wasinefficient and dangerous. The changes from the first scheme to the secondwere made because it was desirable to place the runways as far away fromthe railway as possible, and at the same time those changes permitted animprovement in the diversion line proposed for A.23, and reduced the noisecomplaint in respect of Horley.
z49. As to Russ Hill, Mr. Rowe said that it is a natural feature whichthey would prefer to be without, but he relied on the evidence of the Ministry&apos;stechnical experts, and of Captains Bressey and Woodman representing theBritish Air Line Pilots&apos; Association who, after careful consideration of theproposals, had come to the conclusion that they are in every way reasonablefrom the point of view of air safety, and that Russ Hill is no disadvantageat all from the safety aspect. Captain Woodman expressed the view thatthe regulations under which aircraft were certified to operate preclude RussHill from being a danger, and &quot; it was unanimously agreed that we haveno technical objections to the development of Gatwick &quot;.250. As to Leith Hill, Mr. Rowe pointed out that this hill is on the direct course of aeroplanes flying between London and the Continent andthat tens of thousands of aircraft fly over it every year, aircraft taking off and landing at Gatwick have passed over Leith Hill since 1935, and no evidence of an accident attributable to the presence of that hill was forth-coming.251. On the question of the proximity of A.23 to the Airport, Mr. Rowenoted that the Great South-West Road passes closer to the end of the mainrunway at London Airport than A.23 would be to Gatwick when developed,and there was no evidence that there had been any increased danger onthe Great South-West Road because of the presence of the Airport. Mr.Rowe recalled that the only Safety Regulation in reference to the height of aircraft passing over roads, required a clearance of 50 feet, and in fact the clearance over A.23 would be much greater. There had been 18,000flights a year from Gatwick Airport, the existing runways were close tothe railway and no accidents had occurred.252. On the question of the diversion of A.23 in the way suggested, whichis a temporary expedient, or alternatively in the way suggested by the SurreyCounty Council, to make it form part of the Brighton Radial Road, Mr. Rpweunderstood that the governing factor in this connection was finance, and adecision must be made on it by the Minister of Transport. He suggested,however, that the smaller scheme was a perfectly satisfactory one.253. On the evidence on weather given by Mr. Gold, Mr. Rowe suggestedthat his comparison of operational minima for London Airport with allnavigational aids and the present operational minima at Gatwick without suchaids was thoroughly unsound, and that Mr. Gold was applying tests toGatwick which would have no relevance to Gatwick developed in the waysproposed.254. On the question of the width between the two main runways, Mr.Rowe agreed that the capacity of Gatwick would be increased if the widthwere extended, but he disagreed with the suggestion that its reduction meant that the site was unduly cramped.255. On cross-wind component in relation to the subsidiary runway,Mr. Rowe submitted that such knowledge as Mr. Gold had on this subject was now out of date. He also submitted that Mr. Gold had misinterpretedthe cross-wind component calculation made by aircraft manufacturersindicating the amount of cross-wind which their aircraft could stand, and for those reasons he submitted that Mr. Gold&apos;s evidence on this question couldnot be accepted.256. On the differences between the evidence given by Mr. Best for theMinistry and Mr- Gold for the Surrey County Council, Mr. Rowepointed out that Mr. Best&apos;s conclusion was that within the London area and
within a reasonable distance of London, Gatwick was no worse than the generality of other airports in that locality, whereas Mr. Gold stated that from the aspect of radiation fog &quot; Gatwick is about as bad as can beimagined.&quot; He pointed out that Gatwick had been used as an airport since1935, and suggested that if the weather was as bad as Mr. Gold considered it to be, operators would have appeared at this Inquiry in opposition.257. Mr. Rowe then commented on the weather generally, first in connec-tion with the use of Gatwick as an airport in its own right. He agreed thaton the evidence, Gatwick is not ideal, but he submitted that Gatwick wasno worse and in many respects better than the world&apos;s greatest Airport,London, and that if Gatwick was unfit to foe a major airport, London Airportwas also unfit. On weather, from the point of view of diversions, Mr. Rowesuggested that Gatwick would be &quot; in &quot; on about one occasion in every twothat London was &quot; out.&quot; He questioned the reliability of the assumptionswhich Mr. Gold made on physical science grounds in the absence of nightobservations of weather conditions at Gatwick, and he called attention to Mr.Best&apos;s view that there was no evidence to support the theory that Gatwickwould be worse at night than in day-time, and also to the absence of evidenceof the extent of atmospheric pollution which Mr. Gold suggested would arise from the development of Crawley New Town.258. On the question of noise, Mr. Rowe agreed that Lowfield Heath wouldbe the area worst affected, and that Charlwood would be materially affected,but ihe suggested the numbers of persons affected by noise from Gatwiokwould not be excessive having regard to the pre-requisite that the alternateairport must be somewhere within reasonable distance of London. Crawleywould not be appreciably affected, and he pointed out that the evidence of theCrawley Development Corporation was that residents and industrialists hadnot been deterred from coming to Crawley when the threat of the aerodromeextension was known to them.259. In reference to noise from the maintenance area, Mr. Rowe pointedout that so far as the Bowthorpe Factory is concerned, the factory nearest tothe maintenance area, the new area would be almost three times as far awayas the existing maintenance area. He expected that the number of occasions on which jets would be used at Gatwick would be small, and he emphasised that the Bowthorpe Factory is alongside a main electrified railway line,which must produce an appreciable amount of vibratioDLand noise.260. On planning, Mr. Rowe pointed out that the Surrey development plan proposed to retain the area in so far as it is not already used as an aerodrome, as agricultural land, and Sir William Holford&apos;s view was that itshould be kept as an open space, thus avoiding continuous built-up areas.Mr. Rowe suggested that the user of land as an aerodrome would in fact have that effect, because nine-tenths of the area would remain open.261. On agriculture, Mr. Rowe submitted that the total output in 1952 wasnot great, and that it would be difficult to find in the Home Countiesagricultural land which showed a much lower yield than the statistics pro-duced indicated.262. On the question of cost, Mr. Rowe suggested that even  10m.expended represented a very small amount when related to the number of passengers to be carried, and he submitted that expenditure of comparablesize would have to be incurred wherever the alternate was sited.
263. Finally, Mr. Rowe submitted that, despite the damage which wouldregrettably be done to a number of individuals, the conclusion must bereached that Gatwick was a suitable site for the purposes for which .it waswanted, and that the Governments proposal should be confirmed.CHAIRMAN&apos;S OBSERVATIONS264. My duty is to report to you, Mr. Minister, on the evidence tendered to me at the Inquiry, and particularly on the matters raised by way ofobjection to the Ministry of Civil Aviation&apos;s proposals.265. The hearing, which occupied fifteen days, covered very fully all mat-ters which the Ministry and the Objectors and other parties to the proceedingsregarded as relevant to the objects for which the Inquiry was held.266. Case for the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The Ministry&apos;s case was explained by Counsel and supported by a body of competent expert witnesses,who gave their reasons for the choice of Gatwick for the three purposes forwhich another major aerodrome in the vicinity of London is necessary. Theirsubmission was that, although Gatwick is not ideal, it is suitable for allthe requirements contemplated of it, and that it will be better able, on balance, to meet those requirements than any other site in the area.267. Situation of Site. It emerged during the hearing that the Ministryattached great importance to the siting of the Airport in the area which lies between the Air Traffic Lanes serving London Airport known as Amber 1and Amber 2. These lanes are shown on a Map attached to this Report and,if a site must be found between them for air traffic control reasons, it isdifficult to see how any other site can be found better suited to require-ments than Gatwick: indeed, even if the terms of reference for the Inquiryhad permitted, I do not think that any Objector would have attempted toput forward an alternative so situated. But the Surrey County Council con-tend that Amber 1 and Amber 2 are Traffic Lanes designed to fit into a given pattern of Airports, and that the Technical Officers of the Ministry ofCivil Aviation can, if another site is chosen, work out a satisfactory aircontrol pattern for it and for the other aerodromes in the area. This is a technical matter on which I am unable to express an authoritative opinion,but it is one of major importance, because, in the Ministry&apos;s submission,however perfect a site might be in other respects, it cannot be considered at all unless it can be fitted in properly and safely with the air pattern of Southern England. I suggest, therefore, that you might give prior con-sideration to this matter in the light of the evidence tendered, and of such further advice as may be available to you.268. Weather. A great deal of time was taken at the Inquiry on theimportant subject of weather. On this matter difficulties arose because ofthe total absence of statistics of weather conditions at Gatwick at night,and of the limited statistical data available of day-time weather. TheMinistry&apos;s expert witness was of opinion that there is no substantial differ-ence in weather conditions in several places which might be regarded aspossible sites for a diversionary airport, and that therefore for that purpose the choice of a site ought to be made on considerations other than meteoro-logical. He was of the same opinion in reference to the site for its otheruses, and regarded the weather generally at Gatwick as rather better thanat London Airport in winter and rather worse in summer. He consideredthat the statistics available were sufficient justification for the opinionshe expressed, and that if others had been available they would not have
shown Gatwick&apos;s weather as different from that indicated in his StatisticalTables. On the other hand, the Surrey County Council&apos;s expert witness,whilst accepting the statistical data submitted by the Ministry, drew con-clusions in the absence of statistics as to night weather conditions which were very critical of the site. He based his conclusions on the laws of physicalscience, which led him to believe that Gatwick is a thoroughly bad site foran alternate airport, and not as good as other sites in southern england for an airport for all purposes. The data available, in my opinion, sub-stantiates the view which was expressed by the Ministry&apos;s witnesses thatmeteorologically the site is suitable. As, however, there is a difference of opinion between the parties about weather at times for which no statisticsare available, and as the Objectors attach considerable importance to theircriticism of this feature of Gatwick, I suggest that the evidence which bothexpert witnesses gave, and the Statistical Tables Which they put in, should be carefully considered by such technical advisers as are at your disposal, andtheir views ascertained for your further guidance.269. The County Councils Meteorological witness also gave evidence onthe potential danger to light types of aircraft using Gatwick from crosswinds and eddies on landing and at take-off. This witness has not been closely associated with aviation matters since his retirement in 1947, andI am not satisfied that he has sufficient knowledge of modern aircraft tojustify the conclusions to which he came.270. Planning. An objection on planning grounds was pressed stronglyby the Surrey County Council and the other Local Authorities in the area.It was put to me that to use Gatwick for the purposes contemplated is completely opposed to the good planning of that part of Surrey, that itcould not possibly toe justified on planning grounds, and that the interestsof planning are irreconcilable with it. The Crawley Development Corpora-tion who, it should be noted, are the Planning Authority for Crawley NewTown, and who for many years until after the issue of the White Paperstrenuously opposed the development but at the Inquiry accepted it inthe national interests, also consider the proposal to toe bad planning. Theevidence of Sir William Holford on this point is emphatic, and I would say that quite obviously the imposition of an Airport of the size contemplatedinto a semi-rural area will change the character of the area completely,and will require a drastic revision in the Planning Authority^ intentionsthat the existing use of the land in the area should continue. Planningis a part of this question which is the responsibility of your Department,and you will doubtless consider the views of your advisers in this connec-tion. In my opinion, a change in the character of, at any rate, a partof this area has already taken place as a result of the development of theCrawley New Town, a change which will extend as the New Town grows,and it may be that a change probably as great would occur wherever an airport is sited.271. Noise. An objection raised by almost every party appearing beforeme arose out of the anticipated effect of noise on amenities and on industry,which would occur as a result of the Airporfs extension. There can beno doubt that this is a widely held and well justified fear, and that all parts of the area will be affected, some very substantially. Whilst theMinistry promised that everything possible would be done in the construc-tion of the Airport and its buildings and in its subsequent user to minimisethis great nuisance, whatever precautions are taken it will clearly be verymuch noisier in certain parts of the area than it has hitherto been, particu-larly in Charlwood and in Lowfield Heath.   Charlwood is a village quite
separate from, and is apparently unaffected by the development of CrawleyNew Town. It contains buildings of historic value, and has many valuable and well designed dwellings. Lowfield Heath is a village near to theLondon-Brighton Road, and has some attractive residential development,which will be much disturbed, and although the experience gained by theMinistry at London Airport in the use of baffle walls, etc. may help to minimise the nuisance, I believe that properties, particularly in these twoplaces will, because of noise, depreciate in value, and the amenities atpresent enjoyed by the residents will be substantially prejudiced. Obviously,nuisance from noise will arise wherever an Airport is placed, but the sub-mission which was made to me was that it ought to be possible to find a site in which fewer people would suffer in this way. One witness estimatedthat the population within a nine mile radius of Gatwick Airport would,in the near future, be 162,000, and implied that that number of persons would be prejudiced. In my opinion, the Surrey County Council&apos;s estimateof 75,000 persons as being affected is more realistic. The embargo onthe discussion of sites situated in less populated areas prevented Objectorsfrom suggesting any alternative to Gatwick from this point of view, butthe effect of noise at Gatwick merits your consideration as a substantialpoint against the proposal.272. Orographical Features. Another disadvantage of the site which was stressed by most of the Objectors was the presence of Russ Hill, aneminence about 360 feet above sea level, which is in some degree in the flight line to the west of the two main runways. The Ministry maintain that, with the navigational aids which will be available, Russ Hill is nota danger, and that opinion was corroborated by two Pilot Captains, one in the employ of British Overseas Airways Corporation and the other with british European Airways, who were authorised to represent the views ofthe Air Line Pilots&apos; Association. Another British Overseas airways corporation Captain, on the other hand, with considerable experience ofpiloting large aircraft, but speaking only for himself, expressed concern atthe potential danger of Russ Hill in bad weather at a time when the naviga-tional aids might not be in order. On balance, the evidence seemed tome to indicate that Russ Hill is not a seriously Objectionable feature ofGatwick.273. Proximity of Main Road and Railway. Other dangers were envisaged by the Objectors, particularly from the close proximity of the runway-endsto the busy London-Brighton A.23 Road and the electrified main line rail-way. In my opinion, this juxtaposition increases in some slight degree thepossibility of an accident and the likely consequences thereof, but theevidence of the Ministry&apos;s officers, supported by the two Pilots called bythe Ministry, show that conditions at least as difficult as these exist at other Airports, and that at London Airport the Great South-West Roadis only 500 yards from the end of the main instrument runway. Theproximity of a railway line to an aerodrome also appears to be notuncommon in various parts of the world, and is asserted to be of nosignificance if the required clearance is provided, as it is at Gatwick. Itwas emphasised that Gatwick Airport has been in use since 1935, and thatno accident has occurred in that period.274. Size. The smallness of the site, which, when both Stages have been constructed will comprise 1,000-1,100 acres, was also criticised, and it was submitted that the design and lay-out had been dictated and prejudiced by site limitations. It will not be possible further to extend the Airportexcept by a slight extension of the two main runways, and the Objectorssubmitted that a new Airport should not be constructed which would not
permit of considerable extension, if an extension should prove to be neces-sary. There is, in my opinion, considerable substance in this criticism,but the Ministry&apos;s reply is that the site is sufficient for all the requirementsthat are likely to arise, and that if London air traffic increases to such an extent as to need more facilities a new problem will arise which will need to be met by the provision of an Airport elsewhere.275. Cost. The question of cost ( 6 m. for the first Stage and  4 m.for the second) was also emphasised. The Objectors&apos; view was that  10 m.is an excessive sum to pay for an Airport which, in their opinion, would fall short of the ideal in many respects. Much expense would, they pointedout, be incurred in unremunerative work, e.g. on stream diversions, theacquisition and demolition of property, and the re-routing of the London-Brighton Road. It is true that money of an unremunerative character willbe spent if Gatwick is extended but this would appear to be inevitablewherever an airport is constructed. As to the total cost of  10 nr., itis, in the absence of the estimated cost of alternatives, impossible to comment, but it may be of interest to note that the estimated final costof London Airport is  26 m. for an aerodrome occupying 2,870 acres.276. Changed Government Policy Hardship. Much emphasis was placed by the Objectors on the hardships caused by the change in government policy which had resulted in Gatwick being selected for extension afterassurances had been given by Ministers that it was to be used in futureonly for private and charter flying: Counsel for one Objector submitted that the importance of observing undertakings such as were given here was sufficient of itself to justify the rejection of the proposal. The giving of these assurances was of course admitted by Counsel and witnesses forthe Ministry, and the reasons why the Ministry felt compelled to disregardthem appear in Mr. Michael Rowe&apos;s concluding speech. It is, however,clear that this change of mind will, if the extension proceeds, cause unusualhardship on individuals who purchased properties at a time when theintention to make Gatwick a major airport had been specifically rejected,and the value of whose interests will be seriously depreciated. Illustrationsof this kind of hardship appear on page 36 of this Report TimberhamFarm, Tea-Cup Cafe, Windmill Service Station, and on page 42 Mr. S. R.Walker, and if Gatwick is to be extended whatever is possible should bedone to mitigate the hardship.277. Agriculture. The loss of agricultural land involved in the proposals was also raised by the Objectors, particularly the Gatwick Protest Associa-tion, who submitted a Table of Agricultural Holdings which were affected and their potential food-producing capacity. This question inevitably ariseswhenever it is proposed to use land for development, and the submissionmade to me was that it ought to be possible to find a site the taking ofwhich would do less damage to agriculture. I have no doubt that theevidence tendered to me will be considered by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and his views obtained on this part of the problem ; butin this connection I would point out that a considerable area of the landproposed to be acquired is at present part of the Gatwick Race-course,and is not therefore used for agricultural purposes. In the circumstances,I do not regard an objection on agricultural grounds as being weighty.278. Absence of Evidence from Operators^ There was criticism also con-cerning the absence of evidence that British Overseas Airways corporation and British European Airways would use Gatwick Airport for the purposes for which it is intended to be used. The Ministry&apos;s reply to this criticismwas that the Inquiry was for the purpose of hearing objections, and that it
IPwas therefore unnecessary for those Corporations to appear. I agree that ona strict interpretation of the terms of the Inquiry the appearance of supporters of the Ministry&apos;s proposals was unnecessary, but I would suggest that, ifyou propose to permit this development, specific assurances should first beobtained from the two Corporations and from any other operators expectedto use Gatwick that the new Airport will meet their needs and that theywill use it in the way and to the extent envisaged by the Ministry of CivilAviation.279. Summary^ Summarised as best I can, these are the main objections which were made to me. The Objectors submitted that collectively theyproved that Gatwick would fall so far short of the ideal in so many respectsthat it could not be said to be suitable, and that the Ministry should lookelsewhere for a solution to the difficulties which are arising at London Air-port. The Ministry say that whilst Gatwick will not be ideal, it will be suitable for all the purposes for which it is needed, and in that belief theyask for approval to it. The advantages and disadvantages of the site emergein the summary of evidence and speeches set out in the preceding pages, andon balance, and subject to your being satisfied on the several points I raisein these observations, I consider that the Ministry&apos;s contention that Gatwickis a &quot; suitable &quot; site for an aerodrome for the purposes for which they intend to use it was established. As to whether it is the most suitable site whichcould be found, it is not, because of the limitation of the scope of the inquiry, possible for me to express an opinion.280. Safeguards and Conditions. If you decide that the extension ofGatwick shall proceed, the question of safeguards and conditions, and possiblyamendment of the scheme in detail, requires consideration. It is obviousthat the creation of a major airport anywhere brings with it considerablehardship, inconvenience and interference of amenities, and if those misfortunesare imposed on a large body of persons in order to serve the national interests, all possible and reasonable steps ought to be taken to minimisetheir effect.281. The Crawley Development Corporation have discussed this question with the Ministry of Civil Aviation very fully, and their requests are setout in detail in this Report. I understand that the Ministry has in substanceagreed to afford the safeguards asked for, and in so far as they can be con-ceded without prejudicing other parties, I hope that you will find it proper toissue your approval subject to them. Some of these safeguards will be ofbenefit to other Objectors, but many residents and workers other than thosein the New Town who will be affected by noise and will suffer other hard-ships, should receive similar consideration. Some areas will be subjected tothe serious annoyance of low-flying aircraft above or in very close proximity to dwellings and other buildings which have hitherto enjoyed a reasonablemeasure of quietude, and I urge strongly that whatever can be done in theconstruction of the Airport and in its subsequent use to minimise the effects of noise both from the maintenance area and from aircraft shall be provided.The Ministry undertook also to install the most complete navigational aidsat Gatwick, and they will, I am sure, take all other precautions to avoid the possibility and minimise the consequences of accidents.282. A.23 Diversion. The question of the diversion of the London -Brighton Road (A.23) also merits some further consideration. The lineproposed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation is the shortest possible alternative to that part of the road which passes through the land required for the air-port extension, but in addition to creating some congestion between the MainLine Railway and the eastern ends of the main runways, its construction
requires expenditure of  212,000 which, when the London Brighton RadialRoad is made, will be abortive. If the road were diverted further to the eastit could be designed to form a part of the Radial Road. Not only would this alternative save abortive expenditure, but it would also avoid the towingof aircraft over A.23 during the period of two years which the proposal inits present form appears to compel. I understand that the Ministry ofTransport feel unable to finance this alternative at the present time, but itwould seem proper that they should again consider the matter with theobject of making now, as part of this scheme, a small part of the RadialRoad.283. Another point on the road pattern emerged from the objection of thePovey Cross Motor Company, who put in a plan showing an alternative proposal for the diversion of A.23 which avoids the by-passing of theirpremises. I suggest that the views of the Ministry of Transport should beobtained on this proposal also.284. Delimitation of Airport Boundaries. The Surrey County Councilcalled my attention to the effect on certain properties of the drawing of the boundary lines which delimit the area of land to be acquired compulsorily.The boundaries appear to have been drawn so as to require the acquisitionof as small an area as possible, but the result of so doing is by no meansalways satisfactory. An illustration of the difficulty which arises is to befound in Bonnetts Lane, which is situated at the south-west end of theproposed southern runway. In this Lane some properties are to be acquiredand others immediately adjoining them are not, because they will not beactually inside the Airport limits. Moreover, between a considerable lengthof the southern runway and the Lowfield Heath Charlwood Road is a stripof land about 200 yards wide which will be cut off from other areas, andwhich will be so close to the runway as to make its user for any non-airportpurpose extremely uncomfortable. I suggest that this land should be in-cluded in the area to be acquired compulsorily, thus meeting the desiresof at least one owner of property therein, Mr. S. R. Walker, and that thewhole line be reviewed and amended as may be found to be desirable.285. It is proposed to acquire no land or buildings on Russ Hill, but it isobvious that living conditions there will be much less comfortable in thefuture than they have been in the past. I would urge that if any owners of dwellings on Russ Hill who purchased during the time when the Ministrydid not intend to extend Gatwick and in reliance on that assurance desireto sell their property, the Ministry should be authorised to purchase it on as generous a basis as the law of compensation permits. If on this basis the compensation proves to be inadequate, the payment of an ex-gratiasum should be considered. There are probably other dwellings and smallbusiness premises in respect of which the same considerations apply, and Ithink that their owners too should be similarly regarded. I anticipate that many permanent employees of the Ministry at the Airport will desire or willbe required to live in the vicinity, and properties so purchased might be very useful for their occupation.286. Hardship. There are illustrations in the case presented on behalf ofthe Gatwick Protest Association of hardship which will arise where busi-nesses built up over many years, and being the only assets of the owners,will suffer severely in consequence of road diversions. These cases are ofcourse not peculiar to Gatwick, as indeed they arise on almost every occasionwhen a substantial road diversion occurs, but if and when the general ques-tion of compensation for injurious affection arising out of the carrying out of
public works is considered, they will serve to illustrate the type of hardshipwhich occurs. There are also, however, cases where interests were pur-chased or established during the time when it was not intended to developGatwick, and to these owners special consideration ought to be given whereit can toe shown that financial hardship will arise because of the Govern-menfs change of mind. I suggest that in proper cases the hardship shouldbe minimised toy ex-gratia payments.287. Consultation with Local Authorities. There is one other matter towhich I would call attention, and to which I referred at the commencementof this Report, namely the absence of early consultation by the Ministry ofCivil Aviation with the Local Authorities. The Surrey County Council andthe Dorking and Horley Rural District Council resented, and, in my opinion,properly resented the fact that a scheme of this magnitude so seriously affect-ing their areas should have been developed so fully without their being brought into consultation on it. It is difficult to understand why the CrawleyDevelopment Corporation should have been accorded confidences which werewithheld from tooth Surrey and Dorking, and I hope that in future the Minis-try will seek the views and enlist the support of the Local Authorities much earlier than they did in connection with Gatwick.288. Finally, I desire to say how much I was helped in my task of hearingand reporting on the very large amount of evidence given toefore me, by the care and efficiency with which all parties to the proceedings had preparedtheir cases, and by the competence and courtesy with which those cases were submitted by Counsel and witnesses. There were no precedents for an inquiry of this kind, but the realisation toy all concerned of the importanceof the subject matter and of the necessity for a temperate submission of their point of view produced an atmosphere which assisted me immensely in considering the many difficult and technical matters which came underreview.I also express my sincere thanks to the Officers of your Department,especially Mr. S. W. C. Phillips for his valuable advice on procedure andfor the manner in which he put the resources of your Department at mydisposal, and to Mr. J. R. Lay ton, who acted most efficiently as my Secretary.COLIN CAMPBELL,Chairman.24th June, 1954.
APPENDIX IHISTORY OF GATWICK AERODROMEThe first Aerodrome Licence recorded was granted to Home Counties AircraftServices Limited for what was described as the &quot; Cotland Farm Site.&quot; That sitecovered an area of about 90 acres. The Licence was granted on the 1st August,1930 and was classified as &quot; private all types.&quot;In 1933 the aerodrome became the property of the Red Wing Aircraft CompanyLimited who, in turn, sold it to Horley Syndicate.In 1934 Airports Limited was formed with the object of acquiring and developingGatwick Airport. The Aerodrome Licence was converted to a &quot; Public RestrictedInstructions &quot; Licence on the 1st March, 1934 and entered in the name of AirportsLimited. Development of the site included acquiring an additional 99 acres,constructing a terminal building, having a railway station built, and diverting GatwickStream.On 6th June, 1936, Gatwick Aerodrome was opened by Lord Swinton, Secretaryof State for Air. It was used from 1936-37 by British Airways Limited who left forHeston, due principally to bad weather (see evidence on this point on pages 58-59,Day 4; pages 55-56, Day 5 of the shorthand note of the Inquiry proceedings). Itwas also used by private aircraft owners and a few Charter Companies, and in 1937contracts were entered into between the Air Ministry and Airports Limited for theoperation of R.A.F.V.R. Schools. These contracts were followed by a contract for a &quot; Direct Entry School.&quot;In September, 1939, the Aerodrome was requisitioned by the Air Ministry for use by the Royal Air Force. Its area was later extended by further requisitioning toinclude part of Gatwick Racecourse. As regards its use, the attached documentmarked A has been obtained from the Historian Branch of the Air Ministry. Itis not possible, however, to ascertain the actual degree of use by the different unitsconcerned without considerable research by the Air Ministry, which would takea good deal of time.Since the War, the Aerodrome has been retained under requisition and has beenoperated as a Civil Customs Aerodrome by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. On the1st March, 1949, the Ministry of Civil Aviation gave notice that Gatwick wouldbe derequisitioned in September, 1949; but there was a change of policy and thederequisitioning did not take place.June, 19402nd July, 19403rd September, 1940 until13th January, 1943.7th April, 1943 until 23rdJune, 1943.1st June, 1943   ...5th July, 1943 until 12thAugust, 1943.GATWICK UNDER THE ROYAL AIR FORCE ASEPTEMBER, 1939 to AUGUST, 1946......
