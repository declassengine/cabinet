(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)secret cabinet OFFfCP // &apos;C(54) 211 RECORD COPY&quot; COPY NO.26th June, 1954CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation on 23rd June, with the support of the Secretary of State for Scotland,I sought the approval of the Home Affairs Committee for a draft White paper on the  Reorganisation of the Railways (H.A.(54) 15th Meeting, Item l).    this paper embodied the Scheme and Explanatory Statement submitted to me bythe British Transport Commission on 15th April.2.        Among the bodies which I have consulted under section 17(1) of theTransport Act, 1953 (they are listed on page 4 of the attached White Paper)only the Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Trades Union Congressdislike the Commission^ proposals - a dislike rooted mainly in dislikeof the Act itself.     In view of the general support the Secretary of.State.forScotland and I felt able to accept the proposals without amendment, savefor two minor drafting amendments to the Explanatory Statement.3.        The Home Affairs Committee approved the draft White Paper,subject to further consideration of certain points raised in discussion.4.        I was invited to consider a re-casting of the White Paper so as topresent the British Transport Commission^ submission to me as the mainpart of the paper, more clearly discernible as their document and not mine.This I have done.5.        The Secretary of State for Scotland and I were invited to considerwhether Scotland would be better dealt with in a distinct paragraph.    Inthe matters dealt with in the White Paper, Scotland is treated in almost exactly the same way as the other railway regions.    We think, therefore,that it would be unwise to suggest, as a separate paragraph about scotland would, that the Scottish position is a special one.    It is, of course, stillour intention to set up a Scottish Transport Council to co-ordinate all forms of publicly-owned transport - air,,sea, rail and road - in Scotland,and, while this is hardly a point to be dealt with in the White Paper itself,I propose to tell the Scottish Council before the White Paper is published that the Government intend to appoint this special co-ordinating body assoon as the Scottish Area Authority has been constituted.6.        I was invited to reconsider with the Chairman of the commission the wording of paragraph 27(f) of the Commission^ Explanatory Statement.As the whole of this paragraph relates to the responsibilities proposed forthe Area Authorities in relation to their areas, we feel that any attemptto specify (f) as being a regional matter is undesirable.    We prefer thatthe paragraph should remain unchanged.-1-
7. The question of the publication of the White Paper and the subsequentdebate thereon in both Houses presents difficulty.8.        The Chairman of the Transport Commission, in face of considerabledifficulty, submitted his Scheme to me three weeks in advance of thestatutory time allowed to him.    He urged that, in view of the difficultieswhich the present period of uncertainty is creating for the railways,Parliamentary approval of the Scheme should be secured before the Houserose for the summer recess.    I was most anxious to meetSir Brian Robertson&apos;s difficulties, and in my efforts to do so I have receivedready co-operation from the interests I have consulted, many of whomexperienced considerable inconvenience in giving me their views within thetime I stipulated.9.        I informed the House on 5th May that I had received theCommission^ Scheme and it is, I think, common knowledge that I have completed my consultations on it and that it has received general support.Early publication is everywhere expected and I think pressures will be such that it will be impossible to postpone it.    To fail to complete theParliamentary processes before the House rises would not only add in amost regrettable way to the difficulties of the Commission, but might wellprejudice the existing generally favourable attitude to the Scheme andconsequently its passage through Parliament.10.       I submit the draft White Paper for Cabinet approval.     I believethat immediate publication is unavoidable and I urge most strongly that theparliamentary processes be completed before the summer recess.A. T.

37RAILWAYS REORGANISATION scheme. During the passage of the Transport Bill in 1953, the Government under-took that a White Paper should be introduced into both Houses ofParliament containing the proposals for the reorganisation of the railways,and that this should be the subject of debate in both Houses. The Ministerof Transport and Civil Aviation would then consider all that was said inthe debates on the White Paper before tabling the Draft Order embodying the Reorganisation Scheme and seeking the affirmative resolution of bothHouses.2. In accordance with the provisions of section 16 (1) of the transport act, 1953, the British Transport Commission submitted to the Minister ofTransport and Civil Aviation on 15th April last a Scheme for the reorganisa-tion of their Railways.3. In accordance with section 17 (1) of the Act of 1953 the Minister hasconsulted with such bodies representative of classes of persons likely tobe specially affected by the Scheme, as he thought fit, and with the national coal Board.  A list of the bodies so consulted is attached.4. Those consultations have shown the Commission^ Scheme to be gener-ally acceptable and, in particular, acceptable in making possible a properdegree of decentralisation of management and control, and as being suffi-ciently flexible to allow for the development of regional management as experience develops of the Area Authorities which the Commission proposeto appoint.5. As a result of these consultations, the Minister, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland as section 17 (6) of the Transport Act, 1953,requires, has seen no necessity to suggest any modification of the Com-mission&apos;s Scheme as originally submitted to him, nor has he thought itnecessary to suggest, except in one or two minor ways, any modification ofthe covering Statement which accompanied the Scheme. The Commission^Scheme and covering Explanatory Statement, as thus amended, are annexed.6. The Minister fully agrees with the Commission^ view that the scheme must be widely drawn and flexible if it is to facilitate an orderly and fruitfuldevelopment of decentralised management. Nevertheless, the Minister isaware that, although it is generally recognised that it is not possible at thisstage to be in all respects precise, a greater clarification of the relationship between the British Transport Commission, the Area Authority and the ChiefRegional Manager would be welcomed. He has therefore consulted theChairman of the British Transport Commission who has sought to make theCommission^ intentions more clear in this respect by informing the minister in the following sense:  (a) The British Transport Commission is a policy forming body.(b) The Area Authorities are also policy forming at area level, andsupervisory. They are not intended to be executive organs of day-to-day management, nor will they toe suitably composed for thatpurpose. In this they resemble the boards of the former railwaycompanies.(c) In spite of (a) above, there are certain matters of day-to-day manage-iment requiring general treatment. The wagon stock, for example,must toe managed so that it is put to the best possible use throughoutthe country ; some large undertakings prefer to do their business
with British Railways by negotiation at the centre instead ofseparately in the six Regions. Other examples could be quoted.There must be a focus for these and like matters, and that focusmust be within the Commission^ headquarters. The organisationat British Transport Commission headquarters is not final in that respect yet, but it can be taken that a clear focus for these mattersof executive railway management will have to exist, in addition tothe Commission^ policy making machinery.id) It is common sense that direct contact should exist between this element of executive management within British Transport Corn-mission headquarters and executive management in the person ofthe Chief Regional Manager in the Region. Moreover new policyitself is more often than in any other way initiated by discussion between those who are responsible for the daily operation of existing policy. This is an additional reason for direct contact betweenthem. This is no more a by-passing of the Area Authority thanit is a by-passing of the British Transport Commission. It is merely two policy-making bodies freely admitting that a numberof day-to-day matters can toe settled by their executive organs,and that contact between them is desirable and helpful. Thechain of responsibility is from British Transport Commission to area Authority, and from Authority to Chief Regional Manager.(e) The Commission will look to the Area Authorities for a very real and big contribution towards increasing the efficiency of the railwayindustry. In this, they are representing the Commission and re-lieving the Commission of work.  They are not an opposition firm.if) As experience is gained, the Commission hope to delegate other functions to the Area Authorities not directly concerned with rail-ways, and provision is made in the scheme for this purpose. Thus,although the Authorities will only be responsible for railways atthe outset, it is contemplated as other factors become clear thattheir functions may be extended.7. The (Minister commends the Commission^ Scheme to Parliament as one which will in his view give full effect to the policy for the efficient management of the railways within the provisions of the Transport Act, 1953.30085

The submission of the British Transport Commission to the Rt. Hon.Alan Lennox Boyd, M.P., Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.ReorganisationII of illRailwaysSECTION I.-EXPLANATORY STATEMENT.SECTION II.-THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION(ORGANISATION) SCHEME, 1954,
SECTION 1EXPLANATORY STATEMENT,1. By Section 16 of the Transport Act, 1953, the British Transport Com-mission are required to submit to the Minister of Transport a scheme forthe reorganisation of that part of their undertaking which consists in theoperation of railways. This Section further requires the scheme to provide(a) for the setting up of area authorities, (b) for the delegation to them of functions of the Commission, and (c) as respects each of these areas, forthe compilation and publication of statements of operating costs and statistics.Section 16 of the Act also contains further indications respecting the scheme,and these will be referred to, as necessary, later in this statement.2. In preparing their proposed scheme, the Commission have naturallygiven wide consideration to the matter. They have, of course, had specificregard to Section 16 of the Act; they have also considered in detail therequirements of the railway industry, particularly from the point of viewof increasing the efficiency and economy of the public transport service ;and they have been mindful of the future development of the other partsof their undertaking. It is desirable in considering the Commission^ pro-posals that regard should be had to the present position of the railwayindustry and the course of development over recent years, so that in lookingahead the general trend of progress may be seen more clearly. organisation is a means to an end and not an end in itself. It is also a live thing,constantly changing, yet by its nature strongly resistant to change particu-larly in an industry employing a staff of some 600,000 and with a longtradition of public service.Railway Organisation, 1923-19473. On the outbreak of the first world war in August, 1914, the Govern-ment took possession of the railways for the purpose of working them as one during the war. This arrangement continued until August, 1921, whenthe railways were returned to their owning companies. In that same month new Railways Act was passed, one of the main features of which was the amalgamation of 123 railways into four groups in 1923. That Act lefteach group company to determine its own form of organisation.4. Between 1923 and 1939 these four railway group companies were responsible for the main line railways of this country.- In this period each group developed its own system of organisation to fit its particular circum-stances. The working out of these organisations was not easy ; it proceededover the years by trial and error. The arrangements were changed on morethan one occasion by some of the groups and they were constantly under close examination. Three of the groups-the L.N.E.R., G.W. and Southern had General Managers as the chief officers of their companies. In placeof a General Manager the L.M.S. group had appointed at the apex of its organisation a President with three Vice-Presidents, who formed an Execu-tive Committee responsible to the board. Whatever may be the organisation,there must be a continuous chain of responsibility from the apex down tothe lowest ranks, but among the four groups there was not uniformity inthe methods of connecting the several links. The L.M.S., G.W. and Southerngroups adopted the departmental system under which the whole of the staffin one department, through district and divisional officers, was responsible to the head of that department and through him to a General Manager or
Vice-President. The L.N.E.R. organisation was partly a departmental andpartly a divisional or area system. There were three Divisional general managers responsible to a Chief General Manager. But some branches ofthe work, e.g. mechanical engineering (and later civil engineering) and finance,were for the whole line the direct responsibility of chief departmental officers.5. Before 1939 the four groups found it necessary to introduce extensivearrangements for the pooling of receipts, which had important effects upon their finances and operating methods and to a considerable extent eliminatedcompetition between them.6. On the outbreak of Che second world war in September, 1939, theGovernment took control of the railways for war purposes, and this controlcontinued until December 31st, 1947. In this period the organisations of thefour groups remained, in essentials, as they were before the war, but a railway Executive Committee was set up to ensure the maximum use ofthe combined resources of the railways in the war effort. The arrangementsincluded the pooling of the revenues of the four groups. Meanwhile, theGovernment had introduced their proposals into Parliament for nationalisingthe railways, and the Transport Act of 1947 became law in August of thatyear under which the railways passed into public ownership as from january 1st, 1948. Many valuable lessons have been learned for the future in the experience between 1948 and 1953.Railway Nationalisation7. The Transport Act, 1947, did not lay down the form the railwayorganisation was to take beyond establishing a Railway Executive &quot; to assistthe British Transport Commission in the discharge of their functions,&quot; and requiring the Executive, as agents of the Commission, to exercise such functions as were for the time being delegated to them. The members ofthe Executive and of all other Executives were to be appointed by theMinister of Transport &quot; after consultation with the Commission.&quot;8. It was made clear in the Parliamentary debates that the broad organisa-tion under the Commission was to be functional in the sense that separateExecutives were to be responsible for the different forms of transport. Inthe House of Commons on July 23rd, 1947, the then Minister of Transportexplained this:  &quot; It is essential that we should recognise the structure, both for policyand management, which this Bill embodies the division of the two.In this case the Executives are not area or regional bodies; they arenational and functional bodies, and the Commission, by an instrument,delegates- to the Railway Executive, if I may use that as an example,the running and conduct of the whole of the railways of this country.&quot;9. When the members of the Railway Executive were appointed by theMinister after the Act had been passed in 1947, they were selected for their qualifications in particular spheres, with a chairman of general-managerexperience and two part-time members representing industry and agriculture.This was a new type of general management from that which had been applied in the railway industry up to then.   Moreover, the constitution ofthe Executive not only provided for a new type of management, but intro-duced an entirely new principle of working.  Each of the full-time memberswas required to exercise departmental responsibilities (which generally were those in which he was particularly qualified) right down the line ; and, inaddition, all the members had a corporate responsibility for the general management of the railways.   The Executive was treated as the employerof the staff.
10. An urgent task which faced the Commission and the Executive wasthe unification of the four groups into one system, to secure increased efficiency and reduced costs, and the Executive was well constituted for thispurpose. Unification could be secured most quickly by strong initial central control. The full-time members of the Executive were experienced inparticular departments of railway work, and it was their responsibility tounify these departments and select the best standards for current conditions,having reviewed the various practices of the former group companies. Therailway system was formed into six Regions, and the technical and trafficofficers in each worked on the unification project under the direct guidanceof the members of the Executive. There was nothing sacrosanct in the sixRegions. The upheaval of nationalisation and unification was big enough,and it was essential to make the transition with the least possible disturbanceto normal day-to-day working. It was realised at the start that the Regionswere by no means ideally arranged, but it was essential, first of all, to concentrate on securing the benefits which unification offered.11. The system of departments in the Regions corresponded closely to the composition of the Railway Executive itself, but as each Region was a verylarge unit it was necessary to co-ordinate the work of the departments bymeans of a Chief Regional Officer specially appointed for the purpose. Asthe main initial task, however, was the unification of the railways as quickly as possible, and as this could obviously be done only by direction to allthe Regions, the Executive decided to undertake this as well as to deal withthe policy of general management. It was recognised that as the work ofunification proceeded and the reduced costs were secured, it would be neces-sary to delegate more responsibility to the Regions. The four groupcompanies went through precisely the same cycle of changing emphasis afterthe amalgamations of 1923, and the outbreak of war in 1939 interrupteda further considerable decentralisation of authority in at least one of the groups.12. It became obvious from 1951 onwards that a fundamental change inthe railway organisation would be required in the near future. The systemof departmental control and centralised management was appropriate forthe initial period, following the changes brought about by the transport act of 1947. But it was never intended that the railways should be organisedpermanently in this centralised manner, and before 1951 steps had beentaken to delegate additional responsibility to the Regions. The time was approaching when departmental control could be transferred in the mainto Chief Regional Managers. In 1952, however, the Government announced their transport proposals which included the abolition of the railway executive. After the Transport Act had been passed in May, 1953, theGovernment announced the abolition of all the Executives other than theLondon Transport Executive.Interim Railway Organisation, 195313. The Commission therefore decided to introduce an Interim Organisa-tion as from October 1st, 1953, until the statutory scheme of reorganisationshould be introduced which the Transport Act of 1953 required. In thisInterim Organisation the primary function of the Commission was to controlmajor policy and general direction. Departmental authority was transferredto the Regions, the Chief Regional Officers were renamed Chief RegionalManagers, and all the regional departmental officers were made responsible to them. The &quot; functional&quot; system of supreme management was abolished.Apart from this major change, the powers of the Chief Regional Managerswere increased.  The functions of the former Railway Executive were thus
divided as follows: The Commission took direct charge of certain specificmatters (such as the design, manufacture and standards of maintenance oflocomotives, rolling stock, permanent way and signalling; labour relations of a major character ; general level of charges; financial control in its broaderaspects; higher appointments; the policies and principles to be adopted in railway operation ; the inter-regional distribution of wagons ; and commercial policy in general and national negotiations in connection therewith) insofar as the Railway Executive had previously been concerned with them: theremaining functions which concerned the day-to-day management of therailway system were delegated to the regional managements.14. To enable them to carry out their responsibilities under the new arrangement, the Commission clearly needed to reorganise their headquarters&quot; staff.&quot; This consists of officers dealing on the one hand with certaindepartments which concern the whole business of the Commission (legal,public relations, research, etc.), and on the other with the operational depart-ments (commercial, operating, engineering, etc.). It is important tounderstand that the heads of all these departments are not, like the headsof departments in the former Railway Executive, functional chiefs issuingorders in their own name to the corresponding officials in the Regions. Theirfunction is to assist the Commission in the carrying out of their tasks, andthey fulfil this function in the following ways: By their specialised knowledgethey ensure that matters requiring the decision of the Commission are presented to them in a co-ordinated and easily digestible manner: by keeping in intimate contact with the officers in the Regions they promote co-co-ordination between them and enable many things to be settled by agreement at stafflevel instead of demanding decision at Commission level: it is their dutyby frequent liaison visits to keep in touch with the Regions both in orderto keep the Commission informed, and also to assist the Regions in carryingout their task; and the Chief Regional Managers are required to ensurethat this touch is maintained and that advantage is taken of the advice ofthe Commission^ professional and technical officers: as regards those mattersonly for Which the Commission have reserved authority to themselves,instructions are issued by the staff on behalf of the Commission major policy instructions by the secretariat and implementing instructions by thestaff of the department concerned.15. To deal with the immediate situation, the staff of the Executive wasmerged with that of the Commission, and the process of reduction was putin hand at once. Care was naturally required in such a readjustment toavoid hardship, and the work is not complete.16. The new arrangements are working well. The Chief Regional Managersare now conscious ctf a real sense of responsibility for their Regions ; theyregularly attend meetings of the Commission for the discussion of matters ofpolicy and principle affecting the industry.17. It is with this general background that the Commission have approached the preparation of the scheme of reorganisation which the Transport Act, 1953,requires.The Scheme of Reorganisation- 18. The Commission intend that ]the reorganisation of the railways should include and be developed from the principles of the Interim Organisation.19. It is quite unsound to design a scheme of organisation for the railways(or tor any other industry or business) that will remain unchanged. Suchrigidity could only lead to inefficiency by retarding normal growth anddevelopment. The Commission are of opinion that there is great scope for30O85A3
an improvement of the railway system, and to achieve this it is essential,once the initial statutory scheme has received&apos; approval in accordance with section 17 of ithe Act, that as much freedom and flexibility as possible shouldbe allowed to the Commission in developing the future organisation.20. The scheme is required to provide for *he reorganisation of therailways, but it Should also allow for the possibility of changes in theorganisation of the Commission covering other forms of transport at some future time. In preparing their scheme, therefore, the Commission have had regard tto this. It emphasises the necessity for allowing as much flexibility aspossible in the framework of the scheme.Area Authorities21. Section 16 of the Act requires the scheme to provide for the settingup of area authorities and adds that these authorities &quot;may Ibe individuals or bodies of persons.&quot; First as regards the areas. There are already inexistence the six railway Regions London Midland, Eastern, Western,Southern, Scottish and North Eastern each with defined boundaries. these regions are largely the former four group companies, with the separation of Scotland and the establishment of the North Eastern Area of the L.N.E.R.as additional Regions.22. For management purposes, these Regions are in themselves very largesystems. The Commission have reached the conclusion that either the largerRegions must be broken up into smaller Regions, or there must be introduced a definite measure of management decentralisation within them: functionaldecentralisation is not sufficient. In view of the major upheaval whichimportant alterations to the Regions involve, the Commission have decided in favour of the latter alternative for the present time. This creation of subordinate organs of management within the Regions need not involve largestaff increases. It would have three principal benefits. lit would provide for railway users a more direct and rapid contact with the railways of an authoritative nature; iit would assist the staff by removing their feeling ofremoteness from the management; and it would increase the efficiency of thedepartments by introducing more effective supervision and co-ordination onthe spot and by encouraging initiative from below. Plans for this decentralisation-tion are being worked out. They are not appropriate for inclusion in thescheme, but they will be put into effect as soon as possible. This will not,however, affect the initial establishment of the existing six Regions as theareas for the purposes of Section 16, although the Commission would ask thatthe scheme in this respect Should be so worded as to afford freedom tothem in making any adjustments that may be required in the light of experience,23. The Comimission have given deep consideration to the question whetherthe area authorities prescribed by the Act should toe &quot; individuals or bodies of persons&quot;: in other words, whether area boards should be set up orwhether (the sole authorities should be the Chief Regional Managers, possiblyunder another name. The Commission have in this connection studied notonly the Act itself, but also the debates which took place in Parliament,and they have had in imind the special reference miade to the case of Scotland.Under the Interim Organisation ithe Comimission have reserved to themselvesonly the minimum (powers necessary to enable them to ensure fulfilment of their responsibilities, and to effect by measures of co-ordination andstandardisation maximum economy in the utilisation of the resources of therailways. The extent to which further powers can be delegated by theCommission is now limited and the conditions for their delegation will need careful consideration.
24. The Railways Act of 1921 brought about an important stage in theprocess of the unification of the railways of Great Britain. It has continued by progressive steps as described in tine earlier paragraphs. The final step towards unification was taken on nationalisation, but it was then only ashort step. lit is not in the interests of the country, nor indeed is it practicable,to reverse this process now.25. The Commission believe that certain advantages would be gained ifarea boards were established with proper precautions to ensure that theyunderstood their role and were imbued with a sense of loyalty to the Cam-mission&apos; as a whole. The members of these boards, drawn in part from outside the industry (but not as representatives of particular interests), would bring to the area organisations a close knowledge of public and businessrequirements in respect of transport. . They would also bring in new ideason methods and practices. They would improve personal contact witlh staff.They would substantially assist the Commission in the fulfilment of their task by relieving them of work.26. Having weighed these [considerations, the Commission have decided torecommend the appointment of boards as the area authorities provided thatcertain fundamental points are clearly established in regard to them. Theexperience of the Commission between 1948 and 1953 has shown how essentialit is that the authority of the Commission in the scheme of organisation shouldbe absolute. The scheme should admit of no doubt on. this point. the function of the Commission is primarily to determine policy, but they musthave the authority to ensure that their decisions are carried out. There is a danger that by the establishment of boards as the area authorities an elementproductive df friction and lack of cohesion may be introduced. The Coin-mission are, therefore, strongly and unanimously of the opinion that theyalone should appoint the persons who would constitute the area authorities.They propose that the number of /persons comprising each area authority should ibe limited to a maximum of seven (including the chairman), andthat one or more of them should be a member of the Commission.. Theperiod of appointment should foe two years with eligibility for re-appointment.It is not considered that the members or the chairmen would require to devote their whole time to the work of the authorities, and they would therefore foe able to continue other activities. For practical reasons thestrength of the area authorities would have to be built up somewhatgradually. The area authorities would not be incorporated. The Comniisisionwould remain the employers of the staff. They would also be the body tosue and be sued.27. The responsibilities which the Commission would place upon thearea authorities in relation to the railways would bei , (a) to exercise as organs of the Commission general supervision of therailway system within their areas and particularly toi ensure that the policies laid down by the Commission were faithfully executed;(b) to promote initiative in improving the service which the railwaysafford to the public, and in effecting economies, making appropriaterecommendations to the Commission where matters affecting generalpolicy are conoerned ;(c) to submit such budgets and forecasts of capital and revenue expendi-tute as the Commission might require iid) to exercise those powers which were specifically delegated to themby the Commission in regard to approval of expenditure, appoint-:   appointments, establishments, etc.;1130085 A 4
y )ie) to ensure that contact was maintained, with those who use, therailways within -the areas, so that their requirements might be metto the fullest possible extent consistent with the observance of a proper relation between revenue and cost; &apos;  ,if) ito encourage loyalty and esprit de corps among the staff and toensure attention to the welfare of &apos;the staff in all its forms. -28. Within the framework of their responsibilities to the Commission, thearea authorities would be responsible for the management of the railwaysystems in their areas, but they would leave the day-to-day management to their Chief Regional Managers. The Chief Regional Managers and their officers would maintain that intimate contact with the staff at the Com-mission&apos;s headquarters which is prescribed in paragraph 14.29. The scheme would provide as. necessary for the area authorities tocarry out the responsibilities referred to in paragraphs 27 and 28 above and such further responsibilities as the Commission may from time to timedecide to give them. In principle, the Commission would continue to reserve to themselves the powers referred to in paragraph 13. Extendedauthority would be delegated to the area authorities in certain directions,particularly in the authorisation of expenditure and the making ofappointments.30. The chairmen of the authorities and the Chief Regional Managerswould attend meetings of the Commission at regular intervals.31. The Commission are of opinion that while competition in the ordinary business sense between the railway Regions is impracticable, it is very desirable that there should be strong emulation between them. In connectionwith staff uniforms, it is considered that it would stimulate local pride if the regions were allowed to display their individual identity in a more dis-tinctive manner. As regards liveries for coaching stock, there are practicaldifficulties in completely restoring individual colours. Many trains pass through different Regions, and there are other complications. The Corn-mission are not opposed to individual colours where practicable and areprepared to consider the matter.32. Consideration has been given to the names of the new areas, butthe changes which were made in 1948 make it impossible to go back tothe old names even if this were desirable. Moreover, the present Regionshave already acquired some esprit de corps, and it is the view of theCommission that they should remain.Hotels and Catering Services33. The Commission do not consider that the scheme should provide forthe hotels to be included in the regional railway management as such. TheChief Regional Managers already have enough responsibility to provide the efficient and economical services required by the Commission without havingattached to them activities like hotels which, under modern conditions, have little to do with public transport and are a specialised business.34. The refreshment rooms and catering services on the trains are in adifferent category from the hotel business. The way they are run directlyaffects the commercial business of the railways, and it is therefore essentialthat those who manage the railways should be able to exercise influence over them. The Commission have therefore reached the conclusion thatthe Catering Services should select a senior officer for each Region, to beattached to the staff of the Chief Regional Manager. His duties would beto give the area authority the best possible service within the limits of thepowers and discretion afforded to him, and these limits would be as wide
as possible. The Chief Regional Manager would have the right to ask hisCatering Services Officer to effect such improvements as he considered desirable, but he could not override the departmental instructions which that officer had received. The Catering Services Officer would attend anyconferences at which his presence was desired by the Chief Regional Manager.If the Chief Regional Manager should be dissatisfied with the catering service in his Region, he would bring the matter to the attention of the Commission^headquarters.Docks and Inland Waterways35. The docks and inland waterways will not be transferred to the regionalrailway management. The experience of separating the docks, other thanthe packet ports, from the railway has been fully justified, and the financial results confirm this. It is a specialised business and not part of the workof those who manage railways.Area Operating Costs and Statistics36. The Act requires that the scheme of reorganisation shall provide forthe compilation and publication in respect of each of the areas of suchstatements of operating costs and such statistics as may be specified underthe scheme.37. At the present, statistics are compiled for individual Regions and are published, suoh as those relating to the numbers of passengers and thetonnage of freight, the volume of service provided, efficiency in the use oflocomotives and rolling stock and in general operation, e.g., net ton milesper engine hour and similar figures. These statistics provide an indication of the level of activity and of the relative operating performance. TheCommission will continue to produce and publish figures of this kind. Theform and scope of such statistics are a matter for constant review, and theCommission will continue and improve, as possible, the compilation of statistics designed to stimulate comparison and emulation between the areas and to provide the area authorities and the Commission with such measure-ments of efficiency as can be usefully produced for purposes of management and control.38. In industry generally it is often possible to stimulate emulationbetween the various sections of a single undertaking by .the preparation of figures of net earnings for each section in relation to the capital employedby that section. Owing to the nature of operations of British Railways,however, and having regard in particular to the great volume of passenger and freight traffic which is not confined within the boundaries ofgeographical areas, there is no possibility of constructing a profit and lossaccount which will significantly reflect either the revenues artd expendituresreally attributable to a given area, or the relative efficiencies of area manage-ments. There is no doubt that the efficiency of British Railways as a whole has been vastly increased by the unifications achieved in the last fifteen years, but the more unified the working of a railway system becomes, themore difficult it is to produce net revenue accounts of significance andvalidity for each area separately. The accounts of the former railwaycompanies represented entities which were distinct in terms of operation andof capital employed, but even after their extensive and costly clearingarrangements for rolling stock, for takings, and for certain expenditures,their net revenues were more a reflection of their respective interests inthe pools which then existed and covered some 70 per cent, of the businessdone, and of the amounts available to stockholders as a result, than of the
separate efficiencies of the individual systems. The Commission are studyingthis matter with great care and they hope to evolve a system which willgive a reasonably fair comparison of the costs in each area of various phasesof operation.39. On the question of publication generally, it must be remembered that whilst many types of accounting and statistical control are essential for internal use, where their limitations will be properly understood, they are often unsuitable for publication especially where publication will result inthe creation of incentives inimical to unified working, or of deterrents tofrank discussion of the figures. It has also to be borne in mind that inthe highly competitive situation created under the Transport Act of 1953,the publication of details of operating costs for each area could be detri-mental to the Commission^ legitimate commercial interests.Charges40. The Transport Act, 1953, reserved to the Commission the general control of the charges to be made for the services and facilities provided.The Commission must deal with the general policy with respect to charges,particularly the formulation of the Charges Schemes required by the Actand any general changes in the level or form of the charges structure. Inconnection with the quotation of individual rates, however, the regionalmanagements would have, as they have under the Interim Organisation,freedom to aot themselves within limits varying according to the nature ofthe business. There would be close consultation with the Commission, or their specialist staff, on those aspects of policy or charge on which they required guidance.General41. As stated earlier in this paper, the Commission do not view their proposed scheme of railway reorganisation as in any sense final and rigid.Indeed, this it can never be. It is their intention to keep the whole organisa-tion under review to secure the most efficient and economical methods of conducting the business, but clearly it will take time. For example, it mightbe that some activities now controlled regionally could with advantage be separated and formed into central services, e.g., the shipping services andthe work in the main mechanical engineering workshops. These are notmatters, however, on which the Commission can say anything at this time;there are arguments for and against in each case which will require detailed study. It is for reasons such as these that the Commission desire that thepresent scheme should be as flexible as possible to permit development onthe most efficient and economical lines..
