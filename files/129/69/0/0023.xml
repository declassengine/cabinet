Printed for the Cabinet. July 1954SECRET Copy No.   6 1C. (54) 2238th July, 1954CABINETTRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate a revised version of the proposed reply to Dr. Malan (Annex IV toC. (54) 216). I think I have incorporated all the suggestions we agreed in cabinet this morning. The changes will be found in paragraphs 6, 7, 12 and 13 of the newversion.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,6th July, 1954.MEMORANDUMOn 8th June the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa handed to theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Cape Town a memorandum for trans-mission to the United Kingdom Government.2. In his message of 14th June to Dr. Malan, Lord Swinton stated that thewords &quot;at the present time&quot; in his letter of 1st April to Dr. Malan, and in the statements made in the United Kingdom Parliament, were used advisedly and explained their meaning. The United Kingdom Government wish now to give a considered reply to the other points in the Union Governmenfs memorandum.3. The United Kingdom Government must emphatically reject the charge that they have repudiated any agreement or undertaking. This charge is based ona complete misunderstanding of the United Kingdom Governmenfs position.Section 151 and the Schedule of the South Africa Act4.   It is important to recall the genesis of the South Africa Act and thecircumstances in which the Bill was presented to the United Kingdom Parliament. Cmd. 8707,The draft Bill was prepared in South Africa by a National Convention of the four page 5,Colonies.  Section 151 and the Schedule were included in the draft submitted by para. 7, andthe Convention and were ultimately passed by the United Kingdom Parliament footnotetovirtually in the same form. page &apos;5. Section 151 provides the legal machinery for transfer. It is permissive and does not impose an obligation on the United Kingdom to transfer. This was made clear in the United Kingdom Parliament when the Bill was introduced. In the cmd. 8707,debate on the second reading of the Bill, the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) said: page.115. &apos;&quot; The natives of the Protectorates are not at present subject to the jurisdiction ofthe Union Government or the Union Parliament. We, on the other hand I assertthis most strongly-stand in the position, in many important respects, of trusteeswith regard to these natives.  We have given them promises and pledges, and we46449
are bound to see that those promises are fulfilled, and that those pledges are notviolated. ... The important point is that you cannot bring any one of theseProtectorates or Territories into a state of subordination to the Union government or the Union Parliament, as Clause 151 shows, unless the King, with the advice ofthe Privy Council-that is, the Cabinet here agrees. That is a most properrecognition on the part of the South African communities that the ImperialGovernment has a voice, and the ultimate voice, in relation to this matter. Theydo not deny our right in the least; on the contrary, on the very face of the Act, theyadmit it, and invite us to exercise it.&quot;Cmd. 8707, 6. During the passage of the Bill, pledges were given by the United Kingdompage 6, Government that the wishes of the inhabitants would be ascertained and consideredpara. 8. before any transfer took place, and that Parliament would have the fullest oppor-tunity of discussing and, if. they wished, disapproving any proposed transfer ofthese Territories. These pledges have been reaffirmed by successive UnitedKingdom Governments.Cmd. 8707, 7. In 1925 General Hertzog said in the Union Parliament: &quot; Our position haspage 17.     always been, as a Party, that we are not prepared to incorporate in the Unionany territory unless the inhabitants of the territory are prepared to come in.&quot;And, in 1935, General Hertzog informed the then Secretary of State that he wasCmd. 8707, well aware of the pledges which the United Kingdom Government had given bothpage 57.  &apos; to consult the natives and to afford an opportunity to Parliament to express its opinion, and that he did not question that the United Kingdom Government were bound by them.Cmd. 8707,        8.   The United Kingdom Government in no way dissent from the view ofpage 73, &apos; their predecessors referred to in the Union Governments memorandum thatpage 75.     Section 151 of the South Africa Act has a meaning and intention.  Indeed, UnitedKingdom Governments have always recognised that Section 151 and the Schedulecontemplate the Territories being handed over, subject to the fulfilment of theCmd. 8707, pledges referred to, at some time to be fixed by agreement between the two Govern-page 117.    ments; but the United Kingdom Government do not accept the contention inthe Union Governments memorandum that there is any undertaking on their part,express or implied, to transfer the Territories unless the United Kingdom Parlia-ment are satisfied that the pledges have been fulfilled and assent to the transfer.The situation between 1935 and 19399. In 1935 it was plain that native opinion in the Territories was strongly opposed to transfer. In these circumstances the United Kingdom Governmentand the Union Government concluded that for the next few years the wise courseof action would be for the Union Government and the Administrations of the territories to co-operate in practical measures which would be for the mutualbenefit of the Territories and the Union, in an endeavour to bring about a situationin which, if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics, it could be effectedCmd. 8707, with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned. These conclusions werepage 53. set out in the Aide-Memoire which the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairshanded to the South African Prime Minister on 15th May, 1935.Cmd. 8707, ly. in furtherance of this course of action it was agreed in 1938 that apara 24     Joint Advisory Conference comprising officials from the Union and the territories should study openings for co-operation between them. It was also agreed that thePage 89.     Union Government should prepare a memorandum setting out the conditionswhich would obtain under Union administration, if transfer were to take place.With the outbreak of war in September 1939, it was agreed that publication of theCmd. 8707, memorandum and of the report of the Joint Advisory Conference should bepage 10, deferred, and that the question of transfer should remain in abeyance for thepara. 27.     time being.11. It is thus clear that there was in 1939 no agreement to transfer the territories as suggested in the Union Governments memorandum.The situation to-day12. The United Kingdom Government are bound by their pledges that thewishes of the inhabitants would be ascertained before any transfer took place,and that the United Kingdom Parliament would have the fullest opportunity of considering any proposed transfer. The United Kingdom Government have always
Cmd. 8707.page 89,para. 3.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,6th July, 1954.recognised that it is for each sovereign Government within the commonwealth to determine its policy; but, in relation to transfer, the United Kingdom Govern-ment must have regard to the effect of Union policy on African opinion in the territories.13. That this view was shared by the Union Government is shown by thefact that the Union Government prepared the 1939 Memorandum in order to tellAfricans in the Territories the conditions which would obtain if the territories were transferred. Without expressing any view on the current native policy ofthe Union Government, it is certain that this policy would not to-day be willinglyaccepted by Africans in the Territories. Nor in these circumstances would theUnited Kingdom Parliament be prepared to assent to transfer were it proposed at the present time.14. For these reasons it was made clear in Lord Swinton&apos;s letter of 1st april to Dr. Malan and in the statements made in the United Kingdom Parliament on13th April that no useful purpose could be served by entering upon negotiations with were bound to be fruitless at the present time.
