CONFIDENTIAL CABINET office (54) 205 RECORD COPY21st June. 1954COPY NOCABINETGENEVA CONFERENCENote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexedtelegram from the Canadian Delegation in Geneva to Ottawa recordinga conversation between Mr. Ronning, the Canadian Ambassador inOslo, and Mr. Chou En-lai on 19th June.    Mr. Ronning knows Chinavery well and speaks Chinese fluently.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.21st June, 1954.TELEGRAMINTERVIEW WITH CHOU EN-LAIYesterday Wang Ping-nan telephoned to say that Chou En-laiwould like to talk to Ronning before he left for Oslo.    Holmes andRonning agreed that Mr. Pearson would perhaps not wish us torefuse.    Chou talked cordially and frankly with Ronning to-day.Wang, Ko Pai-nien and Pu Shan were also present.2. On Korea, Chou said while it was a great disappointment tohim that a settlement had not been reached, he felt the eight weeks hadnot been entirely wasted.    Much common ground had been reached andmost delegations had indicated a desire to meet again to settle theproblem by peaceful means.    Only South Korea had made belligerentnoises.    He said his delegation did not have very great hopes of reaching a settlement before they left Peking because Dulles had indicated in Berlin that while he would agree to the calling of a con-ference, he was not in favour of having one.    Since the United Statescame with this attitude, it was not strange the conference had failed.A settlement in Indo-China, Chou thought, would have a good influence on any subsequent conference on Korea.3. On Indo-China, he had high hopes that a settlement could bereached.    China, was most anxious to stop the fighting and reach apolitical settlement.    He hoped his proposals for Laos and Cambodiawould be accepted.    China would agree that all foreign troops,including Vietnamese, should be withdrawn and that the people belongingto the indigenous and resistance movements might be integrated into
their respective nations, expressing their views through free elections.If the majority desired a royal government, and he suspected they would,China was prepared to extend recognition.    Since the problem in Laoswas more difficult than in Cambodia as the resistance movement therewas much greater, the solutions in the two countries need be neitherexactly similar nor simultaneous.4.        When asked if he thought that the problem of Viet Nam was more difficult, he replied it certainly was but if France would take a decisive initiative, free elections throughout the country would solve the problem.    He does not anticipate partition of Viet Nam as necessary for a solution.        Bao Dai is afraid of elections, he said,but not Ho Chi Minh.    He seemed to think that considerable progress had been made in delineating the areas into which the troops of therespective sides should be withdrawn, but he did not think thesedemarcation lines would mean permanent political boundaries.5.        Chou expressed great surprise and a little disappointment atthe attitude of Walter Robertson at yesterday&apos;s meeting on Indo-China.In a previous meeting, Bedell Smith had said that Chou&apos;s proposals were &quot;moderate and reasonable&quot;.    Yesterday, however, Robertson had said that the proposals were completely unacceptable.    Chou commentedthat it was difficult to know what the United States position was when their own representatives had such divergent views.    General Smith,he said, was not backed up by his own delegation.6.        Chou said that Bidault was a puzzle to him.    SometimesBidault seemed to differ with himself as much as Robertson differedwith Smith.    He thought it very strange that Bidault seemed to be soafraid to. meet him.    He had to call on Bidault before Bidault would call on him.    When Bidault did call, he took the greatest care to keepthe meeting completely secret, especially from the delegations of the associated States, giving the impression he was negotiating behind their backs when he should be speaking for these States, which france had created.    Chou hoped that the new French Government would besteadfast enough to pursue a steady policy designed to reach agree-ment and give some leadership to the Associated States.    PerhapsMenders-France had such determination.7.        In reply to a question about his personal plans, he said thatif other Foreign Ministers here all left, there was no point in hisremaining and he would probably return to Peking.    He would, however,come back to Geneva immediately to carry on the discussions here, ashe felt that the most important problem facing us all to-day was thequestion of Indo-China.8.        Ronning thanked him for the quick action his Government hadtaken in respect of Canadian nationals who had been held in China and,in particular, for the good news about Squadron Leader Mackenzie.Chou said that China was anxious to cement good relations with allcountries of the West and asked Ronning to extend greetings to theCanadian Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs.    he also saidthat^as soon as he returned to Peking, he intended to reach an agreement with Norway similar to that which they had now con-eluded with the United Kingdom.
