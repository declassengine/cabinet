Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1954SECRET Copy No.C(54)210 RECORD&apos; COPY06&apos;26th June, 1954CABINETSELECT   COMMITTEE   ON   NATIONALISED  industries memorandum by the Lord Prdvy SealOn 18th January the Cabinet agreed that in the debate in the House ofCommons on the Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries(House of Commons Paper 235) the Government spokesman should take the line that the Government favoured the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations inprinciple, subject to any necessary detailed modifications and to the considerationof any views which might be expressed from either side of the House in debate(C. (54) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 6). I spoke accordingly in the debate in theHouse of Commons on 8th February (Official Report, column 841).2. Of the 22 Members, apart from myself, who spoke on that occasion,those who favoured the appointment, of a standing Select Committee numbered 14(of whom 5 were Opposition Members) and those opposing 7, of whom Mr. herbert morrison said that he was speaking also for the National Executive Committeeof the Labour Party and the Trade Union Congress. I suggest, therefore, thatwe should be justified in claiming that there is an adequate volume of support in the House for the idea of a Select Committee if, as I assume, we adhere to ourown view that the appointment of such a Committee is desirable in principle.3. In accordance with the wish of the Cabinet I expressly kept open in the debate the possibility that the proposed Committee might be a Joint Select Com-mittee of the two Houses. I have since been informed by the Lord president that the Leaders of the three Parties in the House of Lords have agreed not toask for a Joint Committee for this purpose. I understand that one of the factors which have influenced the Peers in reaching this decision has been the consideration that the activities of the proposed Committee would be so largely concerned withfinance that objection might be taken on constitutional grounds to the participationtherein of Members of the Upper House.4. I, therefore, now seek final authority from the Cabinet to announce atan appropriate time the Government^ intention to proceed with the appointmentof a Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries on the general lines recom-mended in the Select Committee&apos;s Report, but subject to the modifications andqualifications set out in the note accompanying the Answer to a Question ofwhich drafts are annexed to this memorandum.H. C.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W. 1,25th June, 1954.46388
.....   .....   .....;:   ANNEX . .............   ............ . ........,Draft Question and AnswerQuestionTo ask the Lord Privy Seal whether he is now able to say what further: action the Government intend to take upon the second report of the Select Committee on nationalised Industries (House of Commons Paper No. 235).AnswerYes, Sir.The House will recall my statement on 8th February that the government accepted in principle the idea of a standing committee on nationalised industries,as recommended by the Select Committee, subject to any necessary detailedmodifications and to consideration of the views expressed in debate, and on theunderstanding that the way was left open for a Joint Select Committee for thispurpose, if that should eventually be decided upon.The Government have carefully considered the views expressed on thismatter from both sides of the House and are satisfied that there is a substantial body of support for the establishment of a Select Committee. They are furthersatisfied that there is no desire in another place that this committee should be aJoint Select Committee of the two Houses.In these circumstances the Government intend to Table next Session a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee of this House on the general basisrecommended in the Select Committee&apos;s Report. I am circulating with the official report a note commenting in detail on certain points.note the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended in their second Report (House of Commons paper No. 235) that a committee should be setup under a Standing Order in the following terms:  &quot; There shall be a select committee, to be designated the Committee on nationalised Industries, for examining the Reports and Accounts of, and for obtaining further information as to the general policy and practices of the nationalised Industries established by Statute whose controlling Boards are wholly appointed by Ministers of the Crown and whose annual receipts arenot wholly or mainly derived from moneys provided by Parliament oradvanced from the Exchequer. The Committee shall consist of not more than twenty-one members, who shall be nominated at the commencement of everysession and of whom seven shall be a quorum. The Committee shall havepower to appoint sub-committees from its own members. The Committeeand any such sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to report from time to time.&quot;The Government think it premature to create a Committee under standing order but propose in the first place to move next session for a Committee under an ad hoc motion. Subject to this, the Government propose to adopt this recom-mendation subject to the following modifications and qualifications:  Terms of reference the Select Committee&apos;s terms of reference should be as in the suggestedStanding Order, subject to the substitution of the word &quot; current &quot; for &quot; general &quot;in the phrase &quot; general policy and practice of the nationalised industries;&quot;The Government consider that it would be inappropriate that the proposed committee should investigate matters which have been decided by the minister concerned or clearly engage his responsibility and for which he should thereforebe answerable on the floor of the House, or matters (including wages questions)which are normally decided by collective bargaining arrangements.   They also
consider that the proposed committee should not concern themselves with matters which fall to be considered through formal machinery established by the relevantStatutes or with matters of day-to-day administration.CompositionThe Committee should consist of not more than fourteen members of whomfive should be a quorum.Sub-committees the Committee should not have power to appoint sub-committees.Power to send for persons, papers and recordsThe Committee should normally take evidence about the affairs of a nationalised industry from the Chairman of the Board of the industry concernedor a representative nominated by him. The witness might be accompanied byother representatives of the Board where appropriate. Ministers should not normally be invited to appear before the Committee.Power to reportThe Committee should report from time to time and publish its evidenceexcept where such publication might be held to be contrary to the public interest.Staff of the CommitteeThe staff of the Committee should not include an officer of the status of the comptroller and Auditor General. It should have the assistance of liaison officers from the Treasury and from each of the departments whose Ministers areresponsible for the affairs of nationalised industries.
