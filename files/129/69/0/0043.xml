THIS DOCUMENT V? &apos;^H^ FSOPICRTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(54) 243 COPY NO.   o *k20th July. 1954CABINETFUTURE STATUS OF MALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in C. (54) 141, which the Cabinet considered on 15th April(C.C.(54) 29th Conclusions, Minute 6), the Home Secretary and reported that Dr. Borg Olivier and one of his Ministers were coming toLondon during May, to discuss the &quot;Home Office offer&quot; (as well asMaltese emigration problems).    We indicated that the constitutionaltalks with Dr. Borg Olivier seemed unlikely to get us anywhere, unlessthe Home Office offer could be developed.    We thought that the appoint-ment of a Royal Commission to examine the working of the present 1947Constitution of Malta, and to make proposals, might in the end prove tobe the best course.2. We were authorised by our colleagues to initiate discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta, and asked to refer the matter again tothe Cabinet before bringing these discussions to a conclusion.3. I now report the outcome of these talks, and propose what should be done to avoid the stalemate which seems to be developing.4. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs and I, supported bythe Permanent Under-Secretary at the Home Office and other officials,held meetings with the Maltese Prime Minister and Minister forEmigration and Labour during the last ten days of May.    Dr. BorgOlivier said that he had come to London to find out more about the im-plications of the transfer of Maltese affairs to the Home Office.    He didnot want to commit the Government and people of Malta to any decision atthat stage, but had promised to consult his Legislative Assembly fullyafter his return to Malta.5. Previously he had asked for transfer to the commonwealth relations Office.    I made it plain to him that discussion of this would notbe profitable, and he appeared to accept this.    He said thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government^ offer of transfer to the Home Office, whilstappreciated, fell short of Maltese aspirations.    It might be acceptable ifit could be accompanied by an undertaking by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto consider proposals for a long-term financial settlement, and for a revision of the 1947 Constitution, especially over matters reserved to theImperial side of the Dyarchy.6. We explained to Dr. Borg Olivier that, although the suggestedtransfer to the Home Office was not intended by itself to make any changein Malta&apos;s constitutional position, the Maltese Government would be just as free under the Home Secretary as they are now to put forwardconstitutional or financial proposals if they so wished.    Whilst I could
not commit myself in advance to the view that proposals of the kindindicated by Dr. Borg Olivier would be acceptable to Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, he was quite free to put them forward in making his formal reply tothe Home Office offer.7. It was made clear to Dr. Borg Olivier that I expected to receive from him a formal reply to Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ offer of transfer to the Home Office (made last September) within a reasonable time after his return to Malta, accompanied by any proposals of his own that he wanted to put forward.    Our discussions were left on the note that dr. Borg Olivier would have further consultations in Malta, in the lightof the information he had obtained in London, and would then make his reply.8. The Maltese problem is basically economic and financial.A &quot;long-term financial settlement&quot;, in Maltese minds, means a payment by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to Malta, representing a kind of rent forthe strategic facilities of the island.    I urged Dr. Borg Olivier not to pursue the question of a subvention on these lines since the proposition that such payments were due as of right would not be acceptable.    But Iadded that this need not preclude the Maltese Government from proposing a long-term financial arrangement.     Malta is unlikely to be economicallyviable after payments for war damage cease.    If the island will have tobe financially supported by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in any event, Ishould myself (although I did not tell Dr. Borg Olivier this) think thatthere is a good case for promising some reasonable long-term financialassistance, as part of an arrangement by which the Maltese accept a status under the Home Office as satisfying their constitutional ambitions.Some amendment to hh-:-. present Maltese Constitution need not be ruled out.9. I now learn that the Maltese Prime Minister has adjourned hisLegislative Assembly until 28th September.    It looks as if no early replywill be forthcoming from him.    In the meantime, Mr. Mintoff (MaltaLabour Party), the Opposition leader, has been getting restive about his party&apos;s proposals for integration with the United Kingdom.    He has beenclaiming that Dr. Borg Olivier&apos;s Coalition Government, having a majorityof only one seat, has no mandate to commit Malta to a final constitutionalsolution; and wants to explore in London the practicability of his own proposals.10. There is thus a good deal of political ferment in Malta aboutconstitutional changes, as well as public interest in this country over theHome Office offer.    I consider that we cannot let this situation drag on,and that if there is no reply from Dr. Borg Olivier in the next few weeks,or if his reply is unsatisfactory. Her Majesty&apos;s Government should takea fresh initiative.11. The steps which might be taken would be to call a conference ofrepresentatives of all the chief Maltese political parties, together withrepresentatives of the Imperial side of the Dyarchy.    There is something in the contention that major constitutional changes would affect all parties,and should therefore be discussed in this way.    (The two major parties are very evenly balanced, but the Opposition are in fact the largest partyin the Assembly).    Alternatively we could, without attempting suchconsultations, at once proceed with the appointment of a Royal Commission,or other suitable form of enquiry into Malta&apos;s constitutional and financial problems,    I propose to discuss the relative merits of these courses with
ZLi othe retiring Governor, Sir Gerald Creasy, as soon as possible after his return to this country on about 25th July.12.        I should like to have my colleagues&apos; agreement that, if the maltese Prime Minister has not replied in the near future, I may proceedwith whichever of these courses seems best in the light of information Ihave from the Governor or Acting Governor at the time.O.L,.Colonial Office, S.W.1.19th July, 1954.
