Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1954CONFIDENTIAL CABINET OFFICE--&apos; RECORD copy . (54) 20421st June, 1954CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS: DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED IN CONNECTIONWITH GOVERNMENT BILLSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the annexed letter from a very loyal supporter of the Government in theHouse of Lords draws attention to a growing problem with which the upper house is to-day faced. For this reason I have asked the Prime Minister for permission to circulate it to my colleagues.2. The problem quite shortly is this. Very naturally, at a time when theConservative Government has a very small majority in the House of Commons,and when, therefore, they are extremely short of Parliamentary time to carry through their necessary programme, there is a tendency in all departments torefuse amendments to Government Bills in the House of Lords. I understand the reason for this very well. But the results are becoming increasingly detri-mental to the conduct of business in the Upper House. Once the impression isgained that all amendments to Bills coming from the Commons will be politelyrejected by the Government, both supporters of the Government and of theOpposition become increasingly unwilling to take any interest in the Bills or todo any work upon them. This applies to our own supporters just as much asit does to members of the Labour Party; and it is, I think, quite understandable.They are most of them experts in their subject, and any amendments they put downwill be the result of a good deal of hard work and designed, not to embarrass the Government, but to improve the Bill, and they do not see why they should goin for all this labour unless some attention is to be paid to their views. Thispoint has been put to me continually during recent weeks from the OppositionFront Bench and I have no answer to it; and it is now being urged with increasingforce by my own supporters. As a result, I think there is quite a possibility thatthe House of Lords as a body will cease to take any real interest in these Bills.There will be a formal Second Reading, perhaps one or two Government amend-ments, but, with that exception, the Bill will pass through without any serious workof a revising character being attempted on it. This may be satisfactory to Govern-ment departments; but it will, I suggest, be deplorable from a wider point ofview, since it will go far to confirm the charge so frequently made by supporters of the Labour Party that, when the Conservative Party is in office, the House ofLords is only a rubber stamp.3. I shall be most grateful therefore if, when Bills are passing through the commons, Ministers may find it possible to reserve one or two amendments of substance to be inserted in the House of Lords. There need not be many, butthere should be some.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,18th June, 1954.Copy No. r, jj46367
ANNEX7th June, 1954&apos;.You remember we had some talk about amendments to the Housing !Bill, inwhich we didn&apos;t have much success. But, as I told you, I think we all understood the difficulties of that particular Bill, especially as Harold Macmillan was goodenough to spend a whole afternoon discussing it with the Independent UnionistPeers.However, if the Government take the same uncompromising line about otherBills with less &quot; political dynamite &quot; about them, I believe there will be disappoint-ment which I suppose might express itself in the division lobby, but much more probably would lead our few volunteers to give up bothering. The work involved is considerable and it is simple to stay away.Perhaps you think, in present circumstances, that would not matter, and that,with our small majority in the Commons, and the congestion of business there,Lords&apos; amendments are rather a nuisance. Perhaps we should reserve our energiesfor the next Labour Government, when we could have front bench leadership,and when our I.U.P. Committees would no doubt be stronger both in numbers and quality.During the last Labour Government, the Opposition^ private sessions withAddison and Jowitt were certainly very successful and I think the Conservativeamendments stood a much better chance in the Lords than they did in the commons-no doubt that was in the main due to the fact that we were in themajority, though in opposition. But it certainly did make one feel that it was worth while working. ,I realise this is only an aspect of the much larger question of what are theproper functions of the Lords in these times, and I am afraid it will be very difficult for you to advise us. However, if, next time you address the I.U.P., you would say something on this matter, I think we should be grateful.
