SECRET0C.(54) 231 COPY NO.13th July, 1954CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS germany memorandum by the Minister of state on 7th July the Foreign Secretary circulated to the Cabinet(C. (54) 226) the text of the minute agreed between the President of theUnited States and the Prime Minister in Washington on 27th June aboutAnglo-American policy on Germany and the European Defence Community(E.D.C.).2.        The Foreign Secretary also made an oral statement in the Cabineton 9th July (C. C. (54) 49th Conclusions, Minute 2) explaining in generaloutline the action proposed in Parliament and with Congress and other interested Governments in accordance with the above minute.3, An Anglo-American Study Group has been engaged in London in working out this action in more detail. Its main recommendations havebeen submitted to the two Governments.4.        The work of the Study Group is, of course, hypothetical and will only become a matter of practical politics if the French Assembly fails to ratify the E.D. C. and Bonn Treaties in August.    It fell under thefollowing three main heads :-(i)     First, it prepared short protocols for signature by thethree Occupying Powers and the Federal GermanGovernment which would together (a) bring the bonn conventions into force before the E.D. C.;  (b) preventGerman rearmament until the E.D.C., or some alternative arrangement, had come into force; and(c) provide for continued support costs for our forcesin Germany during this interim period.    Theseprotocols would be negotiated with the French andGerman Governments after mid-August.(ii)    As, however, there is a possibility that the Frenchmight not agree to proceed in this way, the Study Groupprepared secondly plans for achieving much the same result by administrative action by the three western governments acting together in a way which would not require Parliamentary ratification.    The most likelyway would be by agreements between the Allied high commission in Germany and the German Government.
/oc/(iii)       Such action could, however, again be frustrated by-French opposition.    The Study Group thereforealso considered, as a third and last course of action,how the substance of the Bonn Conventions could bebrought into force, if necessary over Frenchopposition, by United States and United Kingdomaction.It is not necessary to take any decisions now upon the second, and still lessupon the third and most disagreeable, of these possible courses of action.But it may eventually prove useful to have cleared our ideas in this way.Fortunately, even on the third hypothesis, a great deal of the action required could be accomplished by majority vote in the Allied high commission without any breach of existing tripartite agreements.5, All we are at present concerned with is the first of the abovecourses of action and, more especially, with our action in Parliament and congress before they rise for the summer recess, and with the necessaryadvance warning to the French and other Governments directly concerned.The draft protocols worked out by the Study Group are attached (Annex I).It will be noted that Article 3 of the second protocol has not yet been drafted.    There was general agreement that there should be a clauseenabling us to prevent the French holding up all further progress on aGerman defence contribution as they have done for the past two years overthe E.D. C.    The Americans, however, basing themselves upon Article 6 ofthe agreed Washington minute, wished to go further than this and tointroduce a clause, the effect of which would have been to leave Germanyfree to reach her own decisions about rearmament after a stated and notvery lengthy period (probably about six months) had elapsed.    We couldnot agree to this.    As this clause 3 does not affect the immediate action required, it was agreed to hold it in abeyance for subsequent discussion if and when these protocols became an actual, instead of a hypothetical,issue.    Our opposition to any provisions which would have given suchliberty to Germany has been made very clear.6. A communication is being made by the United Kingdom and united States Ambassadors in Paris to the French Government on12th July informing them generally of our position, as set out in theattached telegram of instructions (Annex II).    It is being made very clearthat we are still hoping for French ratification of the E.D. C. and BonnTreaties, that these studies have been on a purely hypothetical basis butthat some advance notice had to be given to Parliament and Congressbefore they adjourned for the summer.    The German and Benelux Govern-ments and the North Atlantic Council will be given similar information.The way will thus be clear for a general statement in the course of theForeign Affairs Debate on 14th July.S.L.Foreign Office, S. W.l.12th July, 1954.

(annex IITELEGRAM NO. 1660 DATED 11TH JULY, 1954,FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO PARISHer Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government arenow considering the report of the Anglo-United States Study Group.    Itwill be forwarded to you by bag.2.        In consultation with your United States colleague, you should approach the French Government on the evening of Monday, 12th July,and make an oral communication in the following terms.    You should begin by recalling that, as was made clear in the Washington statement and in my statement in the House of Commons on 7th July, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, like the United States Government, are still working on theassumption that the German contribution to Western defence will be made through the European Defence Community.    We are, however, concerned about what would be the political effect in Germany if the French parliament were to rise at the end of their present session without having taken a vote on the E.D. C. Treaty.    No progress has been made since the Treaty was signed over two years ago in improving the international status of theFederal Republic.    Any further delay would have a most unsettlingeffect on Germany, gravely weakening the position of the federal chancellor and bringing his policy of European co-operation into disrepute.3.       As the French Government will be aware, bot3i Congress and parliament adjourn towards the end of this month.    Both Governmentstherefore feel that before such adjournment they should formulate their positions so that they can inform and consult with their Parliamentarybodies as seems appropriate in each case.    They have considered mostsympathetically the French Governments suggestion that any public statement in Parliament might be avoided or perhaps deferred.    her majesty&apos;s Government will however undoubtedly be questioned on therecommendations of the Study Group in the course of the Foreign affairs debate on Wednesday, 14th July, which is likely in any case to be the lastopportunity for the discussion of foreign affairs before the House rises.They understand, moreover, that consultation between the President and congress cannot be delayed much longer.    They do not therefore feelthat they can avoid making some public reference to this problem duringthe debate, although they are confident that this can be done in a way which need not embarrass M. Mendes-France.    For your own information, thepresent intention is for the Minister of State to deal with this matter inreply to what will have been said by other speakers in winding up the debate.4.       As the French Government know, the Anglo-United States study group was set up in London to consider on a purely hypothetical basis andin all its aspects the question how the international status of the german federal Republic could be improved were the E.D. C. Treaty not toenter into force in the very near future.    The two Governments have come to the conclusion that, in that event, their aim could best beachieved by dissociating the Bonn Conventions from the E.D.C. Treatyby means of a short and simple agreement to be concluded between thefour Powers who signed those Conventions.    Such an agreement wouldprovide, in agreement with Chancellor Adenauer, that German rearmamentwould be deferred for the time being.    It would also provide for thecontinued financial support of the Allied forces in Germany.
5.        In making this communication, you should of course leave the FrenclGovernment in no doubt that the two Governments maintain in full forcetheir support of E.D. C. and that it is their confident hope that the FrenchAssembly will vote the Treaty during the present session.6.        You should inform the French Government that we shall be makinga subsequent communication in the same sense to the German federal government, the Benelux Governments and the North Atlantic Council.7.        For your own information, you will see when you receive the study Group&apos;s report that it includes drafts of four-Power Protocols andconnected letters.    The existence of such drafts should not, however, be mentioned to the French now because -(a) the texts have not yet been finally cleared;(b) they cannot be submitted to Parliament at this stage;(c) knowledge of their existence might only encouragefurther delaying tactics on the part of Frenchopponents of the E.D.C. ; and(d) we could only usefully enter into negotiations upon them with the French at a later stage, if at all.Nor of course should you mention the possibilities of action which might betaken if the French were unwilling to proceed on the basis of the Protocols.We should regard these parts of the Study Group&apos;s work as being coveredby the words (paragraph 4 above) &quot;on a purely hypothetical basis and inall its aspects&quot;.8.        Should the French Government suggest that the work of the study Group might now be resumed with their participation, you should explain that this seems to us premature and suggest that it could onlyconfuse the issues while the E.D.C. issue is still before the Assembly.We shall of course be anxious to consult fully with them if to our greatregret the problem becomes actual rather than hypothetical.9.        We understand that your United States colleagues will be receivingparallel instructions.    The wording of your respective statements neednot be identical.    No written communication should be made.10.       I shall probably take the opportunity of my meeting withM. Mendes-France in Geneva on Monday to speak to him on similar lines,but the formal notification of our intentions should be made by you and your United States colleague in Paris.     You should request that thisnotification should be regarded as confidential pending whatever public statement is made in Parliament.
