3.CGRD copy .(54) 20621st June,1954CABINETEGYPTMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceMy Service colleagues and I agree with the Minister of State thatthe need for an agreement is urgent and that negotiations with the Egyptiansshould be re-opened as soon as possible.Scope of Base2. We agree that it is unrealistic to think of maintaining a base on anything like the present scale, nor is it necessary in the light of the lateststrategic appreciation.We need to secure -(a) the right of re-entry in the event of war;and(b) for a period, at least the nucleus of a base in peace.We want the workshops at Tel-El-Kebir in order to maintain our peace-time Middle East garrison. The only other workshops are in Libyaand we cannot keep these after 1958. tWe should like to have somewhere to store some war reservesfor our reduced Middle East garrison and the Jordan and Iraqi forces whichare dependent on us.    We should like to see the base&apos;s roads, railways and essential fixed installations kept in as good a condition as possible.We need the right to use the airfield at Abu Sueir and associatedstaging facilities.Although the base would be to some extent a functioning organisa-tion, it would be greatly restricted.Contractors or Technicians3. It seems clear that the Egyptians will not accept soldiers in uniform.    We agree that soldiers in civilian clothes are politicallyunacceptable.    We must, therefore, use civilian contractors or directlyemployed civilians or a combination of both.

their own words, &quot;reluctant, inefficient and expensive&quot;.    Our difficulties should diminish, the smaller we keep the organisation.    For both technical and security reasons we shall not be able to keep anything like the samerange of stores in reserve in Egypt as if we were able to employ soldiers.We must, however, accept these disadvantages if, as we must, we are toget an agreement.Period for Evacuation4. We cannot without a risk of serious losses and, perhaps, financialscandals carry out evacuation in a lesser period than two years.Availability&apos;5. We want not only a right to return in case of attack, but at leastagreement on consultation in the event of a threat of war.Period of the Agreement6. We favour extending the period of the agreement beyond seven years, if this is possible.    Politically we see the advantage of this, but from a military point of view we would object if the price were a reductionbelow two years in the period for evacuation.United States Participation7. We agree that there is not much hope of securing either Egyptianor American agreement to direct American participation in these arrange-ments.    General support, with perhaps some link between American aid for egypt and the satisfactory performance by the Egyptians of their obligation under &apos;any agreement reached with them, is probably the best we can hope for..A.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.21st June, 1954.
