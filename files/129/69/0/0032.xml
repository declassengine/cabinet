Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1954SECRETC. (54) 23215th July, 1954Copy No.82CABINETREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CIVIL expenditure memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Committee on Civil Expenditure was appointed by direction of the PrimeMinister, with the following terms of reference: &quot; To submit for considerationby the Cabinet proposals for ensuring that civil expenditure in the financial year1955 shall be reduced by  100 millions, below the total at present forecast forthat year.&quot;2 The total of Civil Supply forecast for 1955-56 at the time the Chancellorof the Exchequer reported his prospective deficit to the Cabinet was  2,342 million.This figure has since been increased (largely because of increases in Colonialemergency expenditure) by  26 million to  2,368 million, and consequently we decided to aim at a reduction of  125 million in the revised forecast.3.   Civil Supply may be analysed as follows:-A. Social services. National Health Service.........      ...2. Education, including Universities       ......3. Pensions, Family Allowances, National Assistance4. Housing, Equalisation Grants, and other servicesB. Agricultural and Food Subsidies1. Food (including Welfare) Subsidies2.

4. We have not examined those parts of Civil -Estimates which provide for defence Preparations.* These must depend on the strategic appreciation to whichthe Defence Policy Committee is giving its attention. But we think it right topoint out that considerable sums are spent in this way, and there is a large field for economies here if strategic considerations allow. The sums in the 1955-56Estimates are:    millionCivil Defence        ..................       45Strategic Reserves ...      ...      ...      .........       47General Ministry of Supply expenditure t      ......       42Total (as at F. 1 above)   .....      .,..........      134Atomic Energy ( 54 million) is also borne on a Civil Vote, and we are not ableto recommend a saving here.We propose, if the Cabinet agree, to make a review of expenditure on strategic Reserves, together mth the sectors Jof Civil expenditure on defence preparations, in the light of such decisions as are made on defence policy.  &quot;5. We have also left Over for later decision the possibility of saving part ofthe Exchequer contribution to the National Insurance Funds (Line E, in para-graph 3 above). The Chancellor of the Exchequer has this matter in mind.6. Of the remainder (Lines D and F, 3 of paragraph 3 above) amounting to 2,103 million, no less than  1,630 million is concerned with Social Services and agricultural and Food Subsidies. It is from these that the bulk of our proposedsavings must come. Although we have examined the whole field with care the savings in the remaining sectors of expenditure are bound to be relatively verysmall.7. Our proposals follow. The last figure against each item shows the savingwhich will result. Where legislation is required this is indicated.National Health Serviceid) Reduction of forecast capital expenditure on hospitals to  10million, which is the level for 1954-55. This will enable a little new building to be started, but considerably less than the Minister had intended    ...      .........(b) Restriction of allowance in hospital maintenance expenditure for new developments in 1955-56 to  1 million for England andWales, and  125,000 for Scotland      ...............(c) Prescription charge Is. for each item instead of for eachprescription form. This should be adopted unless the guillebaud committee proposes better methods of saving      ...      .....:Education(d) The charge for school meals should be increased in someway. The exact form of the increase is still being examined, but might well cover some part of the other costs, in addition to the costof the raw food as at present.  We would hope to save aboutIn this connection, we understand that the whole system of familyallo wances is being reviewed.(e) Universities. While expanding and accelerating the pro-vision of higher technological education, it has been found possible tospace the capital expenditure more widely than had been originallyenvisaged; it has also been possible to avoid an increase in the rateof non-technological building.  This would save     .........Agricultural and Food Subsidies(/) Reduction, &quot;of financial support to agriculture at the nextAnnual Review.  The aim should be a saving of    ...      .......    30 million(g) Leave retail price of milk at. Id. for the whole year, insteadof reducing it during the summer. If consumption is not affected bythis, the saving would be......      ............... 12 million&apos;* &quot;With the exception of the items in paragraph 7(r) and (s) below.t Excluding (a) that included in the Defence Programme, and (6) that on Civil Air Research andDevelopment. 6 million 3 million 5 million 4 million 2 million
We should only do this if our experience of the Id. price during next winter shows that consumption has not declined in the mean-time. If consumption is affected, we should consider raising the priceof welfare milk by \d. per pint (which would save  1\ million). Pro-vided we can get the much larger saving on ordinary milk (whichdoes not entail a direct increase in the price) we do not think the comparatively small saving on welfare milk outweighs the politicaland other objections to an increase in its price.(h) Increase price of bread by Id for 3\\b. loaf, with a consequentdecrease in subsidy from  40 million to  30 million, and an increaseof 0-29 of a point in retail price index............... 10 million(/) Introduce, as a complement to (h), a levy on all flour. Thiswould need legislation. The additional saving (derived from biscuits,cakes, &amp;c.) would be     ...............      ......     8 million(/) Increase of \d. per lb. in price of sugar. This would be rather more than sufficient to pay for increased costs of storage. The effecton the retail price index would be an increase of 0-08 of a point.It would produce.........      ...      ............     3 millionWe have brought the proposals above affecting the price of food to the notice of the Minister of Labour, and he is particularly con-cerned about the effect of any increase in the price of bread on wage claims and industrial relations.Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry General(k) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries has agreedeconomies on land purchase and capital expenditure, pests, ruralroads, allotments, capital expenditure on research institutes anddrainage grants, and additional receipts from sales of land andprogeny-testing, of some ...............      ......     1 million(/) Economies on Scottish Agriculture, on Fisheries, Forestry,Agricultural Research Council, Nature Conservancy and Develop-ment Fund total about   .&apos;....................     1 millionOverseas Departments and Information Services(m) The Arab Legion subsidy should not be increased, or if anincrease were needed on defence grounds it should be met from theDefence Budget   ...      ...      ..................     1 million(n) Technical assistance to other countries via the Colombo plan should be reduced ( 420,000) and that via the United Nations shouldnot be increased ( 150,000); with other economies by the overseas departments, the savings amount to something under.........     1 million(o) Overseas Information Services should be reduced from  10^million to  9-1 million. This is contrary to the recommendations ofthe Drogheda Report; but the views of the Home Secretary&apos;s Com-mittee on this Report (as expressed in C. (54) 185) expressly did not take account&quot; of any economies which may have to be undertaken asthe result of other deliberations.&quot; We think that the reduction werecommend should be achieved in a selective way; priority should begiven to expenditure on propaganda directly helpful in the &quot; cold war,&quot; on economic information including Commonwealth co-opera-tion and the promotion of exports, and on British Council expenditurein Asia including the Middle East, where this can be effective; certain other branches of expenditure we think should be curtailed, such asthe commissioning of films, exhibitions, British Council activities inEurope, and press advertising by the Service Departments. Wesuggest that some body, under Ministerial supervision, should be setup to achieve the recommended reduction in expenditure on the lineswe have indicated, after taking into full account the views of theForeign Secretary.46482 B 2
We also recommend seeking a 5 per cent, reduction in expendi-ture on home information by the Central Office of Information, andby the National Savings Committee, and a 10 per cent, cut in thelarger departmental information staffs.In all, these economies in the Information Services would savean amount approaching ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1 millionOther Home Departments(p) The Minister of Labour has agreed economies by reducingstaff, wages inspection, hostels (including an increase in charges),capital expenditure on factories for the disabled, a contraction oftraining, and is endeavouring to find additional minor economies,making a saving in all of.....................     1 million(q) While allowing for an increase over 1954-55 in work on road maintenance and minor improvements, the Minister of Transport and civil Aviation will endeavour to reduce the figure in his ForecastEstimate for 1955-56 by  900,000. He will in addition make savings in miscellaneous civil aviation services. In all, the saving would be ...    1^ million(An additional substantial saving of  800,000 could be securedif the development of Gatwick were to be postponed.)(r) It was thought that, while Civil Defence policy was subject to review, there was no point at present in planning the strengtheningmeasures for Tube railways under the Thames. This would pro-visionally save     ........................     1 million(s) Similarly, while the original programme for Emergency ports should be completed, the provision for further schemes for the equip-ment of emergency ports ( 1 million) should be omitted; and the pro-vision for expenditure on other Ports Schemes should be reduced (byabout  600,000), saving in all about     ............      ...    1^ million(t) Works economies on maintenance, furniture and overseasbuilding and at Kew (Palm House) will save about.........     1 million(u) Other economies include the postponement of the extensionof legal aid in criminal cases ( 500,000), the abolition by April 1956 ofthe regional organisation of the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, and savings on Scottish prisons. These would amountto something under       ............      .........     1 million 95 million8. In addition to the savings enumerated above, which all represent reductions in the intended expenditure for 1955-56 or an increase in receipts, there are twomeasures which, although not economies in the true sense, would effect a reductionin above-the-line expenditure.   These are:  (a) That grants for rural water and sewerage schemes should be related to the loan charges rather than to the whole of capital expendi-ture in the year. This reduces the cost of these schemes to the Budget;the reduction in 1955-56 is somewhat problematical, but would be ofthe order of        ...      ...      ......      ...      ...      ...      ...     2 million(b) That the period over which temporary (pre-fabricated) houses should be written off should be extended from ten years to fifteen years or some longer period. The amortisation payments at presentmet from Votes would be reduced in 1955-56 by some       ...... 16 million for both of these, legislation would be necessary.9. The total of all these reductions is  113 million. This falls short of the target of  125 million which we had set ourselves.
10. There is, however, a big field of expenditure which, as mentioned above,we have not examined, namely, the relation of the Exchequer to the national insurance Fund and expenditure on war pensions. This field will have to be reviewed when the report of the Phillips Committee has been received. It isimpossible to forecast at present the saving to the Exchequer which might result from such a review.11. We have, of course, considered a large number of other measures,including the possibility of making a general &quot; hotel charge &quot; for hospital in-patients, and of increasing the school-entry age to six years, but for a variety of reasons do not recommend them to the Cabinet.12. There are further measures of a more radical nature which are,however, unlikely to affect expenditure in 1955-56, of which the most importantare the proposals at present under consideration in &quot; Operation Round-up.&quot; Weare of the opinion that local authorities could be induced to be more economicalin spending the vast sums of money they receive from the Government of theorder of  600 million if the proportion of grant were less than at present. Inparticular, we consider that the 60 per cent. Education grant should be reduced to50 per cent.; but this could only be done as part of a general change in the financial relations between the Government and the local authorities. In the meantime, weshould do what we can to make local education authorities adopt an economicalattitude.13. It may also be possible to save a substantial amount on the emergencygrants and loans to Kenya and Malaya, possibly by increasing the contribution tobe made by these Colonies. This must await the discussions with the Governors ofthe territories, which are taking place this summer.14. We have recommended that the Ministers concerned with fisheries should agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the proposals for the future ofthe White Fish industry in our present economic circumstances. At present thesubsidy to Fisheries is an unsatisfactory and increasing item, and we see no prospectof its effective limitation until the longer-term policy has been settled.15. Further investigation is proceeding into certain points notably,the possibility of extending contract cleaning in Government offices, and economies in the cost of official transport. A decision will have to be taken in the Autumn onthe abolition of building licensing, which would save a considerable number ofstaff.16. We have suggested (in paragraph 8 (a) above) that grants for rural water and sewerage schemes should be related to the loan charges, rather than to capitalexpenditure. This change simply brings the services into line with Exchequerassistance to local authorities for their expenditure on housing and school buildings.We have considered whether this principle should not be extended to borrowing forthe Government^ own expenditure on such items as Government buildings,prisons, &amp;c, instead of providing the necessary capital out of revenue. There are,however, undoubtedly disadvantages in such a course, particularly if we have to look forward to a long period of expenditure on such items. The analogy ofcapital expenditure in industry is not exact, because that expenditure producesrevenue. On the other hand, there is a good deal to be said for not charging to asingle year the capital non-recurrent expenditure on huge Government offices,which cost several million pounds and are built to last for a hundred years or more.In any case, both because we think that the necessary budgetary economies Can befound better elsewhere, and also for general economic reasons, we do hot recom-mend that this extension Of the principle should be adopted for 1955-56. Neyer-theless, although such a course is not an economy in the strict sense, we considerthat it should not be ruled out for the future, at any rate in certain cases and if general economic conditions do not prevent it.[Conclusion
