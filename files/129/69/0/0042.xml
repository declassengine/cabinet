Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1954SECRET Copy No.   g CjC (54) 24220r/2 jw/y, i954CABINETHOUSING SUBSIDIESMemorandom by the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of housing and Local GovernmentThe Committee on Local Government Reform is considering the proposals in C. (54) 111 &quot; Operation Round-up.&quot; On housing subsidies it is in a positionto make a report to the Cabinet.2. After the reduction in the Bank Rate and in the Public Works Loan Boardrate of interest on loans to local authorities, a White Paper was presented on29th June foreshadowing as from 1st April, 1955 a material reduction in variousexisting subsidies. The general standard subsidy, for example, will fall from 26 145. Od. to  22 Is. Od. a year for sixty years. This general reduction will bemade by Order, requiring an affirmative resolution of the House of Commons.3. More radical changes will require legislation. Various details will needconsideration by officials, but the principles are clear. They involve a two-tier system of housing subsidies. The higher tier, for which a rate of  24 is recommended, would be available(a) for new houses built in replacement of the slums;(b) for new houses built in New Towns or other areas providing for people from overcrowded towns.All other Council housing (broadly described as &quot; housing for general needs &quot;)would attract the lower rate of subsidy, but with the existing discretionary supple-ments available to meet special cases. It is proposed that this rate should be  12.As &quot; private enterprise &quot; or &quot; unsubsidised &quot; house-building expands it should bepossible to reduce and eventually to abolish the amounts of the lower rate of subsidies.4. Unless housing is to be an increased burden on local rates, the proposedlower rate for general needs will no doubt require a considerable departure inthe rent policy of many local authorities. At present many tenants of council houses, both pre-war and post-war, are subsidised in their rents regardless of theirmeans. But the Brooke Report has pointed the way to differential rents as asolution.5. If the Cabinet accept these proposals in principle, a vital question is the timing of their announcement. Administratively, it would be valuable to makeit soon. Knowing that the subsidy for general needs housing would be  12 only,some local authorities would want to reduce their programmes. If the announce-ment is delayed, local authorities will assume that the new White Paper rates willcontinue and press for housing allocations at a greater rate than the resourcesof the industry can support, having regard to the rapidly expanding contribution of unsubsidised building.6. But it is scarcely necessary to draw attention to the importance of thepolitical issues involved.46514
7.  Appendix 1 gives the best estimate that can be made of the effect of theproposals on the Exchequer.Appendix 2 shows the present and expected house-building picture.H. C.H. M.19th July, 1954.APPENDIX 1Estimated Effect of Proposals on the ExchequerEstimated Number of Houses to be Completed in Calendar Year 1955By Local Authorities, &amp;c.        ......... 212,000By Private Enterprise (estimate)        ......      110-130,000Total in England and Wales        ......      322-342,000Scotland (mostly local authority building)    ... 40,000Total in Great Britain      .........      362-382,000Notes and Assumptions[These apply only to England and Wales.   Figures for Scotland areinserted above only to indicate approximate Great; Britain figures.]1. The number of completions by local authorities in 1955 is already deter-mined by the allocation made to them in 1954, which in England and Wales isabout 180,000. When this allocation was settled it seemed probable that private builders would only start about 80,000 houses. They have been more enterprising.2. It is estimated that at 31st December, 1954, local authorities, &amp;c, inEngland and Wales will have;  180,000 houses under construction.60,000 more approved but not started.3. The White Paper reduced rates of subsidy will apply from 1st April, 1955,to 30th June, 1955. If a Bill to effect the more radical changes now proposed is introduced in the autumn of 1954, they cannot be brought into operation before 1st July, 1955, at the earliest.4.   Local authorities cushion fall in subsidy by (a) spreading rise over all their houses so that all rents rise a little.;(b) wider use of differential rent schemes.(In 1952, 30 per cent, of Council households had incomes over 600 a year average income,  528. These will be higher now.)5. It is to be expected that, as from the announcement of the intention tomake the more radical changes now proposed, local authorities will try to completeas many &quot; general needs &quot; houses as possible by 30th June, 1^55, and thereafter to claim as many houses as possible as slum clearance replacements.6. On these bases, the completions of local authorities in England and wales and the approximate cost to the Exchequer might be:  1st quarter, 1955: 58,000   (Standard subsidy,  26 14s.)Annual cost to Exchequer of all subsidies., 1-6 million.2nd quarter, 1955: 58,000   (Standard subsidy,  22 Is.)Annual cost to Exchequer of all subsidies, 1-4 million.3rd quarter, 1955: 48,000 P(of ^ 4^00t f ^4, remainder at  1.2)4th quarter, 1955: 48^00 j ^ 9 m3n0n0 Exchec*uer of a11 subsldies&apos;1st quarter, .1956: 43,000   (of which 17,000 at  24, remainder at  12)Annual cost to Exchequer of all subsidies, 0-8 million.
