secret CABINET office. (54) 201 RECORD COPY copy NO-18th June, 1954CABINETEXPENSES of MEMBERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the Cabinet on 15th June (C. C. (54) 40th Conclusions, Minute 7)I was asked to prepare the draft of a Parliamentary statement in general terms on a scheme of subsistence allowances, and also a draft white paper setting out the details.    I accordingly submit the attached drafts.2.        I must at the same time make clear that the preparation of thesedrafts and their form and substance still make me prefer a system ofblock payment for expenses up to a set sum, say  250 or  300 a year.This would not only be dignified but would be more effective and wouldbe much more likely than the draft submitted to secure a measure ofagreement and an atmosphere in which we can conduct parliamentary business successfully.3.        At any rate I feel that the question of Members1 allowances should be settled first by deciding upon an expenses scheme to beintroduced as a provisional arrangement, and second by determining inour own minds at the Cabinet to-morrow how we answer the questionsof the leaders of -the Opposition about our iii tent ions as to a permanent settlement.    It may well be that we shall have to stand on the interim arrangement without committing ourselves for the future;  but this is a subject on which I shall be glad to contribute my thoughts.r.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.17th June, 1954.
ANNEX ADraft Statement.    .    ,      :    ..... , ,,I wish to make the following statement about Members&apos;expenses:-On 14th April, I said to the House:   &quot;There is no doubt that anumber of hon. Members are oppressed by serious difficulties becauseheavy and necessary expenses absorb so much of the parliamentary salary&quot;.    But I also said that., in the view of Her Majesty*s Government,it would not be right in present circumstances to proceed in the particularmanner recommended by the Select Committee - namely, to increase theParliamentary salary from  1,000 to  1,500.    That view did not prevailwhen an all-Party motion was set down to test the opinion of the House ona free vote on 24th May.    It cannot however be said that there is atpresent that wide measure of agreement in the House which I put forward in my statement of 14th April - with, I think, general acceptance - asbeing indispensable on this particular issue.    I then said:   &quot;It is essentially a House of Commons matter in which a wide measure ofagreement between the Parties is desirable, for it is the well-being andreputation of the House&apos; of Commons as a whole which is involved&quot;.The Government, therefore, now hope that a wide measure ofagreement can be reached on a proposal for a cash reimbursement tohon. Members in respect of extra subsistence expenditure incurredthrough attendance at Westminster.    The details are set out in a white paper which is now available at the Vote Office.This arrangement is intended to be provisional.    It is inaccordance with the practice already followed in other representativeassemblies in this country and overseas.    It should be possible in thelight of experience to decide whether or not something on these lines can
be embodied in our permanent arrangements. It will require a resolution of the House and a Supplementary Estimate: these will be submitted to theHouse at an early date.The House on 24th May recorded the opinion that legislation should be introduced to improve the financial position of Junior Ministers.The Government intend to introduce legislation for this purpose in theautumn.The Select Committee^ recommendations about pensions havebeen referred to the Trustees of the Members&apos; Fund as resolved by theHouse on 24th May.    I understand that the Trustees have already beguntheir study of the problem and the Government will consider their reportsympathetically when it is available.
ANNEX draft White PaperPROPOSED SCHEME OF SUBSISTENCE allowances for MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF commons.        Any Member of the House of Commons who attends at the house on a full sitting day will be entitled to draw a subsistence allowance -(a) if by reason of that attendance he spends the nightfollowing that day away from his home , at therate of  2 for every such day;(b) in any other case, at the rate of 12/6d. for every such day.2.        Members with two homes will be required to declare, both forthis purpose and (as at present) for the purpose of tax relief, which ofthem is their main base, and only absence from that main base will beregarded as absence from home for the purpose of the subsistence allowance at 1(a) above.3.        Payment will be made by the Fees Office on a simple declaration by each Member of his entitlement under (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 (as thecase may be).    Payment will be made monthly or in such other manner as suits the convenience of each Member.4.        Any subsistence payments drawn will fall to be taken into account by the Inland Revenue in settling the amount of tax relief to which aMember is entitled in respect of subsistence costs - since to the extent that expenditure is reimbursed in cash it no longer constitutes   a charge on salary ranking for relief from tax.    But a Member will continue to be eligible for tax relief on any amount by which his allowable subsistenceexpenses exceed the cash reimbursement drawn on account of them.5.        This scheme will not apply to Members of the House ofCommons in receipt of salaries or pensions under the Ministers of theCrown Act, 1937, or otherwise as Ministers, as officers of the House, or as officers of Her Majesty*s Household.6.        The scheme will come into operation as from /lat July, 19547.
