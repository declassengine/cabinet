Printed for the Cabinet. July 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   gC. (54) 23516th July, 1954.CABINETGATWICK airport memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Ctvil AviationWe must decide now when to announce the Governmenfs findings on SirColin campbell&apos;s report of his public enquiry into the proposed development ofGatwick Airport. I consider that the announcement should be made before the summer recess. I have discussed this confidentially with the Members ofParliament whose constituencies are affected by the project (they are all Govern-ment supporters) and they share this view. The Cabinet have already decided thatthe report should be published without delay (C.C. (54) 46th Conclusions, Minute 4).I understand that publication will be on Tuesday, 20th July. I should thereforelike to tell Parliament the Governmenfs decision on the following Monday. I can give the Cabinet an outline of what I would like to say.2. The advantages of this course as opposed to announcing the Govern-ment s decision either on the day of publication or not until the House resumes inthe autumn are(i) it would give time for Members of Parliament and others to have read thereport before the Government Statement, and thus to ask informedquestions;(ii) the subject could be debated on the Summer Adjournment, if there were a demand;(iii) the Governmenfs position and views on the various points raised by thereport would be made clear soon after publication. If this is not done,there will certainly be plenty of uninformed agitation stirred up locallyabout the project throughout the Parliamentary recess, and we maywell be faced with an intolerable situation by October;(iv) work on developing the airport could start without further delay.A. L-B.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,15th July, 1954.46505
