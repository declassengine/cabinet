( \........TOP SECRET cope No.  26C. (54) 25024th July, 1954CABINETREPORT BY THE COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE policy memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilWhile the Prime Minister was in Washington I presided over the concludingmeetings of the Committee; and, as the Minister of Defence is now abroad, itfalls to me to present the Committee&apos;s report.2. We were instructed to review, in the light of recent developments in atomic weapons, the strategic assumptions underlying current defence policy and thescale and pattern of defence programmes, military and civil. In doing so, wehave sought to secure all practicable economies in defence expenditure in 1955and subsequent years.STRATEGIC policy. A new strategic appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff has been circulatedseparately to the Cabinet (C. (54) 249). The Committee invite the Cabinet to endorse the following statement, based on that paper, of the aims and objectives of our defence policy.Our primary aim must be to prevent a major war. To that end we muststrengthen our position and influence as a world Power and maintain and con-solidate our alliance with the United States. If we do so, it is reasonable to hopethat major war may be averted, at any rate during the next four or five years,during which the United States will retain their superiority in atomic weapons andwill themselves be comparatively immune from atomic attack. Therefore, during that period, the military means to exert our influence as a world Power and tomeet bur &quot; cold-war &quot; commitments should have priority over preparations for major war, wherever there is conflict or competing demand on limited resources.Such resources as we can devote to preparations for major war should be concen-trated on measures which would be effective immediately on the outbreak of war.Thus, the main objectives of our defence policy should be:  (i) To possess the most modern means of waging war, so that we may holdour place in world councils on the issue of peace or war and play our part in deterring aggression.(ii) To continue to play our part throughout the world in checking the spread of Communism.(iii) To preserve security and develop stable government in our colonial territories and to support our world-wide trading interests.REVISION OF MILITARY PROGRAMMES4. The programmes of the Service Departments have been revised in thelight of this strategic concept and with the object of achieving the maximum practicable economy. The changes proposed are summarised in Annex I. In thefollowing paragraphs I mention the main proposals, including those which present political difficulties.46545 b
5. New building and modernisation will be confined to those ships whichcan play a valuable role in both war and peace. Nearly all the future building of the mine-sweeping fleet will be suspended and the conversion of escort vesselswill be curtailed.  The remaining programme will be spread over a longer period.The man-power of the Navy will be reduced over the next two and a half years by one-eighth to a strength of 120,000. The active.fleet will be reduced tothe minimum required for peace-time commitments.The reserve fleet will be drastically reduced. 4 carriers, 7 cruisers and about30 destroyers and frigates now in the lowest category of reserve will be scrapped.(b) The Size of the Army6. Owing to shortage of man-power, the strength of the Regular Army mustfall by April, 1956, from 435,000 to 400,000. This will involve the early disband-ment of a number of units, including 8 infantry battalions.The production programme will be reduced, so as to provide for the equipment of 8 (instead of 10) Regular divisions, 2 (instead of 4) Territorial divisions, and amuch-reduced Anti-Aircraft Command (see paragraph 9). The pace of the pro-gramme will also be retarded.Only 2 Territorial divisions will be equipped and trained for service overseas.(c) The Medium Bomber Force7. No reduction is at present proposed in the programme for the develop-ment of the Medium Bomber Force. This is an essential part of our contributionto the deterrent. In any event, a reduction in the ultimate planned size of theForce (viz., a front-line strength of 240) would yield no financial saving in 1955.(d) Air Defence of the United Kingdom8. The Chiefs of Staff have revised our air defence plans in the light of thenew strategic concept and the threat of attack by nuclear weapons of enormouslyincreased power. They believe that, if a nuclear attack were made on this country,it would be delivered by manned aircraft flying at heights over 40,000 ft., probablyat night and, after 1960, possibly by ballistic rockets as well. Against the latterno defence is yet in sight: against the former the Swifts and Hunters will only be partially effective as they cannot operate effectively at night or, except for a fewaircraft, carry air-to-air guided weapons. The Chiefs of Staff consider that, inorder to provide an effective deterrent during the next few years, we must maintain a fighter force which, though smaller in size than that planned hitherto, will have at least 50 per cent, of night / all-weather aircraft and be re-equipped as soon aspossible with the newest types of aircraft now under development carrying improvedradar aids and guided weapons.  It is therefore proposed that:  (i) The number of aircraft in each squadron should be reduced from 22, as now planned, to 16. This will reduce the planned size of the force from792 aircraft to 576, of which half will be night / all-weather fighters.(ii) We should slow down the programme for replacing the obsolescentMeteor aircraft by Hunters and Swifts and reduce the supply of thelatter types to the R.A.F. This will mean that Hunters and Swifts willbe sold abroad during the next two years while the Air Force still havea proportion of Meteors in front-line squadrons, and this will certainly involve some political difficulty. But it will enable us to reduce byrather more than 400 the number of Swifts and Hunters to be purchasedto replace the Meteors.In the long run, these measures will produce a relatively small but effective fighterforce.: 9. Anti-aircraft gun defences cannot make any real contribution to defence against aircraft flying at heights over 40,000 feet or against ballistic rockets. It istherefore recommended that Anti-Aircraft Command should be disbanded, exceptfor about 10 regiments of light A.A. guns for the close protection of radar stationson the coast. The small size and isolation of these targets make it more likely that they would be attacked by low-flying aircraft armed with conventionalweapons than by high-flying aircraft armed with nuclear weapons.
This step will certainly give rise to public discussion and anxiety. It can bejustified only on the basis that anti-aircraft artillery affords no effective defence against the form of attack to which we are likely to be exposed. This argumentcan best be deployed in the context of a general explanation of our revised defence policy as a whole (see paragraph 18 below),   s     ^ ... *Economies in Expenditure10. If the Cabinet approve the changes which we recommend in service programmes, expenditure on the Armed Forces in 1955 will total  1,630 millions.This represents a reduction of  120 millions on the large total expenditure whichwould have been required if present plans had remained unaltered.REVISION OF CIVIL PROGRAMMES11. The development of nuclear weapons calls for a new approach to theproblem of civil preparations for war. Plans must be directed to ensuring nationalsurvival during the initial phase of a future war. The role of the Civil defence services will be concerned largely with the after-effects of raids emergencyfeeding, treatment of casualties, providing for the homeless and restoring order.A new importance will attach to the mobile columns and, to the extent that it is practicable, dispersal will be a better safeguard than shelter. All the war prepara-tions of Civil Departments are now being overhauled in the light of the newstrategic concept.12. Meanwhile, we have considered what should be the level of expenditureon these preparations in 1955. We have advised Civil Departments to revise their defence programmes in accordance with the following principles:  (i) During the next four or five years the resources available for defence willbe directed primarily to the discharge of our commitments in the &quot; cold war &quot; and to the building up of deterrent strength to prevent the out-break of major war. Existing plans should be revised on the basis that,wherever there is conflict or competing demand on limited resources,these objectives will take priority over preparations for major war.(ii) We should, however, take some measures of insurance against the risk that we may fail to achieve our primary aim of preventing major war.We should therefore continue to devote a modest proportion of avail-able resources to those measures which are indispensable to nationalsurvival in the initial phase of a major war.(iii) In general, we should not devote resources to making preparations orproviding protection which, though adequate against attack by high explosive or other conventional weapons, would be ineffective againstthermo-nuclear weapons.(iv) Civil Defence programmes should be concentrated upon the measuresessential to building up public confidence in Civil Defence and sustainingthe efficiency and morale of the Civil Defence Services.(v) Subject to these qualifications, expenditure by Civil Departments on warpreparations should be reduced as rapidly as possible, though all&quot; paper plans &quot; should be revised in the light of the foregoing principles and kept up to date.We invite the Cabinet to endorse these principles. We set out in Annex II some ofthe main changes in the policies and plans of Civil Departments which would follow from their adoption.13. We are not in a position to submit a detailed statement of the savings tobe secured in 1955 as a result of the application of the foregoing principles. under existing plans defence expenditure by Civil Departments would have amounted in1955 to  45-6 millions, with an additional  18 millions on Post Office communica-tions to be financed by loan. A preliminary survey by the Departments suggeststhat the application of the policy proposed in this report would make it possibleto reduce the figure of  45; 6 millions by about one-third, viz., a cut of the order of 15 millions. In addition, there would be a reduction of about  4 millions in theI        Post Office expenditure which is financed by loan.(It should be noted that this figure of  15 millions includes a cut of  1-millions in expenditure on defence preparations at ports, for which credit hasalready been taken in the report of the Committee on Civil Expenditure(C. (54) 232).)46545 b 2
If the principles which we have formulated are strictly applied in the detailed examination of the Departmental estimates, the Treasury should be able to securestill further reductions in the defence expenditure proposed by Civil Departments   , ^for 1955. &apos; &apos;STOCKPILING14. Departments were planning to spend in 1955 a total of  47 millions on increasing our strategic reserves of food, oil and materials.A working party of officials is now reviewing this programme in the light of thenew strategic concept. It has been instructed to frame a five-year programme, inwhich stocks required for national survival will have priority over those needed for maintaining industrial production. Food, oil and materials needed for theemergency repair of air-raid damage will now be more important than rawmaterials needed by industry. Special attention will be given to the need to storestrategic stocks outside the target areas.This review will not be completed until September and its financial resultscannot yet be forecast. Though the new strategic concept gives an addedimportance to stockpiling, it would be idle to accumulate stocks which cannot bestored outside the target areas and this consideration may at first impose a limit on expenditure. There may therefore be scope for some savings under this head in1955.DEFENCE EXPENDITURE IN 195516. The Minister of Defence is satisfied that, even if the Cabinet approveall the changes proposed in this report, expenditure on the Armed Forces in 1955cannot be less than  1,630 millions. The Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot seehis way to provide for this purpose more than  1,500 millions. There thus remainsa gap of  130 millions.The Cabinet should, however, realise that the figure of  1,630 millions includes a provision of  80 millions against the possibility that the whole cost of the british forces stationed in Germany may have to be met in 1955 from the Exchequer.No provision for this was included in the Estimates for 1954. No firm forecastcan yet be made of the date on which the German Federal Government will cease to bear this cost. There is general agreement that it is most unlikely that the wholeof the cost in 1955 will fall on the Exchequer. If the Estimates contained no provision for meeting any part of this cost in 1955 the gap would be one of 50 millions.17. The Minister of Defence is convinced that greater economies in theexpenditure of the Service Departments can only be secured by changes in policyeven more drastic than those recommended in this report, including the furtherabandonment of existing military commitments. Even so, it is doubtful how far the effects of such further changes could show themselves in financial savings in1955. The problem of closing the gap, which would stand at  50 millions if no provision were made for meeting the cost of British troops in Germany, is oneof major policy which calls for decision by the Cabinet.18. From the point of view of presentation, some advantage could beobtained by presenting together in the next Statement on Defence the whole ofour defence expenditure, military and civil. There is a strong case on the meritsfor putting forward, in the Defence White Paper, a comprehensive picture of our defence effort as a whole. Indeed, as stated in paragraph 19 below, we have little prospect of gaining public acceptance for our revised plans for Civil Defence unless they can be presented as an integral part of a new policy for defence as a whole.From the financial angle, this would have the advantage that we should be ableto bring into account in a Statement on Defence a saving of some  15 millions on the defence preparations of Civil Departments.PRESENTATION OF NEW DEFENCE POLICY19. The policy outlined in this report will clearly need most careful presenta-tion to the public. Many people are preoccupied with the destructive power ofthe latest atomic weapons. Fewer perhaps have yet recognised that the develop-ment of these weapons may have made major war less likely. The public as awhole will therefore find it difficult to understand why, as the destructive powerof air attack increases, we propose to cut down our fighter and anti-aircraft
defences and reduce the scale of our expenditure on Civil Defence. These andother changes recommended in this report certainly could not be defended in isolation. Public acceptance of them can only be secured if they are presented as parts of a coherent plan based on the recognition that no purely defensivepolicy could ensure the safety of these islands and those who live in them andthat the main weight of our defence effort must now be concentrated on building up the deterrent strength which will prevent the outbreak of a major war.If therefore the Cabinet approve the changes in policy and programmes whichare recommended in this report, we suggest that we should on this occasionanticipate the annual Statement on Defence, which is normally published inFebruary, by presenting in the autumn a special White Paper on Defence containing a full statement of our new defence policy as a whole. This could be followed inFebruary, when the Estimates are presented, by a White Paper confined to astatement and explanation of the details of defence expenditure of all kindsproposed for 1955.S.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,22nd July, 1954.ANNEX 1List of Proposed Economies in 1955-56 Defence programme .

Royal Air Force   millions(a) Reduction in Fighter Command (retarding re-equipment; while retaining 36 front-line squadrons, reducing their size from22 to 16 aircraft (a front-line reduction of 216 aircraft inall); dispensing with certain reserve airfields);(b) Disbanding certain of the present 20 Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadrons;(c) Reduction in reserves of petrol, oil and lubricants;(d) Miscellaneous  economies  in  works&apos;  services,  production,administration and radar facilities overseas.These measures, in 1955-56, effect a total economy of     25Total Saving    115N.B. In paragraph 10 of the report it is stated that the savings on previously-planned expenditure amount to  120 millions. The difference between this figure and the  115 millions listed in this annex is accounted for by a transfer to CivilVotes of  7 millions of the Ministry of Supply expenditure on research and develop-ment and an increase of  2 millions in Ministry of Defence expenditure on theUnited Kingdom contribution to the N.A.T.O. infrastructure programme.ANNEX IIOutline of Changes in Civil Defence policy the following notes illustrate the effect of applying the principles in paragraph13 to some of the main defence preparations of Civil Departments.1. Civil Defence Services. Recruitment and development of the civil defence Services would continue: development of mobile columns would be accelerated.2. Civil Defence Equipment. We should continue to produce equipmentneeded for training. In addition, we should accumulate such further stocks of equipment as may be required to give the Civil Defence Services a sense of potentialefficiency in war. We might also continue the production of certain equipment,such as fire-fighting appliances, which take a long time to make. But we should cease to accumulate war stocks of other stores and equipment which could be acquired relatively quickly if it should later be decided that the tempo of our preparations should be quickened.3. Stockpiling. We should continue to accumulate reserves of supplies (e.g.,food and fuel) necessary to survival in the initial phase of a war. These should,however, be stored away from main target areas.4. Organisation and ControL-We cannot assume that it will be possible tomaintain central government control from London in a major war. Plans forusing the protected accommodation already available for Government use shouldbe kept up to date. But we should make no further provision of this kind, andshould devise alternative means of maintaining the essential machinery of Govern-ment with maximum flexibility and devolution.The system of control in the Civil Defence Services should be similarly revised and, wherever practicable, alternative control headquarters should be plannedoutside the main target areas.5. Communications. We should cease to provide expensive undergroundprotection for vital communications. Revised plans are in preparation for layingalternative trunk cables overland in wide arcs round the main target areas andfor providing a range of radio stations down the centre of the country.6. Shelter. It will not be realistic to attempt to provide shelter for the civilpopulation on the lines of that provided in the last war. Shelter of this kind would help to reduce casualties on the periphery of a thermo-nuclear explosion,but it seems doubtful whether public morale in war could be sustained by theprovision of such shelter in the target areas. This problem needs further study.
7. Evacuation. Except for certain priority classes, no considerable sectionof the population could be moved from the main target areas by a pre-arrangedscheme of evacuation.  But the size of evacuation areas will have to. be extended,find plans for the reception areas must allow for a large unorganised exodus fromhe target areas. These plans should be made on the basis of affording essentialrelief in the initial phase of a major war.8. Due Functioning. As regards public utilities, plans should aim at main-taining skeleton services without relying on the repair of the extensive damage which must be expected in main target areas. Stores of duplicate or spare partsshould be held outside the target areas.We cannot expect to maintain industrial production in the initial periodof the struggle for survival. Since no priority has so far been given to plans fordue functioning of industry, no change of policy is involved.The Port Emergency Plan, which is well advanced, should be completed,possibly at a slower rate. The increased vulnerability of major ports makes itnecessary to review existing plans for ensuring their continued functioning.The provision of oil supplies will be vital for relief measures and for thedistribution of essential commodities during the survival period and later.9. Chemical Warfare. We should consider whether or not to continue theproduction of respirators.  The Home Secretary is examining this problem.
