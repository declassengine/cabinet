Printed for the Cabinet. July 1954SECRET Copy No.   6C. (54) 2163rd July, 1954CABINETTRANSFER OF THE HIGH COMMISSION territories memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations on 21st May I gave Dr. Geyer, the South African High Commissioner, an aide-memoire (Annex I) containing a reply to the Union Government^ request for discussions in the terms approved by the Cabinet on 20th May (C.C. (54) 34th Con-clusions, Minute 5).2. On 8th June Dr. Malan handed to our High Commissioner a memorandum(Annex II) couched in most intemperate language which accuses us of havingfinally closed the door to negotiation and of having repudiated our obligations withregard to transfer. It concludes with an apparent threat.3. To anticipate a tendentious statement by Dr. Malan in his Parliament,which he was contemplating, our High Commissioner on my instructions gave himon 14th June a message (Annex III) and informed him that our full reply would follow. Dr. Malan then said he would wait until the return of Dr. Geyer to theUnion early in August before taking any further decision in the matter. precipitate action by the Union Government now therefore seems unlikely.4. The Union memorandum was, I think, designed to elicit a reply from uscapable of the maximum exploitation for their own internal political purposes.The threat in the last sentence of the memorandum was no doubt primarily intendedto stampede us. Our full reply should therefore demonstrate that we are unmovedby the threat, but it should avoid playing into the hands of the Union government by unnecessary provocation. It should, I think, be factual and objective and in a form suitable for later publication should this be necessary. A draft reply isattached at Annex IV and I invite the Cabinet to approve it.5. The references in the margin of my draft are to Cmd. 8707 of 1952 (Thehistory of discussions with the Union of South Africa .1909-1939). They havebeen inserted for the convenience of my colleagues and will be omitted from the reply when delivered to Dr. Malan.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1,1st July, 195446423B
ANNEX IText of Aide-memoire delivered by the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations to the High Commissioner for the Union of SouthAfrica on 21st May.aide-memoireYour Excellency informed me on 18th May that you had been instructed by your Government to enquire whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom would be prepared to open discussions on a Ministerial level regardingthe transfer of the High Commission Territories at Pretoria during August thisyear. I replied that I would have to consult my colleagues. This I have now done.When I discussed this subject with you previously on 1st April, I asked you to inform your Prime Minister that Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom could not agree to the transfer of the High Commission Territories atthe present time. I went on to say that if a request for transfer were to be publiclymade by the Union Government, either by tabling a resolution or by some otherofficial statement, it would be impossible for the Government of the UnitedKingdom to avoid declaring their attitude. We would be immediately questionedin Parliament; and we would be bound to make our position plain. It would there-fore be fruitless to embark on any negotiations as proposed in the draft resolution,because it would be clear to everyone in both countries that negotiations on transfercould lead to no practical result.As Your Excellency is aware, recent events led to the making by the PrimeMinister and myself of statements in Parliament, in which we made our positionplain. To engage now in discussions that could in view of what we have already said lead to no practical result could only in the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom cause misunderstanding in both countries and beharmful to the good relations existing between them. They are unable, therefore,to accept the proposal of your Government that discussions on the subject of transfer should take place in Pretoria. Nor, I should say, would they be able toconsider holding such discussions in this country.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. I,21st May, 1954ANNEX IIText of Memorandum delivered by Dr. Malan to the United kingdom high Commissioner in Capetown on 8th June1. The reply of the United Kingdom Government as communicated to us by our High Commissioner in London creates a situation which we must regard asregrettable and indeed very serious.2. The rather abrupt refusal to accede to the Union Parliaments request to resume the advanced negotiations, including important points of agreement andsuspended only as a result of the last war, inevitably raises the following questions:  (1) does the present United Kingdom Government repudiate &quot; the under-taking to transfer the Territories &quot; (cf. Lord Hailey) given in 1909 aswell as the commitments of its predecessor which in 1939 had practicallyagreed with the Union Government headed by.General Hertzog, and supported by General Smuts, to the transfer of the Territories, bothin principle and as to the method of execution? and if so,(2) does the United Kingdom Government agree that Section 151 of theSouth Africa Act has &quot; a meaning and an intention &quot; an admissionpreviously made, and to which the Union Government had thus an established claim, and if so,(3) how does the United Kingdom Government propose to give practical effect to the intention?
The reply to the first question is, self-evident and requires no elucidation.The negotiations, as well as the points of agreement reached in 1939, have now beenrepudiated in to to.The two succeeding questions are interdependent, and even more vital and urgent than the foregoing. After the repudiation of the 1909 undertaking, andof the 1939 agreement;-the Union Government must definitely know where theUnited JCjngdprn Government stands.with regard to,&quot; the meaning andindention,&quot;nariy,ok&amp;^ f&quot;1 &quot;lTi-s f^/y&apos; .i:r In this cbnhectiohitwill be appreciated that the Union Government&quot;can&apos;attachno value to the fact that the British reply professes to confine the refusal to&quot;present time &quot;---a phrase which must now inevitably be judged in the light ofthe history and experience of the last 44 years.In these circumstances the refusal of the United Kingdom government cannot but be considered as final, and as putting an end to all negotiations onthe subject.    :      miar.If this is so, we must record how deeply shocked public opinion in SouthAfrica will be at such an act of repudiation of an undertaking given to SouthAfrica before she attained full sovereignty, as well as the subsequent agreementbetween the Governments of two Commonwealth countries, in effect confirmingthe earlier undertaking. It will be difficult to underestimate the effect of thisrepudiation on future relations between our two countries at a time when mattersof common concern demand the most cordial relations and co-operation. For our part we can only say that the essential basis of mutual trust and respect, willhave been rudely shaken. We are aware that this is strong language, but wewould be failing in our duty to a friendly State if we did not frankly, and indeedstrongly, give expression to our sense of shock at what we regard as morally inde-fensible and, from the point of view of Commonwealth relations, most fortunate and disturbing.3. The Union Parliament can reasonably be expected to be informed asto the United Kingdom Governments reply, and questions directed to the Govern-ment can now be. expected at any time, in either or both Houses. The reply tosuch questions must naturally disclose what has actually happened. It will,however, not be regarded as adequate, unless it is followed by a clear statementof the Union Governments reaction to the reply received from the United KingdomGovernment.Such statement will obviously include the main points set out above, and inparticular will make clear that the United Kingdom Government has, by thenature of its reply to the Union Governments approach, closed the door to further negotiations. The statement will also refer to the fact that a new situation hasnow been created which leaves the Union Government free to determine its policyand actions now, and in the future.ANNEX IIIText of Message from the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relationsdelivered by the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Cape Town to dr. Malan on 14th june  have received your memorandum dated 8th June, the text of which hasbeen communicated by the High Commissioner in Cape Town.I shall send a full reply after discussion with my colleagues. Meanwhilehowever, since your statement that we have closed the door finally on all dis-cussion on Transfer shows a misunderstanding of our position, I wish to make clear that the words &quot; at the present time &quot; in my aide-memoire of 21st May andin the statements made by the Prime Minister and myself in Parliament here on13th April were used advisedly. These statements meant exactly what they said,namely that, as in the conditions which exist at the present time the UnitedKingdom Government would not recommend to Parliament a transfer of the territories, it would be fruitless at this time to embark on negotiations which could lead to no practical result.46423 b 2
ANNEX IVij,ir.. -t Memorandum . *mh?*?niv ow&apos;*.    T&quot;&quot; &apos;;ii   yi ^ i Transfer of the High Commission Territories \     ,     /On 8th June the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa handed to theUnited, Kingdom, High Commissioner in Cape Town a memorandum for trans-mission to the United Kingdom Government. ,-   &apos;&apos;!    ;   &apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;..-\\.2. In his message of 14th June to Dr. Malan Lord Swinton stated that thewords &quot; at the present time &quot; in his letter of 1st April to Dr. Malan, and in the statements made in the United Kingdom Parliament, were used advisedly and explained their meaning. The United Kingdom Government wish now to givea considered reply to the other points in the Union Governments memorandum.3. The United Kingdom Government must emphatically reject the charge that they have repudiated any agreement or undertaking. This charge is basedon a complete misunderstanding of the United Kingdom Governments position.Section 151 and the Schedule of the South Africa Act4. It is important to recall the genesis of the South Africa Act. and thecircumstances in which the Bill was presented to the United Kingdom Parliament.The draft Bill was prepared in South Africa by a National Convention of the fourColonies. Section 151 and the Schedule were included in the draft submitted bythe Convention and were ultimately passed by the United. Kingdom Parliamentvirtually in the same form.5.   Section 151 provides the legal machinery for transfer.   It is permissiveand does not impose an obligation on the United Kingdom to transfer. This wasmade clear in the United Kingdom Parliament when the Bill was introduced.  Inthe debate on the second reading of the Bill, the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith).said: &quot; The natives of the Protectorates are not at present subject to the juris-diction of the Union Government or the Union Parliament.   We, on the otherhand I assert this most strongly stand in the position, in many important respects, of trustees with regard to these natives.  We have given them promisesand pledges, and we are bound to see that those promises are fulfilled, and thatthose pledges are not violated ......  The important point is that you cannotbring any one of these Protectorates or Territories into a state of subordinationto the Union Government or the Union Parliament, as Clause 151 shows, unlessthe King, with the advice of the Privy Council that is, the Cabinet here agrees.That is a most proper recognition on the part of the South African communitiesthat&apos;the Imperial Government has a voice, and the ultimate voice, in relation tothis matter. They do not deny our right in the least; on the contrary, on the veryface of the Act, they admit it, and invite us to exercise it.&quot;6. During the passage of the Bill, pledges were given by the United KingdomGovernment that the wishes of the inhabitants would be ascertained and consideredbefore any transfer took place, and that Parliament would have the fullest oppor-tunity of discussing and, if they wished, disapproving any proposed transfer ofthese Territories. These pledges have been reaffirmed by successive UnitedKingdom Governments. Moreover, in 1935, General Hertzog informed the thenSecretary of State that he was well aware of the pledges which the United KingdomGovernment had given both to consult the natives and to afford an opportunity toParliament to express its opinion; and he did not question that the United King-dom Government were bound by them.7. The United Kingdom Government in no way dissent from the view of their predecessors referred to in the Union Governments memorandum that Section 151of the South Africa Act has a meaning and intention. Indeed United kingdom governments have always recognised that Section 151 and the Schedule contem-plate the Territories being handed over, subject to the fulfilment of the pledgesreferred to, at some time to be fixed by agreement between the two Governments;but the United Kingdom Government do not accept the contention in the UnionGovernments memorandum that there is any undertaking on their part, expressor implied, to transfer the Territories, unless the United Kingdom Parliament aresatisfied that the pledges have been fulfilled and assent to the transfer.
The situation between 1935 and 19398.   In 1935 it was plain that native opinion in the Territories was strongly   Cmd. 8707,opposed to transfer. In these circumstances the United Kingdom Government and   Pase 53-the Union Government concluded that for the next few years the wise course ofaction would be for the Union Government and the Administrations of the Terri-tories to co-operate in practical measures which would be for the mutual benefitof the Territories and the Union, in an endeavour to bring about a situation inwhich, if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics, it could be effectedwith the full acquiescence of the populations concerned.  These conclusions were set out in the Aide-memoire which the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs   pmd- ?Z07,handed to the South African Prime Minister on 15th May, 1935. ge9.   In furtherance of this course of action it was agreed in 1938 that a joint advisory Conference comprising officials from the Union and the Territories should Cmd. 8707,study openings for co-operation between them. It was also agreed that the Union Page 9,Government should prepare a memorandum setting out the conditions which would Para- 24-obtain under Union administration, if transfer were to take place.   With the Page 89.outbreak of war in September 1939, it was agreed that publication of the memo- Qmd. 8707,randum and of the report of the Joint Advisory Conference should be deferred, Page 10,and that the question of transfer should remain in abeyance for the time being. para. 27.10.   It is thus clear that there was in 1939 no agreement to transfer the territories as suggested in the Union Governments memorandum.The situation to-day11. The United Kingdom Government are bound by their pledges that thtwishes of the inhabitants would be ascertained before any transfer took place, andthat the United Kingdom Parliament would have the fullest opportunity of considering any proposed transfer. The United Kingdom Government wouldbe lacking in frankness if they did not in this connection refer to the effect ofthe native policy of the South African Government. The United KingdomGovernment have always recognised that it is for each sovereign government within the Commonwealth to determine its policy; but, in relation to transfer,the United Kingdom Government must have regard to the effect of Union policy on African opinion in the Territories.12. It has been common ground that transfer would not take place unlessthe inhabitants of the Territories (in the words of General Hertzog) &quot; are prepared and desire to come in.&quot; Indeed, the object of the memorandum which the Union Pale 54;Government prepared in 1939 for circulation in the Territories was to tell the african people in those Territories the conditions which would obtain after page 89.transfer. These Africans will form their opinion on those conditions in the lightof the current native policy of the South African Government. No one wouldcontend that they would willingly accept the native policy of the South african government at the present time or that to-day they &quot; are prepared and desire tocome in.&quot; Nor in these circumstances would the United Kingdom Parliamentbe prepared to assent to transfer were it proposed at the present time.13. For these reasons it was made clear in Lord Swinton&apos;s letter of 1st april to Dr. Malan and in the statements made in the United Kingdom Parliament on13th April that no useful purpose could be served by entering upon negotiations with were bound to be fruitless at the present time.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,29th June, 1954.
