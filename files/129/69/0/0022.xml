S3SECRETC.(54) 222COPY NO7th July, 1954CABINETDISPOSAL OF LAND ACQUIRED COMPULSORILYFOR PUBLIC PURPOSESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs on 2nd June the Cabinet approved in principle an announcement ofpolicy on the disposal of land acquired compulsorily for public purposes onthe general lines of the draft statement annexed to C. (54) 182, but invited the Minister of Agriculture to reconsider its exact terms in the light of the cabinet&apos;s wish that they should be kept as general as possible (C. C. (54) 37th.Conclusions, Minute 4).    Subsequently, the Ministers concerned agreed uponthe terms of the attached draft statement (Annex I).2.     At a recent meeting of the Committee of Ministers which is considering the arrangements for the forthcoming debate on the crichel down case, the Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed the view that theproposed statement of policy did not go far enough in the direction of ensuring, wherever possible, the disposal by the Government of land whichhad been acquired by the use, or threatened use, of compulsory ppwers;  inparticular, the phrase in paragraph 1 - &quot;the sale of agricultural land whichwas acquired compulsorily or under threat of compulsion and is no longer required for Government purposes&quot; - would appear to leave the way open for a repetition of what happened over the disposal of Crichel Down.    he accordingly suggested that the proposed announcement of policy should include more stringent safeguards against the transfer of such land fromone Government use to another in the future.3.     There was general support in the Committee for the Chancellor&apos;view and it was agreed that it was desirable that the official Land TransactionrCommittee should urgently re-examine the draft statement on the basis that ministers favoured in principle its modification on the lines suggested.The Committee contemplated that the proposed new policy on disposal shouldbe expressed as applying to agricultural land which was no longer requiredby the original acquiring Department, or immediately by any other Govern-ment Department possessing compulsory purchase powers, for a purpose for which the use of those powers would be justified.    Indeed, the view was also expressed that, even in cases where land was required by suchanother Government Department, some means ought, if possible, to be devised whereby interested persons or members of the general publiccould be enabled to raise objections to the proposed transfer of the land from one such Department to another.4.     The Committee invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrangefor the Land Transactions Committee to review the draft statementaccordingly and to report to me in order that I might submit recommenda-tions on this matter to the Cabinet for their consideration during the
present week.    The Land Transactions Committee were instructed to relatetheir recommendations primarily to the case of agricultural land, and if, asappeared to be likely, they should adhere to their earlier view that a policyof the kind proposed could not be applied to &quot;sites&quot; (i.e. land with buildings -other than agricultural buildings - upon it), to recapitulate, for the informa-tion of Ministers, the grounds on which this view was based.5.     I now circulate, for the consideration of the Cabinet, a report whichI have received from the official Land Transactions Committee (Annex II)in which they recommend:-(a) that, before a Department transfers agricultural land aquired under compulsory powers to another department for a purpose for which there is no power of compulsory acquisition, the land should be offered for sale to theformer owner;(b) that it should be open to a Department to transfer suchland to another Department for a purpose for which powersof compulsory acquisition exist, without any special procedure;(c) that no alteration should be made in the present procedure for disposing of surplus &quot;sites&quot;.D.M.F.Home Office, S. W.l.6th July, 1954.
This leads me on to the next general question of policy which theGovernment have had under consideration for some time, namely the saleof agricultural land which was acquired compulsorily or under threat of compulsion and is no longer required for Government purposes.2.      The Government recognise that the former owner or certain of his successors may fairly claim that they should be given a special opportunityto buy such land.    Nevertheless the circumstances under which land isacquired, or disposed of, are so varied that it would not be possible to lay down any fixed rules capable of being applied in every case.    Forexample the land may at the time of its disposal be wanted by a localauthority for housing sites or some other purpose for which compulsory purchase powers could be used;  or it may have been compulsorily acquiredunder the Agriculture Act because the owner was not willing or able to fulfil his responsibilities under the rules of good estate management;alternatively the whole character of the land may have been altered forinstance by the erection on it of buildings other than agricultural buildions or by the laying down of concrete runways on an airfield which might makeit impracticable to restore the former boundaries;  or again there may be small parcels of land left over from land acquired for say trunk roadsor forestry which may not be suitable for resale to the former owners.These are only some examples of the circumstances relating to a parcelof land which may arise and which make any rigid rule impracticable.It will also sometimes be a matter of difficulty to decide whether the successor in title has a special claim.    Nevertheless, the Government willin future be prepared to consider each case on its merits, and wherecircumstances show that land can properly be offered to a former owneror his successor who can establish a special claim, this will be done ata price assessed by the District Valuer as being the current market price.    This procedure cannot be applied retrospectively;   it can onlyapply to future disposals.PROPOSED ANNOUNCEMENT OF GENERAL policy on DISPOSAL OF LAND
ANNEX IIDISPOSAL, OF LAND PURCHASED COMPULSORILY for public PURPOSESReport by the Land Transactions CommitteeIn the forthcoming debate on Crichel Down, the Minister of Agriculturehas it in mind to make a statement on future policy about the disposal ofland.    Broadly speaking, the proposed statement is to the effect that, whereagricultural land has been acquired compulsorily and is no longer requiredfor Government purposes, the former owner will in appropriate cases begiven an opportunity to buy the land back at the current market price.2.     At the request of Ministers, the Land Transactions Committee (whichis representative of all Departments concerned with land) has examined two questions arising out of the proposed statement:-(a) If the statement refers to &quot;land no longer required forGovernment purposes&quot;, it envisages a continuance ofthe existing procedure under which the land&quot; is offered to other Departments (which might or might not havebeen able to use powers of compulsory acquisition)before it is offered for sale to private individuals.Ought a Department which no longer requiredagricultural land for the purpose for which it wasacquired to offer it at once to the former owner,possibly with a proviso that the land might be retained for a further Government purpose if (i) compulsory powers could be used, and (ii) a special enquiry were held to ascertain that the conditions governingacquisition for the new purpose could be regarded asreasonably well-fulfilled?(b) Ministers also asked the Committee to consider whether any policy adopted under (a), in regard to agricultural land, should apply to sites - i.e. land with buildingson it, other than agricultural buildings.Disposal of Agricultural Land3.     The scope of the problem should not be over-estimated.    Depart-ments do not normally acquire land outright if they do not expect to need itpermanently, and, except when there has been extensive acquisition on threat of war or during a war or other emergency, the question of releasing theland seldom arises.    The current cases are largely concerned withacquisitions immediately before the war or during the war.    The long-term problem is of very small size.4.     The Committee consider that a former owner might reasonably begiven an opportunity to regain his land before the land is offered to another department for a purpose for which powers of compulsory acquisition donot exist.    This would rule out most of the transfers of land to the Ministryof Agriculture that now take place and would considerably reduce the size of the problem.    The transfer of land to another Department for a purpose for which powers of compulsory acquisition exist should be allowed.Otherwise, if the former owner were allowed to buy back the land, he might find fresh proceedings for compulsory acquisition being started soon after he had regained it, and there would be difficulties about price.
m5.      The Committee have considered whether some special proceduremight be devised in these cases of transfer from one Department toanother, which would take the place of the statutory procedure which thesecond Department would have to follow if it were proceeding de novo toacquire the land compulsorily.    Departments, however, regard any such proposal as impracticable.    In the case of transfers between the service departments, which will become the most common type of transferif the   proposal in the preceding paragraph is adopted, all the Departmentsconcerned have the same statutory powers and follow the same procedure under the Defence Acts (which does not require any local public enquiry in the event of objections from private individuals, although the Departmentsdo observe a non-statutory procedure designed to give Departments andpublic authorities an opportunity to object).    The Service departments would oppose, on defence and security grounds, any procedure for transferredland which would be more restrictive than their existing wide power of acquisition de novo.    There is perhaps a stronger case for a specialenquiry before land is transferred from a Department which acquired it under the Defence Acts to a Department which has different powers,involving an obligation to hold a local public enquiry if objections were raised.    But -(a) such cases are likely to be rare in future;(b) the public enquiry, after all, is concerned with a proposalto use land for a particular purpose, and the introductionof a special enquiry before transfer from one Depart-ment to another might lead to pressure for a similarspecial enquiry before an alteration in the use of landwithin the ownership of the same Department (e.g. a post Office building diverted from postal to telephoneuse).    Departments felt strongly that this would be quite unreasonably restrictive, and that it can fairly be assumed that, when compulsory powers have oncebeen properly used to acquire any particular piece ofland, its use for any other purpose for which compulsory powers exist would be authorised if those powers were used.6.      The procedure, outlined above, under which compulsorily-acquiredland might be transferred to another Department for a purpose for whichcompulsory powers might be used but might not otherwise be transferredto another Department, is intended to apply to land which was in agriculturaluse before acquisition and is still capable of being used for agriculture.It should not apply where the character of the land has been changedsubstantially (e. g. by construction of an airfield) so as to make itimpossible for the former owners to use the land in the manner they did.In the latter type of case, the transferring Department should be able to hand the land over to another Department (e.g. the Ministry of Agricultureor Department of Agriculture for Scotland) without regard to whether theDepartment could have employed compulsory powers of acquisition.    More-over, there are cases where Departments have statutory powers of acquisition for the purpose of ensuring that land is used in a particularway, and in order to ensure such use they may have to sell it (e, g. theBoard of Trade may acquire land under the Distribution of Industry Act,1945, and sell it to an industrialist):  such cases must obviously be excluded from the restriction on transfer.
Treasury Chambers,S.W.1.6th July, 1954.7.     The provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,relating to the circumstances in which former owners could regain their land, did not extend to land with buildings on it, and there is a long tradition of dealing with sites in a different manner from agricultural land.    WhereDepartments acquire land for development, buildings are frequently erectedor other work done, so as to change the character of the land, with consequent increases in value (e.g. a factory worth  500,000 may be erected on land acquired for  2,000).    This takes the land outside theinterest or resources of the original owner, and, of course, he has no&quot;moral claim&quot; to acquire the buildings.    Thus the Ministry of Supply,having erected a factory and licensed it to an industrialist, may wish atsome stage to sell the factory to the industrialist without bringing in theformer owner.    In other cases of the disposal of sites, there is a procedure for notifying surplus properties to other Departments, but only in a relatively small proportion of cases is the site required by another Depart-ment.    In a great majority of these cases, the site is advertised for sale and the general experience of Departments is that, if a former ownerwishes to buy the site back, he is aware of the sale and makes an offer.In the ordinary way, these transactions are regarded on both sides asstrictly commercial in character.    Sentimental ties might exist in regardto a house which a Department has acquired and has not substantiallyaltered, but it is rare for compulsory acquisition to be applied in thesecases, and even rarer for the owner to desire to have his house back.    Thegeneral view of Departments is, therefore, that no alteration is called for in the present procedure for disposing of surplus sites.conclusion.     The Committee accordingly recommend:-(a) that, before a Department transfers agricultural land acquired under compulsory powers toanother Department for a purpose for whichthere is no power of compulsory acquisition,the land should be offered for sale to theformer owner;(b) that it should be open to a Department to transfersuch land to another Department for a purpose for which powers of compulsory acquisitionexist, without any special procedure;(c) that no alteration should be made in the present procedure for disposing of surplus sites.
