EGYPT:  DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsAdvantages of an Agreement with EgyptWe can re-deploy our troops and release our Army from a commit&quot;ment which is becoming intolerable.2.        We shall secure an immediate financial saving.3.        Nuclear weapons have changed the whole picture of warfare.Smaller bases, re-deployment and dispersal are a more efficient way of employing our strength.4.        We now need a smaller base, workshop facilities for our middle east forces in peace and storage for war reserves, at least for the next fewyears.     We also need air transit facilities.    We have them now, and we can keep them by agreement with the Egyptians.5.        An agreement will give us a clause on the Suez Canal which willunderline Egypfs obligations to maintain free navigation.6.        We hope that an agreement will lead to an improvement in ourrelations with the Arab world.Disadvantages of having no Agreement7.        We secure none of the above advantages, except such military facilities as we are at present maintaining at great cost and effort.8. We relapse into a vicious circle of incidents and counter-measures,leading probably to intervention in Egypt by British troops.9.        The Treaty to all intents and purposes expires in 1956.    We couldnot then, in the face of world opinion, refuse arbitration.    As that timeapproaches, we have less and less to negotiate with, and our chances ofsecuring our essential meeds diminish.10.       We lose the chance of better relations with Egypt, and other arab state s.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use top SECRET Copy No...f^fe.C.(54) 24823rd July, 1954CABINET
Ill11.       A fighting withdrawal would either cause us a great loss of prestige or elsa involve us in the same commitments as the policy of standing our ground.    We should of course lose the facilities, and the suez Canal declaration, which we would get under an agreement.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.22nd July, 1954.
