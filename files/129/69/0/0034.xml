CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 2C. (54) 23417th July, 1954CABINETATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION AT SOUTHAMPTONMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 2nd June the Cabinet invited me, in consultation withthe Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Minister of Fuel and power, to prepare and submit to them a statement of the measures to be takento reduce the dangers of atmospheric pollution in Southampton, as a result ofthe conversion to oil firing of the power station which is being built at Marchwood(C.C. (54) 37th Conclusions, Minute 6). I attach a statement prepared by the officials concerned.2. We agree that the proposals set out in paragraph 11 of the statement shouldbe adopted, and for this purpose the Minister of Fuel and Power is already inconsultation with the British Electricity Authority.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,15th July, 1954.ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION FROM OIL FIRING AT MARCHWOODPOWER STATIONMeasures to Reduce the Dangers of Pollution in SouthamptonThe power station now being built at Marchwood (three milejj south-west ofSouthampton) is designed to burn either oil or coal and will contain eight60-megawatt electricity generating sets, that is a total of 480 megawatts. Whencompleted it will be larger than Fulham (360 megawatts), Battersea (413 megawatts)or Bankside (139 megawatts), but smaller than either Barking (597 megawatts)or Hams Hall, Birmingham (570 megawatts). The sets will come into operation at irregular intervals from 1955 until 1961. There will be two chimneys, each425 feet high, to assist dispersal of the chimney gases. It will be a two-shift station,operating on an annual overall load factor in the region of 40 per cent.; though there will be periods when all the sets will be in full operation.2. When the completed Marehwood Station is in full operation on oil, thesulphur dioxide leaving the chimneys will be nearly twice the quantity produced at full load by either of the coal-fired stations at Barking and Hams Hall, whichare amongst the largest now in operation, but there would be no grit emission.3. The only processes for the removal of sulphur dioxide from the flue gasesof power stations that have been operated on a large scale are the &quot; B.E.A.-Battersea&quot; process, in operation at Battersea and Bankside, and the&quot; Howden-I.C.I.&quot; process, which was operated at Fulham before the last warbut is not now used.4. The &quot; B.E.A.-Battersea &quot; process at Bankside removes more than 95 percent, of the sulphur dioxide from the gases from the burning of fuel oil containingnearly 4 per cent, of sulphur. It requires the circulation of large quantities ofwater from the River Thames (70 tons for every ton of oil burned) and there is asimilar quantity of liquid effluent discharged to the river. The overall cost ofthe process, which gives no product of value, is about 15/- per ton of oil burnedor 8 to 10/- per ton of coal when coal is the fuel.46506Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1954
5. The &quot; Howden-LCI. &quot; process does not give rise to a liquid effluent butproduces a sludge of calcium sulphate which has to be dumped at sea. The overallcost of this process at present prices would be 12 to 14/- per ton of coal burnedor about 20/- per ton of oil.6. Before the recent war, experiments on a small scale were made at Fulhamon the treatment of the flue gases with ammonia in the form of crude concentrated&quot; gas liquor &quot; (a by-product of gas works) to produce ammonium sulphate fertiliserand sulphur. This experimental work has since been continued, in the laboratoryand with small pilot plants, at the Fuel Research Station of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research, with promising results. It has been estimatedthat, on a full-scale, this process would be much less costly than either the &quot; B.E.A.-Battersea &quot; or the &quot; Howden-LCI. &quot; processes. With coal or oil containing morethan 2\ per cent, of sulphur, the proceeds from the sale of the ammonium sulphateand sulphur should cover the whole cost of the process, including interest on andamortisation of the capital cost of the plant.7. Before this &quot; ammonia &quot; process could confidently be recommended for full-scale operation, experiments at a power station with a large pilot plant are needed. A proposal by the Fuel Research Station that such a pilot plant shouldbe erected for further investigation and development work is being seriously considered by the British Electricity Authority, and first designs and estimates of cost have been prepared.8. The maximum quantity of concentrated &quot; gas liquor &quot; that could be pro-duced by the gas industry for this process would be sufficient for five or six largepower stations, but not more.9. None of the several other methods proposed for the removal of sulphurdioxide from the flue gases of power stations shows promise of being practicableat any reasonable cost.10. All washing processes cool the chimney gases and thus reduce the&quot; effective &quot; dispersal of the gases discharged. Provided, however, that more than90 per cent, of the sulphur dioxide is removed, the resulting concentration ofsulphur dioxide near ground level would be much less than without treatment.11.   It is proposed, therefore, that (a) arrangements should be made to proceed as rapidly as possible with theerection of a large pilot plant at a power station to develop the&quot; ammonia &quot; process of removal of sulphur dioxide from flue gases;(b) measurements, of atmospheric pollution in the Southampton area shouldbe intensified immediately so that, as the Marchwood power stationprogressively comes into operation, it will be possible to obtain a firmassessment of its effects;(c) the station should be built throughout, as at present proposed, for alternative oil or coal firing.. As provided in the original sanction forits erection, it will include space for gas washing plant, so that suchplant can be erected if it is found to be necessary;id)   if the measurements referred to in (b) show undue pollution by sulphurdioxide with oil firing, then either(i) oil firing should be changed over to coal firing to the necessaryextent, either temporarily or permanently; or(ii) if found practicable, gas washing plant should be installed toremove at least 90 per cent, of the sulphur dioxide from the fluegases before discharge.
