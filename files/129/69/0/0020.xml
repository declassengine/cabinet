The United States agreed to follow up the British approach,stressing their support for the British proposals.    After the approach hasbeen made, the British plan to make public announcement that they havetaken the initiative in resuming discussions, unless it develops in theirtalks that greater progress can be made on a secret basis.    If the Britishmake such an announcement, the United States would make a statementwelcoming the resumption of negotiations and emphasising the importance from the United States point of view of early agreement.    If the Suez Basetalks start satisfactorily, the United States would begin negotiating with egypt the necessary cover agreements required before United states assistance can be extended.    It is understood that these agreements would not be signed prior to signature of the heads of agreement betweenthe British and the Egyptians on the Suez Base.    Should protracted delaysresult due to unforeseen circumstances, further consultations might berequired regarding the extension of United States assistance.    The UnitedStates agreed that, while there should be no legal connection between the suez Base Agreement and the United States Assistance Agreements, a way would be found to indicate to the Egyptians that United States assistance would be conditioned upon Egyptian fulfilment of the Base Agreement.This should be accomplished in a manner which would not indicate to the egyptians an advance distrust that they would in fact not live up to theagreement.    The United States also agreed to support publicly the principleof freedom of transit through the Suez Canal to be re-affirmed by theBritish and Egyptians.
