THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT-    1        Printed for the Cabinet. June 1954SECRET, CABINET OFF!C iRECORD&apos;COPY ^Copy No.  g5C. (54) 20321 st June, 1954CABINETNEW COLONIAL OFFICE building memorandum by the Minister of works the Colonial Office was moved from Downing Street in 1946 because of pressure on the accommodation there. The intention was to build a newColonial Office on the site of the old Westminster&quot; Hospital and the oldStationery Office.2. Mr. T. S. Tait, a private architect, prepared plans which have beenaccepted by the Royal Fine Art Commission. There was criticism of his firstscheme on the grounds that the building would be too big for the site oppositeWestminster Abbey, and the plans were altered so as to set back the main face ofthe new building considerably behind the front line of the old hospital. Half the site of the hospital would not be built on.3. About  850,000 out of a total estimate of  3^ millions have been spenton acquiring the site of the old Westminster Hospital, on architect^ fees for thepresent scheme and on constructing the foundations and sub-basement. Work was stopped in April, 1952 as an economy measure, but in November last (H.A. (53)24th Meeting, Item 1) the Home Affairs Committee agreed that work ought to be resumed as soon as possible and completed as quickly as possible, and asked me to seek the necessary financial authority. After the Home Affairs Committee had given approval I recast the programme and arranged to start building the super-structure in March, 1955. I would hope to complete the building in November,1957. I have not yet sought financial authority for the continuation of thebuilding.4.   The reasons for proceeding with the building are:  (1) The Colonial Office badly needs suitable headquarters accommodation.At present it is housed in leased buildings, which provide pooraccommodation and do not make a good impression.(2) The intention to provide this building has been made known in thecolonies and they have made gifts toward its interior finishings.(3) The combined site of the old Westminster Hospital and the old stationery office is very valuable and we should seek a return from it.(4) If we go ahead now the new building will be completed and will providespace for about 1,150 staff shortly before requisitioning powers arelikely to expire. At the same time leases of about a million square feet of headquarters office space are due to run out. We need moreaccommodation to ease the problems of derequisitioning and in casenot all the leases can be renewed.5. The Colonial Secretary and I looked very carefully at the model of thenew building.   We did not think it was perfect but the site is extraordinarily46366
difficult to handle. We^,thought it might still be possible to simplify some of thefeatures of the building.6. The Treasury have been consulted but consider the scheme will have tobe ,looked at again in connection with the work of the Committee on civil expenditure. The Colonial Secretary and I would like a decision now becausemoney is being spent on preparations which will be wasted if the buildingls^nortogo ahead, and, more importantly, because the need for a new Colonial Office is sourgent. ; -       ,..D. E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.18th June, 1954.
