is(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETAt the meeting of Cabinet on 1st July, 1954 I was invitedto c irculate a memorandum on the probable international offsetsof the course of action proposed in C. (54) 212,  i.c. the bombing of bases within Yemen territory from which raids have been conducted against the Aden Protectorate (C.C.(34) 45th Conclusions,Minute 2).2,     As soon as we take such action the matter would certainlybo raised in the United Nations,  of&quot;which the Yemen is a member.Even if she were not, there would be plenty of champions.    Allthe Arab and all the anti-Colonial States would be against us.Amongst our friends, it is probable that a good many would not feel able to do more than abstain on any resolution condomningour action.     However, even if in one way and another we were ableto muster enough support to defeat a condemnatory resolution,it would probably only be at the price of agreeing to the .appointment of a United Nations Commission to investigate on the spot.      I think that is the best result wo could hope for, andit would of course mean continuing United Nations interest inthe matter.    It may be that the frontier between the Yemen andthe Aden Protectorate is sufficiently well defined, and ourevidonce of Yemeni raiding sufficiently good, for us to face the prospect of a United Nations Commission with equanimity.But we might find it difficult to confine the Commission^activities to the issues laid before it and I think we ought to look very carefully before taking any step which is going to result in establishing a precedent of allowing United NationsCommissions into our colonial territories.3o     As far as the discussion in the United Nations is concerned,technically wo could claim to be acting under Article 51 of thoCharter, under which wo have the &quot;inherent right of individual or collective self-defence&quot;.     But this legal approach, which alsoincidentally would bind us to report the matter to the security council, would cut very little ice.     Quite apart from the adverse psychological reaction vi/hich may be expected in any international Assembly to the bombing of undefended people, we should also lose a good deal of sympathy by having resorted toforceful measures before trying to use the procedure providedby the United Nations for tho peaceful settlement of disputes.4.     There is another aspect.     There would be an immediateout-cry throughout the Middle East, whether or not our ^ombscaused loss of life, and this might be very damaging at a timewhen we are about to re-open negotiations with Egypt and arehopeful of a settlement of the Buraimi dispute with Saudi Arabia,C.
