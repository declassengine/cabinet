SECRET Copy No.   gC. (54) 2185th July, 1954CABINETCOAL imports memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power the fuel and power proposals recently approved by the Cabinet were mainly concerned with measures which would begin to bring results in two years&apos; time.The intervening period will be one of severe coal stringency if present trends ofincreasing industrial consumption continue.2. My immediate concern is the coming winter. We are likely to need fromthe pits over the next twelve months about 6 million tons more coal than we had from them last year, mainly to meet the prospective increase in industrial con-sumption. The prospects of getting so much are slight. Although as part of thewages settlement last February the miners accepted an additional 5 million tons as their target for this year, the position now is that, with half the year gone,there are still no signs of this promise being redeemed. Output per man shift has improved and is now as high as it has ever been. Absenteeism is a little less than last year. But apart from a gain of 1 - 2 million tons (representing recovery of lastyear&apos;s Coronation losses), coal supplies have in the first six months of the yearincreased by only about 0-2 million tons. While the National Coal Board and theminers&apos; leaders are pressing the miners to make greater efforts, I have been warnedby the Chairman of the Board, Sir Hubert Houldsworth, that owing to holidayswe cannot expect any significant increase in output until the Autumn. By then,of course, it would be too late to fill the gap by imports.3. I have discussed this with the Emergency Committee of the national production Advisory Council on Industry. Without exception the members ofthat Committee (including representatives of the Federation of British Industries,the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the National Union of manufacturers, the British Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades UnionCongress) expressed serious misgivings, and the Committee passed the followingresolution:  &quot; This Committee regrets that once more there should be occasion for serious concern over the adequacy of coal supplies for the coming winter.The Committee urges upon the Government the vital importance of arrangingwithout delay the importation of sufficient coal to ensure that the nationalstocks at 1st November, 1954, are not less than 19J million tons, which isconsidered to be the minimum amount needed as a safeguard against serious difficulties on coal during the coming winter.&quot;4. This recommendation, and the fears prompting it, are in my view entirelyjustified. A distinction must be drawn between marginal coal shortages of amillion tons or so, which have arisen from time to time since the war, and a possibleshortage of, say, 4 million tons, which was the shortage that caused the fuel crisis of 1947. If we failed to take action now, we should merit (and certainly receive)the criticism which in 1947, when in opposition, we passed on the Labour Govern-ment for failing to import during the summer enough coal to avert thewinter crisis.46435Printed for the Cabinet.

5. Exports of coal are running at the rate of over 1 million tons a month and it would of course be possible to secure more coal for the home market by cutting them down. But that would do permanent damage to our export trade.The only alternative to cutting exports is in present circumstances to import morecoal. This I am convinced we must do.,: &apos; 6. By arrangement with the Chancellor I have already authorised theNational Coal Board to contract for the delivery of \ million tons of coal, but weshall need a good deal more than this. I am advised that the maximum rate atwhich we can bring in coal from abroad is about   million tons a month, and thismeans that at best we shall not get more than 1 million tons by the beginning of winter. The gap may well turn out to be one of 2, 3 or more million tons, and inthat event we shall have to go on importing throughout the winter; but as timegoes on we shall get a clearer picture of the coal prospects. In the meantime Ipropose (i) that the National Coal Board should be told to raise the rate ofimports to the maximum as soon as possible, and (ii) that the situation should be reviewed when the Board have concluded contracts for, say, another 1 million tons(that is, \% million tons in all).7. The National Coal Board hope that this amount of coal can be obtainedfrom Western Europe and Poland, but they may need to include in their purchasessome 300,000 tons of United States coal. The bulk of the 1J million tons will bein large coal, but some small coal will be needed to make good the fall in opencastcoal production for the power stations. The cost should not exceed  10 millionc.i.f. The value of our exports this year should be about  60 million f.o.b.8. I believe that with energetic action on imports and continued efforts toraise output we shall be able to overcome our difficulties next winter, but I mustnot conceal the danger of the present situation.G. L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,3rd July, 1954
