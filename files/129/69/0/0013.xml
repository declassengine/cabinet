9 G-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA TESTY fS GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL q [iCfcC(54) 213 KcGQRD  COPY        COPY NO. (qU-28th June, 1954CABINETNOISE AT AIRFIELDSMemorandum by the Minister of Supply and the Viinisterof Transport and Civil AviationBy Orders and Regulations under the Civil Aviation Act, 1949aircraft operators have, for years? been protected against legal actionarising from noise and vibration at Government and licensed airfields,provided they comply with certain conditions.    The same immunity, however,did not until recently apply to manufacturers&apos; airfields.2. The Hawker Aircraft Company assemble and test Hunter jetfighters at Dunsfold airfield, near Guildford.    The owner of a farm near the airfield issued a writ seeking damages and an injunction against noiseand disturbance there.Had this injunction been obtained, the production of Huntersat Dunsfold would have stopped.    This might well have precipitated similaractions at other contractors&apos; airfields with the result that production ofjet aircraft would have been most seriously affected.3. The Home Affairs Committee invited the Minister of supply on 2nd April to endeavour to promote an amicable settlement of the case,and agreed that when this had been done an Order in Council should be madeprotecting manufacturers, on the same basis as operators at Governmentand licensed airfields, against such actions in future (H,A.(54) 8th Meeting,Item 4).    Hawkers reached a settlement with the litigant, paying his costs and  750 as damages and also entered into a written agreement to do their best to minimise noise and disturbance.    Contrary to what has appeared inthe Press this is a legally enforceable agreement which stands regardless of the Order in Council, which was made the following day.   .4. The main general criticism of this Order is that manufacturers&apos;airfields will now be able to make as much noise as they wish.    This is nottrue.    The conditions under which they can make noise are restricted bythe Regulations.    Moreover, in their own and the public interest,manufacturers are doing all they can to abate noise.   Furthermore, if theGovernment is not satisfied that any manufacturer is doing enough to reducenoise , the conditions under which immunity is granted can well be made more restrictive.    This can, if necessary, be done by Regulations applyingspecifically to an individual airfield.    If the conditions in the current order and Regulations or in any subsequent ones are not complied with, the manufacturer is open to actions at common law.5. A Prayer for the Annulment of the Order has been tabled byMembers of the Opposition for Wednesday, 30th June and there is a question in the Lords on Tuesday, 29th June.D.S.28th June-, 1954. A.L-B.
