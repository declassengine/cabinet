CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 69C. (54) 23617th July, 1954CABINETGATWICK airport memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation in his Report on the Public Inquiry into the proposal, to develop gatwick airport, Sir Colin Campbell concludes (paragraph 279) that Gatwick is a suitablesite for the project, provided the Government are satisfied on six points: -(a) Situation of the site (paragraph 267).(b) Weather (paragraph 268).(c) Planning (paragraph 270).(d) Noise (paragraph 271).(e) Size (paragraph 274).(/) Views of the airlines (paragraph 278).2. Points (c) and (d) are covered in the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment^ paper (C. (54) 237).  On the other points:  (a) Situation of SiteSir Colin agrees that with the present air traffic control arrange-ments in South-East England it would be difficult to find any better sitethan Gatwick. He asks, however, if these arrangements could be changed to enable another site to be chosen. They cannot. military flying to each side of the civil air traffic lanes to London (&quot; AirwaysAmber 1 and Amber 2 &quot;) is intense and neither lane could be shiftedwith safety. The air space over South-East England is one of the busiestin the world and this inevitably means that traffic control arrangements are rigid.(b) WeatherSir Colin agrees that the site is suitable on observed meteorologicaldata. There are, however, no night weather statistics. The objectorsclaimed that Gatwick would frequently experience radiation fog at night. I have consulted the Director of the Meteorological Office andhe confirms, having considered Gatwick&apos;s topographical position and winter visibility statistics starting at 9 a.m., that Gatwick does not suffersignificantly for this part of England from night fog and indeed shouldhave a better record than London Airport.(e) SizeSir Colin draws attention to the criticism that the airport as plannedcannot be much extended, should that prove necessary. This is a fact,but is not a material criticism. All aircraft now using London Airport(apart from the Stratocruiser, which has exceptional runway demands)and all future civil aircraft as far ahead as can be seen can use the longest planned runway when fully laden. The load limitations to beplaced on the Stratocruiser are, as I can explain, not serious opera-tionally or commercially. Furthermore, though we do not foresee theneed for doing so, the longest runway could be extended 800 feetbeyond the 7,000 feet planned for it.46507 &apos;Printed for the Cabinet. July 1954.
(/) Views of the Airlines ......Sir Colin suggests that assurances should be obtained from the airlines expected to- use Gatwiek that it will meet their needs and thatthey will use it in the way and to the extent envisaged. These assuranceshave been obtained. A developed Gatwick will be usecj percent diye^siojie b-^both the British Air Corporations and all foreign airlines, servingLondon, while British European Airways also consider it suitable,,will use it, for seasonal services at peak travel periods.3. I hope that, in view of these answers, which I can amplify orally, theCabinet will agree that the development of Gatwick Airport can now proceed.A. L-B.Ministry of Transport and Qvil Ay.british.on, W..L16th July, 1954.
