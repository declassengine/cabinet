Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1954SECRETC. (54) 24723rd July, 1954LEGISLATION   TO   COMPLETE   THE  DISMANTLING   OFDEFENCE REGULATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 5th May, 1954 (C.C. (54) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 5) invited me to arrange for my Committee on Emergency legislation to investigate the possibility of dispensing altogether with emergency powers beforethe end of the present Parliament, and to report to the Cabinet. I reportaccordingly.2. During the past two years we have made good progress in relinquishingthe emergency regulations surviving from the war. When we took office therewere in force 215 regulations in the Defence (General) Regulations and the associated codes: by the beginning of this year we had reduced that number to96. During 1954 we shall revoke a further 36. This will leave 60 regulations,of which 35 contain only ancillary or procedural provisions. A determined effortnext session will enable us to reach our goal of dismantling the whole structure of emergency powers. The purpose of this paper is to outline the legislation necessary for that purpose and to invite the Cabinet to approve its inclusion inthe legislative programme for next session.3. Of the first three measures whch have to be considered, one the food and Drugs (Scotland) Bill has been introduced this session, but is unlikely to pass;the other two have been approved in principle by the Home Affairs Committee.The three measures concerned are:  (a) Food and Drugs (Scotland). This is  he counter-part of the English food and Drugs (Amendment) Bill now before the House.(b) Inventions and Designs (Defence). This is a shorter and less controversialBill in substitution for the Inventions and Designs (Crown Use) bill which came to grief in the Lords last December. The President ofthe Board of Trade is consulting the interests concerned in the hope of facilitating the passage of this much restricted measure.(c) Aliens in Crown Service. This Bill, designed to permit revocation ofDefence Regulation 60d, will authorise the continued employment ofcertain aliens in the Civil Service.4. The regulations remaining if the above three measures have been passedwill comprise (apart from supplementary and enforcement provisions), three maingroups:   i(a), Land and Water Regulations. This group centres on. defence regulation 51 (Taking Possession of Land) which is the regulation onwhich requisitioning depends. Included in the group are defence regulations 50, 50a, 51a, 52, 56, 62 and 85.(b) Economic Control Regulations-This group centres on defence regulation 55 (General Control of Industry) which has been themainspring of rationing and economic controls. Included in the group are Defence Regulations 46, 55aa, 55ab (Price Control) and theDefence (Agriculture and Fisheries) Regulations.46550 copy -No..CABINET
(c) Miscellaneous Regulations.-Apart from those in groups (a) and (b) thereare, only, four substantive regulations which would need to be continuedafter the summer of 1955:- &quot;    -1.1       . D.R. 58aa. Avoidance of Strikes and Lock-outs.D.R. 59. Exemptions from Acts relating to Factories, Mines andQuarries.     .D.R. 60a. Safety and Welfare of Miners and Quarrymen.     :Defence (Finance) Regulation 2a.-Power of Treasury to prohibitaction on certain orders as to gold, &amp;c.Land and Water Regulations5. Before the regulations dealing with land and water can be relinquished,some-legislation must be passed (part permanent and part temporary) to enable us to deal with certain outstanding-problems. Legislation affecting land is usuallycontroversial, and will be the more difficult by reason of the Crichel Downcontroversy. The Home Affairs Committee have, therefore, taken special pains to ensure that the powers to be sought in this legislation will be reduced to the bareminimum.  The legislation must cover the following subjects:  (i) acquisition and use of land for defence purposes;(ii) future of certain deep shelters in London;(iii) future responsibility for requisitioned houses;(iv) open-cast coal mining;(v) measures for increasing water supplies in time of drought.Each of these subjects is referred to briefly below.  Details are in Appendix I.Acquisition and use of land6. The defence purposes for which permanent provision must be made covertraining rights and facilities for minor exercises hitherto obtained by the service departments under Defence Regulations; clearance of obstructions to flying:construction, maintenance and use of oil pipe-lines; and maintenance and use ofexisting telecommunications tunnels. In addition, the Postmaster-General is considering, in consultation with the Service Ministers, whether he needs permanentpowers to acquire compulsorily, under the Defence Acts procedure, land requiredfor the purpose of providing other communications essential to defence.Future of certain deep shelters in London7. A hybrid Bill will be required to vest in the Minister of Works the futureownership of seven deep shelters, constructed during the late war by the london passenger Transport Board on requisitioned land.Future responsibility for requisitioned houses8. Requisitioned houses cannot be dealt with in the same way as otherrequisitioned property because, before the houses are released, other houses mustbe found for the 90,000 families at present living in them. The Minister of Housing&apos;sproposals for dealing with the problem by a transfer of responsibility to localauthorities are set out in detail in Appendix IV to C. (54) 111 and are summarised in Appendix I to this memorandum.Open-cast coal mining9. Defence Regulations 50, 51 and 51a at present provide the legal authorityfor the working of open-cast coal by the National Coal Board. The Minister of fuel and Power is satisfied that these operations must continue until at least 1958.It seems inevitable, therefore, that temporary powers for this purpose should nowbe taken by statute. This could be done either by including, the necessary pro-visions in the Acquisition and Use of Land Bill (paragraph 6 above) or by continuing these Defence Reglations for this limited purpose in the temporary bill proposed in paragraphs 11-12 below. I am discussing with the Minister of fuel and Power which-of these alternatives will give rise to least difficulty.
(c) Miscellaneous Regalations.-Apa.rt from those in groups (a) and (b) thereare onLy four substantive regulations which would need to be continuedafter.the summer of 1955:  fD.R.58aa.-Avoidance of Strikes and-Lock-outs:      -D.R. 59. -Exemptions from Acts relating to Factories, Mines andQuarries^ -        .D.R. 60a. Safety and Welfare of Miners and Quarrymen.Defence (Finance) Regulation 2a. Power of Treasury to prohibitaction on certain orders as to gold, &amp;c.Land and Water Regulations5. Before the regulations dealing with land and water can be relinquished,some legislation must be passed (part permanent and part temporary) to enable us to deal with certain outstanding problems. Legislation affecting land is usuallycontroversial, and will be the more difficult by reason of the Crichel Downcontroversy. The Home Affairs Committee have, therefore, taken special pains to ensure that the powers to be sought in this legislation will be reduced to the bareminimum.

In addition, the Postmaster-General is considering, in consultation with the Service Ministers, whether he needs permanentpowers to acquire compulsorily, under the Defence Acts procedure, land requiredfor the purpose of providing other communications essential to defence.-Future of certain deep shelters in London7. A hybrid Bill will be required to vest in the Minister of Works the futureownership of seven deep shelters, constructed during the late war by the london passenger Transport Board on requisitioned land.Future responsibility for requisitioned houses8. Requisitioned houses cannot be dealt with in the same way as otherrequisitioned property because, before the houses are released, other houses mustbe found for the 90,000 families at present living in them. The Minister of Housing&apos;sproposals for dealing with the problem by a transfer of responsibility to localauthorities are set out in detail in Appendix IV to C. (54) 111 and are summarised in Appendix I to this memorandum.Open-cast coal mining9. Defence Regulations 50, 51 and 51a at present provide the legal authorityfor the working of open-cast coal by the National Coal Board. The Minister of fuel and Power is satisfied that these operations must continue until at least 1958.It seems inevitable, therefore, that temporary powers for this purpose should nowbe taken by statute. This could be done either by including the necessary pro-visions in the Acquisition and Use of Land Bill (paragraph 6 above) or by continuing these Defence Reglations for this limited purpose in the temporary bill proposed in paragraphs 11-12 below. I am discussing with the Minister of fuel and Power which of these alternatives will give rise to least difficulty.
vihivfii&apos;46550Measures for increasing water supplies in time of drought10. Experience during the war &quot;and since has proved the need for permanentpowers, on the lines of those temporarily taken in the Water Supplies (ExceptionalShortage Orders) Act, 1934, to ensure adequate supplies of water in times ofdrought. A permanent measure on the lines of the temporary Act of 1934 shouldbe enacted before steps are taken to revoke the Defence Regulations under whichthis need has been regularly met since 1939. The proposed Bill would also enablethe Minister to vary water rates and charges.Economic Control Regulations and Miscellaneous Regulations11. Regulation 55 and the associated Regulations confer on the Executivecomprehensive powers of economic control. The use of those powers has beenprogressively narrowed and, after the summer of 1955, they will not be needed for more than a few limited purposes. The power to re-impose economic controlscan therefore be extinguished if these regulations are continued by a temporary bill, renewable annually, which would limit their exercise to a small number of specified purposes. Appendix IT contains an explanation of those purposes andnotes on certain ancillary matters to be covered by the Bill.12. If the Cabinet approve the introduction of a temporary Bill on these lines,it should also contain provision for continuing the four outstanding regulationslisted in paragraph 4 (c) above. None of these should give rise to any controversy.Regulation 58aa is needed for the purpose of maintaining the industrial disputes Tribunal in being until such time as the tv/o sides of industry have definedtheir attitude on the question of permanent machinery for compulsory arbitration.Though they have not yet done so, neither side is anxious to disturb the existingtemporary arrangements.Defence Regulation 59 should be continued until such time as legislation canbe introduced to amend the Factories Act, 1937.Regulation 60a is needed until the new Mines and Quarries Bill can be broughtinto operation.Regulation 2a of the Defence (Finance) Regulations will be needed until after afinal decision has been taken on the convertibility of sterling.13. There are three political advantages in proceeding next Session with atemporary Bill on these lines. First, the Bill will extinguish the comprehensivepowers of economic control at present available under Defence Regulation 55and related regulations. It will thus ensure that another Government could notre-introduce economic control without fresh Parliamentary authority. Secondly,it will bring to an end the annual procedure for renewing Defence Regulations by resolution of both Houses: the new temporary Act would be continued underExpiring Laws procedure. Thirdly, if the Bills discussed earlier in this memo-randum were also passed, it would set the seal on the Governmenfs efforts to get rid of surviving war-time powers: with the passing of this measure the whole structure of emergency powers would finally be dismantled..

APPENDIX I proposed LAND AND WATER LEGISLATIONAcquisition and Use of Land BillThis Bill will-fa) revoke the Defence Regulations relating to land and bring the war period for purposes of the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act, 1945, toan end not later than December 1955;(b) substitute in the Act of 1945 a period of three years to enable land and works held under Defence Regulations 50, 51 and 52 to be held until1958 instead of 1957 as would otherwise be the case, and authorise theexercise of the powers of acquisition under the Act during the three-year period. [The effect will be to terminate all requisitions (exceptfor houses and opencast coal sites for which special provision will berequired) not later than 1958. The power of the Minister of Agricultureunder Defence Regulation 62 to let requisitioned land for cultivationwill be continued until the same date.](c) authorise the Secretary of State for War compulsorily to acquire underthe Defence Acts for a term not exceeding 21 years training rights over land already held for training purposes under Defence Regula-tion 51 or 52 (about 75,000 acres in all), the rights to be such as topermit a substantial use of the land for other purposes and not tobe exercisable on more than 150 days in a year, except where they relate to danger areas behind ranges;(d) empower the Secretary of State for War to authorise by order the useof land specified in the order on not more than six occasions over aperiod of twelve months for the purpose of (i) the bivouacking of troops (including their wheeled and trackedvehicles and animals) on their way to and from training areas,and the carrying out of training for the defence of the bivouacarea, compensation to be paid for all damage;(ii) the carrying out of signalling exercises, and for that purpose the laying of telephone wires and other cables above ground andthe erection of poles, compensation to be paid for all damage;extend the bye-law making powers under section 2 of the Military LandsAct, 1900, in respect of any tidal water or sea area within the terri-torial limits of the United Kingdom;enable the Ministry of Transport to continue for three years any orders inforce temporarily stopping up highways under section 2 of the supplies and Services (Defence Purposes) Act, 1951;confer on the Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply a power, similarto that conferred in respect of electricity lines by the Electricity SupplyAct, 1926, for securing the lopping and felling of trees which are a danger to flying in the vicinity of airfields;extend the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act, 1945, to cover themaintenance and use of oil pipe-lines constructed since 1949;extend the powers to acquire easements under the Defence Acts to enablethe Service Ministers and the Minister of Fuel and Power to constructand maintain additional pipe-lines for defence purposes.  The specificpowers sought would extend to:  (i) Rights to lay or place pipes (mainly below ground) for transmittingpetroleum and to construct marker posts, manholes, &amp;c.(ii) Rights to maintain, remove and replace any of the pipes or works,,:   and to use them lor any suitable purpose.   -\ . ;(iii) Rights to prevent any structure being erected, or works beingcarried out over or near to the pipes or ancillary works so as to obstruct access, use or maintenance.(iv) Rights of entry for the purpose of exercising the above rights,and for inspecting the line.(k) confer on the Postmaster-General powers to -maintain&apos;&apos; and-use certaindeep telecommunication tunnels  already constructed for defence :purposes. :&apos;*/f;;J i     &quot;--Jih t-nii[vji
APPENDIX IIDISMANTLING OF DEFENCE REGULATIONSProbable Form and Contents of Proposed Temporary Bill(Note.-ln this Appendix items shown in [ ] are open to some further examination by Ministers;&apos; They are included at this stage to show themaximum scope of the measures.)The scope of.the Bill,would be to restrict the use of certain.Defence Regula-tions,; to continue others., and to repeal certain, provisions of the Supplies and services Acts and the Emergency Laws Acts.      &quot;This Bill will vest in the Minister of Works the ownership of seven war-timetube shelters in London together with certain surface works. Provision will bemade for compensation to land owners in appropriate cases. Ownership of theseexisting shelters must be regularised, whatever decision may be reached on their use in a future war.Requisitioned Houses bill the proposals of the Minister of Housing for dealing with the remaining45,000 requisitioned houses were included in Appendix IV of C. (54) 111. If thisquestion is dealt with separately from legislation on central and local finance, aseparate Bin would include the following provisions:  (a) Owners of requisitioned houses wanting them for their own or their families&apos; use should have broadly the same rights as owners of rent-controlled houses to get them back by application to the county court.(b) Owners of requisitioned houses prepared to accept sitting licensees astenants should be paid a &quot; sweetener &quot; of twice the annual compensa-tion in addition to the terminal compensation.(c) All other requisitioned houses should be transferred by statute to the localauthorities, which would hold them on a statutory basis for a period not exceeding 5 years.(d) Instead of the local authority acting as agent for the Minister and beingreimbursed the whole cost, the local authority would have a statutoryduty and the Exchequer would pay grants in aid of the expense reducingby stages to 50 per cent, of the net cost.(e) If and when it became clear in any area that the problem could not other-wise be solved, there would be a discretionary grant of up to 50 percent, to help the local authority to buy requisitioned houses as necessary.Water BillThis Bill will provide for an accelerated procedure under which the Ministerof Housing or the Secretary of State for Scotland will be able to authorise a waterundertaker in time of severe drought to take water, use land for temporary worksor restrict the flow of compensation water. This part of the Bill will follow broadly the lines of a temporary pre-war statute, the Water Supplies (Exceptional ShortageOrders) Act, 1934, and will contain safeguards for the rights of individuals at least as great as in that Act.The Bill will also enable the Minister of Housing to vary water rates and charges in England and Wales as often as may be needed, and to keep alive chargesorders at present made under Defence Regulation 56. In this respect the Bill willbe the counterpart to the Transport Charges (Miscellaneous Provisions) bill which is now going through Parliament.
2- iLi-Part II5. Part II of the Bill would continue in force the following regulations: - [(i) D.R.58A (Control of Employment)](ii) D.R.58AA (Avoidance of Strikes and Lock-outs)This regulation affords authority for the Industrial Disputes Order, 1951, underwhich the Industrial Disputes Tribunal operates. Both sides of industry acceptthe existence of the Tribunal on a temporary basis; neither side has yet formulateda view on the form any permanent machinery should take. In this situation thereis no alternative to maintaining the existing Order in force as long as it is acceptable to both sides of industry. As, however, the present Order does not make use ofthe power in the regulation to prohibit strikes and lock-outs, the powers to be preserved will be limited to the minimum required to support the present Order.(iii) D.R.59 (Exemption from Acts relating to Factories, Mines and Quarries).Paragraph (1) of this regulation as modified by the Defence Regulations (No. 2)Order, 1954, enables the Minister of Labour to make exemptions from Part VI and section 29 (6) of the Factories Act, 1937, in respect of the hours of employment ofwomen and young persons in some 2,000 factories, including Ordnance factories and those engaged on continuous processes, such as glass manufacture, and inrespect of the periodical inspection of boilers at power stations.   In both these. Part I of the Bill would continue in force Defence Regulations 55 (general control of Industry), 55aa (Powers Of Competent Authorities as to keeping of books, making of returns, entry and inspection) and 55ab (Price Control of goods and Services) for a limited number of defined purposes. Broadly the specifiedpurposes (not necessarily in these words) would be:  (a) restriction or regulation of the supply of articles of strategic value to countries under Communist dominations including control of voyagesof British ships;(b) maintenance of arrangements for deficiency payments and guaranteed prices in pursuance of the Agriculture Act, 1947;(c) maintenance of equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of thefollowing articles of food: milk, bread, flour, [potatoes] and foodsspecially suitable for children and mothers;[(d) maintenance of equitable distribution, and regulation of price, of coal and coke for domestic consumption;](e) maintenance of equitable distribution and economic use of newsprint;jute goods; hemp; tinplate [and iron and steel scrap, including price control of iron and steel scrap].[(f) regulation of the prices and charges for goods or services required for.....     purposes of the National Health Service Acts, 1946-52, or the corre-sponding Scottish Acts;]2. As a result of continuing the regulations for the purposes defined above,existing Orders made under the regulations would be continued only so far as theyfell within these purposes.3. The Defence (Agriculture and Fisheries) Regulations contain certain pro-visions which are ancillary to the continued suspension under 1 (b) above of the bacon and pigs marketing schemes and also contain independent provisions relatingto livestock and milk. Provision would be made for the continuance of these regulations.4. The continued suspension of certain provisions of the Wheat Acts, 1932-1939 at present effected by the Agriculture (Miscellaneous War Provisions) Act,1940, and Section 3 (1) of the Emergency Laws Act, 1946, would be provided forin this part of the Bill.
respects the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, have proved to be too rigid andsome amendment of the permanent law will be necessary as soon as consultationscan be completed with both sides, of industry. In the meantime the power to makeexemptions from the Act for these purposes will be required., Paragraph (2) of the regulation provides a similar power in respect of mines and quarries and will have to be continued until the Mines.and Quarries Bill is brought into operation in 1956. ,    .(iv) DR.60A (Safety and welfare of Miners and Quarrymen)This regulation will be revoked by the Mines and Quarries Bill, the dustsuppression clauses&apos; of which will supersede the Coal Mines (South Wales)(Pneumoconiosis) Order made under it. As revocation will not become effectiveuntil the new Act is brought into operation in 1956, the regulation must be keptalive until then.(v) Regulation 2A (and certain supporting regulations) of the Defence (Finance)RegulationsThis regulation gives the Treasury power to prohibit action on certain ordersas to gold and securities. It is used to supplement existing powers of exchange control in Hong Kong and certain parts of the Middle East. In due course an amendment of the Exchange Control Act, 1947, will be called for, but legislation on this subject would not be opportune until decisions have been taken on the convertibility of sterling.6. The Ministry of Supply Act, 1939, is at present extended in certain waysby Section 6 of the Supplies and Services Act, 1945. As the Act of 1945 is todisappear some temporary provision may have to be made in this part of the Bill.Part III7. It will be necessary to preserve certain of the enforcement and penaltyprovisions in Part V of the Defence (General) Regulations to support the regula-tions continued by the Bill.  These will be restricted to the bare minimum.8. The Bill will provide for the revocation, either in whole or in part, byOrder in Council of any Defence Regulation for the time being in force underthe Bill.9. The Bill will be expressed to continue in force for one year, with power tocontinue it in force for further periods not exceeding one year and to omit anyof the specified purposes in Part I from the Bill as continued. Continuance wouldbe effected under Expiring Laws procedure.
