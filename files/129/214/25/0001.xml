CONFIDENTIALiDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 25 COPY NO 8320 May 1982CABINETFUTURE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SETTLING THE PAY OF MPbMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION!. We announced on 12 May our proposal to increase pay of Members ofParliament (MPs) by 4 per cent this year.    This proposal will need to bedebated by the House of Commons which has the final decision on MPs&apos; pay.The recommendations of the report of the Select Committee on Members&apos;salaries are certain to be referred to in the debate.    We ought therefore to bein a position to give the Government&apos;s response to these recommendations andto put our own proposals for dealing with MPs&apos; pay in future years.2. The recommendations of the Select Committee were that:i. Reviews of Members&apos; pay and allowances should beconducted by the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) once duringthe fourth year of each Parliament with a view to that Parliamenttaking a decision on the recommendations.    When shortenedParliaments preclude this timetable, a new review should beundertaken not later than four years after the rates of salaryconsequent on the previous review first became payable.ii. At the same time as decisions on the findings of thereview are taken, the House should agree to the annual automaticinterim adjustment of salaries between reviews by reference toincreases in the nearest percentile in the Department ofEmployment&apos;s New Earnings Survey.    Such adjustments shouldtake place in November, the first after an interval of at leastone year.PERIODIC REVIEWS BY THE TSRB3. The first of these recommendations does not pose any serious difficulty.Periodic reviews by an independent body are the most satisfactory way ofsettling the level of MPs&apos; pay which would be acceptable to both the House of1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCommons and the Government.    Alternatives are likely to involve a greaterrole for the Government, to which the House would not agree, or a greater rolefor the House itself, which would be less publicly defensible and would bedifficult for us to endorse.    The TSRB has the experience to undertake suchreviews; there would be no advantage in setting up another body.    If the systemis to work we will have to be prepared to implement the TSRB&apos;s recommen-dations save in the most exceptional circumstances.    This will be made easierby their relative infrequency.4, On timing, a review once every four years seems about right. TheSelect Committee&apos;s preference for the review to take place in the fourth year ofeach Parliament could in practice be difficult to arrange, because of theuncertainty over the length of Parliaments.    However, for tactical reasons, weshould not reject more of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations than we haveto.    As it happens, a review in time for next year&apos;s increase would take placein the fourth year of the current Parliament.    There could be disadvantages insuch a review; we would find it very difficult to reject its recommendationsand this in turn would make it difficult to reject what the TSRB recommendedfor its other groups and the Doctors and Dentists Review Body for doctors anddentists.    On the other hand, assuming that we succeed in making the 4 per centstick this year, it is unlikely that the House will be ready to accept an increasebelow the level gained by most public servants for the third year running. Thelast substantive TSRB review of MPs&apos; pay was in 1980.    An attempt to update itby reference to pay movements since then would not be satisfactory.    A freshreview looks therefore like the best plan.    If we were to announce it now and atthe same time say that we expect it to be the first of a series of four-yearlyreviews, we could fairly claim to have implemented the spirit of the first of theSelect Committee&apos;s proposals.INCREASES BETWEEN REVIEWS5. The Select Committee&apos;s second recommendation, for a link with the NewEarnings Survey (NES) between TSRB reviews, raises much greater problems.The idea of an NES link is not original to the Select Committee.    The TSRBitself has said on two occasions that, while it disagrees with any form of linkage,if it were to be introduced, an   NES link would be the most satisfactory. Ittakes this view because it argues that a more specific form of linkage wouldlead to misleading comparisons between MPs and the groups to which they werelinked and to undesirable political pressures entering the negotiating processfor the linked groups.    The Select Committee endorsed the arguments for havingas wide a comparator group as possible and commented that taking one year withanother it was unlikely that this would lead to markedly different increases thanthose for public servants generally.6. Against this it must be said that links of this sort elsewhere in the publicsector (eg for the police) have turned out to be expensive and presentationallyembarrassing.    The Government has been pressing for pay increases well belowthe levels indicated by indexation with average earnings.    If MPs were per-mitted to have such a link, numerous other public service groups would demandthe same treatment.    Whatever may be the relationship between averageCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALearnings and public sector pay in the long term, at a time when the level ofsettlements is declining, links with indices, which inevitably reflect whathappened some time in the past, sit very uneasily with the Government&apos;s stanceon the current level of settlements,7- If we reject the NES link, we must consider what could be put in Usplace.    There are three main options:i. To leave the Government completely unfettered to makeproposals for interim increases in the light of the circumstancesat the time.ii. To ask the TSRB to undertake annual updating reviews inthe years between their major reviews.iii. To accept the principle of linkage, but to make the linkwith one or more public service groups rather than an index.8. None of these options is without disadvantages.    The first two involvea rejection of the principle of linkage.    Although, like the TSRB, we have con-sistently expressed our doubts about linkage, in agreeing to set up the SelectCommittee we went some way to accepting it in a limited form.    We would havedifficulty in carrying the House with us if we were now to reject it completely.9. The first option, which is what has been done this year, would be themost satisfactory from the Government&apos;s point of view but it is highly unlikelyto be acceptable to the House of Commons as a permanent arrangement. Thesecond is in effect a return to the arrangements we had until this year.    It wasbecause we felt unable to implement the TSRB&apos;s 1980 recommendations that theSelect Committee was set up in the first place.    There is little advantage inreturning to this system.10. The third option is one that we indicated to the Select Committee that wewould be willing to consider.    However it has serious difficulties.    A link witha single public service group would mean that MPs&apos; pay would become an issuein the negotiations for that group.    For example, if the four yearly review byTSRB recommended a large increase for MPs, the linked group would use thisas an argument for large increases for itself.    Furthermore such a link wouldgive MPs a direct financial interest in the pay of the group concerned. Thesedifficulties would be less serious if the link were with a   basket   of publicservice groups.    But MPs&apos; pay would then be increased by the average increasefor the groups in the basket and such an average would tend to be seen as thenorm or going rate for the public services for the year in question. Somepublic service groups would inevitably receive less than this average and wouldtend to feel badly treated as a consequence.    These feelings would colour theirattitude to their next pay claim.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIf we do go for a link with a basket, it could consist of the followinggroups;a. Non-industrial Civil Serviceb. National Health Service (NHS) doctors and dentistsc. NHS nurses and midwivesd. NHS administrative and clerical staffe. Primary and secondary teachers (England and Wales)12         The increase for MPs would be the average, weighted by numbers in thegroups, of the increase in basic pay for each of these groups as a whole.Although basic pay seems the most suitable measure for most occasions, weneed to recognise that there are times when it increases by more than theincrease in earnings and is not the figure that is publicised as the level of thesettlement.    All the groups in the basket have settlement dates of 1 April.MPs&apos; pay is adjusted with effect from 13 June but the necessary resolution canbe retrospective and can therefore be passed somewhat later.    This leaves thegroups in the basket a reasonable time in which to settle.    However if oneclaim were still in dispute in July, the latest official side offer could be used toobtain the average for the basket.    Unusual settlements, such as those whichWere staged, would have to be dealt with ad hoc.13.        The Select Committee favoured an automatic link, that is one whichwould operate in the years between TSRB reviews without any action by eitherthe House or the Government being required.    This would leave us withrelatively little control in the event of unforeseen circumstances.    We wouldprefer to proceed as at present with a Government motion each year on MPs&apos;Pay on which the House would vote.14         Even if we conclude that we are driven towards some form of linkage andthat an NES link would be unsatisfactory, there are arguments against goingfirm on a basket link at this stage.    The method of determining the pay of twoof the groups in the basket - nurses and civil servants - is still under consider-ation,    it might be better to wait and see what transpires in these cases beforewe link MPs to them.    One option would be to tell the House that we acceptedthe need for a TSRB review for next year (and every four years thereafter), didnot agree with an NES link but felt that the decision about the best method ofinterim adjustment could best wait until we had the results of the first reviewwhen arrangements elsewhere in the public services would be clearer.However the House might suspect that we were attempting to shelve the linkageissue indefinitely and react accordingly.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNEXT STEPS15.        We will need to communicate our proposals to the House of Commons.The most suitable occasion will be the debate on the increase in MPs&apos; pay thisyear.    it is not absolutely necessary for us to table a Motion on future arrange-ments.    We could simply announce our conclusions orally.    However it isdoubtful whether the House would consider it satisfactory if it did not have aMotion before it on which it could express a view.    Furthermore it is highlylikely that there will be an opposition or backbench Motion in favour of an NESlink.    The easiest way to counter this would be to have a Motion of our own,The terms of that Motion will depend on what we decide about the method ofdetermining increases between TSRB reviews.    However if we propose linkageto a basket and the House votes in favour of it, we must recognise that we couldn t lightly set aside the arrangement in future years.MINISTERS&apos; PAY, MPs&apos; SECRETARIAL ALLOWANCE AND PEERS&apos; EXPENSES*y         The pay of Ministers, MPs&apos; Secretarial and Research AssistanceAllowance and the Peers&apos; Expenses Allowance are normally increased at thesame time as MPs&apos; pay.    It would be essential to ask TSRB to continue toreview these payments when it reviews MPs&apos; pay.    Between TSRB reviews wePropose that we deal with them on an ad hoc basis.    It is unlikely that there willDe much objection to treating Ministers&apos; pay or Peers&apos; expenses in this way butwe might come under pressure to provide a link for the secretarial allowance.RECOMMENDATIONSWe accordingly invite colleagues to agree that we should;a. Accept the proposal by the Select Committee that TSRB shouldcarry out a review of MPs&apos; salaries and allowances in the fourth yearof each Parliament and aek TSRB to undertake the first of thesereviews in time for next year.b. Accept the principle, as proposed by the Select Committee,of annual automatic adjustments of salaries between such reviews.c. Reject the Select Committee&apos;s proposed use of NES as ameans of determining such annual interim adjustments, but suggestinstead a link with a basket of comparators as described inparagraph 11 above.d. Agree that, notwithstanding the Select Committee&apos;spreference for automaticity, all annual increases in pay soarrived at should remain, as at present, subject to approvalin each case by the House of Commons.e. Seek the approval of the House of Commons for theGovernment&apos;s proposals by introducing a suitable Motion forapproval in the course of the forthcoming debate on MPs&apos; pay.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALf. Ask TSRB, at the same time as it reviews MPs&apos; pay, toreview Ministers&apos; pay, MPs&apos; secretarial allowance and the Peers&apos;expenses allowance.GHJBTreasury Chambers20 May 19826CONFIDENTIAL
