It was noted however thataiQn recommendations could be accepted at very little cost, that these groupsrec    among public service groups were still significantly below the pay levelsCon ^nrnended as appropriate for 1 April 1980, and that the recommendations wereret   S.tent with the Government&apos;s policy of relating pay to recruitment andion considerations.    The main options considered in relation to the TSRBrePortwere:a        to accept the recommendations;k       if the DDRB recommendations were accepted without restoringthe 1981 3 per cent deduction, to abate the TSRB recommendations by, say,5 percentage points (a table illustrating this option is attached atAppendix B);c        to accept the recommendations but implement the increases in twostages, with an abatement of, say, 5 per cent this year, and therecommended rates coming into effect in full next year, and thusbecoming the starting point for the 1983 recommendations.6.viev/     While recognising the difficulties in relation to the NHS, the balance ofto ac ^ ^e meeting of Ministers was that it would be preferable for the GovernmentaCc    SI3t *ne DDRB and TSRB recommendations in full in the same package asreco^ance of tb-e CSAT award and the AFPRB report, and to implement theaftectimenC*at*0nS ^n  ne sta e now rather than in two stages.
