SECRET-S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 126 January 1982CABINETECONOMIC STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer*. I shall be presenting our fourth Budget on 9 March,OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR AHEAD2. The latest forecasts predict continuing, though slow, recovery inoutput and a further fall in inflation, which should be at 10 per cent by the endof this year, and in single figures in 1983.    Unemployment is likely to edgeup a little further in 1982, though at a diminishing rate, while industrialproductivity should continue to improve.    The general picture is one ofcontinuing recovery, with encouraging signs of real improvement in theeconomy.    Annex 1 gives some figures showing the progress we have made todate.    A continuation of this improvement could, of course, be invalidatedby events beyond our control, whether world-wide (eg American interestrates) or domestic (eg a serious setback on pay).3. Of course I continue to be deeply concerned about the level ofunemployment.    We should all like to get it down.    But all previous attemptsat artificially induced reflation have resulted, in the medium and longer term,in higher inflation and in higher unemployment.    In political terms, any gainsfrom another such attempt would be short-term and extremely limited. Theprobable impact on interest rates, the exchange rate and inflation would meanthrowing away the hard-won progress of the past l\ years - and lead to stillhigher levels of unemployment than those from which we are now suffering.THE RIGHT STRATEGY4. We must accordingly persevere in our present strategy, maintainingprogress towards our key objectives: a continuing reduction in inflation; acontinuing rise in output; a diminution of the monopoly public sector;  and astrengthening of the free market economy.    This is the way to secure agenuine improvement in the employment situation rather than a very smalland short-lived change in the figures.    The prospects are now good. Therates of both wage and price increases should continue to fall, with inflationdown to    8 per cent or less by the end of 1983;  and there should be fastergrowth of output in that year than in 1982.1COPY NO35SECRET
SECRET5. For domestic and overseas confidence in the Government&apos;s strategyto be sustained we must have a credible financial framework.    The marketswill expect us to maintain downward pressure on the rate of monetary growth.This is crucial to confidence, to maintaining a reasonably steady exchangerate without cripplingly high interest rates, and hence to the defeat ofinflation.    Our objectives for the period ahead will need to be expressed interms of a number of aggregates, and with more explicit reference to theexchange rate, rather than exclusively to  M3,    But if we were thought tohave abandoned monetary and fiscal control, sterling would quickly comeunder pressure.BORROWING6. Within this framework the size of the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) for next year is crucial.    For the current year, weplanned for a PSBR of  10| billion and we are on course for this.    For nextyear, the forecast (which may change substantially before March) gives aprovisional figure of rather less than the  9 billion for which we thought itfight to plan at the time of the last Budget.    This forecast is based, as iscustomary, on the following as sumptions:-i.       That public spending next year is at the level agreed inNovember - a planning total of  115 billion.ii.       That income tax thresholds will be increased in line withinflation (&quot;Rooker-Wise&quot;).iii. That excise duties will be similarly increased.iv. That the tax structure and rates are in other respectsunchanged.Annex 2 shows what assumptions ii. to iv. mean in terms of cash increasesin the allowances and price increases in the goods subject to specific duties.The impact on the FSBR of assumptions ii, to iv., taken together, is broadlyneutral:  the revenue lost through indexing the income tax allowances isnearly offset (in the first year) by the extra revenue produced by revalorisa-tion of the specific duties.7  The choice of the right PSBR for next year presents a problem. Togo up to about  9 billion might give some limited room for modest taxreductions.    But it would also involve risks for interest rates and theexchange rate.    Since the last Budget the exchange rate has fallen consid*erably.    Oil prices, which support it, have also fallen and we have had toface high interest rates.    We could diminish some of these difficulties byplanning for a PSBR of, say,  7 to  8 billion.    We should then have a betterprospect of lower interest rates, though they will probably still be unfomfort-ably high.    For most people - industry and mortgagors alike - lower interestrates are an important objective.    But we should not have any room for taxreductions, and the political difficulties are obvious.2SECRET
SECRET8. The traue-off between interest rates and tax reliefs as a means ofsustaining recovery is bound to be a matter of judgment - political as well aseconomic.    But it is my belief, not least in the light of our experience of thelast year, that to go for a PSBR above about  9 billion is likely to lead tohigher interest rates than we now have, would affect confidence, and couldrisk so large a fall in sterling as to jeopardise the prospects of reducinginflation and impair - or even reverse - recovery.FISCAL OPTIONS9. If some reductions in taxation should turn out to be possible, for thecoming year, the main issue will be the balance to be struck between:-i.       measures which would directly affect prices;ii.       those which would reduce income tax; andiii.       those which would directly assist companies.Category i. includes less than full revalorisation of excise duties, or areduction in the rate of Value Added Tax (VAT).    Category ii. includesaction to more than implement &quot;Rooker-Wise&quot; increases in tax allowances.The most obvious category iii. measure would be a cut in National InsuranceSurcharge.10. The argument for category i. changes is essentially political. Wewould avoid adding to the Retail Price Index (RPI):  full revalorisation of theduties is assumed in the forecast.    And we would avoid the unpopularityattaching to some individual increases:  Annex 2 lists some, including petrol.But the more ground we give here, the less room we have for changes incategories ii. or iii. , the case for which emerges clearly from the tables inAnnex 3.11. For the personal sector, an increase in tax allowances of 10 to 11percentage points above inflation would be necessary to restore tax thresholdsas a proportion of average earnings to their 1978-79 levels.    An increasewould bring benefits in wage bargaining;  and would diminish the poverty trapand &quot;why-work&quot; problems.    Assistance to the company sector is no lessdesirable, and category iii. changes would have the most direct impact oncompanies&apos; income, though at the risk of some leakage into wages. Whensecond round effects are taken into account, the effects on employment,Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and company incomes of all three categoriesare however very similar.    Annex 4 sets out Treasury model estimates of thebroad consequences of an illustrative  l billion reduction, effected throughmeasures falling into each of the three categories, while Annex 5 gives therevenue effects of certain specimen reductions.3SECRET
SECRETSUMMARY12. All the signs are that our efforts to restore the economy to health aresucceeding.    Inflation is coming down;  output is going up-;  the rate ofincrease in unemployment is slackening.    This Budget will be crucial. Atthis stage in the economic cycle previous governments have sacrificed soundfinance for dubious electoral advantage.    If we follow that pattern, we willrisk losing all.    The key for 1982-83 is the PSBR.    Given high interestrates world-wide, there is an argument for going for a figure in the regionof  7-8 billion but to achieve this could mean foregoing tax cuts altogether.To go above about  9 billion would be popular politically in the short run;but it would imperil the exchange rate, interest rates, the conquest ofinflation, our whole determination to create a sound economy and, in every-thing other than the very short-term, the creation of more real jobs. Thechoice for the FSBR lies in a range which has  7 billion as the minimum andabout  9 billion as the maximum.13. If a figure towards the top of the range is chosen, the main choice fortax reductions lies between the three categories listed at paragraph 10 above.Elements of all three might of course find a place in the final package.    I am,naturally, considering a number of other smaller items, as well as the?structure of the North Sea tax regime.14. I would welcome colleagues&apos; views on all these matters on 28 January.G HTreasury Chambers26 January 19824SECRET
