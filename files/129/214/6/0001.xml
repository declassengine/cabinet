CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 6 COi Y NO g329 March 1982CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND: A FRAMEWORK FOR DEVOLUTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Northern IrelandINTRODUCTIONL During the past six months I have been investigating the possibilities forpolitical development in Northern Ireland.    I am convinced that the indefinitecontinuation of direct rule cannot produce the answer to the Province&apos;s presentproblems.    It merely postpones the creation of stable political institutions.And without such institutions we cannot hope to mobilize the whole communityin combating terrorism; nor can we engage the people of Northern Irelandfully in tackling the daunting economic difficulties,2. Events in the past few months have created an expectation of movementand have brought all the main political parties to the point where they would feeiobliged, albeit reluctantly, to respond to an initiative from us.    There is amomentum flowing that gives us the chance to break   the deadlock that haBexisted for eight years.    I believe we have an opportunity now that will be th last in this Parliament.3. For all that, our scope for political movement is limited.     The fun-damental disagreement between the parties over the exercise of power remains.The Unionists - both the Official Unionist Party (OUP) and the DemocraticUnionist Party (DUP) - reject any suggestion that minority representativesshould sit at the table where the top decisions are taken.    Equally, the minority .the Social Democratic &amp; Labour Party (SDLP), supported by the non-sectarianAlliance - insist that any new system of Government must allow for minorityparticipation.    For the time being we cannot bridge that difference; and wecannot therefore institute any new system that involves the immediate exerciseof powers.PROPOSALS4. What I therefore propose is to set in motion a process in which agreater degree of co-operation between the parties may develop and powers canbe transferred as and when a sufficient degree of agreement is achieved.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The essential element in this process i* a new Northern IrelandAssembly, elected as before by proportional representation, exercisingdeliberative and scrutinising functions through a system of departmentalcommittees constituted on proportional lines and with Chairmer and Deputiesshared betv/een the parties.    Under these proposals it will be open to theAssembly to gain actual powers (legislative and executive as before in NorthernIreland) when sufficient agreement between representatives of the two parts ofthe community is reached.    That agreement will be signalled by 70 per centsupport in the Assembly for proposals as to what should be devolved and howexecutive power should be exercised.    The figure of 70 per cent should in itselfensure cross community support; but Parliament will also have to be satisfied f acceptability from both sides of the community before an Order in Councildevolving powers can be approved.6  A vital feature of these proposals is that the Assembly has flexibilitynot only about precisely how executive powers are to be exercised (and there-*fore how the Executive should be constituted) but also about how wide a range ofsubjects should be devolved.    All the subjects transferred in 1973 (which do notinclude law and order) will be available.    But if agreement is:possible or. thedevolution of only some of those powers, then partial devolution will be possible.And if the agreement breaks down after a transfer has occurred, then powerscan return to the Secretary of State, and if appropriate the Assembly can revertto its deliberative phase, without the whole system foundering.7. In this way the onus would be on Northern Ireland elected representativesto decide both how to accommodate each other over minority participation inGovernment, and how widely or narrowly devolved Government should range.These proposals are fully set out in the attached White Paper and will requirea short Bill to give them legislative effect.REACTIONS OF THE PARTIES8. I have discussed my proposals at some length with the Northern IrelandParties.    As was foreseen from the start they are not enthusiastic. Each,inevitably, wants something closer to its own preferred scheme.     But of courseeach of those schemes is wholly unacceptable to some other party.    The OUPare particularly cool in public, guided by the Molyneux/Powell leadership whichis against devolution at all.    But many, indeed most, in the party do want tosee devolved Government return and are keeping a more open mind.    It issignificant that the OUP have said that they will contest elections to the Assembly,as will the PUP.9. The SDLP pose different problems.    The leadership (but not all the rankand file) profess to see no profit in so-called internal solutions and are pressingfor an increased &quot;Irish dimension&quot;.    They are worried that the proposals donot specify enforced power-sharing.    But it is significant that they have notdecided to boycott elections.    And Alliance will co-operate too.!0.        We therefore have the prospect of all the main parties participating inelections to an Assembly that will provide a new political forum in NorthernCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIreland and a chance to progress from the sterility of direct rule to the creation f constitutional arrangements acceptable to both communities.    I cannotguarantee that that progression will be made.    But I am convinced that we mustgive the local politicians the opportunity.OTHER OPTIONSll  In formulating my proposals I have been much influenced by the momentumthat has been generated in recent months.    I believe it is essential to capitaliseit.    But a consequence is that legislation must be introduced rapidly andcomplete its passage by the Summer Recess.    I recognise the difficulties thisPresents in Parliamentary terms - and have carefully considered whether thereis any alternative to early legislation.    But I have been forced to the conclusionfchat there is not.lz-       To delay legislation until next Session would mean that elections to thenew Assembly could not take place until the spring of 1983.    A delay of thatMagnitude would be fatal.    The parties would almost certainly by then havetalked themselves into outright oppoaition to the proposals and one  r more couldwell refuse to participate in elections.    This risk would be magnified by theimminence of a General Election under whose shadow political movement inNorthern Ireland is particularly difficult.l3         As an alternative I have considered early elections on the basis oflisting legislation pending a Bill next Session.    However, the Northern IrelandParties would be acutely suspicious of elections to an Assembly whose functionshad not yet been properly defined.    And Parliament might feel it presumptuoust0 assume its approval for legislation still to be debated.    Moreover, anAssembly sitting while Parliament debated the role to be given it would be arecipe for divisive and discordant debate in the Assembly.l4-       I am forced to the conclusion that if we do not have a short Bill thisSession, we will miss the tide and the Government will be seen to be opting out&lt;* attempting a long term solution to the problems of Northern Ireland. Thiswould have grave implications in Northern Ireland, in Britain, and in the IrishRepublic and the United States.    There could well be a knock-on effect on thesecurity climate and the prospects for attracting investment if we are seen to bedisappointing the expectation of a political initiative.COMPARISONS WITH SCOTLANDl5.        i&quot; considering the way forward I have been conscious that whatever we&lt;*ay propose for Northern Ireland could be regarded as setting a precedent for ther parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland.    However, we have to^cept that Northern Ireland is unique.    Its divided community   its geographyand history (particularly its experience of devolved Government), the fact that*o national political parties operate there, the general desire throughout thecommunity to see devolution restored - all these set Northern Ireland apartfrom the rest of the United Kingdom.    They also require and enable us to justifyCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtreatment of the Province that is geared to its particular needs.    An integration r &quot;Scottish solution&quot; would not meet Northern Ireland&apos;s special problems and,bY slamming the door on minority aspirations, would be liable to strengthensupport for the Irish Republican Army and to end co-operation vith the Southand the security benefits which that brings.16        I am also conscious that the &quot;West Lothian&quot; issue may arise if devolvedGovernment returns to Northern Ireland.    It could be argued that the increasein Northern Ireland&apos;s representation at Westminster from 12 to 17 seats that i jQue to take effect at the next General Election should be rescinded if devolvedGovernment is to be restored.    Yet the increase in representation to a levelsimilar to that enjoyed by Britain was not conditional on the continued absence f devolved Government.    In Opposition we made crystal clear our view thatParity of representation was deserved regardless of whether devolvedGovernment existed.    We would be rightly criticised if we went back on ourPast commitments.    Moreover, even with 17 seats Northern Ireland has an^significant proportion of a 640-strong House (unlike Scotland with 71 seats) andwe are a long way from fully devolved Government in Northern Ireland.CONCLUSIONStt.       There is a clear expectation that the Government will seek to achievePolitical development in Northern Ireland.    To disappoint that expectation wouldieave a dangerous political vacuum.    Our security and economic problems inthe Province would only increase as a result.18-       The momentum generated recently gives us the opportunity to bring allmain parties into a new elected Assembly capable progressively of assumingdevolved powers.    As we all realise there could be no guarantee that they willreach the necessary degree of agreement.    But without a move from us, therewill be indefinite stalemate.    And for us to be seen to be accepting a continuation * the deadlock has uncomfortable implications for opinion not only in NorthernIreland but also in the rest of the United Kingdom and overseas.    I thereforeinvite colleagues to agree:-1. The attached White Paper should be published as soonas possible before Easter.2. Legislation should be introduced, also before Easter, witha view to enabling elections to a new Assembly to be held in theautumn.J PNorthern Ireland Office2 9 March 1982CONFIDENTIAL

(confidential)PART 2:    THE NEED FOR DEVOLVED GOVERNMENT2. V    Direct rule has served Northern Ireland well.    It has won ameasurecf acceptance from all parts of the community and it is^cognised to be impartial.    It is, however, generally and rightlyregarded as an unsatisfactory long-term arrangement - a view shared^ all the major political parties in Northern Ireland. TheProlonged uncertainty caused by repeated renewal of sucharrangements is damaging in many ways.    Northern Ireland&apos;s 50 years&apos;experience of devolved government has shaped its politics. The&quot;lain differences between the Northern. Ireland parties turn onattitudes to Northern Ireland&apos;s constitutional future rather thaneconomic and social issues.   The direct rule arrangements relyuPon Westminster to provide democratic safeguards on executiveauthority.    They provide no other opportunity for Northern IrelandPoliticians to play a major part in the decisions affecting theProvince.    It is notable that none of the Secretaries of Stateand Ministers of the Northern Ireland Office in successiveGovernments has been an Ulsterman.    Northern Ireland&apos;s dividedeommunity, its geography and the history of its politics all make^ impracticable to treat the Province as though it were in allAspects identical to the rest of the United Kingdom. Recognition f this reality in no way implies lack of support for the unionbetween Great Britain and Northern Ireland; rather is it thatN rthern Ireland&apos;s experience makes the case for devolvedgovernment of a quite different order from that which might applyto any other part of the United Kingdom.2&apos;2     Direct rule means in practice that primary legislation forNorthern Ireland is generally implemented by Order in Council^ther than by a Bill which receives full Parliamentary scrutiny.
(confidential)Some subordinate legislation, which in Great Britain would takethe form of statutory instruments subject to a degree of Parliamentaryscrutiny, is made in Northern Ireland by executive action withoutai&gt;y formal opportunity for scrutiny by elected representatives.2-3     The importance of an agreed and stable system of governmentin Northern Ireland is becoming increasingly recognised. Thedifficulties in the way of agreement remain substantial. Neverthelessthe Government believes the time is right for a renewed attempt.lfc also believes that an attempt to impose a system of its ownloosing would be unavailing and that&apos;a different approach isneeded.2.4Active co-operation among elected representatives in runningp litical institutions in Northern Ireland could make a substantialc ntribution to surmounting Northern Ireland&apos;s economic problems.AsthePart of the United Kingdom economy, Northern Ireland is sharingcyclical downturn which has affected much of the industrial*orld. But Northern Ireland also has to contend with special^oblems of its own - a shrinking industrial base, dependence on^ustries in decline, for example textiles and shipbuilding, and^unemployment rate currently in excess of 19%. The lack of theinvestment needed to create fresh employment owes much to thes*ioi image which Northern Ireland presents to potential investors*t home and abroad.    These issues transcend differences betweenareMo;erent parts of the community.    Until Ulster men and womenseen to be tackling their political problems, confidence outsiderthern Ireland in the stability of the Province as somewhere inn to invest is undermined.roll SMOvfial
(confidential;2 cIn what was for both of them a very difficult and painful^ear  the two sides of the community showed in 1981 that they wereft t prepared to be provoked into a resurgence of the inter-communalvi lence   of earlier years.    The political differences in Northern*reland are held as firmly as ever but the Government believesthatthe rejection of violence as a means of expressing differenceshasstrengthened and with it the co-operation of both sides of theCoiNriunity in frustrating the aims of terrorists claiming to act inthe** name and in bringing them to justice.    It believes alsothatthe time is ripe to afford an opportunity for such attitudesbe given expression in ordinary politics and that such politics, nce re-established, will serve further to isolate the men ofVi lence.2.6andofThPrevious attempts to form an administration to which legislativeexecutive powers could be devolved failed because of the lacka9reement on the key issue of how power was to the exercised.^ was so in 1975 and in 1980:    accordingly, direct rule hasc ntinued but it is not a long term solution.   Nor can the centrallssue of how powers should be exercised be settled by turningt0 Political arrangements other than devolved government. Anysuchthearrangements would be unacceptable to one or both sides ofcommunity.    The Government believes that an elected body inNorthn.ern Ireland is the right forum for the Province&apos;s special^oblems to be tackled.    That is why there is an urgent need foran ielected Assembly. The Assembly must have substantial functionsthat it can inject an important element of local responsibilityan&lt;aPolinfluence into the day-to-day conduct of business. Althoughitical differences in Northern Ireland centre on constitutionalers, the people are no less concerned about jobs, wages, schoolsWUH MMI
(confidential)and health than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.    The Assemblyshould enable them to influence such matters.*&apos;     The Assembly will provide a forum within which the necessaryProcesses towards agreement can be developed constructively. ThePeople of Great Britain will expect Northern Ireland politicalParties to respond constructively to the new opportunities whichtheconstitutional proposals offer.    Northern Ireland&apos;s specialdifficulties are well recognised, but the rest of the UnitedKi gdom looks to Northern Ireland to come to terms with its politicalProblems.    The events of recent years&apos; have amply demonstratedthe2.8Pressing need for compromise and reconstruction,The Government adheres to the view that in any administration^ Northern Ireland there must be reasonable and appropriatearrangements to take account of the interests of the minority*hich are acceptable to both sides of the community.    This is no ore than a recognition of the reality that in the specialcircumstances of Northern Ireland nothing else can provide stable9overnment on a lasting basis.
(confidential)?ART__3_:    THE TWO IDENTITIES ,&apos;.1     The majority of the population in Northern Ireland think * themselves as British.    They regard themselves as part of thesocial and cultural fabric.of the United Kingdom and their loyaltylies to the Crown.    They favour continuance of the union with .therest of the United Kingdom.3 9.*   Successive Governments have made it clear that NorthernIreland will remain part of the United Kingdom as long as aMajority of the people in Northern Ireland so wish.    There isstatutory provision for border polls to be taken from time totimeso that the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland canbeestablished.3-3   There is also a substantial minority within NorthernIreland who think of themselves as Irish, whether in terms oftheir identity, their social and cultural traditions, or theirPolitical aspirations.    Many of them support political parties*hich would like to see a united Ireland in some form.3.4beaThis difference in identity and aspiration lies at thert of the &apos;problem&apos; of Northern Ireland; it cannot be ignoredwished away.    There are, and always have been, many activitiesin Northern Ireland - including the work of many people serving n numerous public bodies and voluntary organisations - whichSuccessfully bridge the community divide.    It is the wish of theSreat majority of the people of Northern Ireland to live 9ether in peace and harmony.    The Government&apos;s efforts aredirected to that end.    Nevertheless, the Government recognisesthat the sense of two different identities is an important anddential
(confidential)continuing reality of social and political life in NorthernIreland.    Proposals for the politial progress necessary for therestoration of economic stability and the improvement ofsecurity musttherefore take account of these differences.Nor is it possible to ignore the intensity of feelinggenerated between the two sides or the fact that each tendsto take a distinctive view not only on constitutional issues butalso on wider issues such as religion, culture and education.No other part of the United Kingdom has been divided so deeply r for so long on fundamental principles.i3-5   The object of the Government&apos;s proposals is to point to aw*y whereby, in spite of their acknowledged and continuingdifferences, the two sides of the community may achieveEfficient mutual respect, and make sufficient mutualaccommodations, to participate more creatively in the publiciife of the Province.    Total repudiation of violence, with allthat implies for economic advance and the prevention of furthersuffering for families in Northern Ireland, is only likely tocome about when both sides of the community recognise eachether&apos;s different aspirations and when they are able to livetogether as good neighbours.3-6     Given the importance of these two identities and traditionsin Northern Ireland,    the application of simple majority rulev uld (as in the past)  leave the minority in perpetual and^effectual opposition where they can become prey to those whoSeek change by violent means.    This cannot lead to the stablesociety in the establishment of which the majority have as much ,interest as the minority.confidential)
(confidential)3.7     The position of those who wish to alter the constitution ofthe State raises questions of loyalty.    Some argue that onlythose with a full-hearted commitment to sustain indefinitelythe constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of theUnited Kingdom are properly entitled to full participation in .the public life of the State.    The Government, however, believesthat, in a free society, the advocacy of change, including funda-mental change, in the institutions of society, is a legitimateactivity if pursued by peaceful persuasion   and not by violence.So long as the existing institutions of the State are respectedthose who favour change should not be debarred from playing afuH part in public life.3.8 The Government&apos;s proposals accordingly embody the principle,shared by the main parties in Parliament and recognisedinternationally,that any new structures for the government ofNorthern Ireland must be acceptable to both sides of the community.This is the prerequisite for setting up a devolved administrationand restoring responsibility to Northern Ireland for the conductof its own affairs.    In the Government&apos;s view this principle isboth right in itself and unavoidable in practice; no systemof government which is unacceptable to either side of the&quot;oommunity will work effectively.3.9 Relations between both sides of the Northern Irelandcommunity inevitably influence and are affected by relationsbetween the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. TheGovernment welcomes the significant improvement in relations ,between the two countries in recent years, both bilaterallyand working together as members of the European Community.
(confident! al)3-10     The Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Council, which has beenestablished following the Anglo-Irish talks and Joint Studieswhich begain in 1980, gives institutional expression to theunique relationship between the two governments without affectingnational sovereignty.    The first meetings of the Council havetaken place and the Government is confident that these newarrangements will enhance close, friendly and practical co-operation^ the interests of all the people of the United Kingdom. Itis now for the Parliaments concerned to consider whether thegovernmental meetings of the Council should be complementedbY an Anglo-Irish body at Parliamentary level in whichMembers of the British and Irish Parliaments could take part.The Government would expect the arrangements to enable members f the Northern Ireland Assembly to participate if they soWished.3-11     Relations between the United Kingdom and the RepublicwiH in general be conducted within the ambit of the Council.A devolved government in Northern Ireland will, under existingstatutory provisions,  be able to make such bilateral arrangementsand agreements with the Government of the Republic within thefield of &quot;transferred&quot; functions as they consider appropriate.Practical co-operation in many forms between the two parts of^eland has been long established.    It would be for a Northern^eland administration to decide what further arrangements wouldbe in the interests of Northern Ireland.
(confidential)CONSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUNDBetween May 1921 when the Parliament of Northern Ireland wasestabliShea and its prorogation in 1972, Northern Ireland had av lved government within the United Kingdom.    Since then, save forthe f ?lve months&apos; life in 1974 of the Northern Ireland Executive, itas heen governed directly from Westminster.4.2The present system of government in Northern Ireland is based n the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 and the Northern IrelandAct 1Q-7-,.3/4.    The 1973 Act provided for the appointment of a power-sharing*ecutive answerable to an elected Northern Ireland Assembly withle9islative powers.4,3The 1973 scheme, in setting out those matters for which theu&gt;-ive and the Assembly had responsibility, made the followingOssifications:(a) &quot;Excepted&quot; matters, for which responsibility wouldremain permanently with Westminster.    This categorycomprised various matters of national importanceinappropriate for consideration other than byParliament, eg the Crown, Foreign Affairs and Defence.(b) &quot;Reserved&quot; matters, for which initially respon-sibility would remain with Westminster, but whichcould be transferred to local control at some futuredate.    These were principally various matters in thelaw and order field which were administered by theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland. Legislation
(confidential)was the responsibility primarily of Westminster,although the Assembly could exceptionally legislateif the United Kingdom Government agreed.(c)    &quot;Transferred&quot; matters comprised all other mattersnot covered under categories  (a) and (b) above.These were the full responsibility of the devolvedgovernment (and are still, under direct rule, adminis-tered by the Northern Ireland Departments ofAgriculture, Commerce, Education, Environment,Finance and Personnel, Health and Social Services,and Manpower Services).ls structure of &quot;excepted&quot;, &quot;reserved&quot; and &quot;transferred&quot; matterseitl^ins on the statute book as a sensible basis for any future devolution0f Powers.4.4A Northern Ireland Executive formed in accordance with the 1973^ook office on 1 January 1974.    However, the new arrangementscu to retain widespread acceptability in Northern Ireland and whenpower-sharing Executive collapsed temporary arrangements for directror a one-year &quot;interim period&quot; were introduced in the Northernteland Act 1974.    That Act provided that all executive and legislativeUions in relation to Northern Ireland which were distributed amongtheelected Assembly and the devolved administration became the respon-?LltY of the Secretary of State and Parliament.    The 197 4 Act&quot;gements are today still in force by virtue of seven successiveextending that one-year interim period.- 2 -
(odnf1d5ntialj4-5     Since&quot; 1974 there have been sustained attempts to find a system&lt;* government which would be acceptable to both sides of the Northern^land community, for example the Northern Ireland ConstitutionalConvention which met in 1975; and whose report was not acceptable tofilament; and the conference convened by the then Secretary of Statefc* Northern Ireland early in 1980.11- 3 -

(confidential)THE PROCESS OF DEVOLVING POWERSBgj^ort on Devolution of Powers .     The Assembly will be required to consider and report on how aNorthern Ireland administration should be formed and under whatarrangements executive powers should be exercised.   The legislation iU allow for devolution by Order in Council of executive andlegislative powers in respect of the range of &quot;transferred&quot; mattersas defined in the 1973 Act (see paragraph 4.3 above).5-&apos;0   There are two crucial differences, between these proposals and . arrangements in the Northern Ireland constit^ion Act 1973. Frrst,* will be for the Assembly to recommend to the; Secretary of State whatJotm any devolved administration should take and how devolved powerss^ld be exercised.    Secondly, devolution of executive and legislative*&gt;wers could either take place en bloc or there could be &quot;partial&quot;^om^n under which only functions relating to specified Northernl&quot;lana departments would be devolved leaving others subject to drrect&quot;le.   The flexibility introduced by the opportunity of proceeding in^ges could prove valuable to the Assembly in moving towards agreement&apos; arrangements for full devolution.   These two features are discussedoriinmore detail below.5-11  new system of devolved government in Northern Ireland must,l    it 4is to be stable, be acceptable to both sides of the communitythereThe Government will not therefore institute new arrangementsr the government of Northern Ireland that do not comply with thisCental principle of acceptability - a principle repeatedlyUnciated by successive Governments over the past ten years.5 Tconfidential

Depending on Parliamentary reaction to theReport, the Secretary of State could lay a draftOrder in Council for Parliament&apos;s approval trans-ferring executive and legislative powers.(b) If a Report on the exercise of devolved powers were.agreed by a majority of less than 70% of the membersof the Assembly, the Secretary of State could, if itappeared to him that its proposals were acceptableto both sides of the community, invite the Assemblyto submit that Report to him and the procedure at(a) above would then apply.^.15In framing Reports on devolution of powers, the Assembly mayProposals on the following issues:-(a)    which departments in the &quot;transferred&quot; field shouldbe devolved;- 7 -

FIDE Ml wsummary and conclusion^HSSiary of Proposals \^.1    There follows a broad summary of the main legislative proposalsin this White Paper:(i) The Government is bringing before Parliament a Bill .to given effect to its constitutional proposals,  ,       (paragraph 5.1).(ii) There will be an election to a new Northern Ireland Assembly(paragraphs 5.2-5.3).(iii) The Assembly&apos;s functions pending devolution of powerswill be consultative and deliberative, includingscrutiny of draft legislation and making reports andrecommendations to the Secretary of State which hewill lay before Parliament (paragraphs 5.5 - 5.6).(iv) Prior to devolution there will be a requirement tohave committees of the Assembly, corresponding toeach Northern Ireland department.    Each departmentalcommittee will have a paid Chairman and Deputy Chairmento whom the Secretary of State and the Ministerresponsible for the department will look for guidance.Membership of the Committees, and the allocation ofChairmanships and Deputy Chairmanships, will so far aspracticable reflect party representation in the Assembly(paragraphs 5.7 - 5.8).(v) .   It will be for the Assembly to consider and reporton how powers should be exercised.    The powers inquestion are those in the &quot;transferred&quot; category(paragraph 5.91confidential)
&lt; I(cslFIDSNTIAL)(vi) The essential criterion for devolution is that. representatives of both sides of the community shouldagree on how executive powers should be discharged.If not less than 70% of the Assembly approved a Reportrecommending how powers should be exercised, the Secretaryof State would place that Report before Parliament.If Parliament approves the proposals - and inexpressing a view to Parliament the Government would haveregard to the extent to which they commanded thenecessary support in Northern Ireland - a devolutionorder would be laid.    If a Report containing proposalsfor devolution obtained less than 70% agreement in theAssembly, it would nevertheless still be open to theSecretary of State to invite the Assembly to submitthat Report to him if he believed that its proposals wereacceptable to both sides of the community; the Reportwould then be laid before Parliament and powers couldbe devolved if Parliament agreed (paragraph 5.14). ;(vii) There could be partial devolution under which theresponsibilities of one or a group of Northern Irelanddepartments would be devolved (paragraphs 5.16 - 5.19)Vi-ii) The Assembly could proceed to full devolution of powerseither directly or via partial devolution.    Either way,Parliament would have to be satisfied that the Assembly&apos;sproposals commanded the necessary support (paragraphs5.20 - 5.21).fix) Under full devolution the Northern Ireland Executivewill consist of not more than 13 members. Members
(confidential)of the Executive could be replaced followingconsultation with the parties  (paragraphs 5.22 - 5.23).(x)The &quot;reserved&quot; matters specified in the NorthernIreland Constitution Act 1973, including law andorder responsibilities, will remain in that category.They could be placed in the &quot;transferred&quot; category indue course.    The Assembly, and an Executive whenformed, will be kept fully informed about securitypolicy (paragraph 5.25).(xi) Under partial devolution, the Assembly would havesubstantial financial responsibilities, althoughthe Department of Finance and Personnel would not bedevolved.    Following full devolution, freedom ofdecision in financial matters would be as under theconstitutional arrangements of 1973 (paragraphs 5.26 - 5.31)Xli)  If, following full devolution, the Executive lost thesupport on which the proposals leading to devolutionhad been based, devolved powers could be returned tothe Secretary of State.    If all powers returned to theSecretary of State, the Assembly could be prorogued;or it could continue in being with scrutinising, con-sultative and deliberative functions.    If there wereno prospect of forming another Executive, the Assemblycould be dissolved (paragraph 5,32).
(confidential)Other points of importance are that:(xiii) It is now for the Parliaments in London and Dublinto consider whether there should be an Anglo-Irishbody at Parliamentary level in which Assembly membersfrom Northern Ireland could take part (paragraph 3.10).(xiv) a devolved government in Northern Ireland would be freeto make bilateral arrangements and agreements with theGovernment of the Republic of Ireland within the fieldof &quot;transferred&quot; functions  (paragraph 3.11).Conplusion6.2     since direct rule was re-established in the Spring of 1974,successive attempts to devolve powers to a representativeNorthern Ireland body have failed because agreement could not^ reached on how those powers should be exercised.    The presentProposals are flexible and provide a framework within which anacceptable arrangement may be developed:    an Assembly, involved^ the conduct of current public business from the day it firstmeets, will be able to choose between full or partial devolution.These arrangements provide an opportunity to establish a stableand durable system of government acceptable to both sides ofthe community.6-3     The proposals offer an opportunity to move forward from thePolitical sterility of recent years to a system of devolvedgovernment, with all the benefits which such a system could^eate for the prosperity and stability of Northern Ireland. Thenovel and flexible arrangements proposed in this White Paper
(confidential)should help - the Assembly in its major task of achievingagreement.    Procedures in themselves, however, cannot alonesolve the intractable problems which have made agreement inNfttfcheED.. Ireland so difficult for so many years.    They willneed to be matched by flexibility and willingness to explorenovel approaches on the part of the representatives electedto the Assembly.    The Government believes that the peopleof Northern Ireland will expect politicians in Northern Irelandto respond positively to the opportunity provided by theseProposals, in the interests of the long-term future of theProvince and the rest of the United Kingdom.29 March 1982
