These provxde theessential elements of withdrawal and non-introdnetion of forces.   We wereTable get Argentine agreement to forego freedom of movement except for e three specified 150 nm withdrewal/non-introdnction zones.   The state--l that Argentina will not operate its forces in the zones is desxgnedto mate clear that their so-called &quot;theatre of operations&quot; does not apply.withdrawal schedule permits United Kingdom naval forces to remaxn&quot;ithin the zone for seven days.   At which time Argentina must have withdrawn*alf o( their forces.    The idea of requiring the United Kingdom Naval Ta.k*orce seven days to be at 1750 nm from the co-ordinates provides f erxbxlxty.position of United Kingdom forces at the time of agreement wxll of&quot;ourse determine the closest point of approach of those forces to the&quot;-ordinate points before having to torn beck in order to be at 1750 nm  &quot;ay seven.     The United Kingdom will of course went to look very closely  *e treatment of the submarines, which was a major point ofh e.

At this writing, change is being reviewed by GOA.Paragraph k (Economic Sanctions)1116 hasic concepts have been retained from the draft we carried from London,ng, however, has been altered at Argentine insistence.

We assume &quot;without delay&quot; includes timenecessary to make such arrangements, a reasonable amount of timeto   complete domestic requirements,    and the time necessary to consul*the EC and Third Countries.Paragraph 5 (Authority)The concept of a Tripartite Special Commission survives with a changename to Special &quot;Interim Authority&quot;.   While the Commission&apos;s functionsnot changed materially from the text we worked out in London, the changeof name with it&apos;s connotations is optically more appealing to Argentina*The authority is now to verify compliance with all obligations in theagreement.   Awkwardly, the draft retains reference to &quot;observers&quot; toaccomplish these tasks;    in our London text, observers were intended tomonitor force withdrawal and separation only.    Staff limitations wouldbe handled in the separate protocol creating the authority.Paragraph 6 (Local Administration)Here and elsewhere, we have attempted to divorce substantive provisi DS&quot;pending a definitive settlement&quot; from the interim period for negotiato promote a basis for continuing arrangements should negotiations not ^meet this deadline.

It refers* various rights enjoyed by the inhabitants heretofore on the Isiande, and&quot;cures them pending a definitive settlement on an equal basis to bothUnited Kingdom and Argentine Residents.Paragraph 8 (Negotiations)**. Paragraph has seen a number of changes.    The &quot;Interim Period&quot; hasbeen clearly linked to the negotiation process in an attempt to permxt ther substantive provisions to potentially survive 31 December. Thet^t describes the objective of an agreement on &quot;Modalities&quot; by whxch theElands might be removed from the list under Chapter XI of the United^tions Charter (following a United Kingdom suggestion), and on mutuallya^eed conditions for their definitive status.    The &quot;DecolonizationTerence theoretically would not preclude any kind of future status forth* Islands, except perhaps the status quo ante.   Mutual agreement wasSECRET

The conditions are stated to include &quot;due regard&quot; - which willobviously vary in weight in the eyes of the two signatories - for theright of the inhabitants and the principle of territorial integrity&quot;applicable   to this dispute&quot;.    The Argentines will argue that therights of the inhabitants refer   only to individual rights, and not a&quot;collective&quot; right of self-determination.    The Argentines will arguethat a principle of territorial integrity with the mainland applies&gt;the reference could equally be argued to mean the Islands should notbe partitioned or dismembered in the process of change of status. Tbesreferences in effect recall the differing positions of the two parties ^throughout this dispute.   Self-determination is reinforced by UnitedCharter and Resolution 1514 references;   the Argentines cite territorialintegrity language in 1514 and insisted on reference to UNGA Resolutionon the Islands.   Explicit reference to 2065 is retained (the United &amp;iaccepted such a reference in the 1971 Agreement with Argentina on theIslands), but there is a subordinate general reference to the others(including Resolution 3l/49 which the United Kingdom oppos ed).

Only you can judge that outcome against the advantages and disadof armed action.My best immediate judgement in this situation is that I should return toWashington and report to the President.

Having been the victim of one sudden attack,British Government could not risk the same thing again following arawal of Argentine troops.     The best way of minimising this riskWould be &amp; concrete arrangement involving the United States, which wouldprovidean effective deterrent to further Argentine use of force. Themethods nf i achieving this would have to be discussed further, but the&amp;11 and Commonwealth Secretary emphasised the importance of such anSement to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Parliament.3SECRET
