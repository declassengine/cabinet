CONFIDENTIALDoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 23COPY NC 8314 May 1982CABINETSPORTING CONTACTS WITH ARGENTINA:THE WORLD CUPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentBACKGROUNDGiven the present situation in the South Atlantic, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment now faces the question of the attitude we should adopt towardsthe participation of United Kingdom teams in the final stages of the WorldCup.   This competition attracts more worldwide public interest than theOlympic Games.    It begins in Spain on 13 June.    24 countries are competing,including, for the first time since 1958, England, Scotland and NorthernIreland.    Argentina are the current holders.   The organisers are the worldgoverning body of football, the Federation of International 4  FootballAssociation^FIFA), which comprises 2 main power groups from Europe andSouth America.   The General Secretary is Swiss;  the President Bra*ilian,2* The British teams are not in the same first round group as Argentina.It is, however, possible for Scotland to meet Argentina in the second round,beginning on 28 June.    Given the groupings, England or Northern Irelandcould meet Argentina only in the Final, on 11 July.    The British teams haveto submit their final lists of players before 4 June.SPORTING CONTACTS WITH ARGENTINA*. The Government has discouraged any sporting links with Argentina atrepresentative, club or individual level in the United Kingdom or in Argentina.No action has been taken to discourage British sportsmen competing in thirdcountries in competitions.which might involve Argentinians.    As for theWorld Cup, Ministers have argued publicly that the United Kingdom teamsshould not be penalised by withdrawal, given Argentina&apos;s role as aggressorin the Falklards,    However, it has been emphasised that the situation will bereviewed in the light  f events in the South Atlantic,^&apos; FIFA have said that there is no question of banning Argentina from thecompetition; and that they expect the British teams to compete.    If theBritish teams are withdrawn, they will be replaced with other nations.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE BRITISH GOVERNMENT VIEW5. In Britain, some footballers/administrators have already expressedconcern at playing in a competition with Argentina.    There is some feelingin our own party that this would be unacceptable.    We have, as yet, no clearimpression of public opinion generally.    Even if we knew public opinion nowthe situation could change rapidly if hostilities worsen, and especially if therewere to be more British casualties.6. One important factor could be the actual physical pressure of Britishteams, and supporters, in Spain.    There could be provocation of Britishsupporters, and demonstrations of anti-British feeling by Spanish spectators -though the Spanish government is anxious for our teams to attend. Scotlandplay Brazil on 18 June;  and Spain play Northern Ireland on 25 June.?. The Government has no powers to ban sporting contacts (although thiscould change in the event of a state of war).    However, the football authoritieshave so far adopted a highly responsible attitude and have indicated that theywould follow a government call for a boycott.    If this happens, it should bemade at senior political level.   Our judgment is that the football authoritiesare unlikely, unless the external situation changes considerably, to withdrawindependently.    But there would, of course, be merit in the footballauthorities being seen to take their decisions without government pressure,if that were possible.THE IMPLICATIONS OF WITHDRAWAL8. Government pressure to withdraw is likely to be seen by theSpanish government and people as a gesture against Spain (as a consequence ofSpanish altitudes over the Falklands) with implications for tourism. Thiscould have adverse effects on British interests over the opening of theGibraltar border, due to take place on 25 June.    This risk could be reduced,of course, by presenting the decision as a measure directed againstArgentina and not Spain.9. Withdrawal by United Kingdom teams would undoubtedly be greetedwith pleasure in Argentina, who would regard it as a moral victory over theUnited Kingdom.A0.       The financial consequences of a withdrawal are considerable for the3 Football Associations.   There could be a ban on competing in the 1986 WorldCup; a heavy FIFA fine; the possibility of compensation;  the cancellation oftravel and accommodation arrangements;  and players&apos; contracts would haveto be met.    The Scottish and Northern Ireland Football Associations could bebankrupted.    Whilst there might be no legal obligations on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for compensation, there could be a moral one.    It is difficult toestimate the amount that might be claimed.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlL       The position of Sportsworld Travel Ltd - the sole sources of ticketsin the United Kingdom - is less clear.    They have contract arrangementswhich they would have to meet.    Legal advice would be necessary on whetherthere was liability for compensation from Her Majesty&apos;s Government.CONCLUSIONS*2.       This paper is designed to inform colleagues of the problem, and ofthe possible implications should the 3 British teams be asked to withdraw.In the present international situation I believe that Ministers can continue toargue strongly that Argentina is the aggressor nation and that the onus ofwithdrawal lies in that direction and not with us.    My present view is thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government should not yet suggest withdrawal to  he footballauthorities, but that we should be ready to adopt that course, at short noticeif the situation worsens, and in the light of public opinion.    We have not soughtso far to discourage Anglo/Argentine sporting contacts in third countries, butI suggest that we adopt a similar approach in any such cases.*3.       I would welcome the views of colleagues on i. the policy to beadopted towards sporting links with Argentina, with particular reference tothe World Cup; and on ii. the action Her Majesty&apos;s Government should takein the event of a worsening of the situation in the South Atlantic between nowand 3 June.M HDepartment of the Environment14 May 19823CONFIDENTIAL
