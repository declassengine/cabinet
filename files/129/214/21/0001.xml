I HAVE JUST HAD A THREE-HOUR SESSION WITH HA IG ABOUT YOUR MESSAGEAND PROPOSALS. HE CANCELLED A MEETING IN NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE, ?AND FROM WHAT HE SAID AND THE WAY HE SAID IT THERE WAS NO DOUBTABOUT HIS GREAT ANXIETY.2. UNDERLYING HAIG&apos;S REACTIONS IS HIS BELIEF THAT THE USA AND THEUK WILL DIMINISH THEMSELVES IN THE EYE&apos;S OF THE WORLD IF THEY LETFIGHTING CONTINUE IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC WITH FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE.HE REALISES THAT HMG CANNOT GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT, AND THATNOT GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT WHEN YOU HAVE OUR SUPERIOR MILITARYMEANS CAN BE FRUSTRATING. BUT HAIG&apos;S VIEW IS THAT WE ARE A RESPONSI-BLE POWER AND THE ARGENTINES ARE NOT, AND THAT THIS IMPOSES CERTAINOBLIGATIONS, AND INDEED PROBLEMS, FOR US IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD.3. HE THINKS IT IS NOW OR NEVER. WE MUST PUT AN END TO THE FIGHTINGAND, AS I HAVE ALREADY REPORTED, HE BELIEVES THAT IF THE FIGHTINGGOES ON WE WILL INCREASINGLY LOSE THE SOLID WORLD SUPPORT THAT WEHAVE GOT NOW, APART ALTOGETHER FROM THE TRAGEDY OF CASUALTIES.HAIG DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF THEPERUVIANS BEING PREPARED TO AGREE TO OUR POINTS OR OF BEING READYTO TRANSMIT THEM TO THE ARGENTINIANS, HE COULD NOT PUT THEM TO THEPERUVIANS. HE FULLY UNDERSTANDS WHY WE WISH,  FOR INSTANCE, TO INSERTA REFERENCE TO THE RESTORATION OF THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION, TO THENEED FOR THE WISHES OF THE ISLANDERS TO BE RESPECTED, AND ANEXPRESSION OF OUR DOUBTS ABOUT REACHING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT BY30 APR|L 1983. BUT HE INSISTS, ON THE BASIS OF HOURS AND HOURS OFARGUMENT WITH THE ARGENTINIANS, THAT THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE CHANCEOF GETTING AN AGREEMENT IF WE INSIST ON OUR LANGUAGE.5 HAIG ATTACHES THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO AN EARLY CEASEFIRE. HEBELIEVES THAT THIS IS THE FIRST AND OVERWHELMING NEED AND HE FULLYAPPRECIATES YOUR READINESS TO TAKE AN INITIATIVE ON THIS SUBJECT.BUT A CEASEFIRE WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE FOR US UNLESS IT IS LINKED WITHSOME PROCEDURE THAT ENSURES ARGENTINIAN WITHDRAWAL: AND IT WILL?&apos;CT EE ACCEPTABLE 70 THE ARGENTINIANS UNLESS IT IS LINKED IN SOMEWAY TO A LONGER TERM SOLUTION.
SECRET6. i can assure you that i left ha ig in no doubt about the strengthof the feeling in london and our conviction in our cause. we hadseen NO readiness on the part of the argentinians to be flexible. itdid not therefore seem reasonable for us TO have to start whittlingaway what we thought necessary just because the peruvians had come?      forward with a text that they thought was wearable by the argenin-ians. (though they have said they could not accept it under duress)the prime minister, you and other ministers had given great thoughtTO this and had made a highly important proposal for a ceasefireinitiative.7. ha| g expressed full recognition of the rightness of our causeand our good faith in coming forward with the ceasefire proposal.but he repeated time and again that our list of points were comple-tely unnegotiable. they would simply have the effect, if westuck TO them, of ensuring that the fighting would go on, with*ll the unpredictable consequences.8. i asked him what, in the circumstances, he thought could be doneand this led on to a prolonged analysis of texts, the outcome ofwhich was a new set of points, as given in Ml ft, that he hoped metsome of our requirements, without involving language that would berejected out of hand both by peru and argentina.9. as regards the idea of a guarantee, ha ig, after referring toadvisers in.the state department, said that what we were asking forposed all sorts of difficulties, that even if they were surmountablewould take a considerable amount of time. to meet our needs andavoid this constitutional problem, haig has incorporated language.n the new points that he considers a guarantee on the part of theusa, and for that matter of the other contact group powers, of thenon-re introduction of argentine forces and of the other terms ofthe agreement. he maintains that the surest guarantee is the usapresence.l0. we had a long wrangle on our proposed wording aboutquote the restored administration unquote. ha ig said there wouldBE no point whatever in discussing any agreement that contained acommitment that the previous british administration should returnt0 the islands. i referred to our conviction that as the argentin-es had take the islands BY force and usurped the british authority,WE had every right,  in seeking a restoration of the status quo, toensure that our administration was reinstated. ha ig said thatunfortunately IT was NOT going TO BE possible to go BACK TO THES,ATUS QUO ANTE. THE ARGENTINIANS WOULD PREFER TO COMMIT 3UICICETan put their signature to a .document committing them toz .SECRET /fltctPT
SECRET.accept a restoration of the british administrate as it was. asyou will see, the wording HA ig has come up with is a referenceto quote the local administration unquote. he admits that this isimprecise. but he regards imprecision as a virtue in presentcircumstances both in this passage of the text and in some others.he knows that there will be wrangles in the contact group about themeaning of this passage but meanwhile we will have achieved ouroverriding objectives, which is the withdrawal of the argentinianforces.i will not recount the prolonged argument we had about respectfor the wishes of the inhabitants because it always came up againsthaig&apos;s conviction that this is another absolute sticking point forthe argentinians, just as it is for us. the wording that ha ig hascome up with on this subject reads, as you will see, that quotethe two governments acknowledge that the aspirations and interestsof the islanders will be included in the definitive settlement ofthe status of the islands unquote.12. ha|g considered that the language of our point 6, which leftopen the possibility of a failure to reach agreement by 30 april1983, would be impossible to negotiate. i said that neverthelessthere was a point of substance here, what was going to happen if adefinitive agreement had not been arrived at by that date? wasthere not a danger that the argentinians would say that if thatpoint had not been compiled with then the rest of the agreementwas invalid? ha|g argued that he did not think they could do this.in practice the contact group would continue their functions.in theend he came forward with a new passage which as you will see, statesthat quote the contact group will have responsibility for ensuringthat the two governments reach a definitive agreement prior to april30. 1983 unquote.13. ha|6 implores you to have another look at this and see whetheryou cannot accept his latest proposals, given everything that isat stake. he does not really think that we can go on drafting andcounter-drafting. if this new te xt can be accepted in london, ha igls thinking of a procedure as set out in my second i ft.3SECRET
SECRET1*. perhaps i could conclude with a final word about the mood here.haig is fearful of the consequences of a prolongation of the fight-ing, particularly if it can be represented, however unfairly, thathmg has not pursued every possible chance of a settlement. heforesees that we may increasingly come to the usa for support andthat, if opinion turns to believing that we have missed theopportunity of peace, it is going to be difficult for the usat  stay in the supportive position they have now adopted. even ifhe thought that the prospects of continued fighting were not withoutconsiderable risks for us, i do not think that he would believeThat it was in our interest to continue the battle to the bitterend.5. haig is sending you a letter as in my third i ft.hendersonCOPIES SENT TO .No. 10&apos;&quot;DOWNING STREETPS/HOME SECRETARYPS/S OP S DEFENCEPS/SIR a ARMSTRONGPS/SIR M PALLISERPS/CHANCELLOR (TREASURY)PS/CHANCELLOR (DUCHY OF LANCASTER)COPIES TOSECRET

THE most important differencebetween your ideas and ours is not that ours abandon principle and .reward aggression. for they do NOT, but rather THAT ours have Areasonable chance of acceptance provided THE argentines ARE now ofa mind to show greater flexibility. while i remain doubtful THATThey would accept ours, i am certain they will reject yours.|vi PARTICULAR:SECRET/-THl
