CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82)20 COPY NO 835 May 1982CABINETPAY OF MPs AND MINISTERS IN 1982Memol&amp;ndum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andThe Lord President of the Council1. The Select Committee on Members&apos; Salaries published its reporton 23 March.    The Committee was concerned solely with the question offuture pay arrangements.   The report recommends reviews of MPs&apos; payeach Parliament by the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) and the automaticadjustment of Members&apos; salaries between reviews by rsfererce to increasesin the nearest percentile of the New Earnings Survey.     It makes noproposals on the level of pay increases in 1982.2. The Government&apos;s attitude to the Report, and in particular to theproposed link with the New Earnings Survey will be dealt with in a separatepaper on the Report, which we will put to Cabinet.    There is much to besaid for debating the Report and the Government&apos;s proposals on MPs&apos; paytogether in the House.    Meanwhile this paper deals only with MPs&apos; payfor 1982.3. Unlike previous years, the TSRB have notbeen asked to review thepay and allowances of MPs in 1982.    This was because the Select Committeereview was in progress.    We therefore start from a clean slate in the sensethat we have no specific recommendations before us for a i-982 increase,4. The final decision on Members&apos; salaries rests with the House ofCommons.    We believe that the House will insist on some increase this yearwhether or not decisions have been reached on future arrangements. Asustainable case can be made for an increase of 4 per cent.    There are anumber of public service groups whose pay negotiations or arbitrations haveyet to be completed, including teachers, nurses and various other NationalHealth Service employees, and Local Authority administrative, professional,technical and clerical staff.    An announcement of a 4 per cent increase forMPs might possibly influence negotiations and arbitrations for these groupstowards moderate settlements.    Any indication that we were prepared tocontemplate offering more to MPs would certainly be prayed in aid to putstrong upward pressure on all outstanding public service pay settlements.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. Since we came into office, MPs - in the light of TSRB recommenda-tions - have had very large increases in pay.    The increase of 74 per centagreed for them in 1979 was paid in three stages between 1979 and 1981.In 1980 they received a further 9.6 per cent, admittedly somewhat less thanthe 14. 6 per cent proposed by the TSRB.    Last year the TSRB recommended nly that MPs&apos; pay should be brought up as quickly aj possible to the higherlevel they had recommended for 1980.    In the event we decided to give MPsa further 6 per cent on top of their earlier increases.    This brought theirsalary to  13, 950.    This was  300 more than the recommendation by theTSRB in 1980, reiterated in their 1981 report.    Although there was obviouslya large element of &quot;catching up&quot; in the increases they have received, an MP&apos;ssalary is therefore now over double what it was in May 1979.6. Against this background we are agreed that we should propose to theHouse a 4 per cent increase in MPs&apos; pay this year.The majority of Ministers have had a pattern of increases similarto that for MPs over the last few years (though Cabinet Ministers have donea little worse).    We suggest that they too 3hould get 4 per cent this yearand that we should announce this at the same time as our proposals on MPs.8- The decisions we are proposing to announce this week on the CivilService, Armed Forces and doctors and dentists will inevitably affect theway a 4 per cent increase is viewed by MPs.    The announcement of an awardto the TSRB groups of the sort we are contemplating - around 14 per cent -might make matters even more difficult, but there is clearly a large elementof catch-up in those awards.    On timing, there are conflicting considerations.On the one hand, if the announcement about MPs&apos; pay is linked to the TSRBannouncement It may serve to offset it in presentational terms, and thiscould be an advantage.    On the other, some MPs may react strongly to thediscrepancy between the 4 per cent they are offered and the much higherawards for senior civil servants, senior ranks in the Armed Forces, and theJudiciary.    But theae feelings will be there even if the two announcementsare not linked.9. It would be possible to delay an announcement on MPs&apos; pay until thesettlement date of 13 June or even beyond   providing an announcement anddebate took place before the Recess.    For MPs, but not Ministers, anyaward would be retrospective to the settlement date.    But a delay muchbeyond that date would lead to increasing restlessness, and in principle anearlier debate on pay and on the Select Committee&apos;s Report seems desirable.10. We should bear in mind that a pay settlement cannot be imposed; wehave to carry the House with us.    If the 4 per cent was accepted, well andgood;  but if an amendment were carried for a higher amount, we would notbe bound to accept it, but the position would be difficult.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11.       The TSRB has in the past dealt with two smaller matters whenreviewing the pay of MPs and Ministers:   secretarial and research assistanceallowances of MPs and the Feers1 expense allowance.    We propose that MPs&apos;allowances should be increased by 4 per cent in line with their p?y, and itwould presumably be appropriate to increase by the same amount the Peers&apos;expenses allowance and the secretarial allowance fcr Lords Ministers.There is no necessary linkage between increases in pay and allowances, butthey were increased oy the same amount last year, and this would be thesimplest and most straightforward course.    But there is some feeling amongMPs that the secretarial and research assistance allowances are inadequate,and there may be some pressure for more.CONCLUSION*2.       We invite Cabinet to agree that we should propose to the House ofCommons that the pav of MPs and of Ministers, and MPs&apos; secretarialallowances, should be increased by 4 per cent this year.    The timing of anannouncement needs to be considered in relation to plans for announcingTSRB and other public service pay awards.    There are some arguments forlinking them, but it is not essential to do so.    We should, if necessary, alsosay that we are not yet in a position to respond to the Select Committee&apos;sReport, but we should give no encouragement about the part of theirrecommendation which suggests linking MPs&apos; pay to the New Earnings Survey.G HJ BTreasury Chambers5 May 19823CONFIDENTIAL
