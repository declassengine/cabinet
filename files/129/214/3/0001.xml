CONFIDENTIALp Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentC(82) 3copy noH February 1982cabinetRECOVERY OF HOSPITAL COSTS FROMROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services1. Cabinet approved in principle at its meeting on 26 November(CC(81) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5) the proposal for recovering frommotor vehicle insurers the cost to the National Health Service (NHS) oftreating casualties in road accidents and invited me to put forward detailedproposals for consideration.    These proposals, which are set out in thefollowing paragraphs, were considered by the Home and Social AffairBCommittee at its meeting on 2 February.    Colleagues expressed a numberof reservations both about the principle of the scheme and the proposedmethod of implementation through the Finance Bill.    In view of these itwas considered that the proposal should be reviewed and a final decisiontaken by Calw.net.BASIS OF PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS2. It was agreed in the discussion on 26 November that to be acceptablethe scheme should be designed to avoid the problem of &apos;no fault liability7 -this was the major objection raised against my predecessor&apos;s proposals in1980.    Accordingly the basic principle of the scheme now proposed is therecovery of road accident treatment costs from motor insurers on a blockbasis.    I would propose also that the sum to be recovered should be theestimated cost to health authorities of treating road accident victims in thePrevious year.    Thus insurers would know in advance of setting premiumsthe additional costs they were expected to bear but individual drivers wouldnot be identified in the accounts presented.3  The total sum to be recovered in a full year is estimated to be 88 million in 1983-84 (for England only) additional to the sum recoveredat present under the Road Traffic Act 1972 (about  4 million a year). This^ould be the cost of treating all motor accident victims in 1982-83 includingnon-motorists e. g. pedestrians and cyclists.    The aggregate bill would beapportioned between insurance companies who would have to agree the basison which this would be done.    The average annual payment is likely to be ofthe order of  6 to  8 per each insured vehicle.    More detail of the schemeis given in the annex to this paper in the context of the present legal positionand of proposals made in the past by this Government and our predecessors.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTIMING AND PRESENTATION4. In order to have a scheme on this basis in operation by 1983-84 theiegislative provisions would have to be included in the Finance Bill.Parliamentary Counsel has produced a preliminary draft of clauses whichwould give effect to the proposals (though for legislative purposes thesewould need to be treated as a taxation measure).    It may not be possible touse the Finance Bill to repeal the existing provisions in the Road Traffic Act1972; if not, the present charges would need to be deducted from the incomeraised under the new scheme until a suitable Bill could be found. TheFinance Bill timetable means that consultation with the insurance and motorinterests would have to begin very quickly.    This would need to be precededbY a statement of our intentions.5  The major judgment is political.    Objections of principle, as well asadministrative difficulties, have resulted in the abandonment of previousschemes developed both by this Government and our predecessors. Theseare described in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex.    While the presentProposals are designed to avoid as many of these difficulties as possiblethere is no doubt that they will be controversial.    The main arguments forand against may be summarised as follows:-For :-a. The importance of widening the income base of the NHS, itwas clear from the discussions on public expenditure that therewere no other acceptable proposals to increase revenue fromcharges,b. Some provision for recovering these costs exists already in theRoad Traffic Act 1972.c. The heavy load which driving accidents place on the hospitalsand their staff, and on the economy and society in terms ofdisablement.d. The way in which our scheme would enable the cost to be spreadamong insured drivers according to their degree of risk ie by thecompanies&apos; appropriate adjustments to each premium.e. At  6 to  8 on average each year this is only equal to the costof a few gallons of petrol.A-gain8t:f.     The driving public should not be singled out for this charge;they pay for the NHS through their taxes and NHS insurancecontributions;  and there are others who run risks such as hang-gliders.    (Home Affairs Committee examined in July 1980 whetherthe latter type of activity could be brought in, but concluded it wastoo difficult to do).CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALg. The motorist whose accident is nobody&apos;s fault - or thepedestrian&apos;s - should not be penalised, even through a spreadingof the costs through insurance premia.h. Insurers would resist becoming, as they will argue, taxcollectors, especially as alternatives of extra vehicle excise dutyor petrol tax are, as they will see it, available.j.     Politically the impact of this scheme will be felt twice, firstwhen the legislation is taken through the House this Spring andsecond when it comes into effect in 1983.We will have to judge therefore whether we can get such a scheme through theHouse.    These proposals in my view offer the best chance of success.CONCLUSIONSD  The next steps, if the proposals are approved by Cabinet, would be:-a. an early announcement of the decision to include provision inthe Finance Bill to recover road accident costs on the basis &lt;.proposed;b. consultation with insurance and motor interests about theimplementation of the proposals;c. Parliamentary Counsel to be instructed to draft the necessaryclauses, for inclusion in the Finance Bill, to implement the proposalsin this paper.N FDepartment of Health and Social SecurityH February 19823CONFIDENTIAL

ANT.&apos;MXCONFIDENTIALDetailed implications of the schemea.     Apportionment of costs between insurers4.     The simplest approach on the face of things would be to apportionin the proportion either to companion&apos; premium income from mo Lor innm&lt;inCor to the number of vehicles insured with them.   But it will be ncccsf-consider any alternative subventions the companies may have.oIn negotiations on the Labour Government&apos;s original propor.aln - ^b. Apportionment between policy holders.       w-r!i.ch i;imt&apos;s original propor.aln - ^,general outline resemble   the present ones - the insurers took strongto being asked to act (as they saw it) as unpaid tax collectors.   rI&quot;hejr   ? ^that the amounts to be collected in respect of road accident costs shoulseparately identified as a fixed amount to be paid by the policyholdeseems highly likely that they will adopt the same approach again.tfitut0^6. There is a strong case in my view for resisting pressure for bt&gt;-apportionment between policyholders.   I understand that this was theenormous technical conrolexity in preparing the draft Bill on the Labourrived coStsGovernment&apos;s scheme.   Insurers already have to recover their own u-*,   ,    ... +reatroent;from insurance premiums and should similarly be able to deal witn w- ^oUgJicosts given that these will have been fixed in advance.   I acknowledgea  Of thCthat we shall need to concern ourselves generally with the fairnessarrangements adopted by insurers and that there is considerable scope4-1 Tobstruction on their nart.   A full assessment will not be possible. i reacti n&apos;proposals have been put to the insurers and we have their initial rc. Uninsured vehicles7. Special arrangements would be needed to deal with those vehici e.+h the SuP1 ,who, as an alternative to third party insurance deposit a sum wiw fu^Court as urovided in section 144(1) of the 1972 Act.   This is subject. . xrroupadvice from Parliamentary Counsel.   The argument for including thismainly one of equity; at present there are only eight of these &quot;spffC:*-a 0uvf&gt;reddepositors&quot; (albeit with substantial fleets) and the sums to be rec mthem would not be a significant proportion of the total.   Section 14 .^gof^Act exempts various public bodies and authorities from the third-pa*^ ^requirement; I do not propose to include these in the scheme as to donot contribute towards a decrease in public expenditure.2CONFIDENTIAL
