CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCCPY NOC(82) 72 April 1982CABINETINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment1. Cabinet decided in July 1980 (CC(80) 29th Conclusions, Minute 4) thatwe should proceed with the proposed International Conference Centre (ICC) onthe Broad Sanctuary site only if private finance could be obtained for its con-struction.    In June last year I reported to Cabinet the terms of an offer byPearl Assurance to finance the ICC (C(81) 34).    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, opposed the proposal on the grounds that it would be &quot;at least twoto three times as expensive&quot; as public funding - but. he was not prepared toallocate public funds at that time (C(81) 35).    Cabinet authorised me to con-clude the deal with Pearl (CC(8l) 25th Conclusions, Minut* 5).2. The terms of the Pearl offer were set out in the Annex to my paper.In the detailed negotiations that have taken place since then the original termshave been adhered to and the detailed arrangements for periodic rent review,including the notional market rent of a comparable office bu?&apos;lding on the site,which was one of the items for detailed negotiations, have been concluded.The rent review formula provides, as is now common on lease-leasebackschemes of this kind, for the first rent review due in 1991 to take account ofgrowth in market rents since 1981 (the date to which the notional rent of thecomparable building relates).    Thus, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, hassuggested that, if rents increased as a result of inflation from 1981, the rentpayable after five years could represent a return to Pearl of about 8-10 percent (which is what the market might expect in those inflationary conditions)rather than the initial 6.123 per cent payable in 1986 (although as the rent isreviewed every five years, the true rate of return Is about 1 per cent less than6 per cent or 8-10 per cent).    There is no certainty, of course, that rents willmove in line with inflation:  the rent is fixed in relation to market rentsprevailing at each review date.    This is the only significant point that was notcovered in the Annex to my earlier paper although it was made clear that therewould be five-yearly rent reviews.3. I have subsequently asked my new Accounting Officer to consider theseterms and his advice to me is that &quot;the deal with Pearl is as good as we arelikely to get in the private sector&quot;.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. I have also returned to the agents (Healey and Baker) who advised onthe Pearl offer and they have informed me, having reviewed the process ofnegotiations and the terms of the offer, that &quot;the terms negotiated are bothreasonable in relation to property financing and the best that were available atthe time&quot;.    They add that they do not consider &quot;that there are any materialareas where you might ha^e expected a better outcome, given the nature ofthe commodity and your requirements for the way in which it was to befinanced&quot; (ie as a property investment on lease-leaseback).5. I should mention that when we set out to obtain competitive offers forfinancing the ICC, the Treasury were kept fully informed of all the processes -including the prior invitation to four leading agents which led to the selectionof Healey and Baker.6. Pearl Assurance have now signed the Agreement and the managementcontractors (Bovis) are ready to let the main contract for the structural steel-work (this was timed for Monday 5 April but has been deferred pendingCabinet&apos;s decision).     The substructure contract (which is publicly funded atabout  5 million) has been completed and the scheme is running to programmefor completion in 1985-86.7 The Chief Secretary. Treasury, adheres to his view that privatefinancing is coo expensive.    Ho has suggested that we should ini-.rm Feailthat we do not wish to proceed with the Agreement and he has now offered toallocate funds for the project additional to the Property Services Agency Voteover the next four years (total cost at April 1982 prices about  36 million plusprovision for variation on price and contingencies).8. In his earlier advice to colleagues the Chief Secretary, Treasury, saidthat the Pearl offer would be &quot;at least two or three times as expensive&quot; aspublic funding.    He has suggested that, taking account of the rent reviewformula, it could be three-and-a-half to four times as expensive. Evenalloving for the rent review clause the cost is not widely different from thatput to colleagues at the time the decision to proceed was taken.    But, in anycase, I cannot accept this basis of calculation.    It assumes that the real costof Government borrowing is 2 per cent per annum and that the rent of the ICCwill rise in line with inflation throughout the 125 years of the lease.    Both themethod of comparison and the assumptions on which it is based are open toquestion.     On equally plausible, I would say more realistic, assumptions (egGovernment borrowing at 2j per cent per annum), the cost differential can beshown to be well within the range of two to three originally reported toCabinet.    All calculations of this kind, where market forces will determinethe eventual cost, are highly artificial.    In fact, it is unlikely that the ICCrent will keep pace with inflation in the longer run, since there is noprovision in the lease for refurbishment of the building, whereas the marketrents for office buildings will reflect modernisation.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9. The Treasury have also criticised the fact that there is :*0 break-clause in the lease.    It is quite unrealistic to suppose that there could be,since the building is designed expressly for Government purposes and there isno question but that the Government would wish to remain in occupation (at theend of the lease, both the building and the site will revert to the Crown).Nothing proves that more clearly than that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, isnow prepared for it to be built at public expense.CONCLUSION10. I believe that to drop Pearl now would be a major breach of good faith.They have adhered strictly to the original agreement in principle, which weannounced publicly last July, and we have no good grounds for going back on it.If we did so, the Government&apos;s credibility will be put at risk for future jointfinancing ventures.    Having entered into such negotiations, and reached asatisfactory conclusion, we must show that we have the will to carry it through.I believe that the deal as formulated is the best that can be got in the privatesector and, since Cabinet decided that the ICC was needed but there were nopublic funds available, it was right to negotiate it.11. I therefore seek colleagues&apos; approval to sign the Agreement forthwith.M HDepartment of the Environment2 April 19823CONFIDENTIAL
