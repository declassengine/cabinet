CONFIDENTIALthis documentIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82)l0 COPY NO 8313 April 1982CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1982-83Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislationconsidered the proposals made by Departments for a votal o  ?  ^^emSession&apos;s legislative programme and have where aece6f7h^&quot;&quot;^8^ee.With the Ministers concerned.    This memorandum seeks the Cabxne: s^agreement to the Committee&apos;s recommendations.    Further details of the Billsconcerned are given in C(82) 11.2- 1982-83 will be the last full Session of the present ^^&quot;&apos;^^legislative programme which we bring forward wil be crucia to th   .tancewhich we adopt in the run-up to the next General Electxon.    If the&lt;* an Election in the autumn of 1983 is to be kept open   we &quot;^&quot;^Jg^ ure that we can complete our programme comfortably by the Summex Recess * that year.    Although our programme for 1981-82 has been consldera^shorter than in earlier Sessions of the present Parliament - a fact whic~^en generally welcomed in both Houses - we are still faced with the prospectth a SUkstantial spillover in the Lords next autumn.    These considerations lede Committee to start from the assumption that we were looking for a^Qgiarr&gt;.rn  of about 15 Bills (excluding Finance, Consolidation, Scottish, nd Reading Committee and contingent Bills);  that was the number agreed8jL *k.e Cabinet at the beginning of the present Session.    We also agreed that we^ Uj,ci  nly select Bills which could confidently be expected to be ready forjkjor ^Uction at the beginning of the Session or, exceptionally, by the end ofpro ernber at the very latest.    We recognised the importance of legislation tom te our main strategic objectives, particularly in the field of privatisation,me same time we sought to give the programme a substantial socialin^tent*    Finally, we needed to include a good stock of Bills suitable for Lords-^auction, so as to minimise tne risk of end of Session congestion in that3. .&apos; Against this background, the Committee have decided to recommend thejQn listed in Annex A for the main programme.    Although this is not a-8 -ist, it is by no means a light one.    We estimate that 11 of the Bills will be-oversial, most of them highly so;  and we can expect the Opposition to use1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALevery means at their dispocal to obstruct progress.    The inclu. ion of theData Protection Bill in this list is in part conditional upon the reactions to theWhite Paper which we are about to publish, and colleagues will wish to take afinal decision later on whether it is in fact necessary and desirable to bringforward legislation on this subject.    The proposed Water Bill is confined toraising the borrowing limits of the water authorities, and does not include thewider provisions on the reorganisation of the water industry proposed by theSecretary of State for the Environment.    The Committee are satisfied that^ajor additions to the recommended programme could only be accommodatedat the expense of equivalent deletions.4- Annex B lists six contingent Bills which could become essential incertain circumstances.    In addition, the Secretary of State for the Environmenthas reminded us that the Cabinet has yet to take a decision on the timing ofiegislaticn on the reform of the racing system;  and the Secretary of State forTransport cannot rule out the possibility of a Trarspoit Bill being needed todeal with public transport subbidies and with the finance of British Rail.5- Annex C lists 10 Bills for inclusion in the programme on condition that^ey are ready for introduction at the beginning of the Session and theOpposition then raise no objection to their being dealt with under the SecondReading Committee procedure in the House of Commons     Second ReadingCommittee Bills cannot be accorded a high drafting priority, and it is essentialthat instructions should be sent to Parliamentary Counsel very early if they areto have a reasonable prospect of being ready in time.The three Scottish Bills listed in Annex D should all be suitable forSecond Reading in Scottish Grand Committee.7I must again emphasise the importance of Departments maintaining or^proving the timetables for the preparation of thsir Bills as set out in^(82) \it     because of the leave season, Parliamentary Counsel is unlikely toe able to start drafting before September Bills for which instructions are not?&quot;? ^exved mtil late July;  and that may well mean that the Bills concerned mayn t be ready by the beginning o:f the Session.    The Lord President of theUncil must be informed immediately if there is any failure to meet the time-J-e for the despatch of instructions.I invite colleagues to:a. Approve the list of programme Bills at Annex A.b. Note the contingent Bills listed in Annex B, and agree that theyshould be brought forward if necessary.CONFIDENTIAL
