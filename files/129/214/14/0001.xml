CONFIDENTIAL &amp;vS cumeNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 14 .COPY NO    Q ^19th April 1982CABINETINDEX-LINKED PENSIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTIONl. It is now 14 months since the publication of the Scott Report and weare coming under increasing and understandable pressure to announce ourconclusions.    At Cabinet on 10 December (CC(8l) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4;Pwe agreed In principle not to legislate to remove or reduce the inflation-proofing of public service pensions.    Instead, we asked for further work on a.new system of employee contributions.    Essentially, public servants wouldPay, in addition to their present contributions (described in these papers asthe lower tier) a new special charge (the upper tier) towards the current costof index-linking and this would be regularly reviewed and if necessaryadjusted.    We accepted that the scheme could not extend directly to thenationalised industries because of the legislative difficulty of bringing theircontribution ratss within Government control.SHE ~^?iCIAL REPORT2- Officials have now completed this further work and their report is atAnnex A.    It is detailed, but that is inevitable given its scope and the complexlegal and financial structures involved.    I am satisfied that the basic conceptof cur preferred option is sound;  and that the technical difficulties can beovercome.    There is, indeed, considerable attraction (except for the peopleaffected) in a course in which public servants would be seen to pay for theadditional cost of full index-linking, as compared with private sector practices.And it must be right in principle.3  The report distinguishes between the services where full pensionsare   earned over 40 years (&quot;normal accrual&quot;) and those where pensionsare earned more quickly and are payable from an earlier age (&quot;fast accrual&quot;).Fast accrual is much more valuable and the benefit of index-linking iscorrespondingly greater.    I endorse the general view of officials that thesebetter benefits should be paid for at a somewhat higher rate.    But we mustalso recognise that the advantages of earlier retirement stem partly fromthe fitness requirements of the jobs concerned - in the policefire andPrison services, for example, and the Armed Forces.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPOINTS FOR DECISIONOn the main issues posed in paragraphs 4 - 6 of the official reporta d paragraph 4 of the Chairman&apos;s note, my views are as follows:-a. Police, Fire and Prison Services - Lower Tier ContributionsI would accept the Official Committee&apos;s recommendation that thelower-tier contributions for these services should in principle beincreased.    I doubt whether in practice it is realistic to aim at asingle, uniform, contribution and it will probably be unavoidable that:we negotiate rates tailored to the circumstances of each service.We should, however, aim to ensure that the treatment of the variousservices is consistent and avoid unnecessarily fine distinctionsbetween them.    (Similar considerations apply to the National HealthService Mental Health Officers. )b. Calculation of the Special ChargeThough it will complicate the scheme, I agree that the specialcharge should be calculated separately for the normal and fastaccrual services and it must be subject to regular review.    If therewas a single charge for all, those in the normal schemes would claimthat they were being required to eubsidise the more costly inflation-proofing of the others.    However, for the fast accrual schemes, thecombined impact of increases in both tiers would be very severe.We may need to modify the higher special charge on the grounds thatearlier retirement is imposed in these services.c. The Armed ForcesIt is desirable in principle that the scheme should have the widestpossible coverage and that the Armed Forces should not appear tobe getting specially favoured treatment.    This argues fcr includingthem.    On the other hand, the present pension deduction for theArmed Forces - increased last year to 11 per cent (equivalent to13 or 14 per cent in a contributory scheme) - is unlikely to becriticised as inadequate.    And although the method of calculation isdifferent, the result is in line with what is proposed for the other fastaccrual services.    A change would require major adjustments to theArmed Forces pay and pension arrangements.    On the balance ofthese arguments I would suggest that the Armed Forces should beexcluded from the new scheme - at least for the time being.5. For the normal accrual pervices - Civil Service, National HealthService, teachers and local government - I agree that the lower tiercontribution should be 5 per cent (manuals) and 6 per cent (non-manuals)with a uniform special charge estimated initially at Z\ per cent.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. I would endorse the other recommendations in paragraph 4 of theReport.    In particular, I see it as an integral part of the prcporalu thatthe Civil Service scheme should become fully contributory, with ai* upwardadjustment to pay to compensate for the lower tier contribution.    The effectwould be financially neutral.    I would propose to enter into consultation withthe Civil Service unions on the precise amendments needed to the pensionscheme avoiding, so far as possible, &quot;windfall&quot; benefits for existingemployees.    Arrangements equivalent to the special charge must clearlyaPply in the universities and other public service bodies mainly financedfrom public funds.    It would also be right to invite the Top Salaries ReviewBody to review, in the light of the proposed changes, the arrangementsunder which they take account of pensions in assessing judicial pay.I shaU consider further the effect of the increases in contributionson the Inland Revenue limit that employee contributions should net exceed15 per cent of pay in schemes qualifying for tax-relief.    My present viewls that chis limit should continue to apply to those who have yet entered intocontracts to pay additional voluntary contributions but be waived for thosewith contracts existing at the date of announcement, to the extent - and onlyto the extent - that the new arrangements would take them over the limit..   The special charge as estimated in the official report must beregarded as provisional, pending a proper review before implementation.However, the most likely overall effect of these proposals can be summarisedas follows:-Total C&gt; ntributionsper centTeachers )Local Government )NHSOfher BodiesCivil ServiceExisting5 manual6 non-manualProposedl\ manual8^- non-manualTotal effective contribution 7^ manualapproximately 8 (equivalent 8^ non-manualto 8^ per cent in a contri-rbutory scheme)*MPsPolice, fire and )prison services )JudiciaryArmed Forces66| - 83 or 48*10-13 depending onnegotiations5$ or 6|-, plus TSRBpay adjustmentContinued pay adjustment equivalent to13 or 14 per cent in a contributory schemereflecting the fact that pensions would be slightly larger being basedon higher gross pay.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe gross public expenditure savings of these changes - that is, theadditional income from employee contributions, assuming no offset inhigher pay - would be abouc  535 million a year.IMPLICATIONS FOR PAY9. The key question for decision is whether in this Parliament we aregoing to insist that public servants should pay more for index-linkedpensions.    To impose a higher contribution would not be easy at any time.It will be particularly difficult at a time when most public servants arebeing asked to accept increases in pay which are near or below theincrease in the cost of living.    We must, therefore, expect our proposalsto be vigorously resisted by the unions, even if the basic shape of the schemeis a fair one,10. The Official Committee on Public Service Pay have pointed out(Annex B) that the introduction of the special charge will lead to claims ofvarying strengthes for compensatory adjustments to pay.    However, thewhole scheme is designed to answer the charge that public servants pay toolittle for index-linking.    Its purpose would be lost if we conceded automaticpay increases to meet the new charge.    So, too, would the savings inPublic expenditure.    In my view, we should say there can be no assumptionthat pay will be increased to offset the special charge.    We should thenresist claims for offsets so far as possible.11. These difficulties are, of course, inherent in any proposal toincrease the contributions for index-linking ever the next two years. TheProblem will not go away; and my judgment is that public concern aboutindex-linking will increase if we are successful in holding down pay whilePensions increase in line with prices.    If we are to meet this concern, theonly alternative to a genuine increase in contributions would be to cease fullindex-linking.    We have rejected that course for other reasons.    It might,however, help to secure the acceptance of the special charge if, during theP &apos;ocess of consultation, we pointed to this as the alternative.ANNOUNCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION12. The Official Committee on Public Service Pay have recommendedagainst an announcement before the completicn of the remaining publicservice pay settlements - the Civil Service, the National Health Serviceand schoolteachers - and it is clearly important not to prejudice theiroutcome.    On the other hand, the matter has now run on for well over a yearand we are being widely criticised for dragging our feet.    There are, in myview, good political arguments for resolving this thorny question once-and-for-all, well before the run up to an election.    In particular, the formerLeader of the House has faced growing pressure in the House to arrange afairly early Parliamentary debate and, in his judgment, there is no prospectthat this can be avoided.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL13.       The best timing for a debate would be towards the end of May orearly June, after decisions on the Civil Service pay arbitration and beforethe report of the Megaw Inquiry.    This could still run us into difficultiesover the teachers&apos; or nurses&apos; pay negotiations, if they had not been settledby then- but it would be difficult to hold off the pressures much beyondmid-June.    A debate with no clear indication of our intentions would be badlyreceived by our supporters, both in the House and in the country.    It wouldtherefore need to be preceded by an Oral Statement giving an indication ofour conclusions in fairly broad terms.    (A possible draft is at Annex C. )This could be backed by a written document, placed in the Library of theHouse, explaining the proposals i  greater detail.!4.       Beyond that, we are firmly committed to consult the variousinterests on any proposed changes and we could undertake this during thesummer - perhaps on the basis of a White Paper or formal consultationdocument.    We could make it clear that while we had made proposals ingenera] terms, we were still open to representations, and we need not,therefore, be committed to final decisions until the autumn.    On theassumption (which we may wish to reconsider) that no place can now befound in the 1982-83 legislative programme, this timetable could leadeither to legislation early in the 1983-84 session (with a view to implementa-tion in the course of 1984), or to a firm Manifesto commitment for actionearly in the next Parliament.    We need not close the options on this forsome time.RECOMMENDATIONS15.       I ask my colleagues to agree, thereforea. that in readiness for a Parliamentary debate in late May orearly June, I should announce our intention to introduce a two-tiersystem of contributions on the general lines of our preferred options(see the draft statement at Annex C);b. that in the light of the debate we should consult interestedbodies with a view to reaching final decision this autumn;c. on the detail of the scheme -i.       that the normal accrual schemes should be treated asproposed in paragraph 5 above and pay a special charge ofaround 2^ per cent;ii.       that for the police, fire and prison services,contributions for pension benefits should be reviewed asproposed in paragraph 4a above;  that the special chargeshould be set at a higher rate;  but that the overall impactof these changes may need to be modified (paragraph 4b);5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiii. that the scheme should exclude the Armed Forces,but that it should embrace all the other public pervices,including the judiciary and, indirectly, the universitiesand other public service bodies mainly financed fromGove: nment funds;iv, that the Civil Service scheme should become fullycontributory and that the other recommendations inparagraph 4 of the official report should be accepted;v.       that there should be no assumption that adjustmentswill be made to pay to offset the special charge; andd.       that whi]e the scheme cannot apply directly to the nationalisedindustries we should invite each industry to review its own level ofemployee contributions in the light of the changes proposed for thepublic services.G HTreasury Chambers*9 April 19826CONFIDENTIAL

The Committee&apos;s6 8u   en^a,tions are summarised in paragraph 4, while paragraphs 5 and&apos;fast tllose questions about the application of these criteria tothat   a Crua1&apos; groups (see below) which it seemed to the Committee nly Ministers could resolve,cruala0 v.     rePort .draws a necessary distinction between the &quot;normal^al&quot;services (mainly civil servants, teachers, NHS and local1
government) in which pensions are earned over 40 years, and theaccrual&quot; services (mainly armed forces, police, fire and prisonservices) where pensions are earned over shorter periods by an e retiring age.   Pensions &quot;based on a faster accrual rate are morevaluable, and as a general rule derive greater benefit from indeA-linking.   Much&apos;of the report is concerned with this complication,it has perhaps three main features which call for special consicieby Ministers:a     the scheme would be simpler if the upper tier were average^across all services.   Against this, the cost of index-linki^Sconsiderably higher in the fast accrual schemes.    If there weresingle charge for all, those in the ??&lt; schemes would poiftthat they were being required to subsidise the more costlyinflation-proofing of the others.   The Committee believe that ^this could damage the acceptability of the scheme to normal accgroups and the Government&apos;s ability to justify it as broadly falto all concerned;b    how to deal with the overall level of contributions in faSaccrual schemes (paragraphs 21-23 and 31-34).    The Committeeconsider that, in addition to the higher charge in the upperthere is a strong case for increasing the lower tier contri utlCMpaid by most of the fast accrual services.    The combined e feC&quot;increases in both tiers could, however, lead to an overallcontribution which would not be negotiable with the groupsconcerned.    There is a case for modifying the overall impact oAincreases on the grounds that the benefits of fast accrual ste&gt;partly from management requirements for early retirement.

Wecerr .0uSht to ensure this in preparing this report.   But we draw attention tocain exceptions:-a* As we explained in our second report, Course B or any otheraction on contributions cannot be applied directly to nationalisedindustries and public corporations because contribution rates to theseschemes are outside Government control. However, the NationalisedIndustries Chairmen&apos;s Group have said (Annex F to our second report)that the Government could reasonably expect the industries to takeaccount of any Government decisions for the public services and, inthe light of them, to examine their own arrangements in conjunctionwith the Trustees of their pension funds along with employees andtheir unions. It would accordingly be unrealistic to expect uniformresults across the public trading sector. But it would be reasonable,and politic, for the Government to ask the nationalised industries forviews within a specified time on the case for, and feasibility of,higher employee contributions, particularly in the case of those fundsrequiring employer deficiency payments.h  The proposals cannot apply to certain UK nationals employedoverseas. These are mainly officials employed by overseas governments,through whom the Government cannot impose or collect contributions.The number of staff involved is, however, very small, although thenumber of current pensioners is quite large.c&lt; It is for decision whether the armed forces and the judiciaryshould be treated in the same way as other groups. This is discussedln Paragraphs 25 to 29 below.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS4. The Committee is agreed on the following recommendations to Ministers.The effect on individual public service groups is summarised at Annex B.a. The  special  charge  for  index-linking  should be averaged acr^different  services,  at  least  for the &quot;normal accrual&quot; services:civil service, teachers, NHS and local government (paragraph 8).b. In all  the  normal accrual  services  there  should be a staIK*a,*temployee contribution of  5 per cent for manual staff and 6 per cfor non-manuals (paragraph 9).c. The Civil Service scheme should become fully contributory(paragraph 10).d. Mental Health Officer status in the NHS should be reviewed by thehealth departments (paragraph 14)..  . .   &lt;?chemee. Financial   support   for   the   Universities Superannuationshould   be   adjusted   on   the   assumption   that   university   staff ^a^.teachers would pay a contribution towards pensions increase equivato that paid by other public servants (paragraph 17), andf. Similar action should be taken where appropriate in relationcontrolled fringe bodies (paragraph 18).tb^g. The Review Body on Top Salaries should be invited to reviewarrangements  under which  account  is  taken of  pensions  in assessjudicial pay and to publish its findings (paragraph 29).h. Officials should consider urgently the  issues which would a^^fflfrom men and women paying equal contributions in all schemes aridclaims for widowers&apos; pensions (paragraph 38).i. Transitional tax relief should be considered for public ^erv^&quot;^gtaken over the Inland Revenue 15 per cent limit on employee contribut ^gas a result of these proposals, but a more general relaxation oflimit is not recommended (paragraphs 39 to 42).i . a   fire5. We are agreed that the overall contributions paid by the police, ^ fland prison services should in principle be increased. Within this there ^strong prima facie case for reviewing the level of lower tier contributto the schemes. However, Ministers will wish to decide whether:-rate&quot;3a. to review existing contributions with a view to negotiating ^.tailored closely to the circumstances of each service (paragraph &apos;orb. to aim at  a  single  uniform contribution  in all  these servic(paragraph 32).6. The following major questions  seem to us to raise considerationeither side which only Ministers can resolve:-2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa. whether the fast accrual services should pay a higher pensionsincrease charge than the normal accrual services. If Ministers decidethat they should, we recommend that the charge should be averagedacross these services, as with the normal accrual services. There is acase however for moderating the full increase in contributions by thefast accrual services that would be entailed by strict application ofthe principles used to determine the charge for normal accrualservices (paragraphs 21 to 23);a&gt; whether the armed forces should be excluded from the newarrangements (paragraph 26), or brought into line with the other fastaccrual rate services (paragraph 27), which on balance we consider thewore logical and consistent outcome.GE**RAL FEATURES7.pro It is important to be clear about the principles underlying thed6    8ais in this report, because they will form the basis of the Government&apos;sce  f their equity against a wide range of conflicting objections. WeCasegaPPlied a number of criteria to each group in turn, drawing attention toc0n . where they may conflict with each other or where Ministers may wish toaer variations. The criteria are as follows:-a&apos; Consistency: that all who stand to enjoy similar benefits shouldPay similarly for them in a way that is widely seen to be fair.b  Clarity and credibility: that the public servants concernedshould demonstrably meet a cost which is known, and defensible inrelation to outside practice. A simple, broad-brush approach willcontribute to this objective.c- Stability and self-sufficiency: the objective is to establishself-contained arrangements for pensions and pension contributionswhich will last and not be subject to short-term disruption.Practicability: this has two main elements in the presentcontext - negotiability with the groups concerned and the danger thatto attempt to deal with all the variations in question would lead tothe proposals foundering because of their complexity. In particular,there is a need for the proposals to be compatible with existingfinancial and administrative systems.pr^n . An important general question, to be considered in the light of theseCaj  ^Ple8 is whether the special charge for pensions increase should beserv ate&lt;* by averaging the cost of pensions increase across the publicSer .Ces. This is best considered separately for the &quot;normal accrual&quot;fu1^ Ces ~ the civil service, local government, teachers and the NHS, where aPoli ^ensi n accrues over 40 years - and the &quot;fast accrual&quot; services -aCcr e  fire and prison services, and the armed forces - where pensionsp6ns.e faster and may be in payment from an earlier age, giving a much higher&apos;.f   ^^r/employee  ratio.

So far as the &quot;normal accrual&quot;  services are concerned,r6p Case for averaging the cost was argued in paragraph 25 of our secondqU t   .   The cost of pensions increases, as a proportion of payroll, varieshistoriwidely   from   service   to   service,   but   this   is   largely  a  matter ofcal accident,   reflecting  the  relative maturity of schemes and their3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcomposition by  age.   We  do  not  consider  that   individual  serving employ*2^should pay different contributions for such reasons.  We recommend thatsame  charge  should be  levied  on all  the  normal accrual  rate servicesconsider the effect on these groups in the following section.WeTHE NORMAL ACCRUAL SERVICESGeneral9.        There   are   a   good   many   public   service   schemes   in   this category*However,  the bulk of the cost of index-linking arises from the four largegroups: the civil service (excluding prison officers, who have fast aCCt. tarrangements), the NHS, local government and teachers. The best estimate tcan be made of.the pensions increase charge averaged across these ^our.^r theis 2 1/4 per cent (see Annex A).    (This figure, and others associated withdiscussion of  the  special charge,  must be regarded as provisional at tstage,   pending  a  proper  review at  the  time  of  implementation).   The sflcharge as for the main normal accrual schemes would be applied by analogy&apos;the smaller groups. At present, employee contributions in the normal accrrate schemes are typically  5 per cent for manual staff and 6 per cent ^non-manual.   We   recommend   that   these   levels   of   contributions shouldretained but  that  they  should be  regarded as  the lower tier contributidefined   in   paragraph   2.    This   approach  will   minimise   the administratichanges needed to implement the new arrangements.   And 5 to 6 per cent are ^most  common  employee  contributions  to  contributory pension schemes  1  ^private sector.   Thus, for the normal accrual schemes, the combined e^ect(fotthe  two-tier  contribution under  this  course would be  7  1/4 per cent (manuals) and 8 1/4 per cent (for non-manuals).The Civil Service (except prison officers)10. Public criticism of index-linking has been directed very much at C ecivil service and it is important that the Government&apos;s proposals shou1 _gseen  to  apply  to  it.    We  do  not  believe  this  would  happen  if  the vcontinued on its present non-contributory basis. In that case, civil serV .:tswould pay the special charge but would still have their remaining benetaken into account  in the  settlement  of  their pay;   the  impression in ^public mind  that  they were not paying for their pensions would remain*part at least.   And it is only under a contributory scheme that paymentspensions can be ensured no matter what the prevailing pay regime. According &apos;we consider it important to the clarity and credibility of the Governmenpackage that the civil service scheme should become fully contributory.11. We recommend that, within a fully contributory scheme, civil serva ,should  pay  5 per cent  (industrials)  and 6 per cent  (non-industrials) &quot;line with the other normal accrual rate services.   This would be in additto the special charge of some 2 1/4 per cent towards pensions increase. gultimate position would thus be a total contribution by non-industrials 01/4 per cent, as compared with the 7.9 per cent total effective contributin   the   1980   pay   comparison   exercise   (equivalent   to   an   8   1/2   per  c gcontribution in a fully contributory scheme).   But the effect on the earnltjieof civil servants would depend on the way in which the introduction ofspecial charge was treated (see below).12. It will take time to draft and negotiate the complicated amendmen*that will  be  needed  to many aspects  of  the  scheme.  A contributory sC&quot;could not come into effect before April 1984.

These   services   pose   a   rather   different   and   more   complex   seL nproblems.   The effects of fast pension accrual and of early retirement ^that the total benefits  (including index-linking) can be up to 70 or 80 Vcent   more   valuable   than   those   of   normal   accrual   schemes.    It doesnecessarily   follow   that   the   total   contributions   to   fast   accrual   sc e(jshould be that much higher.   It has long been argued by the staff concer ^that   their   early   retirement   (and   fast   accrual)   derives   from managemrequirements and  the particularly arduous nature of their duties;  and ^gthe additional cost should therefore be borne by the employer.   While we .some  force  in this  argument,  we  consider  that,  with  the  exception ofarmed  forces,   the  existing  overall  contribution differential   (a percenpoint  or  two)   is   insufficient  in view  of  the  advantageous  nature of ^gschemes, and that the lower tier contributions should be examined as welthe charge for pensions  increase.   We discuss  the  implications of thiseach of the fast accrual services in paragraphs 25 to 34 below.21. In the case of the pensions increase charge, the main questi n ,whether the fast accrual services should pay the same as the normal acC Q{services:   the  current  cost  of  pensions   increase  is  about   10  per cent6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALae^ ^ ^or tne armed forces, the police and the fire service combined, asg0^nst rather less than 4 1/2 per cent for the civil service, NHS, localser ^nment and teachers, taken together. If the cost were averaged across all8e lces  the charge would be about 2 1/2 per cent of pay. If there wereMou, ate charges for the normal and fast accrual services, these figuressPec&apos; lnd*cate 2 1/4 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Thus, if thef^1^ charge for pensions increase did not differentiate between normal andWere accrual, the normal accrual services would be able to argue that theyPens&apos; 8uksidising (albeit by 1/4 per cent of pay) the highly favourablebet 0ns  f others. The Committee concluded that, although the balancetWo t^e criteria of consistency and practicability would suggest that theraatt r ad groups should be treated separately, this must essentially be aer for Ministerial decision.22.      yf .is e fflSt accrual services are to pay a higher special charge thererefle furt&apos;ler question whether it should vary for different schemes,make  ?Xn*&gt; their different circumstances. We do not recommend this. It wouldany ae system unduly complex, would imply a spurious precision which is insyjj.Case not possible, and, because the numbers would be small, would beJect to considerable fluctuation.the f ^6 1uestion then arises whether the fast accrual schemes should paytions ^ ^6r cent charge, or whether the increase in their total contribu-that .Snouid be moderated in some way. There are two arguments which suggestpetlB.1,: should be moderated. First, the argument that the high cost of theseinc ns is the result of a management requirement applies to pensionsPer 3Se *&quot;n much the same way as to the totality of benefits. Secondly, a 5contr^Knt pensi ns increase charge, combined with an increase in basics0 m ,Ut&quot;&apos;&apos;(?n t0  say  8 per cent, would result in a level of total contributionw uld h n^ner than at present that application without adjustment to paybetWe 6 Particularly difficult. A different division of the emerging costPensi n emPi yer and employee (eg two-thirds/one-third, which would give ac nsider dincrease   charge   of   3   to   3   1/2   per   cent),   might   therefore be24. .gr0.

Paid by any other public service.    In the light of this, it is open tofast      wbether the armed forces should be included in the arrangements forccrual schemes described above..26.forCes, n fcbe one hand, it could be convincingly argued that the armedsPecian non*&quot;contributory pension arrangements are part of a pay systemCon  . y set up for them, in which the armed forces themselves haveto ^ nce and which the public has accepted, and that it is both unnecessaryc sts ^e *t and preferable not to do so.

On the other hand,   the objective is to apply this option acrosspublic services so far as possible.   The Government has always made it cthat   its   consideration  of   the   Scott   Report   encompasses   the  whole Puservice, and it might seem anomalous to exclude the armed forces from anyarrangements for the public services generally.  If the armed forces aPPeaherto be getting&apos; special treatment,    that might increase the resistance of 0cgroups to the Government&apos;s proposals; and once the whole of the rest ofpublic services&apos;  pension arrangements had been put on a contributory ba ^the armed forces would alone be open to criticism - however misguided &quot;receiving  non-contributory pensions.   The  rationale  for  excluding themthe general scheme would rest entirely on the present pay arrangements, wmay   not   always   continue   in   their   present   form.   The   armed   forces  m .therefore be included in the general scheme, with an appropriate contribut^^^to basic benefits and the pensions increase charge in line with those ofpolice and fire services.

Judges  have  the benefit  of  a uniquely  rapid accrual  rate - apension   after   15   or   20   years,   depending   on   the   office   held. Judicpensions,   taken as  a whole,  are  the most valuable  in the public serVlCaiJudges contribute only to widows&apos; pensions: 3% for those with 20 year accrand  4%  for  those  on  15  years.    They are  covered directly by  the PenSi(Increase) Act, and so would be required to pay the special charge.   It lS imoot point,  however, whether it should be at the level paid by fast accrservices   generally   (if   that   is  higher  than  that   for   the   normal accrservices).   The main argument for a higher charge to the fast accrual serv^Cseis  their early retirement age:  this does not apply to the judiciary, wnretiring   age   is   over   70.    Thus   judicial   pensions   are   in  payment   f J econsiderably   shorter   time   than   the   average.    Index-linking   is   theref proportionately less significant than for the other fast accrual services. ^balance, we consider that the lower special charge only should be leviedthe judiciary, as for the normal accrual services.the29. More  generally,   similar arguments apply  to  the judiciary as toarmed forces.    It could be held that the criteria of coverage, consistencyclarity require a fully contributory scheme so that judges can be seen topaying for their very advantageous pensions.   On the other hand,  TSRB taaccount of pensions in determining judicial pay.

Such claims may be presentetwo broad grounds:-a.

Some groups could claim that specific and up-to-date assessmej^had been made of the value of index-linking; that such assessmentsbeen fully reflected in pay rates; and that public service pay P based heavily on uniform pay factors within cash limits,  had ca ^the effect forward.   The civil service will certainly claim tosuch a position; so will groups with civil service pay links (eg ^very recently, NHS administrative staff).  At the other extreme, ^are   groups   -   the   police   and   fire   services,   and   possibly ggovernment   non-manuals   (where,   although   comparability   studies ^been done in the past,  it is not known with certainty what,  lf j,account was taken of pensions) - who would have no foundation f r gclaims, because no past adjustment was made.

Private sector pension schemes normally guarantee no post-retirementpensions increases or, at best, fixed escalation of 3% to 5% a year.However, it is common for schemes to go beyond the minimum contractualrequirement, either by using funding surpluses arising from the higheriiinterest rates accompanying high inflation, or by discretionary &quot;toppingfrom the employer.5. Practice varies quite widely.   A good many large employers - for exafflP^Id, the major oil companies, the clearing banks and IBM - are known to haveprovided substantial increases over the last several years which have falleDonly a little short of full indexation.   Other pensioners, however -particularly those from smaller employers with insurance-based schemes -have received no increases at all over a period of many years.   The bestevidence we have suggests fairly consistently that private sector pension^0Thi6have received on average increases at about half the rate of inflation.is borne out by the Government Actuary&apos;s 1979 survey of occupational pensi00schemes, which covered the whole private sector but looked at increases i a 198 &apos;one year only; by the data supplied to the Pay Kesearch Unit in 1979 anwhich was confined to a smaller sample, but went back over the previous ^5 years; and also by periodical surveys carried out by the National Associaof Pension Funds.   An important point to note in this context is thatprivate sector pensions are based on 1/60th of salary for each year of sewhereas the pension fraction in public service schemes is normally l/80th Further detailed consideration would need to be given at the time to how, ^at all, this should be taken into account in calculating the special charge&apos;iSGCONFIDENTIAL

The key elements of theseP  Posals so far as the implications for pay are concerned are as follows:2.1    The introduction of a special charge, specifically related to thecost of the difference in degree to which public service and privatesector pensions are protected against inflation.   Current calculationssuggest that this might initially be 2$: per cent, although it wouldneed to be reviewed periodically.lx    An increase in pension contributions for basic benefits (and ahigher special charge) for the police, fire and prison services, totake account of the fact that their pensions accrue at a faster ratethan those of the generality of public servants.uese proposals are likely to be resisted by staff who will seek to recoupthe whol *e  * the new special charge through higher pay.

And a number of groups in the NationalHealth Service (NHS) and local government will point to the fact that rep01&quot;*on their pay by the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability (the CleggCommission) took explicit account of pension benefits.   Broadly similarconsiderations apply to doctors and dentists.3.     In response the Government will no doubt wish to argue that it isimportant that pension contributions in the public services can be demonto be reasonable by reference to private sector practice;   that pay is aseparate matter from pensions and should in future be negotiated in theof the particular considerations relevant to it, especially market factortratedwhat can be afforded;   that there should therefore be no automatic payincreto compensate for the new special charge for pensions increase;   but that *nlevel of pension contributions will be taken into account in all future pftVnegotiations in so far as they are relevant.   Moreover, the Government canargue that the proposed new contribution for index-linking implies greater0 futureconfidence that the principle of index-linking will be preserved in tne4.     In reaching decisions on the proposed changes in pension arrangementsMinisters need to assess how far the objective that public servants shouiseen to be paying an appropriate price for their pensions is likely to beachieved in practice.

This section considers the likelihood of offsetting pay increases in^3 for each of the main groups affected by the public service pensionProposals.   Any such assessment must be a matter of judgement.   Moreover, even&quot; the employers concerned were to maintain the principle that there was no&apos;P-ific compensation for the extra pension contribution, the issue would^ouHedly influence the negotiations and there could be no- certainty, evena*ter the event, that the level of settlement eventually reached had or hadn t been influenced by the extra pension contribution.6.In tenurses -rms of presentation, as the detailed discussion below suggests, therea difference between those groups - the civil service and perhaps also the * newwhere the new pension arrangements may coincide with the introductionPay arrangements, and other groups.   In the case of the former categoryGovernment would be able to argue that pay must be decided under the new^    arrangements as a separate matter from whatever is happening on the pensionand it may be possible to present the outcome on this basis even thoughthere i.no guarantee that what happens on pensions will not in fact affectpay tosome extent.   In the case of other groups it will not be possible toSGParatepensions and pay both in argument and presentation in this way. iyii7.Jn thecase of the Civil Service there are two special considerations:1.ii.The Megaw Inquiry will be reporting this year on new pay arrangementsfor the non-industrial Civil Service and the objective is to put thenew arrangements into effect in time for the 1983 settlement(effective date 1 April).The Civil Service pension is at present non-contributory (although thecost has been taken into account in pay determination) and theProposals envisage not only the levying of a special &quot;pensionsincrease&quot; contribution from 1983 onwards in common with otherpublic service groups, but also the putting of Civil Service pensionson a contributory basis, which cannot be implemented until 1984.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE8. The effect on the 1983 Civil Service pay negotiations depends largely  nwhether the new pay arrangements following the Megaw Inquiry can he pit ineffect in I983.    If they can, there is at least a possibility that the newcontributions for index linking would not be fully offset by an increase inpay because this element might tend to be lost in the complexities ofchangeover to the new pay arrangements.   If the new postTMegaw payarrangements are not put into effect in 1983 at the same time as the newcontribution for index-linking, it is likely that the outcome of the 19^3pay negotiations, and any subsequent arbitration, would be influenced. oynew contribution.?cbeBie9. It is proposed in the VP Report that, if the Civil Service pension  is made fully contributory in 1984, the basic contribution (as distinct fr the contribution for index-linking) should be fully offset by increasedat that time.   This would need to be made clear at the same time as the nevrcontribution for index-linking was announced.    This should help to makeproposals more negotiable although the Civil Service unions may argue that*having conceded the principle of offsetting the basic contribution, theGovernment is on weaker ground in resisting offset  of the index-linkingcontribution, bearing in mind the deductions in pay made for both elementsin the past.National Health Service10. In the case of one National Health Service group, the nurses and mithe Government has undertaken to consider new pay arrangements.   These ne^ ^arrangements will have to take account of the Government&apos;s thinking aboutCivil Service pay arrangements post Megaw;   thus it is doubtful whether *n ^ vcan be in place in April 1983  although that is the present target  anabe in place until 1984.    If the new arrangement for the nurses and midwive ^were to coincide with the new contributions for index-linking, there i possibility that the new contribution would be lost in the complexitieschangeover and would not be fully offset by a higher pay settlement. Xlicase of the other NHS groups however the unions are likely to press strongfor offsetting increases in pay and to advance the arguments in paragi&quot;apkabove.    It would be realistic to assume that the level of NHSsettlement *I983 would be affected by the extra pension contribution._LCONFIDENTIAL

There is, therefore, the^ 8sibiiity of industrial action in the prison service if the Government werelnsi8t that increased pension contributions should not be offset, at leastrtially^ by increased pay.Whatever is finally agreed for local government could be expected toapply also to the fire service.   In the case of the police, the management sidethe Negotiating Board is already proposing a review of pension arrangementsa view to higher contributions.

Ministers need to decide whetherthe proposed new pension arrangements should apply to the Armed Forces,the Armed Forces are excluded the question of increases in pensionIfcontributions, or of compensating increases in pay, would not arise.If thearrangements were to extend to the Armed Forces, the AFFKB would take in*0account whatever pensions contribution was levied.    In practice, therefore*while the remuneration of the Armed Forces continues to be settled hy asystem of detailed comparability, any alteration in the pension arrangement9is likely to be balanced by a corresponding adjustment to pay.Cash Limits15.    Since it is proposed that the Government&apos;s position should be that theincreased pension contribution should not automatically be offset by increpay, the cash limit pay factor could make no apparent allowance for this*.fheIn practice, however, as the analysis in previous paragraphs suggests,outcome for most groups would be likely to reflect the increased contributeat least to some extent.    The contingency reserve would need to be adequatefor this purpose.    The fact that the cash limit pay factor was exceeded t rmany public service groups would however be presentationally disadvantage011Timing16.   We have considered whether the timing of the introduction of the prop0, n-fcifliincrease in pension contributions might be adjusted to minimise the potenpay problems.   One possible approach might be to introduce the 2^ per centspecial charge over more than.one pay round.   On the one hand smaller increin pension contributions might prove more palatable and thus less likelybe offset by a pay increase.   On the other hand there is the danger thatspreading the increases over a period would mute their effects publiclythe Government would not be able to demonstrate so clearly that the publlCservices were henceforth paying significantly more for their index-linkedpensions.17.   Another possibility might be to introduce the increased pensioncontributions at a date other than the pay settlement date, for example 10_u_CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX CDraft Oral StatementThe Government has completed its review of the arrangements forincreasing public service pensions in the light of the ScottReport and I should like to announce our broad conclusions andProposals for change.2.      First, we have decided that the right course is to ensurethat adequate contributions are paid by all public serviceemployees for their pension benefits rather than seeking to limitor reduce the value of those benefits.    This decision is fullyin line with the approach to these matters which we put forwardat the last election.      The principle underlying our proposalswill be that public service employees,  rather than the taxpayer,must bear the full cost of the extra benefits they enjoy ascompared to private sector practice.3- For the Civil Service we will replace the present mixture f salary reductions and widow&apos;s contributions by a fullycontributory scheme with special arrangements being made toavoid  &apos;windfall&apos;  benefits for existing- employees. Contributionsto the other public service schemes will be reviewed. Inaddition to these changes,  a special charge will be levied onall employees,  in schemes covered by the Pensions (Increase) Act.It will be set at the level necessary to recover in full theextra cost of index-linking in excess of average private sectorPractice and will be subject to regular review to ensure thisextra cost continues to be met.4- This new charge is provisionally and initially estimated tobe about 21  per cent of pay for most public servants and about3 Per cent for members of schemes in which full pensions accrueover less than 40 years,  such as the police,  fire and prisonservices.      As a result most non-manual public servants will paya Pension contribution of at least BJ per cent of salary.Members of the armed forces pay for their pensions under separatearrangements based on the recommendation of the Review Body onArmed Forces Payj    their contributions were increased to anadequate level last year and they will be excluded from ourProposals.      Subject to the necessary legislation receivingthe approval of Parliament,  we intend that the new scheme should- 1 -
