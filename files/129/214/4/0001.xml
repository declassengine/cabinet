ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1982INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the AnnualReview of the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdomagricultural industry. The Government will draw on this information, asappropriate, when considering proposals by the European Commission foragricultural support in 1982/83 and when decisions are taken on supportarrangements which remain within our national competence. As usual,these decisions will be announced separately. In most cases the forecasts for1981 were made in November 1981.PART I-STATE OF THE INDUSTRY2. Growing conditions in 1981 were far from ideal with a delayed wetspring followed by a dry summer, but good harvesting weather contributedto a cereals crop only slightly below the record of 1980. Net product atconstant prices, which measures in volume terms the contribution fromagriculture to the corresponding net national product, fell by 1% from therecord level of 1980. The average price paid for all the industry&apos;s inputsincreased by about 9% and the price of outputs increased by about 10%.The sum of farming income, net rent and interest is expected to rise by10% in 1981. Farming income alone is forecast to rise by 14% which, whendeflated by the Retail Price Index (RPI), represents a small rise comparedwith the low level in 1980 but in money terms is still lower than in each ofthe three years 1976-78. The volume of new fixed investment in the industryis expected to decrease by 21%.3. Cereals yields and quality were variable but production is expectedto be about 19.4 million tonnes, just below the record level of 1980.Production of oilseed rape increased by 7%. Plantings and yields of potatoeswere down. The sugar beet crop was expected to yield over one milliontonnes of white sugar for the fourth consecutive year. The area devoted tohorticultural crops declined again.4. The dairy herd was slightly smaller at June 1981 than a year earlierand milk production is expected to fall by nearly 1%. The beef herd fellby about 3\% and home production of beef is expected to be 6% lower thanin 1980. The sheep breeding flock continued to increase although productionof sheepmeat is expected to be lower than in 1980 which was an exceptionalyear. Pigmeat production is forecast to be at about the same level as 1980.Despite increased chick placings, poultrymeat and egg production declinedduring 1981.PART II-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 3)5. The decline in the number of farms in the United Kingdom continues.In 1981 the total number of holdings was about 242,300, some 5% lower thanin 1976.  The fall in numbers continued to be greatest among the smaller113781
full-time businesses. Half the total number of holdings have businessescapable of providing work for at least one full-time man (ie those of 250standard man-days or more) and these account for about 90% of totaloutput. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-days or more, whilst onlyabout 12% of the total number, accounted for some half the total output.In Northern Ireland and Wales the output of small-scale farmers is rathermore significant than in other parts of the United Kingdom.6. The average area (including rough grazings) of the full-time businessof 250 standard man-days or more has risen by about 6% since 1976 to119 hectares. With the exception of breeding sheep flocks the number ofenterprises continues to fall. However, the expansion in the size of individualenterprises continues. There has been an increase in the last five years inthe average area devoted to cereals from 32 to 38 hectares and an increaseof nearly 20% in the average area of sugar beet. In the same period, theaverage dairy herd increased by about 23% to 53 cows, and the averagesize of the ewe flock by about 9 % to 184. The average beef cow herd hasstabilised at 18 cows. Herd sizes in the pig sector have risen sharplybetween 1976 and 1981 with herds of breeding pigs having increased onaverage from 26 to 37 sows and fattening pigs up from 177 to 241.7. In Great Britain 66% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1981 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion ofagricultural land which is farmed by its owner has increased from 52% in1960/61 to 59% in 1981. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers areowner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 22)8. The index of net product at constant prices for 1981 is expected tofall slightly to 128 from the record level of 130 in 1980. This decrease is aresult of small reductions in output from a number of commodities, inparticular in the livestock sector. These reductions are expected to bepartly offset by continuing economies in the use of inputs.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and&apos;22)9. The index of labour productivity measures changes in grossagricultural product at constant prices, per person engaged. It reflectsimprovements in, for example, plant and animal breeding and in theorganisation of farming, the reduction in the number of persons engaged andshort-term movements in output caused by factors such as the weather.During the 10 years to 1980 the index increased on average by about 4%annually. After an increase of 12% in 1980 a rise of 1% is forecast for1981. This arises from a small decline in the level of output and a reductionin the labour force of just under 2%. The number of regular whole-timeworkers fell by nearly 4% in 1980 and a fall of 2\% is estimated for 1981compared with an annual average reduction of 4% in the 10 years to 1980.Farming income (Tables 21, 22 and 24)10. The sum of farming income, net rent and interest (which togetherinclude all the returns to the capital invested in the industry) is expected torise by 10% in 1981. Farming income alone declined by 10% in 1980 to 1,059 million; in 1981 it is forecast to increase by 14% to  1,209 million.2
Deflated by the RPI these figures represent a small rise following significantfalls in the previous four years. The increase in income in 1981 is due to acontinuing high level of production, high returns on some commodities andthe fact that the cost of all inputs has risen rather less than the value of sales.Interest payments on borrowings are expected to show little change between1980 and 1981.11. Further information is provided at the Annual Review from samplesof farm accounts which examine the financial position of farming analysedby size and type of farm and by country and region. The coverage andcertain of the concepts in this series differ from the aggregate calculation.No direct comparisons between the two series can therefore be made. Inparticular the farm accounts relate to full-time farms only; they do not coververy large farms (notably in the poultry sector); and the main analyses do notcover horticultural holdings. There are differences in the treatment of stockappreciation and valuations which can affect the year to which income fromindividual enterprises is attributed, and interest on farming loans is notdeducted. The sample accounts relate to a year ending, on average, inmid-February.12. Information from the farm accounts for 1980/81 (for the year endingon average in February 1981) indicates that changes in net income per farmvaried markedly between the farming types and countries. Incomes increasedthroughout the United Kingdom on specialist dairy farms but falls wererecorded on mainly dairy farms in Wales and Northern Ireland. Onlivestock farms in the Less Favoured Areas, incomes showed some furtherrecovery in the North of England, in Wales and on some farms in Scotlandfrom the bad year of 1979/80. But they declined further in the West ofEngland and fell to very low levels in Northern Ireland and on some farmtypes in Scotland. Incomes fell on lowland livestock farms in the West ofEngland, in Scotland and on those farms in England with significant croppingbut increased in other areas; incomes in 1980/81 on these farms remained lowin many areas. Incomes on general cropping farms fell throughout theUnited Kingdom and losses were recorded on average in Scotland, but onspecialist cereals farms in England increases were recorded except in theNorth.  There was some improvement in incomes on pig and poultry farms.13. Forecasts of the results for 1981/82 (for the year ending on averagein February 1982) made before the effects of the severe weather conditionscould be ascertained suggest that incomes will on average recoverfurther throughout the United Kingdom on all of the farming types althoughmarked variations in the pace of this recovery are expected. The largestproportionate increases are expected in Northern Ireland and in Scotlandwhere incomes in 1980/81 reached low levels on many farming types. Thevalue of output of most products is expected to increase, the largest risesbeing for potatoes, sheep and cattle; the expected increase in input costs,particularly for feedingstuffs and depreciation, is smaller on average thanin 1980/81. Incomes on dairy farms are expected generally to improve.Incomes on livestock rearing and fattening farms in the lowlands and onlivestock farms in the Less Favoured Areas are expected to show substantialimprovement reflecting the Community sheepmeat regime introduced inOctober 1980 and higher returns from cattle. Hill livestock producers willbenefit from the increase in hill cow compensatory allowance which appliedfrom January 1982.  But livestock losses and other costs arising from the3
severe winter will in some areas almost certainly have reduced the recoveryarising from these developments. Increases in incomes on general croppingfarms are expected to be greater on farms growing potatoes and inScotland and the North of England where the cereal harvest was good.The increase in incomes on specialist cereals farms in England is expectedto be small except in the North. Incomes on pig and poultry farms areexpected to show recovery in Northern Ireland and a modest increase inEngland. On nearly all of the farming types the income levels in 1981/82,though an improvement on 1980/81, are still expected to be below thosein 1978/79 in real terms except in Scotland where incomes were relativelydepressed in 1978/79.Price changes14. The price of outputs rose on average by about 10% between 1980and 1981 with increases of about 38% in the price of potatoes and 22% inthe price of sheep and lambs. The price of all inputs increased on averageby about 9% between 1980 and 1981. Within this total, prices of bought-ingoods and services showed a rise of about 10%.Gross capital formation (Table 19)15. It is estimated that the value of new investment will fall in 1981,with the industry&apos;s gross capital formation in fixed assets of  915 millionsome 14% lower than in 1980. Investment in buildings and works isexpected to be  475 million, a fall of 13% compared with the 1980 level,while investment in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to declineby 16% to  440 million. In volume terms, total gross fixed capital formationis expected to decline by 21% compared with the level in 1980. In volumeterms, new investment in buildings and works is forecast to decline byabout 23% and in plant, machinery and vehicles a fall of some 18% isexpected.16. A fall in stock appreciation combined with a net decrease in volume,caused partly by a substantial reduction in potato stocks, contributed toan estimated decrease of some 25% in the change in book value of stocksand work-in-progress. The total capital invested in breeding livestockis forecast to show a small decline in value and volume in 1981 followinglarger reductions in 1979 and 1980.Bank borrowings17. Bank advances outstanding to agriculture in 1981 are forecast toaverage about  3,400 million, some 20% higher than the average for 1980and about 50% greater than in 1979. Although the rise in borrowingsreflects some increase in loans for land purchase, it is considered to havebeen mainly for current farming purposes, including investment. The declinein the rate of growth in borrowings in 1981 is thought to reflect the lowerlevel of new investment.Agricultural land prices (Table 23)18. After rising considerably between 1975 and 1979, the price ofagricultural land in the United Kingdom has not subsequently shown aconsistent trend in either the different countries or the separate vacant4
possession and tenanted markets. Information from the comprehensiveInland Revenue series indicates that the average price per hectare ofagricultural land sold with vacant possession in 1980 was  3,470 in England, 2,326 in Wales,  1,830 in Scotland and  3,227 in Northern Ireland. Themore up-to-date but less comprehensive Current Agricultural Land Pricesseries, which covers England and Wales only, indicates that vacant possessionsale prices in 1981 were broadly at 1980 levels.Farm rents (Table 23)19. On the basis of the provisional results of the ADAS Annual RentEnquiry in England and Wales and of continuing field surveys in Scotlandaverage farm rents in the United Kingdom are forecast to have increased by13.9% in 1981. Tins compares with an increase of 17.1% in 1980.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)20. The average weekly earnings of whole-time hired men in theUnited Kingdom averaged  85.95 for 45.7 hours in the calendar year 1980compared with  71.75 for 46.2 hours in the calendar year 1979. Thisrepresents an increase of nearly 20% in money terms and 1 % in realterms. Average earnings in 1981 are forecast to be about  96.70 for 46.1hours, an increase of about 12 % in money terms or about \% in realterms. The statutory minimum weekly wage rates were increased by 10%for whole-time hired workers in England and Wales from 21 January 1982,by just over 8% for general workers in Scotland from 8 February 1982 andby 10% for agricultural workers in Northern Ireland from 1 February 1982.Public expenditure (Table 25)21. Expenditure by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produceunder the common market organisation of the European Community isestimated to be about  665 million in 1981/82 compared with some  603million in 1980/81. This expenditure includes the Butter and School MilkSubsidies, the Beef and Sheepmeat Variable Premium Schemes, import andexport refunds (net of levies), certain production subsidies, aids to animalfeeds, aids to private storage and the net costs of commodities bought intointervention and subsequently sold. Some of this expenditure benefitsconsumers and trade interests rather than producers. The additional expen-diture in 1981/82 arises mainly from the payment of arrears of exportrestitutions on grain used in whisky, payments under the Sheepmeat VariablePremium Scheme for a full year and increased purchases into intervention ofskimmed milk powder. These increases are partly offset by reducedexpenditure on the Beef Variable Premium Scheme, by the lower net costof cereals and beef intervention and by increased receipts from the co-responsibility levy on milk producers.22. In 1981/82 the estimated out-turn for expenditure in the UnitedKingdom by the Agricultural Departments on price guarantees, grants andsubsidies (excluding the brucellosis incentive payments and horticulturalprotected crops adaptation aid) is  374 million. This compares with actualexpenditure of  409 million in 1980/81, including  33 million on the priceguarantee arrangements for sheep which were superseded by the EuropeanCommunity Sheepmeat regime on 20 October 1980.23. A breakdown of expenditure by scheme and commodity is set out inTable 25.5
PART III-COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5, 7 and 26)24. In 1981 cereals were grown on some 3.99 million hectares, anincrease of 0.05 million hectares over 1980. The increased area came almostentirely from increased sowings of wheat. Yields and quality were aroundor below 1980 levels in most cases, except in northern England andScotland where yields for barley were significantly higher than in 1980.Production reached about 19.4 million tonnes, just below the record of19.5 million tonnes in 1980. Due to the large 1980 crop, prices were lowrelative to support levels at the start of 1981, but thereafter wheat pricessteadily strengthened. Since the start of the new crop year, prices havegenerally been rather higher relative to support levels than during the sameperiod of 1980, due to a high level of exports early in the season, andless has been sold into intervention. The sowing of winter cereals wasdelayed by wet weather in the early autumn of 1981.Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 26)25. The area sown to oilseed rape increased by about 35% to 124,500hectares. Since the exceptional yields of 1980 were not matched in 1981,production is expected to rise by only 7% to a new record level of 320,000tonnes in 1981. Production is likely to increase substantially in 1982. Theaverage price of the crop improved again in 1981.Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 26)26. Plantings in 1981 were some 9,000 hectares less than the UnitedKingdom target area of 199,000 hectares. Planting and growing conditionswere not ideal with the result that yields were well down on the record levelsof 1980 when over 600,000 tonnes of surplus potatoes were removed fromthe market. Prices were significantly higher than in 1980. The PotatoMarketing Board was again authorised to offer contracts to producers inGreat Britain for a proportion of their crop with the aim of ensuringstability in the market throughout the season. 213,000 tonnes of potatoeswere placed under contract in this way.27. Discussions on future support arrangements are continuing, takingaccount of the prospects for an agreement on a Community regime forpotatoes.Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5, 10 and 26)28. In 1981 the British Sugar Corporation (BSC) contracted to purchasesugar beet from 212,000 hectares compared with 215,000 hectares in 1980.Weather during the growing season was not very favourable: the dry spellin the summer followed by heavy rainfall produced a crop of high rootweight but correspondingly low sugar content. Nonetheless, the crop shouldyield over a million tonnes of white sugar for the fourth consecutive year.The 1982 contract provides for a price of  2.56 per tonne above theminimum beet price to be determined at the Community price-fixingsettlement for 1982.6
Horticulture (Tables 2, 5, 11 and 26)29. It is not possible to deal individually with the whole range ofhorticultural crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom. Theseparagraphs concentrate on crops in significant production including thosesubject to Community arrangements (apples, pears, cauliflowers andtomatoes).30. The area devoted to horticulture in 1981 was about 253,000hectares compared with 270,000 hectares in 1980. This reduction followsthe trend of recent years.31. Production of dessert apples and pears in the 1981 growing seasonwas less than in 1980 owing to the cold and wet conditions prevailing inJune and early July. Moreover, the high proportion of ageing orchardsreduced the yield of good quality apples. Production of cooking apples waslittle more than half the 1980 level. Production of vegetables and soft fruit,particularly the mid- and late-season strawberry crop, was reasonably goodin 1981.32. The 1980/81 over-wintered cauliflower crop survived well and qualitywas good. The delayed wet spring caused widespread problems with theearly summer crop. The autumn crop benefited from better weather inlate July and August although summer crops maturing in this period sufferedin quality.  Overall production was similar to 1980.33. Protected crops were delayed by unseasonably cold weather in thespring and early summer of 1981. As a consequence a greater weight ofmarketings coincided with the flow of imports from the Netherlands. Overall,yields and production of tomatoes were a little higher in 1981 on a slightlyincreased area, offsetting a slight fall in the yield of the early-planted long-season crop.34. Prices of apples and pears were higher in 1981, especially for thenew season&apos;s supplies marketed from August, but competition from importsof dessert apples remained strong. Withdrawals of 1981 season apples areexpected to be negligible. Wholesale prices of cauliflowers were on averageappreciably higher than in 1980. Growers of protected crops suffered lowreturns in 1981. Costs of heating oil rose substantially and tomato growersfaced strong competition from imports from the Netherlands. Prices fortomatoes for the season as a whole were lower than in 1980. Cut flowershad a poor year: weak demand kept prices down to levels similar to thoseof 1980. Government aid worth about  5.5 million was made available in1981 to help growers of protected crops to meet the increased costs of heatingoil and similar aid, worth about  4 million, will be available for 1982.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 26)35. The area under hops was about the same as in 1980. Productionfell slightly but the quality of the crop was higher. Average prices in 1981were significantly above the levels of 1980.Seeds (Table 13)36. The area approved in 1981 for production of certified herbageand legume seed (excluding field bean and field pea seed) was down on1980.  This trend is expected to continue.  With yields average to good,137817c*
production was lower. Very high stocks were reduced by increased exportsbut were still more than adequate to meet demand. Prices to growers weregenerally down in real terms.37. While there has been little or no change in the area of the fieldpea and bean crops, there has been a further increase in the proportionapproved for production of certified seed. Seed production continues far inexcess of requirements for sowing and the surplus goes to export and othermarkets.Beef and Milk (Tables 2, 5, 14, 15, 16 and 26)38. The June 1981 census showed a decline of about \\% in the totalUnited Kingdom cattle breeding herd compared with the previous year. Thedairy herd, which accounts for almost 70% of all breeding cows, declinedby \%. The beef herd fell by about 3 %, although a somewhat largerdecline was experienced in Northern Ireland. A further slight fall isexpected in 1982. The size of the national dairy herd in 1982 is expected toremain at about the same level as in 1981.39. Home production of beef in 1981 is estimated to be 6% lowerthan in 1980. Exports are expected to fall by about 30% and imports by3% leaving total supplies of beef about 2% lower than in 1980. Supplies in1982 are likely to be only slightly lower than in 1981. Average marketprices for fat cattle rose from a low point of 80.22p/live kg in January toreach a mid-summer peak of 94.19p/live kg in June, considerably above thelevels reached in 1980. Variable premiums were paid at moderate levels inJuly and August, but the maximum allowable level of 7.32p/live kg was notreached except in Northern Ireland at the beginning of January. Pricesimproved sharply in the autumn to reach even higher levels before the endof the year. Intervention took place, reaching a level of 680 tonnes perweek throughout October, although predominantly in Northern Ireland.Total purchases for January to October 1981 were some 12,000 tonnes,around 1% of total supplies.40. The average yield of milk per cow in 1981 is expected to be slightlybelow that in 1980 largely due to the poor weather in the spring of 1981.As a result of this and the slight fall in the size of the national dairy herd,milk production for the year as a whole is expected to show a decrease ofnearly 1%. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption in 1981 isexpected to fall by 1.4% but, because of the fall in total production, thereis likely to be little change in the volume of milk available for manufacturing.Milk used for cheese production in 1981 is expected to increase by about1% over 1980, and milk used for butter production to remain at about thesame level.41. Producer returns for milk are determined by the Milk MarketingBoards on the basis of their returns from the liquid and manufacturing milkmarkets. The Boards&apos; net returns from all milk for the 1981/82 year areexpected to be between 15.0 ppl and 15.5 ppl after taking into accountthe increase in the retail price of liquid milk of l^p per pint from 10 January1982 and the implementation of the Binder Hamlyn recommendations onthe distributive costings system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The net returns to the Northern Ireland Board are expected to be about1 ppl lower. In Scotland, where the production trends and market structure8
differ markedly from those elsewhere in the United Kingdom, retail milkprices have been free to move in line with market conditions since theremoval of controls on 1 October 1981.Sheep and Wool (Tables 2, 14, 18 and 26)42. The breeding flock increased by nearly 3% between June 1980 andJune 1981 and a similar increase is expected in 1982.43. Home production of sheepmeat is expected to be about 4J% lowerin 1981 than in 1980, when conditions were exceptionally good. Totalsupplies to the market are expected to fall by about 8% with a decline inimports of about 14% and in exports of about 11%. The average level ofprices was about 20% above that of 1980. Producer returns rose evenmore with a guaranteed price about 26% higher on average than before theintroduction of the Community&apos;s sheepmeat regime in October 1980. SheepVariable Premium was paid through most of the year and the first paymentsof annual ewe premium were made in September. Average prices for storelambs and draft ewes were around 20% higher than in 1980.44. Wool production rose by about 1% in 1981. The guaranteed priceremained at its 1980 level but final payments to producers are expected tobe lower than in 1980 because of an increased deduction for marketing costsby the British Wool Marketing Board. Average market prices for the 1981clip are expected to remain below the guaranteed price. Exchequer advancesto the Board continued.Pigs (Tables 2, 14 and 26)45. Pigmeat production in 1981 was expected to be about the samelevel as 1980. Some increase is expected in 1982 to reflect the modestincrease in the breeding herd that occurred in 1981. Breeding herd levels in1982 are expected to remain about the same as in 1981. Prices of pigmeatin 1981 were overall some 6% above the level of 1980.Poulfrymeat (Tables 2, 14 and 26)46. Following a decline in placings in the latter part of 1980 andearly 1981, total placings for poultrymeat production increased from Juneand the upward trend is expected to continue into 1982. Output for 1981was expected to be somewhat lower than in 1980 while some increase isexpected in 1982. Imports were at fairly high levels in the first half of theyear but were significantly reduced from September, following the change toa slaughter policy instead of vaccination for Newcastle Disease, necessitatinga ban on imports from countries pursuing a vaccination policy. Althoughthere was some increase in prices in the latter part of 1981, mainly forbroilers, prices for the year as a whole were expected to be similar to thelevels of 1980.Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 26)47. Despite increased chick placings since April 1981, output for 1981as a whole was expected to be marginally below the level of 1980. A slightincrease in production is expected in 1982.   Imports were at fairly high913781 c*2
levels in the first half of 1981 but as in the poultrymeat sector weresignificantly reduced from September. Producer returns were low for muchof 1981 but have improved in recent months. For the year as a whole,prices are expected to be some 3p per dozen higher than in 1980, but withinthis overall increase prices in Northern Ireland are expected to fall.10
APPENDIXSTATISTICAL TABLESThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper except thatthe &quot; net income &quot; series is no longer presented in Table 22. This series has been discontinuedfollowing the introduction for the 1981 Review of the new &quot; farming income &quot; series.Even where there has been no change in the basis of the tables, some of the figures inthis appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of laterinformation, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statisticalmethods. The forecasts for 1981 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year,as seen at November 1981. They may be less precise than usual owing to delay in theprovision of certain data. Since Overseas Trade Statistics (from which are derived theannual import and export figures in the tables) were not available for most months of the year,forecasts of imports and exports in 1981 have not been included unless consistent informationfrom alternative sources was available to provide a basis for estimation.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Nine relate throughout to the other countriesof the European Community (Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France,Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables. Figuresfor exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:- means &quot; nil&quot;... means &quot; negligible &quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot; not available &quot; or &quot; not applicable &quot;.11

Table 2 {continued)(a) The data in this table vary between the different countries as follows:-England and Wales: For all years the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings including statisticallyinsignificant holdings.Scotland: The figures for 1970 to 1972 relate to agricultural holdings with a labour requirement of 26standard man-days or more. (A standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours* productive work by anadult worker under average conditions.) The raising of the threshold from 26 to 40 smd in 1973 resultedin the exclusion of some 5 000 statistically insignificant holdings and in 1977 a further 1 700 holdings wereexcluded. Since then the Scottish figures relate to all known agricultural holdings with 40 smd or more.Northern Ireland: The figures for 1970 to 1972 relate to holdings of 0.4 hectares (one acre) or more andin the case of livestock to all owners of livestock. From 1973 to 1980 the figures relate to all holdingswith (i) 40 smd or more, or (ii) 4 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more regular full-time workers(excluding the owner). The change between 1972 and 1973 resulted in the net deletion of some 6 000holdings. The figures for 1981 relate to all holdings with: (i) one European Size Unit (ESU) or more(see footnote (b) to Table 24), or (ii) 6 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more full-time workers(excluding the owner). This change between 1980 and 1981 resulted in the deletion of a further 7 000holdings but their exclusion has had an insignificant effect on the cropping and stocking figures.(b) Cereals for threshing, excluding maize.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.((/) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.(./&apos; &gt; Includes area of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(.!.-) Includes lucerne.(h) Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales-&quot; clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses &quot;;In Scotland -&quot; grass under 7 years oldIn Northern Ireland  -&quot; grass Ist, 2nd and 3rd year(/) Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales-&quot; permanent grass &quot;;In Scotland -&quot; grass 7 years old and over &quot;;In Northern Ireland  -&quot; grass 4th year or older(j) Returns of &quot; other land &quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June1969 to June 1973 &quot; other land *&apos; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards,buildings, etc., the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included landwithin agricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not usedfor agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other landforming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land. The NorthernIreland definition is unchanged.1378115D*

The figures for 1976, however, havebeen adjusted to take account of the reappraisal of SI holdings in England and Wales which resulted in afurther II 000 holdings being removed from the June 1980 census. The removal of some 6 700 very smallholdings from the census in Northern Ireland between June 1980 and June 1981 (see note (a) to Table 2)has no significant effect on this Table. The Northern Ireland figures in the first two sections of the Tableinclude only holdings with 50 smd or more which were slightly affected by the change, as were the quantitiesof crops and stock in the other sections of the Table. The decline in the total number of holdings is reflectedin the smallest size group and has marginally increased the average size of some enterprises.Caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with those quoted in recent White Papers and in particularwith figures in White Papers published prior to the 1978 Review when results were based on imperial measure-ments and old smd values.(b) The average size of holdings based on total area was:1976 69.6 hectares of which 67.3% was under crops and grass.1981   72.5 hectares of which 67.8 % was under crops and grass.(c) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass which are excluded from the first section of the Table.(d) With the introduction of revised smd values for the 1978 Annual Review the figures shown in this Table areonly comparable with those in the White Papers for 1978 onwards (but see note (a) above).(&lt;?)  Figures relate to England and Wales only.(/) Figures included for Scotland relate to December censuses in 1975 and 1980 and for Northern Ireland to theDecember 1975 and June 1981 censuses.(g) Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to pig holdings which had fattening pigs only.(/ ) Figures for Scotland, and figures for Northern Ireland in 1981 only, include small numbers of other tablefowls.18

Prior to 1977 the figures do not include the wives/husbandsof farmers, partners and directors, even though the wives/husbands themselves may be partners or directors.In 1977 wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors were returned separately, but only if they wereengaged in farm work.Figures include estimates for all statistically insignificant holdings in England and Wales not surveyed inthe respective June censuses (see footnote (a) to Table 2).(b) Figures relate to Great Britain only.(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland.   See footnote (d).(d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item in Northern Ireland, but wereincluded with part-time workers.(e) The decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers in 1977 is thought to beexplained by the separate return, for the first time in England and Wales, of farmers&apos; wives, some of whomwere probably returned previously as family workers.19

In addition, the scries shown for Scotland refer to equipped farmsonly and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation and inter-family sales.There is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed and the date on which it is included in the series.The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months in England and Wales and about 3 months in NorthernIreland. The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included in the seriesfor these countries in the years ending in the following September and March respectively. The data forScotland and Northern Ireland are subject to retrospective revision.(b) The indices of average rents for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotlandon continuing field enquiries.   In Northern Ireland very little land is rented except under the conacre system.(c) The figures for the most recent years arc subject to revision as detailed below:Agricultural Land PricesScotland: figures for the most recent years are based on sales notified up to September 1981.Northern Ireland: figures for the most recent years are based on sales notified up to September 1981.The 1981 figure relates to prices in the first six months of the year.Average RentsAll countries: 1981 figures are provisional.39

Table 24 (continued)(a) This scries is derived from figures collected in Farm Management Surveys by Universities and AgriculturalColleges in Great Britain and by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. The figures are averagesweighted by the census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. Moredetailed figures for England will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England 1980-81 &quot;, for Scotland in&quot; Economic Report on Scottish Agriculture 1981 for Wales in the &quot; Welsh Agricultural Statistics 1980-81Supplement&quot; and for Northern Ireland in a report by the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.Net income is the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and the returnon tenant-type capital in crops, livestock, machinery, etc., but excluding land and buildings. It is calculatedbefore deduction of interest on any farming loans. All farms are treated as rented and an imputed rentalvalue for owner-occupied land is charged as an expense in the accounts. Stocks of crops and livestock onfarms at the beginning and end of the accounting year are valued at current market prices and net incomeincludes stock appreciation except that arising on breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. The accounts relatemainly to calendar years or years ending 5 April and the average year-ending date is about mid-February.(b) Based on standard gross margins per unit of crop area and per head of livestock, measured in EuropeanSize Units (ESU) with 1 ESU equalling 1 000 European units of account of standard gross margins at average1972-1974 values.   See Commission Decision 78/463/EEC.(c) Includes &quot; lowland cattle and sheep &quot; and &quot; lowland cropping, cattle and sheep &quot; farm types.(d) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannotbe imputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings havebeen assessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paidhave been included. For these reasons tho average net incomes per farm arc not on the same basis as thosefor Great Britain.(&lt;0 4 to 15.9 ESU.(/) Provisional.Table 25Public expenditure under the common agricultural policy (CAP) and onnational grants and subsidies (a)April/March (financial) years   million	1977/78	1978/79	1979/80	1980/81	1981/82		(b)	O)		(forecast)I Price guarantees and production					grants					(i) Price guarantees (c)					Sheep (d) ......	0.4	0.1	11.1	32.9	Wool (e) ......	-2.2	_	_	3.9	8.5Potatoes (e)......	9.1	23.0	5.7	8.7	9.9Total (i)......	7.3	23.1	16.7	45.5	18.4(ii) Production grants and sub-					sidies					Dairy    Herd Conversion					Scheme ......	5.6	3.4		_	_Guidance Premiums	7.4	10.1	111	10.2	7.1Milk Non-Marketing Prem-					iums ......	2.1	7.1	15.8	30.5	24.7Suckler     Cow Premium					Scheme ......	_	_	_	14.6	20.5Annual Premium on Ewes ..	-	_	_		28.5Lime........	0.1	__	_	_,	Calves........	22.8	6.8	_		Beef cows	2.7		_	_	Pig subsidy......	10.6	-	-	-	-Total (ii)......	51.3	27.4	29.0	55.3	80.8Total I......	58.6	50.5	45.7	100.8	99.241

Table 25 (continued)(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by theexpenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease and pest control or on research, advice and education).Expenditure on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund, is alsoexcluded. It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and trade interests ratherthan producers. The figures for years up to and including 1979-80 represent actual expenditure recordedin the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1980-81 are subject to confirmation and those for 1981-82arc the latest estimates of expenditure.(b) Expenditure in 1979-80 includes payments which were due in 1978-79 but were delayed by industrial action.(c) Excludes payments for milk which have been attributed to the food subsidies programme,(J) Price guarantee arrangements for sheep were superseded by the EC sheepmeat regime on 20 October 1980.(c) Payments in respect of wool and potatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated and partlyto the clip or crop in the preceding year or years. The negative figure rctlccts the arrangements with theBritish Wool Marketing Board, whereby deficiency payments made by the Exchequer are repayable fromsurpluses (excess of market price over guaranteed price) up to the amount of debt owing by the Board toMinisters.(/) Includes the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.(s) Includes the Farm and Horticulture Capital Grant Schemes.(/;) Farmers in special areas arc also eligible for additional assistance under the Agriculture and HorticultureDevelopment Scheme and the Agriculture and Horticulture Grant Scheme. The estimated benefit is shownseparately in Section III of the table.( j ) Includes grants in respect of investment on loan guarantees*, farm structure loans*, producer organisations*,horticultural improvements, small horticultural production businesses, agricultural drainage*, specialassistance to livestock producers and milk pasteurisation equipment*. (Provision for the schemes marked *was included in the 1981-82 Supply Estimates.)(k) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads, forage groups*, producersin the Scottish Islands and crofting improvements*. (Provision for the schemes marked * was includedin the 1981-82 Supply Estimates.)(/) The expenditure in Section IV is that administered by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce:expenditure on the suckler cow premium scheme, the annual premium on ewes and on the milk non-marketingpremiums is administered by the Agricultural Departments and is shown in Section I(ii). The figures shownare total expenditure before allowing for receipts from EAGGF which are shown separately at the foot ofthe table. The figures are made up of several elements and include refunds and levies on intra-Communitytrade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beef premium and sheep variable premiumschemes, aid for private storage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the net cost of commoditiesbought into intervention and subsequently sold. The figures also take account of certain receipts treatedas negative expenditure, namely monetary compensatory amounts levied on intra-Community trade andthe co-responsibility levy on milk producers. The figures for 1977-78 onwards include the EC butter subsidyand those for 1978-79 onwards the UK share of the EC school milk subsidy scheme.(m) Includes eggs, poultrymcat, fruit and vegetables, hops, herbage seeds, dehydrated fodder, peas and beans,fisheries, flax and aid to beekeepers. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but notproduced to any significant extent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine, grapemust and hemp).43
