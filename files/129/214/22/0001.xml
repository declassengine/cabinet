CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 2210 May 1982 COPY NCCABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1982-83Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department*?. On 22 April the Cabinet considered the recommendations of TheQueen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) on the legislativeProgramme for 1982-83, and invited me to arrange for the proposedProgramme to be reviewed by the Committee in the light of the points madem discussion (C(82) 19th Conclusions, Minute 6).    The Committee met on4 May, and their revised recommendations are set out in the Annexes to thisMemorandum.2. The Committee decided to recommend that the Data Protection Billshould not be included in the programme.    They took into account theindustrial and commercial arguments put forward by the Secretaries of State&apos;or Trade and for Industry for legislating next Session, but noted that it washighly improbable that a Bill could be ready for Second Reading beforeChristmas,    It would give rise to discussion of highly controversial relatedrnatters such as freedom of information, and, given the likely attitude of theOpposition during the last full Session of this Parliament, there could b no guarantee that the Bill could be passed by the Summer Recess in 1983,It would be damaging in both political and industrial terms to introduce theBill and then fail to carry it before the General Election.The Committee were told that the measures on gas safety which are anecessary preliminary to the disposal of the retailing interests of the BritishGas Corporation could almost certainly be covered by regulations under theHealth and Safety at Work Act, though with a rather smaller saving in CivilService manpower than if the changes were made by means of primarylegislation.    They therefore recommend the deletion of the Gas Safety Billfrom the proposed programme.4  The main purpose of the Dock Work Regulation Bill would be torelieve the Secretary of State for Employment of the statutory requirement tobring forward a new dock labour scheme.    The current threat of industrialaction by the Transport and General Workers Union in support of an extension f the existing scheme raises the question whether it would now be wise torisk a further confrontation by introducing the Bill in the last full Session ofthis Parliament.    Its inclusion in the programme may need to be consideredlater in the light of the situation at the time.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The Secretary of State for Education and Science has not yet resolvedhis policy differences with the Treasury on the content of the FurtherEducation Bill.    The matter is to be considered again by the Home andSocial Affairs Committee in the near future.    QL recommend th ;t the Billshould remain in the programme for the moment, but that it should bedropped if policy agreement cannot be reached at the next meeting ofH Committee.6. The policy on the Telecommunications Bill is still far from settled,but the Bill would be by far the most important privatisation measure in thenext programme, and the Committee recommend that it should stay in theProgramme on conditio:, that it is ready for introduction at the beginning ofthe Session.7. The Committee agree that the actual or potential savings which theyhave identified give greater scope for the inclusion of a wider Water Billwhich would deal both with the borrowing limits of the industry and with theabolition of the National Water Council and changes in the membership of theregional water authorities.    They were grateful to the Secretary of State forthe Environment for his suggestion that room might be made for the extendedBill by combining his Mobile Homes Bill and Housing and Building ControlBill, but took the view that this would not lead to a significant saving inParliamentary time and that it would be better to keep the two Bills separate.They recommend, however, that his offer to delete from the latter Bill theproposed provisions on assignment of local authority mortgages to the privatesector, housing association rent phasing arrangements, and minor changes inhousing law should be accepted;  the Bill would then be confined to extensionof the right to buy and the building control provisions.8. *^he Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is now willing toagree to the addition to the Scottish programme of the Agricultural Holdings(Scotland) Bill on the condition, which the Secretary of State for Scotlandaccepts, that no announcement will be made of our intentions in advance ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech.    This will help him to resist pressure from the CountryLandowners&apos; Association and the National Farmers Union to give a commit-ment to bring forward early legislation on agricultural tenure in England andWales.9. The Cabinet agreed that the Health and Social Services Bill shouldinclude provisions to withdraw supplementary benefit from 14 year olds andto abolish child dependency additions.    This would mean that the Bill wouldno longer be the generally welcome social measure originally envisaged byQL and would not be suitable for Lords introduction.    After further considera-tion, QL now recommend that the additional provisions should go into a shortseparate (but highly controversial) Social Security Bill.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALln.       Since CL made their initial recommendations, it has emerged thatlegislation will be needed to implement the announced decision to write downthe National Voluntary Severance Scheme (NVSS) debt of  22 million. TheSecretary of State for Transport would be prepared to see the necessaryprovisions added to any Bill which it is decided to bring forward on transportfinance.    There is no firm place in the proposed programme for such a Billat the moment (though I have added it to the contingent list), and if for anyreason it failed to materialise some other way of dealing with the NVSS debtwould have to be found.11. The Committee do not consider that the arguments for the Royal ,Ordnance Factories Bil1 are sufficiently strong to justify its inclusion as anaddition to the programme, but they recommend that its position might beconsidered if further time unexpectedly becomes available at a later stage.12. I invite colleagues to approve the revised recommendations for thelegislative programme for 1982-83 as set out in the attached Annexes.W WHome Office6 May 19823CONFIDENTIAL
