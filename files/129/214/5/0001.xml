SECTION I: INTRODUCTION1.1 This White Paper covers the period of the United KingdomPresidency of the Council of Ministers, from 1 July to 31 December 1981.The Government&apos;s hopes for this period and how they were realised, aresummarised in the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s speeches to theEuropean Parliament of 8 July and 17 December, and are printed at Annex F.1.2 The Presidency maintained close links with the institutions of theEuropean Community (EC) and developed effective relations with theEuropean Parliament in particular. On 16 December, the Prime Ministerattended the Parliament to give an account of the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil on 26-27 November at Lancaster House, the first time the Head ofGovernment of the Member State holding the Presidency had done so. Herspeech is at Annex E.1.3 A major preoccupation at the European Council, and indeedthroughout the United Kingdom Presidency, was the Commission&apos;s reportof 24 June 1981 on the restructuring of the Community Budget which hadbeen produced in response to the Mandate from the Council of 30 May 1980.There were intensive discussions on the development of Community policiesand the measures needed to deal with the Community&apos;s budgetary problems.Some progress was made when guidelines for a solution were discussed at theEuropean Council, and provisional agreement was reached subject to theresolution of four key issues. A special meeting of Foreign Ministers on14-15 December further clarified these issues.1.4 The Agriculture Council agreed on the desirability of looking at thefuture development of Community agriculture against the medium termprospects for production and consumption. The importance of making astart on the work needed to secure a firmer grip on the problem of state aidsin the agriculture sector was impressed on the Council and the Commission.Discussion of the future development of the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP) was pursued in the context of the negotiations on the 30 MayMandate. A good start was made to the discussions on the changes neededto the fruit, vegetables, olive oil and wine regimes in the context ofenlargement.1.5 The Fisheries Council made progress towards a settlement of therevised Common Fisheries Policy. In particular, agreement in principle wasreached on a revised marketing regime, and the EEC/Canada agreementwas approved and ratified. Agreement was also reached on the renewal ofthe interim scheme of grant aid for inshore fishing vessels and aquaculture,on guide prices for 1982 and on reciprocal fishing arrangements with Faroeand Sweden. Considerable progress was made on a draft regulation forCommunity wide control and enforcement of fisheries measures.1.6 In the field of environmental protection the efforts of the UnitedKingdom Presidency focussed on the Council of Environment Ministers inDecember, which made useful progress on a wide range of issues. Agreementwas reached on two important proposals: the draft directive on majoraccident hazards and the draft directive on discharges of mercury to water.513831
1.7 The United Kingdom Presidency laid emphasis on the need to makemore of a reality of the single market for goods and services followingagreement at the June European Council that a concerted effort must bemade to strengthen and develop the internal market. The Governmentattached great importance to the discussion of Community air fares.Following a United Kingdom initiative the Commission produced a reportand draft directive. Discussion also continued throughout the Presidencyon the liberalisation of intra-Community regional air services.1.8 In the energy sector the central objective remained the restructuringof energy economies away from oil imports and oil use. Economic energypricing had a key role to play in this process; and in December the Counciladopted Conclusions to develop Community pricing principles and to put inhand further work to improve price transparency and the consistency ofenergy pricing policies.1.9 Foreign Ministers of the Ten had frequent discussions on all majorforeign policy questions including the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Poland.They had a successful meeting with their opposite numbers from theAssociation of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Ministers also agreedthe London Report on European Political Co-operation.1.10 Serious concern about the Community&apos;s trade relations with Japancontinued to grow. The Foreign Affairs Council in December approved aCommission list of requests for action by Japan aimed at improving theCommunity&apos;s balance of trade with Japan. The list was formally presented tothe Japanese Government.1.11 Under the United Kingdom Presidency the Community reached acommon negotiating position on proposals for changing the InternationalArrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits (theConsensus). This paved the way for an interim agreement by all 22Consensus members and averted the immediate risk of a damaging credit racebetween the Community countries, the United States and Japan.1.12 Intensive negotiations continued with both Portugal and Spainconcerning their accession to the Community and significant progress wasmade in a number of areas. The European Council on 27 Novemberemphasised the Community&apos;s determination to bring the negotiations to asuccessful conclusion.1.13 A protocol extending the Multifibre Arrangement was adopted bythe GATT Textiles Committee. The Commission stated that they wouldrecommend conditional acceptance of the protocol to the Council earlyin 1982.SECTION II: THE 30 MAY MANDATERestructuring the Community Budget2.1 The Commission&apos;s Report of 24 June on the Mandate given to it bythe Foreign Affairs Council on 30 May 1980, was the starting point for anintensive series of discussions under the British Presidency on the basisagreed by the European Council on 29-30 June.   The discussion of the6
Report covered three main areas: the development of non-agriculturalpolicies, reform of the CAP, and the problem of excessive net contributionsto the budget by Member States.2.2 In July, special meetings of the Committee of PermanentRepresentatives were held to clarify points in the Report and, in the light ofthis work, the September Foreign Affairs Council (which had been asked bythe June European Council to work on this subject in preparation for theirNovember meeting) had a full discussion of the issues and agreed to set up aspecial Mandate Group, consisting of one representative of Ambassadorialrank from each Member State. The Mandate Group held weeklymeetings in the course of which it had thorough discussions of each of thethree areas of the Mandate. On 19 October the Agriculture and FinanceCouncils had general orientation debates on the CAP and financial aspectsof the Mandate respectively, and the Foreign Affairs Council held anotherfull discussion of all the issues on 26-27 October.2.3 Discussion thereafter concentrated on preparation for the EuropeanCouncil. The Mandate Group drew up a report for discussion at theNovember meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. During this meeting whichdevoted a full day and a half to the Mandate, the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary accompanied by the President of the Commission, had bilateralmeetings with each of his counterparts to discuss the key issues for eachMember State and to try to find a way forward. A further special Councilmeeting was held on 19 November.2.4 The European Council on 26-27 November devoted much of itstime to the Mandate (see Annex E) and reached provisional agreement onguidelines subject to resolution of four outstanding issues. These issues were :milk policy, Mediterranean agriculture, a financial guideline for CAPexpenditure and the problem of unacceptable budgetary situations. ForeignMinisters continued discussions on these issues at an informal meeting on14-15 December in London and although they did not reach agreement, theymade further progress. They had a particularly thorough discussion of thebudgetary issue, on which there was general agreement that the UnitedKingdom faced a problem which should be corrected but not on how tocorrect it. They agreed to meet early in January under Belgian Presidencyto consider the four issues again on the basis of new texts to be produced bythe President of the Commission.SECTION III: POLITICAL CO-OPERATIONImprovements in Political Co-operation3.1 On 13 October Foreign Ministers of the Ten agreed theLondon Report on European Political Co-operation. This embodies astronger political commitment and improved machinery, including theestablishment of a small team of officials seconded from preceding andsucceeding Presidencies to assist the Presidency, and new crisis procedures.It also reflects the increasingly close relation between Political Co-operationand the Community by establishing that the Commission will be fullyassociated with Political Co-operation.   This follows the experience which713831 b*2
the Ten have gained in situations such as Poland where the political andeconomic factors are closely inter-related. This Report also gives increasedemphasis to contacts between the Ten and third countries.East/West Relations3.2 The Ten maintained their close co-operation in the field of East/West relations and remain committed to the search for a peaceful solutionto international problems. The European Council agreed on the need tokeep channels of East/West communication between governments open atall times, and welcomed the reaffirmation of the United States&apos; commitmentin President Reagan&apos;s speech of 18 November to the goal of majordisarmament by means of mutual reductions in nuclear and conventionalforces and confidence building measures in Europe.Poland3.3 The Ten paid particular attention to the situation in Poland. Attheir meeting on 15 December, Foreign Ministers of the Ten expressedtheir concern at the development of the situation in Poland, at the impositionof martial law and the detention of trade unionists. They expressed theirprofound sympathy for the Polish people in this tense and difficult time, andlooked to all signatory states of the Helsinki Final Act to refrain from anyinterference in the internal affairs of the Polish People&apos;s Republic. Theylooked to Poland to solve these problems herself and without the use of forceso that the process of reform and renewal could continue. The Ten havemade their views clear to the Soviet Government and the Russians can be inno doubt that direct intervention would have grave consequences for theirrelations with the Ten and for East/West and international relationsgenerally.Afghanistan3.4 The Ten continued to make clear their view that the Sovietoccupation of Afghanistan has damaged international trust and confidence.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, in his capacity as President-in-office, went to Moscow on 6 July to present the European Council&apos;s proposalsfor a two-stage international conference on Afghanistan to the SovietGovernment on behalf of the Ten. The Soviet reaction, however, wasdisappointingly negative. Lord Carrington subsequently met Mr. Gromykoin New York on 22 September for a further discussion of the proposals,and it became apparent that the Russians still had no intention either ofwithdrawing until resistance ends or of allowing the Afghan people to havea government of their own choice. The Ten&apos;s proposals have, however,gained the support of some 70 non-EC countries, and remain on the table.They offer the Russians a sound framework for serious negotiations if thepolitical will is there.Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)3.5 The Ten attached particular importance to the co-ordination of theirviews on CSCE, which they regard as a useful and important process.Intensive consultations served to enhance the contribution they made at the8
Madrid conference. Delegations of the Ten worked for a substantial andbalanced concluding document. Provisional agreement has been reached in anumber of areas, but there has been no agreement yet on the question of aConference on Disarmament in Europe, or on the human rights issue. TheMadrid meeting adjourned on 18 December and will resume in 1982.Middle East3.6 The Ten continued to play an active role in the search for a just,comprehensive and lasting settlement in the Middle East. The UnitedKingdom Presidency sought to persuade all concerned of the value ofaccepting the Venice principles as a basis for a comprehensive peacesettlement. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary visited Saudi Arabiaon behalf of the Ten on 3-5 November to explore further the principles putforward by Crown Prince Fahd in August and was encouraged by the extentof common ground they shared with the thinking of the Ten.3.7 Four Members of the Ten, with the agreement of their partners,agreed to a request from the United States that they should participate in theMultinational Force and Observers in the Sinai. The Ten consider that thismeets the wish frequently expressed by members of the Community tofacilitate any progress in the direction of a comprehensive peace settlementin the Middle East on the basis of the mutual acceptance of the right toexistence and security of all the states in the area and the need for thePalestinian people to exercise fully its right to self-determination.3.8 At their meeting on 15 December, Foreign Ministers of the Tenstrongly deplored the decision of the Government and Knesset of Israel toextend Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration to occupied Syrianterritory in the Golan Heights. They made clear their view that thisextension was tantamount to annexation and contrary to international law.They therefore considered it invalid, and pointed out that this step prejudicedthe possibility of the implementation of Security Council Resolution 242 andwas bound to complicate further the search for a comprehensive peacesettlement in the Middle East, to which they remained committed.3.9 The Ten heard of the assassination of President Sadat with thegreatest shock. But they were encouraged by the orderly transfer of powerin Egypt and by the commitment to continuity shown by President Mubarak,who has their full support.Euro/Arab Dialogue3.10 The Ten attached importance to the development of the Euro/Arabdialogue and preparations continued for a meeting at Ministerial level, but anumber of issues of substance remain to be settled.South-East Asia3.11 The Ten paid close attention to events in South-East Asia, and inparticular further developed their relations with the members of ASEAN.The Foreign Ministers of the two groups met on 13-14 October in London,when they had a wide-ranging and constructive exchange of views aboutcurrent international and regional problems.  They paid particular attention9
to current areas of instability in Asia and deplored the continued presence ofVietnamese armed forces in Cambodia and of those of the Soviet Union inAfghanistan. The ASEAN Ministers reiterated their support for theEuropean Council&apos;s proposal for an international conference on Afghanistan.United Nations3.12 The Ten sought to maintain and improve their intensiveconsultation and co-ordination at the United Nations General Assembly(UNGA). The Ten achieved a common vote on a high proportion of theresolutions adopted, and placed particular emphasis on common statementsand explanations of vote: well over 100 such statements and explanations ofvote were made. The Ten were active as a group in negotiating the texts ofresolutions, and were treated by other countries as a major partner forconsultation and negotiations.Africa3.13 The Ten continued to pay close attention to African issues. Inparticular, the Ten reaffirmed their abhorrence of apartheid, and their desireto see it replaced by a truly representative system of government. The Tenremain committed to encouraging the process of peaceful change, and willcontinue to consider ways and means that they might use in common inorder to influence the South African Government to abandon apartheid.3.14 The Ten considered the second round of reports by Europeancompanies operating in South Africa on the implementation of the Code ofConduct adopted in Political Co-operation in 1977. Although some firms arestill not fully applying the Code&apos;s recommendation of minimum wage levels,the Code has undoubtedly helped to stimulate some improvement. Thereports show that companies are becoming increasingly aware of their socialresponsibilities. The Ten hope that companies operating in South Africawill continue their efforts to implement the recommendations of the Codeand play a positive role in the training and development of black employees.3.15 The Ten also reaffirmed their commitment to the right of thepeople of Namibia to self-determination and independence by means of freeand fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nationsas provided for in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 435.The Ten welcomed and supported the renewed determination of the NamibiaFive (United Kingdom, United States, Canada, France, Germany), to pursuethe objective which they set themselves of beginning implementation ofsecurity Council Resolution 435 in 1982. They welcomed the Five&apos;s recentapproach to all the interested parties, and were encouraged by signs ofpositive reactions from those principally concerned.Disarmament3.16 The Ten paid close attention to the question of arms control.Individual members of the Ten with the support of the Ten put forwardresolutions at this year&apos;s UNGA on such important questions as conventionalarms, confidence building measures, regional disarmament and arms controlin space.10
Non-Proliferation3.17. A new Working Group was established to facilitate co-operationamong the Ten in the field of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.Terrorism3.18 The fifth conference of Community Ministers of the Interior andMinisters with similar responsibilities took place in London in December,under the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary. Ministers expressed theirdetermination to continue to strengthen co-operation between Member Statesin the fight against terrorism, took note of studies by Working Groups ofspecialists in a number of scientific and technological fields, and endorsedproposals aimed at further extending practical collaboration betweenMember States.SECTION IV : ENLARGEMENT, EXTERNAL RELATIONS, TRADEAND AIDEnlargement4.1 The Community held a number of negotiating meetings at Ministerialand senior official level with Portugal and Spain, at which it presented agreeddeclarations stating its position on some significant aspects of the accessionnegotiations. These included in particular agriculture, customs union andsocial affairs. The applicants also presented a number of papers of their own.4.2 A statement issued after the European Council on 27 Novemberemphasised the determination of the Community to bring the negotiationswith Portugal and Spain to a successful conclusion and stressed theimportance of continuing progress in the negotiations.Japan4.3 Discussions took place between the Commission and the Japaneseauthorities about the problems of trade relations between the Communityand Japan. The Japanese Government announced an emergency importpackage to reduce the surplus on its current account and its intention tointroduce the tariff reductions agreed in the Tokyo Round 2 years earlier thanexpected.United States of America (USA)4.4 Continuing high imports into the USA of carbon steel products,including substantial imports from Member States, resulted in renewed callsby the US steel industry for protection. US steel manufacturers claim thatmany producers, including producers in Member States, trade unfairly becausetheir products are subsidised or dumped, or both. The US Administrationinitiated limited countervailing cases against producers in some MemberStates, not including the United Kingdom, in November. There were urgentattempts by the Commission and the US Administration during December tofind a solution which would avoid the very serious consequences of disruptionII
of Community steel trade with the US, and to prevent the US industryfiling very wide-ranging anti-dumping and countervailing complaints againstCommunity steel producers, including the United Kingdom.Yugoslavia4.5 A mandate for negotiations with Yugoslavia on an AdaptationProtocol to amend the EC/Yugoslavia Agreement of 1980 to take account ofGreek accession was agreed in September, and the Commission begannegotiations with the Yugoslav Government. The mandate provides inter aliafor access to the Community market for larger quantities of Yugoslav babybeef than under the 1980 Agreement. In October, agreement was alsoachieved on new financial arrangements for the export of Yugoslav baby beefto the Community.ASEAN4.6 A meeting of the EC/ASEAN Joint Commission was held inBrussels in October, to review progress under the EC/ASEAN Co-operationAgreement of 1980 and to seek to identify new areas for co-operation,particularly in the areas of trade promotion and technical training.China4.7 The EC/China Joint Commission met in Peking in November toreview progress under the EC/China Co-operation Agreement. TheCommunity presented a package of trade liberalisation measures and newprospects for co-operation in the energy sphere were opened up.Latin America4.8 A second round of the renewed dialogue between Member States&apos;Permanent Representatives (COREPER) and the Group of Latin AmericanAmbassadors to the Community (GRULA) was held in Brussels inDecember. The meeting laid the groundwork for further development of thedialogue by identifying areas for future co-operation as well as priorities inthe development field.Cyprus4.9 There was a meeting of the EC/Cyprus Association Council inOctober, at Ministerial level. The Cypriot delegation, led by the ForeignMinister, Mr. Rolandis, stressed the need for progress in Cyprus&apos; associationwith the Community. There has been no progress since 1977, despite theterms of the 1972 Association Agreement which called for movement to a&quot; second stage &quot; in 1977 leading to eventual customs union. The Communitydelegation took note of the statements of the Cypriot delegation but wasunable to agree on further trade proposals.Romania4.10 The first meeting of the Joint Committee established under theEC/Romania agreements was held in Brussels on 3-4 November. TheJoint Committee had a useful discussion on the development of trade betweenthe Community and Romania and on prospects for its growth anddiversification.12
Poland4.11 On 7 October the Community agreed to make available to Polandat special prices (some 15 per cent below world prices) further supplies offood and agricultural products.India4.12 A decision to establish a Commission delegation in New Delhi wastaken, reflecting the importance the Community attaches to its relations withIndia. It will among other things enable better administration of theCommunity&apos;s aid programme in India.Mediterranean Financial Protocols4.13 In July the Community reached agreement on new aid andEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) loans to be offered to the countries of theMaghreb and the Mashraq and to Israel under new Financial Protocols onthe expiry of the existing Protocols in October. Negotiations with individualrecipients were opened subsequently.General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G ATT)4.14 The Community welcomed the decision of the Contracting Partiesto the GATT in November to convene their next meeting, in November 1982,at Ministerial level. This meeting is to examine the functioning of themultilateral trading system and reinforce efforts to support and improve it.It will also look at the implemetation of the results of the Tokyo Round ofMultilateral Trade Negotiations and current problems and prospects, anddetermine future priorities for GATT work.Textiles4.15 Under the terms of the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) bilateralagreements with low-cost supplying countries, a further five new quotas onimports of clothing products were introduced during the six month period,providing additional protection for the clothing industry. In addition, abilateral agreement was negotiated with Czechoslovakia.4.16 The second 4-year term of the MFA expired on 31 December.A protocol extending the Arrangement until 31 July 1986 was agreed in theGATT on 22 December, and the Commission indicated to the otherparticipants that they would be recommending formal acceptance of theprotocol to the Council of Ministers early in 1982. The Community&apos;scontinued participation in the Arrangement beyond the end of 1982 would,however, be conditional on the conclusion of satisfactory new bilateralagreements to take effect on 1 January 1983.Steel4.17 On 7 December, the Council agreed the extension of the externalaspects of the steel anti-crisis measures for 1982, including a mandate forthe negotiation of voluntary restraint arrangements with majority steelexporting countries.   The Commission will request these countries to cut1313831c*
back their scndings by 9-5 per cent from their 1980 levels. The 15 per centcut provided for in 1981 arrangements was reviewed half way through theyear and relaxed to 12-5 per cent.European Free Trade Association (EFTA)4.18 Discussion proceeded on the simplification of EC/EFTA rules oforigin and the addition to the EC/EFTA agreements of a number ofprocessed agricultural products. Joint bilateral meetings were held inDecember with Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Iceland and Austriato discuss a wide range of trade issues under the terms of the individualEC/EFTA Agreements.Generalised Scheme of Tariff Preferences (GSP)4.19 The Community&apos;s GSP was reviewed and up-dated to allow moreliberal access for imports from developing countries in 1982.Commodities4.20 The Community continued to contribute to discussion under theIntegrated Programme of Commodities, and agreed to bring the third Inter-national Cocoa Agreement provisionally into force on 1 August. A statementby the Council on 27 October re-affirmed the willingness of the Community toco-operate with the International Sugar Organisation in stabilising the worldmarket; and authorised the Commission to investigate with the InternationalSugar Council ways and means of doing this, with a view to possibleCommunity accession to an improved agreement. The Community is theonly major sugar exporter which is not a member of the Agreement andits decision has been welcomed by members of the present Agreement.North/South Dialoguei4.21 Three Community members, France, Germany and the UnitedKingdom, attended the North /South Summit at Cancun on 22-23 October,and the Community took a leading part in the reaffirmation of thecommitment of the international community to a new round of globalnegotiations, to be launched in the United Nations in 1982. The Communityfurther developed common positions for these negotiations and played anactive and distinct role in the preparations for them in New York.4.22 The Community played a full role at the UN Conference on leastdeveloped countries held in Paris in September, which agreed withCommunity support on a target of 0-15 per cent of Gross Domestic Product(GDP) for aid by developed countries to the least developed countries.4.23 At the Nairobi Conference on new and renewable resources ofenergy the Community played a central mediating role in the discussionswhich led up to agreement on a programme of action to provide thenecessary international framework for developing the indigenous energyresources of the developing countries over the next decade.14
Lome Convention4.24 The applications of Belize, and Antigua and Barbuda to accedeto the Second Lome&apos; Convention were approved in principle. Work continuedon the implementation of the Second Lome Convention which entered intoforce on 1 January 1981. In particular the Community agreed proceduresfor implementing the SYSMIN (minerals systems) arrangements which willassist the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) mineralsproducers to remedy harmful effects on their productive capacity of serioustemporary disruptions beyond their control; and a Community position fordiscussion with the ACP was established on the structure of the EC/ACPTechnical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Development which will providea forum for expert discussions on agricultural development.Food Aid4.25 In September, the Foreign Affairs Council reached a commonposition on a draft regulation on food aid management. Since the draftdiffered in some respects from an earlier version which had been approved bythe European Parliament, conciliation was initiated between the Council andthe Parliament.4.26 In November, the Development Council agreed on a plan of action,including immediate additional food aid for least developed countries andsupport for developing country food strategies, to help combat hunger in theworld. The Council also agreed guidelines for future Community&apos; aid toagriculture and food production, with a view to making this aid moreeffective.Emergency Aid4.27 The November Development Council agreed new and improvedprocedures for handling non-Lome emergency relief aid, designed to enablethe Community to respond quickly and effectively with help in emergencies.Aid to Non-Associated Developing Countries4.28 The November Development Council agreed guidelines for aidto non-associated developing countries in 1982 under which 175 millionEuropean currency units (ecus) (about  99 million)C) would be available forcommitment. The guidelines confirmed the priority given by the Communityto the poorest countries and the poorest sectors of those countries.SECTION V: AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESGuidelines for European Agriculture5.1 On 28 October the Commission forwarded to the Council acommunication entitled &quot; Guidelines for European Agriculture &quot;. This setout in some detail the Commission&apos;s thinking on implementation of the(l) Converted at the December market rate of 1 . 77 ecu =  1.1513831 C*2
guidelines for future decisions on the CAP recommended in their 24 June&quot;Report on the Mandate of 30 May 1980 &quot;. It considered the factors whichhad influenced the development of the CAP and its cost to the Communitybudget and argued that future decisions should be taken against the back-ground of prospects for production and consumption over the medium term.It pointed out that, unless decisions were taken to change the operation ofthe CAP, production would continue to grow more rapidly than consumption.It went on to set out the results of the Commission&apos;s projections of thedevelopment of production, consumption and trade in the main agriculturalsectors and their ideas on how Community support arrangements mightbe modified in relation to specific production objectives. It also maderecommendations for stricter discipline on national aids through morerigorous exercise of the Treaty powers. The Commission concluded thatthe implementation of the various measures set out in their paper shouldmean that agricultural expenditure would in the future grow at a less rapidrate than the rate of increase in the Community&apos;s own resources.5.2 The Commission&apos;s communication on &quot; Guidelines for EuropeanAgriculture&quot; was discussed in the Agriculture Council on 16 November.The discussion was reported to the Foreign Affairs Council to assist in itswork on the implementation of the 30 May Mandate.Sugar5.3 Following the rejection by the ACP countries of Communityproposals for a 1\% increase in the guaranteed price for raw sugar importedunder the sugar protocol to the Lome Convention, the Council consideredCommission proposals for an improved price offer and for compensatingCommunity sugar refiners for the additional cost this would have imposedupon them, but no agreement was reached.Beef5.4 Agreement was reached in the Agriculture Council on the openingof two Community import quotas for 1982, covering 21,000 tonnes of highquality cuts of beef and 2,500 tonnes of buffalo meat.5.5 Discussions were held in the Agriculture Council on Commissionproposals for three Community import quotas for 1982, covering 50,000tonnes of frozen beef, 60,000 tonnes of beef for manufacturing and 220,000head of young male cattle for fattening.Wine5.6 Among several detailed Regulations on wine the Council approvedamendments to the rules on labelling which would permit traders in theUnited Kingdom to use labels in Welsh.Mutton and Lamb5.7 On 26 October the Council adopted a Regulation relating to theimport arrangements for 1981 under the sheepmeat regime for those thirdcountries which had not entered into voluntary restraint arrangements withthe EC.16
Irish Agriculture5.8 Two special measures were adopted in July providing further helpto drainage operations in the West of Ireland and on interest rate subsidieswith regard to Directive 72/159.Greek Agriculture5.9 In implementation of commitments under the Greek Treaty ofAccession the Council adopted measures which provided aids to the produc-tion of cotton, dried figs and grapes and extended the producer groupRegulation 3086/81 to Greece. At the end of the year discussionswere still continuing on a measure to provide special aid to cotton producergroups.European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)5.10 Under the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF United Kingdomreceipts during the period were  425 million with the main areas of benefitbeing payments for export refunds on cereals, milk and beef, sheepmeatpremiums and butter subsidies. The Guarantee Section receipts wereinflated by payments delayed from the first half of 1981. United Kingdomreceipts from the Guidance Section of the EAGGF amounted to  33 millionduring the period with  6 million for direct (project type) measures and  27million for indirect (structural) measures.Animal Health and Welfare5.11 The Agriculture Council on 21 July agreed that the marketing ofstilbenes and thyrostatic substances for administering to animals of allspecies should be prohibited. These measures were contained in Directive81/602/EEC, which further provides for a prohibition on the administrationof stilbenes to farm animals, and for a scientific review of five otherhormonal substances used for growth promotion. A monitoring programmeto assist the enforcement of restrictions placed on the availability and useof hormones is still under discussion.5.12 In August, the Commission submitted proposals to the Councilfor a directive laying down minimum standards for the protection of layinghens kept in battery cages. The Council is awaiting the opinion of theEuropean Parliament on the proposals before continuing its discussions.5.13 The Commission submitted in September proposals for revisingand updating Directives 64/433 and 72/462, dealing with health problemsaffecting respectively intra-Community trade in fresh meat, and importationof bovine animals, swine and fresh meat from third countries. Substantialprogress was made towards agreement on these proposals.5.14 The Commission also submitted proposals in September on therecognition of Environmental Health Officers for certain duties underDirectives 77/99 on intra-Community trade in meat products and 71/118 onpoultrymeat hygiene. These were discussed in detail as were theCommission&apos;s proposals for achieving fairer implementation of Directive71/118.17
5.15 Following the resolution of the longstanding difficulties over theinclusion of medicinal premixes in animal feedingstuffs, Council Directives81/851 and 81/852 relating to veterinary medicinal products were adopted atthe September Agriculture Council.5.16 Certain derogations allowing concessions to the rules on thebrucellosis status of animals entering intra-Community trade were extendeduntil the end of 1983. Substantial progress was made towards agreementon proposals for further aid for the acceleration of plans to eradicatebrucellosis, tuberculosis, and leukosis in cattle. Good progress was alsomade at technical level on measures governing zootechnical legislation forcattle and pigs.FisheriesInternal regime5.17 Following the Fisheries Council in July certain herring fisherieswere re-opened for limited fishing, after several years of closure to allowstocks to regenerate.5.18 At the September Council agreement was reached in principle ona revised marketing system which would protect Community fishermenfrom low-priced imports, provide strengthened support arrangements forproducer organisations and include additional species within the marketingarrangements. It was subsequently agreed that this new Regulation shouldapply from 1 June 1982. The scheme of financial aid for inshore fishingvessel construction and modernisation and aquaculture was renewed. Therewas agreement, though its adoption was subsequently blocked, to extend theconservation Regulation indefinitely.5.19 Several meetings of officials were held to resolve problems raisedin the draft control and enforcement regulation&apos;on which the Council reachedagreement in principle in October 1980. Agreement was reached onguide prices for 1982.External regime5.20 A long-term framework agreement between the Community andCanada was signed on 30 December and entered into force the same day.Agreement was reached on reciprocal fishing arrangements with Faroe andSweden to the end of 1981 (although Sweden subsequently decided not totake up the arrangements) and negotiations on third country fishing arrange-ments for 1982 were set in train.18
SECTION VI: ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND BUDGETARYQUESTIONSFinance Council Business6.1 At the 6 July Finance Council meeting there was an exchange ofviews on problems arising in monetary relations between the Communityand third countries. It was agreed that those Member States participatingin the Ottawa Summit later in the month would be guided by the approachevolved at the European Council in June.6.2 On 17 September the Council agreed on the position to be adoptedby the Community at the resumed export credit Consensus negotiationsin Paris in October. A common position, including agreement to a ceiling onlending of 1,000 million ecus (about  565 millionX1) was reached on therenewal of the New Community Instrument which enables the Commissionto borrow in the markets for on-lending to investment projects in MemberStates. A proposal by the Italian Government to phase out rather than toabolish its temporary import deposit scheme was discussed. As a result ofthe representations made, the Italian Government agreed to phase out thescheme over a five month period and to exclude certain categories of goodsfrom its ambit.6.3 The September Council resumed consideration of the draft directiveon non-life insurance services which would give insurers freedom to operateacross frontiers within the Community. Useful further progress was made atthe Council meetings in October, November and December. There was apreliminary discussion at the October Council of the Commission&apos;s draftfifth Medium Term Economic Policy Programme. It also established theDraft Supplementary and Amending Budget No. 2 for 1981 together witha letter of amendment to the 1982 Draft Budget.6.4 On 14 December the Council adopted the Annual Report on theeconomic situation in the Community and approved guidelines for 1982. Itagreed to the inclusion in the Supplementary and Amending Budget No. 2for 1981 of 62 million ecus (about  39 millionX2) for social measures to helpthe Community&apos;s steel industry; and adopted a draft decision to make80 million ecus (about  45 millionX1) of subsidized loans available to Greecefor the reconstruction of areas affected by earthquakes in February andMarch 1981. The Council also agreed the draft interim reports directivewhich establishes minimum content requirements for reports by companieslisted on a stock exchange on their activities during the first half of theirfinancial year.6.5 Following the November 26-27 European Council&apos;s decision toreview the progress and prospects for further development of the EuropeanMonetary System at its next meeting in March 1982, the Finance Councilon 14 December also heard reports from the Monetary Committee and theCommittee of Central Bank Governors on the technical studies that theyhave undertaken in this field. It was agreed that the Commission would, asa next step, prepare some further reflections on the subject in consultationwith the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors.(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -77 ecu =  1.(2) Converted at the rate of 1 ? 5889 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the 1981 Budget.19
6.6 In addition to the scheduled meetings of the Finance Council, therewas a conference on 4 October on a currency realignment within theEuropean Monetary System, at which the Chancellor of the Exchequer tookthe Chair. Changes in the parities of the French Franc, Deutschmark, DutchGuilder and Italian Lira within the exchange rate mechanism were agreed.Budgetary QuestionsThe 1980 and 1981 Community Budgets6.7 The dispute over the legality of the European Parliament&apos;s adoptionof increases to the 1980 Supplementary Budget No. 2 and the 1981 Budgetwas resolved when on 17 September it adopted Amending Budget No. 1 for1981 which involved a reduction of 520 million ecus (about  327 million)(1)in the provision for the EAGGF Guarantee Section due to changes in marketconditions, offset by increases in other areas, principally 200 million ecus(about 126 million)P) for the Regional Development Fund. The countriesconcerned in the dispute then paid over the amounts by which they hadabated their contributions pending resolution of the dispute.The 1982 Community Budget6.8 The Commission proposals (the Preliminary Draft Budget for 1982)presented in mid-June totalled 23,921 million ecus (about  12,512 million)(2)in commitments and 22,381 million ecus (about  11,707 million)^) inpayments, an increase of some 13 per cent over 1981. The first BudgetCouncil on 23 July established a Draft Budget for 1982 totalling22,800 million ecus (about  11,926 million)(2) in commitments and21,737 million ecus (about  11,370 million)(2) in payments.6.9 The Commission presented a letter of amendment to their originalproposals in October which after being considered and approved by theCouncil amended the Draft Budget for 1982. This had the effect of increasingthe total appropriations for both commitments and payments by 21 millionecus (about  11 million)(2).6.10 On 5 November the European Parliament proposed amendmentsand modifications to the Draft Budget which together would add about969 million ecus (about  507 million)!^2) in commitments and about 471 millionecus (about  246 million)^) in payments.6.11 On 24 November the Council took decisions on the Parliament&apos;sproposed amendments and modifications in the light of discussions withrepresentatives of the Parliament on 23 November. These decisions increasedthe total appropriations in the Draft Budget to 23,006 million ecus (about 12,034 million)(2) in commitments and 21,759 million ecus (about 11,381 millionX2) in payments.6.12 On 17 December the European Parliament adopted amendmentsto increase provision by a further 252 million ecus (about  132 million)^for commitments and 224 million ecus (about  117 million)(2) for payments.f1) Converted at the rate of 1-5889 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the 1981 Budget.(2) Converted at the rate of 1- 9118 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the 1982 Budget.20
The total provision proposed by the European Parliament exceeded themargin within which an agreement with Council might have been reached,particularly for commitments. The Parliament included in its amendmentsprovision for both commitments and payments, totalling some 31 millionecus (about  16 millionX1), to the Food Aid Chapter. The Council consideredthat this was obligatory expenditure and therefore not open to change by theParliament at that stage of the budget procedure.6.13 The Budget Council met on 21 December to consider its responseto the Parliament&apos;s actions, and agreed that the President of the EuropeanParliament should be requested to delay adoption of the 1982 Budget untilagreement had been reached on the maximum rate and classification fornon-obligatory expenditure. It was subsequently learned that the Presidentof the Parliament had declared the 1982 Budget adopted.Budget Refunds6.14 During this period the United Kingdom was granted thebalance of its entitlement to refunds for 1980 under the Budget Agreementof 30 May 1980. New support granted under the Supplementary MeasuresRegulation amounted to some 557 million ecus (about  315 million).(2)This took account of the fact that the United Kingdom did not qualify fora refund under the financial mechanism, thus requiring the  210 millionprovisionally paid under the mechanism in January to be converted tosupplementary measures support. The United Kingdom&apos;s receipts of budgetrefunds in the second half of the year amounted to some  146 million,making a gross total of over  790 million since the conclusion of theAgreement.Customs Union6.15 The Council adopted a number of technical measures in connectionwith the operation of the Customs Union. In October Council agreementwas given to a Directive enabling the Free Circulation Directive(79/695/EEC) to be implemented not later than 1 July 1982. It also adopteda Regulation putting into effect in the Community certain changes in theTechnical Annexes and the specimen T1R (Transit International Routier)Carnet of the 1975 TIR Convention, which the Community implemented byRegulation in advance of ratification. In November the Council adoptedmeasures increasing the allowances expressed in ecu for goods containedin the personal luggage of travellers from third countries or sent in smallconsignments; because of the increased value of the pound in relation to theecu these will not involve an increase in the allowances when expressed insterling. A Regulation adopted in December made a number of amendmentsto simplify Community transit procedure.Harmonisation of Tobacco Duties6.16 The proposals for a third stage of harmonisation of the structureof excise duties on tobacco products put forward in 1980 still await theopinion of the European Parliament.   The Parliament has agreed with thetf1) Converted at the rate of 1-9118 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the 1982 Budget.(2) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -77 ecu =  1.2113831d*
Commission that a detailed study should first be made of the effects ofproceeding with harmonisation. The results of this study are to besubmitted before 31 March 1982. Accordingly in December the Counciladopted a Directive extending the second stage of harmonisation until31 December 1982.Harmonisation of Alcoholic Drinks Duties6.17 Two Fiscal Councils (on 22 September and 21 October) were heldto discuss proposals to harmonise the structure of excise duties on alcoholicdrinks. The first discussed proposals originally made by the LuxembourgPresidency but not previously discussed, and at the second the Presidencypresented revised proposals designed to take account of points made byMember States. No agreement was reached. It is now expected that theEuropean Court will give its judgment in the infraction proceedings takenagainst the United Kingdom in which the Commission has alleged thatUnited Kingdom excise duties give indirect protection in favour of homeproduced beer against imported wine. No further discussion of harmonisa-tion proposals is expected in the meantime.Export Credit6.18 In September the Community reached agreement on a compromisepackage of proposals for changes to the Consensus, which were tabled at themeeting of Consensus participants in October. The proposals included anincrease of 2-2-5 per cent in minimum interest rate: a mechanism for dealingwith the problem of low interest rate countries, such as Japan; and greatertransparency in the notification of tied aid credits (including mixed aid andcommercial credits). With some minor modifications, the Community&apos;srevised proposals were finally accepted by all the other 12 non ECparticipants in the Consensus.6.19 The Presidency also initiated a review of Community proceduresfor co-operation in providing export credit support for contracts involvingexporters in different Community countries.SECTION VII: REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRSEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans7.1 Loans totalling nearly  28 million were made by the ECSC underArticle 56 of the Treaty of Paris, following applications from UnitedKingdom companies in respect of projects creating employment opportunitiesfor steel and coal workers affected by restructuring of the industries. Furtherloans are under negotiation. The United Kingdom Government providedguarantees against possible loss on currency fluctuations over the period ofthe loans for projects in the Assisted Areas.7.2 The Commission set aside  11 million for re-adaptation benefitsto be paid to United Kingdom redundant steelworkers under Article 56(2)of the Treaty of Paris.  The amount set aside will help to fund schemes for2.2
early retirement, retraining and income support which are administered bythe Department of Industry. The total amount set aside by the Commissionsince 1974 as a contribution towards schemes administered by theDepartment of Industry for certain qualifying ex-steelworkers is  71 million.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans7.3 EIB foreign currency loans granted to the United Kingdom overthe period totalled nearly  84 million, of which  15 million was to privateindustry in the Assisted Areas, with the balance being taken up by thepublic sector for telecommunications, transport, water supply and sewerageprojects.European Regional Development Fund7.4 The size of the Fund for 1981 was 1,540 million ecus (about  870millionX1) of which 95 per cent, or 1,463 million ecus (about  827 millionX1)was for the quota section. Following the accession of Greece, the Councilagreed new quotas under which Greece was given a 13 per cent quota,the United Kingdom 23-8 per cent. In 1981 grants totalling some  197million were allocated to 541 infrastructure and 42 industrial projects inthe United Kingdom.7.5 The size of the Fund for 1982 in the Budget as adopted is 1,759million ecus (about  920 million)^) of which 1,669 million ecus (about  873million)(a) is for the quota section.7.6 A new regulation governing the operation of the Fund wasproposed by the Commission in October. Although the quotas agreedfollowing Greek accession lapsed at the end of 1981, the Commission arelikely to continue to use the same figures in administering the Fund untilthe new regulation is adopted.Steel7.7 Following the package of measures to support the steel industryagreed by the Council in June, including a combination of quotas andvoluntary producer agreements on steel production, steel producers havebeen able to raise prices. In November the Commission produced aCommunication on price policy proposing further, but staged, price increasesfor 1982.Synthetic Fibres7.8 In August the Commission asked Member States to refrain for afurther two years from giving aids towards the creation of additionalsynthetic fibre production capacity, and to notify in advance any aidsproposed for existing capacity.Textiles and Clothing7.9 In August, to coincide with renegotiation of the Multi-FibreArrangement discussions, the Commission issued a Communication on the(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -77 ecu =  1.(2) Converted at the rate of 1 -9118 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the 1982 Budget2313831 D*2
Community&apos;s textile and clothing industries. The paper analyses the currentsituation and describes in general terms a possible Community approach forthese industries.Microelectronics7.10 On 8 December, the Council adopted a Regulation concerningCommunity action in the field of microelectronic technology. The Regulationestablishes a system for exchange of information on Member States&apos;initiatives in microelectronic technology and also provides for financialsupport for key research and development projects. The topics coveredinclude aspects of optical and electron beam lithography, plasma etchingand deposition equipment, test equipment and computer aided design. TheRegulation provides for 40 million ecus (about  23 millionX1) to be spent insupporting projects involving two or more companies or institutions in twoor more Member States. Support will normally cover 30 per cent ofcosts. It is aimed at encouraging activities on a European scale above andbeyond those supported nationally by Member States.Science and Technology7.11 On 27 July the Council adopted a third programme in the fieldof information and documentation for a period of three years effective from1 January 1981. 15 million ecus (about  8 millionX1) have been allocatedto the programme. It aims to build upon achievements of the two precedingprogrammes, to consolidate and enhance Euronet, to extend and improveDiane services, contribute to the creation of further high-quality informationservices and develop the information market in the Member States.7.12 A Council of Ministers responsible for research was held on9 November, for the first time since 1979. Ministers had a useful exchangeof views on the development of the Community&apos;s science and technologypolicy and agreement was reached on a number of topics which theCommission were charged to study further and report to the Council during1982. Agreement was reached on compromise proposals for the agreementof two Community programmes on microelectronics and biotechnology.7.13 On 7 December the Council adopted a multi-annual indirect actionresearch and training programme in the field of biomolecular engineeringfor the period April 1982 to March 1986, implemented in two stages of twoyears each. 8 million ecus (approximately  4-5 millionX1) have beenallocated to the first stage. Funding will support projects carried out inthe research institutions of the Member States and the training of scientists.Research is to concentrate on developmental aspects of new reactors usingimmobilised multienzyme systems, gene transfer and improvement of safetymeasures for detecting contamination and assessing possible risks.7.14 On 14 December the Council adopted a Decision on the conclusionof an agreement between the Community and Sweden to connect Euronetto the Swedish network for scientific and technical information and(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -77 ecu =  1.24
documentation. The Council also adopted an agreement between theCommunity, Switzerland and Sweden defining the relationship createdbetween these two states and the connection of their networks to Euronet.7.15 On 15 December the Council agreed to the Commission&apos;sparticipation in the implementing agreement drawn up within the frameworkof the International Energy Agency (IEA) relating to the co-operation in aprogramme of energy technology systems analysis.7.16 On 15 December the Council approved the conclusion of aCommunity-COST (European Co-operation in Science and Technology)concertation agreement on a concerted action project in the field of thetreatment and use of sewage sludge (COST project 68 ter) for the period1 January 1981 to 31 December 1983. The project will involve the exchangeof information and production of reports of work carried out within nationalprogrammes and the EC programme on environmental protection and clima-tology (1981-1985). A financial contribution of approximately 10 millionecus (about  6 million)C) will be required from the participating states. Themaximum financial contribution to the co-ordinating costs will be 200,000ecus (approximately  110,000)0 from the Community and 20,000 ecus(approximately  11,000)0 from each participating non-Member State.7.17 On 15 December the Council adopted a second research anddevelopment programme in the field of textiles and clothing for three yearsfrom 1 November. 4 million ecus (about  2 million)(1) have been allocatedto the programme. Its main objectives are the improvement of the com-petitiveness of the industry as well as of working and production conditionsand it will cover garment physiology and construction, quality of knittedfabrics and articles, applications of new spinning technologies in the woolindustry and the upgrading of linen.Company and Securities Law7.18 Discussion began on the draft regulation to establish the EuropeanCo-operation Grouping, while negotiations continued on a number of draftdirectives including those dealing with the accounts of groups of companies,scissions (the division of public companies), the qualifications of auditors,collective investment funds (unit trusts). Agreement was reached on aDirective about the regular disclosure of information by companies whoseshares are admitted to stock exchange listing.7.19 The draft fifth directive (on the structure of public companies,including worker participation), the draft directive on prospectuses forunlisted securities and the draft directive on the annual accounts of creditinstitutions remained under discussion by the European Parliament.Industrial Property7.20 Negotiations continued on the litigation arrangements needed toimplement the Community Patent Convention.

the Council Working Group on Intellectual Property (Trade Marks) met inDecember for a first discussion of the technical content of the proposals. Atthe second session of the Diplomatic Conference to revise the ParisConvention for the Protection of Industrial Property, which was held inNairobi in September-October, the Community played a major part inreaching the agreement that was achieved.SECTION VIII: ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTEnvironmental Issues8.1 The Environment Council met on 3 December. Agreement wasreached on a number of proposals, including two important issues which hadbeen before the Council for some time. The first of these was the directiveon major industrial hazards, the so called &quot; Seveso &quot; proposal. The solutionreached on the one matter previously holding up agreement recognised theobligation of a Member State to consult other interested states within theframework of bilateral relations in cases which have transfrontierimplications. The second was the draft directive on the discharge of mercuryinto the aquatic environment by the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry. Thisproposal was settled as the result of agreement on controls to be applied tonew plant in accordance with the principles of the framework directive.8.2 In addition agreement in principle was reached on a decisionestablishing an exchange of information on air pollution. A Decisionconcerning Community accession to the Berne Convention on Conservationof European Wildlife and Natural Habitats was adopted.8.3 Good progress was also made on the outstanding problems on thedraft regulation on implementation of the Washington Convention on Inter-national Trade in Endangered Species. The Council took an initial look atproposals for the extension of the Community Environment ActionProgramme (1982-86) and discussed vehicle emissions and the problems ofuse of chlorofluorocarbons.Inland Transport8.4 At its meeting on 15 December, the Transport Council discusseda wide range of issues. Agreement was reached in principle on an increasein the Community road haulage quota of 5 per cent for eight MemberStates and 15 per cent for Ireland and Greece. Final agreement is subject tothe views of the European Parliament. The Council also agreed additionsto the types of road haulage exempt from permit and/or quota restrictions.It adopted Resolutions on railways policy; on further work on proposals forCommunity aid to transport infrastructure projects; and agreed a mandatefor negotiations with Austria on a range of transport matters.26
Shipping8.5 Various proposals intended to promote marine safety and pollutionprevention are being considered by Council Working Groups. On 15December the Transport Council adopted a Resolution welcoming theprogress achieved so far in setting up a co-ordinated and harmonised systemof port state control in Western Europe (the enforcement of internationalstandards for shipping safety and pollution prevention in relation to shipsvisiting European ports) and urging Member States and the Commission toplay a full and active part in the second European Ministerial Conferenceon Maritime Safety and Pollution Prevention, to be held in Paris in January1982, at which the new system is expected to be approved.8.6 The activities of Eastern Bloc carriers in Central American, EastAfrican and Far East trades continue to be monitored and examined byCouncil Working Groups.8.7 The Commission has put forward a draft regulation applying thecompetition rules in the EEC Treaty to shipping. Negotiations on the draftregulation will be carried out in a Council Working Group and theGovernment is already in close consultation with British shippers and ship-owners. Interested bodies in the Community have also been invited to makerepresentations to the Commission direct.Civil Aviation8.8 Discussion continued on the proposal for a regulation for theliberalisation of intra-Community regional air services. In response to arequest from the Council to examine the question of air fares in theCommunity, the Commission presented a report and draft directive. TheCommission also presented a proposed regulation for the application of thecompetition rules of the EEC Treaty to air transport. Discussion in theCouncil began on both these measures. The Commission began consultationswith Member States&apos; experts and interested outside bodies in the Communityon express air cargo and on state aids to air transport and on non-scheduledair transport. The Commission presented two draft directives on thelimitation of noise emissions from subsonic aircraft and helicopters.SECTION IX : SOCIAL AFFAIRSInformal Meeting of Employment Ministers9.1 The Employment Secretary presided over an informal meeting ofEmployment Ministers in London on 24-25 September. The main discussioncentred on the forthcoming review of the European Social Fund. Althoughno formal conclusions were issued, there was a degree of agreement aboutthe main issues to be taken into account in the review, including top priorityfor measures to help young people. There was also a discussion on nationalexperience in dealing with youth unemployment and a brief report from theCommission on relations with the social partners.27
Employment9.2 On 3 November the Standing Committee on Employment (whichincludes representatives of employers and workers as well as EmploymentMinisters and the Commission) considered a Commission Communicationon new technology and social change. The paper&apos;s main theme was the needto facilitate the introduction of new technology and to overcome unreasonablefears about its consequences. The Committee recognised the employmentpotential of new technology but realised that the present high level ofunemployment was in danger of creating resistance to these necessarychanges. All were agreed on the need for a coherent Community widestrategy for new technology but views were divided on a claim from workers&apos;representatives for statutory rights to information, consultation andnegotiation when new technology is introduced. The Commission wasencouraged to proceed with a study of existing national legislation andcollective agreements in this field and to consider with the social partners thepossibility of producing a joint declaration on the problem of introducingnew technology in the firm.9.3 It was recognised at the Standing Committee meeting that, in orderto aid the introduction of new technology, action was needed in a numberof areas. These included the training and retraining of teachers, the use oftechnology to aid the handicapped, the improvement of technical qualifica-tions and the demonstration of the employment potential of new technologyto small and medium sized firms. It was also felt that the European SocialFund and European Regional Development Fund had a role to play in thepromotion of an understanding of new technology.9.4 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met on 8 December andadopted a Resolution on the social integration of disabled people, supportingCommission proposals for a network of projects in Member States andexchanges of information and experience to help improve the lot of disabledpeople throughout the Community. Progress was made towards adopting adraft directive on the protection of workers from the effects of lead. TheCouncil also discussed the review of the European Social Fund, the FrenchGovernment&apos;s ideas for Community social policy, and made progress on adraft directive concerning the protection of workers from asbestos. (TheCouncil&apos;s discussions of social security matters are recorded in paragraphs9.9-9.10.)9.5 There was general agreement that the limited resources of the SocialFund should be directed to the most serious problems which it was capableof assisting. Top priority should be given to meet the needs of young peoplewithout jobs by support for vocational training and other appropriatemeasures. There was a general welcome for the Commission&apos;s proposalthat the Fund should promote a medium term strategy designed to provide asatisfactory vocational and educational priority for all young people movingfrom compulsory full time schooling to entry into the labour market. Otherthemes identified included: the future regional allocation of Fund aid, takinginto account the relative severity of economic difficulties and unemploymentwithin Member States across the Community; the necessity for the Fund torespond to needs and opportunities arising from the introduction of new28
technology; and the expansion of the Fund&apos;s role in supporting innovatoryand demonstration projects. There was also a general welcome for theCommission&apos;s proposals to simplify the mechanisms of the Fund.European Social Fund Allocations9.6 In August, the Commission announced the second batch of SocialFund allocations for 1981. This was restricted to the &quot;women&quot; and&quot; migrant workers&quot; fields of intervention which (because of the Fund&apos;soversubscription) had not been included in the first batch. It included about 400,000 for the United Kingdom.9.7 In October, the Commission announced the third and final batch ofallocations from the Fund for 1981. For the United Kingdom theseallocations amounted to 177 million ecus ( 100 million)(:), making a total forthe year of 249 million ecus (about  141 million)^1) This represented25*1 per cent of the total allocations made by the Fund this year (ascompared to the United Kingdom&apos;s 23-3 per cent share in 1980); especiallynoteworthy was our allocation of 150 million ecus (about  85 millionX1)under the &quot; young people &quot; field of intervention (over 40 per cent of totalallocations under this heading).9.8 The following table shows how United Kingdom allocations for 1981were distributed between the different fields of intervention-millionYoung people ...... ......... 85Regions of high unemployment ...... 33Handicapped ............... 17Technical progress ............ 2Textile workers............... 2Migrant workers............... 1Women ...............( 500,000)Groups of undertakings............( 200,000)Total ............ ...... 141Social Security9.9 The December Labour and Social Affairs Council adopted aproposal extending the cover of the Community&apos;s social security Regulationsto self-employed migrant workers and their families. This is a significantstep in the removal of barriers to free movement of labour.9.10 The Council also exchanged views on a proposal to extend theunemployment benefit provisions of the Community Regulations on socialsecurity and to provide for the payment of pre-retirement benefits to continuewhen a beneficiary transfers his residence from one Member State to another.Agreement was reached on the basis for further discussion by officials.(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1 . 77 ecu =  1.2913831 E*
Anti-Poverty Programme9.11 On 9 December the Commission presented an evaluation report onthe Programme which ended in November 1980. The report has not yetbeen considered by the Council nor has the Commission made proposals forfurther specific Community activities in the anti-poverty field.Rights of Establishment9.12 A proposal was adopted on 14 December extending the provisionsfor the mutual recognition throughout the Community of diplomas, certificatesand other evidence of formal qualification of doctors, nurses responsible forgeneral care, dentists and veterinary surgeons to those who began theirtraining before but who finished their training after the original Directiveswere implemented.  This closes a gap left in the original Directives.9.13 A new provision was agreed on 15 December concerning theDirective co-ordinating provisions made in respect of the activities of doctorsand laying down minimum training standards to be observed by MemberStates. The proposal limits more strictly than before exceptions to theprinciple that full-time training should be the norm. Member States whoallowed a method of part-time specialist training were permitted to continueto apply it to candidates who began their training no later than 20 January1979. The proposal extends this derogation to candidates who begin trainingno later than 31 December 1982.9.14 Progress was also made on a draft directive on the mutualrecognition of qualifications for hairdressers and on measures to facilitate thefreedom of establishment of auxiliary transport workers.Consumer Affairs9.15 Considerable progress was made on a directive which would givethose consumers buying goods from doorstep salesmen a cooling off period ofseven days during which they could cancel the contract.Housing9.16 On 19 November the Commission published a proposal for aregulation which would provide for Community assistance for housing inNorthern Ireland.SECTION X: ENERGY10.1 The 27 October Energy Council reached substantial agreementon conclusions on energy pricing which state that consumers should haveadequate access to information on energy prices and the methods by whichthey are determined; and that any differences in pre-tax energy prices whichdo not conform to the guidelines set out in the conclusions must be clearly30
identified and progressively reduced. The conclusions emphasise theparticular importance of energy pricing and price transparency in theCommunity&apos;s energy strategy and set out further work to improve trans-parency and the consistency of energy pricing principles. They were formallyadopted on 3 December.10.2 The Energy Council agreed in principle on guidelines for dealingwith a limited shortfall in oil supplies as a basis for consultation with otherindustrialised countries in the International Energy Agency (1EA). TheCommunity will review the range of measures and the procedures whichmight be taken to cope with a shortfall in oil supplies in the light of thesewider consultations. The aim is to see if it is possible to devise procedureswhich will ensure that any further shortfalls in oil supplies do not leadto unrealistic pressures on world prices. To be effective, any arrangementswould have to involve major consuming countries such as the United Statesof America and Japan.10.3 The Council formally adopted a recommendation on electricitytariff structures, agreed in principle at the Energy Council in November 1980,which states that tariff structures should reflect costs incurred in supplyingthe various categories of consumer. The Council also approved the seventhand latest round of the Community Projects in the Hydrocarbons Sector(CPHS) Scheme, totalling 26 million ecus (about  15 millidn)(l) and includingUnited Kingdom projects representing about 25 per cent of the total.10.4 The Council had a useful discussion of a Commission paper on thedevelopment of a Community energy strategy. This paper set Communityaction in the framework of efforts at national level to attain agreedCommunity objectives, and identified five priority areas-energy pricing,energy investment, possible measures to deal with a shortfall in oil supplies,research and development, and relations with third countries in the energyfield.10.5 The Council reached general conclusions on a Commission paperon gas supplies; and approved the conclusions of a Commission paper onoil refining capacity which noted that oil companies were carrying out thenecessary rationalisation of the refining industry. The Council also con-sidered Commission proposals for further funding for demonstration projectsin new energy sources and energy savings.10.6 In December, the Community agreed to extend until the end of1982 Regulations for the registration of crude oil imports. Under thesearrangements, companies report to Member States each month their importson an individual cargo basis, showing price, volume and type of crude andMember States pass aggregate national data to the Commission.10.7 The European Atomic Energy Community reached agreement withthe government of Canada concerning enrichment, reprocessing and storageof nuclear material; and with the government of Australia concerning thetransfer of nuclear material from Australia.(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1 . 77 ecu =  1.3113831 E*2
10.8 The United Kingdom received from the ECSC about  2 millionin grants for research and development and  3 million for readaptation aidfor miners. The European Regional Development Fund made availablegrants totalling  801,000 for electricity projects and  93,000 for gas projectsin the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authorityreceived grants totalling about  4 million for its own research into nuclearfusion,  3 million for the Joint European Torus fusion experiment and 780,000 for other nuclear research under Euratom. Funds were also receivedfor research into alternative energy sources and for demonstration projects inalternative energy and energy savings.SECTION XI: THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYThe European Parliament11.1 In addition to the reports presented personally by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, 15 United KingdomMinisters took part in the work of the Parliament, either in plenary sessionsor at committee meetings. On 17 November all the Foreign Ministers ofthe Member States together with the President of the Commission met thePresident of the Parliament, supported by other leading members of theParliament to discuss relations between the Institutions.11.2 There was further discussion of the seat of the Parliament andon 7 July it adopted a Resolution providing that plenary sessions be heldonly in Strasbourg, committee meetings be held generally in Brussels, andthat the Secretariat&apos;s operations be reviewed in accordance with thesedecisions. The Luxembourg Government has since brought an action beforethe Court of Justice under Article 38 of the ECSC Treaty, to have theParliament&apos;s action declared void. The Court&apos;s judgment is awaited.Stall Relations11.3 In December the Council agreed to new detailed rules underwhich staff remuneration is adjusted. These rules, which replace those inuse since 1976, follow the principle of parallel development with the trendof national public service salaries, and include an exceptional levy on salariesin recognition of the particular difficulties of the economic and socialsituation.European Court of Justice11.4 The United Kingdom has submitted written observations in ninecases and the Court has delivered judgment in the following cases ofparticular interest and significance. In the case of the prosecution ofGuerrino Casati, referred by the Courts of Italy, the Court had to determinea question on the validity of certain Italian exchange control measures; itheld, inter alia, that although restrictions on the movement of capital to theextent necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the common market hasbeen abolished on the expiry of the transitional period, Member States werenot prohibited from imposing restrictions on the export of bank notes. Inthe Right Hon Lord Bruce of Donington v Eric Gordon Aspden, HM32
Inspector of Taxes, the Court held that Community law prohibited theimposition of national taxation on lump sum payments made by theEuropean Parliament to its members by way of reimbursement of traveland subsistence expenses unless it could be shown, in accordance withCommunity law, that the lump sum reimbursement was in excess of actualexpenses incurred and so constituted in part a form of remuneration. InR v Tymen the Court, amplifying its judgment in Commission v UnitedKingdom (the second &quot; fisheries case &quot;) held that the United Kingdom didnot have power to bring fishery conservation measures into force withoutappropriate consultation with the Commission even though the Commissionhad itself submitted a proposal to the Council advocating similar measuresto come into force on a date preceding the events giving rise to theprosecution of M Tymen. A prosecution based on the United Kingdom&apos;smeasures was therefore contrary to Community law.11.5 In Merck v Stephar the Court extended the doctrine that patentrights are exhausted on the first marketing in a Member State of theCommunity of the patented article by the patentee. It ruled that a patentcannot be invoked against the importation of articles from another MemberState where they have been put on the market by that patentee even wherethat marketing had been at a greatly diminished price due to the locallaw not granting patent protection for such articles.Legal Co-operation11.6 On 7 December the United Kingdom signed the Convention on thelaw applicable to contractual obligations. With the exception of Greeceall Member States have now signed this Convention.11.7 Agreement was reached at expert level on the terms of a draftconvention which will enable Greece to accede to the 1968 EuropeanJudgments Convention as amended. After the necessary consultation andconsideration within individual Member States it is hoped that a textfor submission for approval and signature by the Member States will beavailable early in 1982.European Act11.8 At the November meeting of the European Council the Germanand Italian Governments presented a Draft Act, which aims to consolidatethe political and economic progress already made towards European union,and a draft statement on further progress towards economic integration.The Draft Act covers: strengthening and development of the Community;strengthening of Political Co-operation; co-ordination of security policy;co-operation on cultural matters; harmonisation of further areas of legis-lation; and increased activity on international violence and terrorism.11.9 The European Council invited the Foreign Ministers in co-operation with the Commission, to examine and clarify the proposals and toreport back to them at a future meeting.33
SECTION XII: PARLIAMENT12.1 Parliament was in session for 12 weeks during the period. TheHouse of Commons Select Committee on European Legislation, etc., con-sidered 400 Community documents and recommended 26 of these for furtherconsideration by the House. The House of Lords Select Committee on theEuropean Communities considered 405 documents; 14 documents wererecommended for debate. Debates on 10 documents were held in theHouse of Commons and on 10 in the House of Lords.34

ANNEX EPRIME MINISTER&apos;S SPEECH TO THEEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: 16 DECEMBER 19811. This occasion is a pleasure and a privilege for me. It marks animportant point in the development of the European Community.2. This is the first time that the Head of Government of the MemberState occupying the Presidency has attended a session of the EuropeanParliament to give an account of a meeting of the European Council. Andthe fact that we meet today recognises that among other things that theEuropean Council has become an important part of the European scene. Itgives Heads of Governments the opportunity to discuss matters whereCommunity business and political considerations overlap. We need thisopportunity for a general exchange of views as well as for the resolution ofthe Community&apos;s most important problems.3. The European Council held in London on 26-27 November wasjust such an occasion. The atmosphere throughout was friendly and con-structive. Certainly there was more detailed discussion than usual becauseof the nature of the agenda. Nevertheless we spent several hours discussingthe commanding problems of world recession and East-West relations.Indeed, this European Council well illustrated the two features of ourrelationship-the first, the problems that have to be resolved between us;^ and the second, our relationship with the outside world.Both are equally important to the well-being of the people whom it isour privilege to represent.The Mandate4. The main subject we discussed was the Mandate of 30 May. It isworth recalling how it originated.5. The problem arose when one of the Member States, my own country,found itself bearing an unacceptable and increasing budgetary burden as aresult of the combined effect of Community policies. As the Communityanalysed this problem, it became clear that the real issue was not confinedto budgetary matters. It concerned the whole balance of Communitypolicies, including the relationship of agricultural expenditure to regional,social and industrial expenditure. Agriculture absorbs the preponderantshare of the Community budget and leaves insufficient resources for otherareas equally relevant to the problems of advanced industrial societies,especially at a time of economic recession.6. The Community agreed, on 30 May 1980, that the problem shouldbe resolved, and I quote-&quot; By means of structural changes&quot;. TheCommission was given a Mandate to produce proposals as to how this couldbe achieved without infringing basic Community principles. TheCommission&apos;s Report was produced in June and concentrated on three mainareas or &quot; Chapters&quot;.  These were the reform of the Common Agricultural49
Policy, the development of other Community policies, in particular economic,regional and social policies, and the Community budget, and it was agreedthat all three Chapters must be considered in parallel.7. Behind the prosaic words of the Mandate lies the essential beliefthat, if it is to endure, a venture as bold and imaginative as the EuropeanCommunity must adapt to changing circumstances and to the hopes ofgenerations yet to come. To the Community, as well as to its MemberStates, the dictum of that distinguished political thinker Edmund Burkeapplies.  He said, in the 18th Century-&quot; A State without the means of change is without the means of itsconservation &quot;.8. Speaking for myself, I believe that the Community can and willrise to the occasion. For however diverse our national histories, we allknow that our future lies in working together. Of course, the moderntendency of politicians is to want more spending on their own particularinterests in their own country. Indeed, it is sometimes hard to believe thatParliamentary democracy started with the intent to curb the power of theexecutive to impose greater taxation on ordinary citizens. Throughout ourdeliberations in the European Council ran the constant reminder that ourresources are limited and that the question is how to allocate themfairly.9. The 30 May Mandate laid on the British Presidency the responsibilityof reaching decisions by the end of this year. That target was alwaysambitious. It became more so when a change of Government brought aboutin one Member State by national elections, understandably delayed detaileddiscussion until well into September.10. The responsibility of the Presidency, against the background whichI have described, was truly heavy and we have made strenuous efforts toadvance the discussions. At the European Council on 26-27 November thethree Chapters were talked over in great detail-from the Community loanfacility and its extension, through the proper priorities of regional policy andits finance, prudent policies for agriculture, national aids, export and importpolicies to the budgetary decisions themselves. Throughout, we recognisedthat each conclusion could only be conditional as it rested on a compre-hensive agreement about all three Chapters.11. I had very much hoped to be able to report to you today that theEuropean Council had been able to reach full agreement on all thesematters. Unfortunately I cannot do so. Much progress was made. But onfour main areas we were unable to reach any measure of agreement. Theseare--first, the problems arising from the Community&apos;s milk regime;-second, the way to deal with Mediterranean agriculture;-third, how to relate the share of agricultural expenditure to thedevelopment of the Community budget as a whole; and-fourth, how to ensure that no Member State is put into an unacceptablesituation as a result of the effect of the Community budget.50
12. We asked our Foreign Ministers to meet informally as soon aspossible in a further effort to resolve these matters and to report to Headsof Government. That meeting took place on 14 and 15 December. Despitetheir best endeavours, Foreign Ministers were not able to reach agreement onthe outstanding points. They therefore decided to invite the President ofthe Commission to make revised proposals for guidelines on the four pointsin the light of their discussions. They have agreed to meet again to considerthese proposals in the first half of January. I hope rapid progress can thenbe made. Further delay will serve no-one&apos;s interests and the need to pressahead remains as strong as ever.13. This Parliament will wish to know that at the beginning of theCouncil&apos;s proceedings, Mr Papandreou, the Prime Minister of Greece, madea statement about the economic problems of Greece and his Government&apos;sattitude towards the Community. I should also report that ChancellorSchmidt and Signor Spadolini drew the attention of the European Council tothe ideas put forward by their Governments for closer European co-operation. Foreign Ministers will now examine the ideas, some of whichare far reaching, and report back to a future European Council.World Economic Situation14. Our Community works against the backcloth of world economicproblems. The European Council addressed itself to the economic andsocial situation and the difficulties facing us at a time of continuing worldrecession. Accustomed to growth over many years we have entered aperiod when we do not expect to see it resume at such a rate for some timeto come. This, advancing technologies and changing patterns of worldtrade have left our countries with levels of unemployment we thought neverto see again. Every country is especially concerned about unemploymentamong youth and we all recognised the need for better training. We shallreturn to this aspect of our work at future Councils.15. In our general approach to economic policies we endorsed the viewof the Commission, namely-&quot; That the objectives of fighting inflation and unemployment needdetermined policies to bring deficits under control, and to keep pro-duction, distribution and unit labour costs in check.&quot;Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of that discussion centred onthe effect of high public deficits. They, we were told, lead to unusually highreal interest rates which in turn strangle expansion. Thus high publicdeficits turn out not to be re-flationary but de-flationary.16. At times of national difficulty the tendency to protectionism isstrong. But apart from limited areas where a period of adjustment isnecessary, we recognise that it is not in the best interests of our people.Protectionism in some products can so easily lead to retaliation in others.We were very conscious that we need to pursue a Community policy ontrading with Japan. The Community has put its detailed points to theJapanese Government and we now await their response. In the meantimewe have to continue to rely on national arrangements so as to reinforce theefforts of the Community as a whole.51
17. As the third anniversary of the European Monetary System fallsnext March we agreed to review its operation at that time.18. The theme of economic co-operation between countries includingthe United States ran strongly through all our deliberations. We are eachaffected by the economic policies pursued by others. We believe that thatis something we must each take into account in order the better to comethrough recession to expansion of world trade once again.Political Co-operation19. The Community is, and must continue to be, a force for stabilityin the world-a world that is sadly torn and distracted by conflict. Co-ordination of foreign policies through political co-operation is a key elementin that role. It is vital to come together quickly in times of tension.20. The European Council welcomed the London Report of the ForeignMinisters which provided for important practical improvements in theorganisation of political co-operation.21. The growing strength and cohesion of Europe in these matters isreflected in the way Heads of Government approached issues and the rangeof issues they discussed. We were not simply discussing language forresounding communiques. We were constructing European policy-policywhich increasingly involves taking initiatives, rather than merely respondingto events.22. The problems discussed included East-West relations, Afghanistan,Poland, Disarmament and the Middle East. The Federal Chancellortold us about his conversations with President Brezhnev on the occasion ofthe latter&apos;s recent visit to Bonn. We all agreed on the importance of keepingopen the channels of communication between East and West. We welcomethe commitment of the United States, announced in President Reagan&apos;sspeech of 18 November, to achieve major mutual reductions in nuclear andconventional systems. The Council restated in strong terms its concernat the continuing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.Europe and Democracy23. The protection and furtherance of liberty and democracy was thepurpose which inspired the founding of the Community. That purpose isas urgent today as when the Community began. With regard to theaccession of Spain and Portugal, the European Council reaffirmed our strongpolitical commitment to bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.These negotiations involve problems. But we all have a common interestin strengthening these newly restored democracies and in supporting themin their solidarity with the aims of Western Europe.24. The representation of the people is an essential principle ofdemocracy. The Presidency have worked hard to improve the dialoguebetween the Council and the Parliament. Thanks to the co-operation wereceived from you, I believe we have had some success.  And this is one52
reason why I am here today. The meeting between the Ten ForeignMinisters and you, Madam President, and Leaders of the Parliament, withthe participation of the Commission, marked another important innovation.25. The common aim of all these deliberations is to help create aCommunity which functions more effectively, which protects the democracyand freedom which Europe cherishes and which takes all available oppor-tunities to extend that democracy. For this area of stability and democracyin Europe is a priceless asset in a troubled world. We often count ourproblems and we should sometimes count our blessings. And I say this inparticular in a week when the events in Poland are much on our minds.26. The problems of Poland are for the Poles to solve. And we hopethey will do so by a process of compromise and negotiation. We must nottake our liberties for granted. In the changing world in which we live, wemust work if we are to preserve them. And it is that challenge which makesprogress on our own problems so imperative. I hope that by the time theBelgian Presidency comes to report on the outcome of the European Councilin March next year, it will be possible to describe substantive conclusions onmany of these issues.27. The successful future development of the Community as an instru-ment for furthering the cause of democracy and freedom depends onmaking speedy progress in our deliberations. For freedom must meanmore than freedom to differ. It must mean freedom to act together toconserve our common beliefs-so that our children may enjoy that peacewith liberty which is the greatest gift to mankind.53
ANNEX FFOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY&apos;S SPEECH TOEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: 8 JULY, 19811. We in the United Kingdom are fortunate that our first twoPresidencies have followed immediately after those of the Netherlands.Progress has been made over the last six months on a wide range ofissues for which our predecessors deserve all credit. You have followedthis work with close attention, but let me mention three fields in whichthe Presidency&apos;s contribution was particularly valuable.2. First, there was the agricultural price-fixing last March whenagreement was reached with a pleasant absence of the delay and acrimonywhich has occasionally characterised this exercise in earlier years. Secondly,the progress made on tackling the problems arising from the crisis in thesteel industry showed that the Community is capable of responding to thesocial and industrial problems of the &apos;80s. This augurs well for the future.And in the Middle East the patient and persistent work of Mr. van derKlaauw has enhanced the reputation of European diplomacy and madeclear the hope that Europe has a contribution to make to an eventualsettlement of the problems afflicting this troubled, but vital area of theworld. In one other important sector, fisheries, the Presidency&apos;s efforts,through no fault of their own, did not bring success. We inherit the taskfrom them and consider it a high priority to conclude the negotiationswhich have already lasted for longer than is good for the Community orfor the wellbeing of its fishermen.3. In the policies of the European Community, six months is a shorttime. It is a mistake for any Presidency to assume the chair withexaggerated hopes. To set targets that are too ambitious is to courtdisappointment and disillusion. The Presidency has only limited controlof business and cannot force the pace at which progress is made on thevarious issues before the Community. The speech I am making to thisHouse is not an agreed order of business, but an indication of what theBritish Presidency hopes to achieve. The Presidency&apos;s task is to providecontinuity with its immediate predecessors; to ensure that business isdespatched with the maximum of efficiency and the minimum of fuss; andto work with a sense of purpose to bring about the consensus and com-promise among all Member States without which no steady rate of progresscan be maintained.4. Another major responsibility of the Presidency and a vital ingredientfor its success is the maintenance of good working relations with the otherinstitutions of the Community. If Britain is to perform her task effectivelyand harmoniously we will need the support of the Parliament. Part of theParliament&apos;s role is to discuss and to criticise and I am not asking youto renounce your obligations in this respect. But I do ask that we shouldconsider each other not as adversaries but as partners in a joint enterprise:that of making a success of Europe. The British Presidency, for its part,is determined to try to make out of this relationship an effective dialogue54
and not an exercise in mutual frustration. I and my Hon. Friend, Mr.Douglas Hurd, will come to Parliamentary sessions and political colloquies,committed to that objective. I am also glad that there have been contactsbetween the previous Presidency and the Parliament on how the dialogueover the Community Budget may be improved. As a first step in thatdirection, I am glad that it has been agreed between Mr. Lawson, Presidentof the Budget Council, and you, Madame, that the delegation of yourParliament should meet the Council on 22 July-the day before the Councilestablishes the Draft Budget-in order to give more time for the Councilto consider the Parliament&apos;s views. I am glad that the Parliament hasaccepted the invitation.5. The role of the Commission is also fundamental to the successfuldevelopment of the Community. The Commission&apos;s proposals form thebasis of all progress along the lines laid down in the Treaties. The higherthe quality of the proposals put forward by the Commission, the better thechances of success.6. The traditional purpose of this speech is to explain to you thebusiness that will occupy our Presidency. But I should like to concentrateon the broader themes which we hope to develop over the next six months,and I have therefore circulated a separate memorandum setting out thebusiness of our Presidency in more detail.7. The course of our Presidency, like all others, will be deeplyinfluenced by the economic and political environment, both in theCommunity and in the world outside. In the Community the twin evilsof inflation and unemployment remain with us, undefeated and daunting.These are the problems that are uppermost in the minds of the citizens ofall our countries. If Europe is to be seen to be relevant to their lives,we must tackle them with imagination and success. In its first fifteenyears the Community operated in conditions of expansion and economicgrowth. Now it has to face recession and structural change. Newchallenges call for new responses.8. Another problem that affects all members of the Community andto which we must find a Community response is that of energy. Both inour internal discussions and on the international stage, the Communityneeds to work coherently if her interests are to be effectively furtheredand defended.9. The problems of the budget also make this a crucial period in thehistory of the Community. The resources available have nearly reachedthe limit laid down for them by the original Six in 1970. Like nationalgovernments, the Community is having to look carefully at its spendingprogrammes to keep within the limit-albeit a growing one-which hasbeen laid down. This, combined with the need to restructure the budgetrecognised in the Council mandate of 30 May 1980, means that decisionsof far-reaching importance on the Community&apos;s policies and on the financingof them will need to be taken in the near future. These decisions aremade all the more necessary by the knowledge that two more EuropeanStates are seeking admission to the Community.55
10. if the Community&apos;s internal progress is beset with problems, thenthe international environment is far from serene. The shock caused bythe Soviet Union&apos;s brutal invasion of Afghanistan some 18 months agohas still not died away. Events in Poland are a continuous reminder thata crisis much nearer home could erupt at any moment. We recall withsadness the events in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968: andI think that most of us realise how quickly an even more serious crisiscould arise, with even more far-reaching consequences.11. But the lessons of Afghanistan can bring us advantage if we aredetermined to seek it. The Soviet occupation of that country has broughta new awareness in the Third World of the advantages of partnership withthe West and with Europe in particular. Areas like the Middle East lookto Europe to play a fuller role in these dangerous times. Here too wemust ensure that our response is adequate.12. It is natural that the life of relatively new institutions, like thisCommunity, should be full of critical decisions in its early years. Allthe great nation states have found the same in their early, testing times.Problems crown in on us from every side. Inevitably the search forsolutions will prove difficult and at times contentious. Some will doubtwhether the Community can rise to the challenge that faces it.13. Past experience shows that these doubts are likely to proveunfounded. There has been much steady but unsung progress in manyareas. And although the Community&apos;s history has been marked bysuccessive periods of difficulty, these have led to successive advances.Almost 12 years ago the Community of Six reached what it then perceivedas a crucial point in its development. The leaders of Europe at that timewere not discouraged. They understood the need to look beyond theimmediate problems and hold to a vision of the Europe they were tryingto create. The then French President pointed the way forward by settingthree targets for the Community-separate, but forming a whole like atriptych painted above an altar.14. The three targets were &quot; achevement, approfondissement, dargisse-ment&quot;. At the time this must have seemed an ambitious and a difficult goal.But to a greater or a lesser extent the Community has achieved all three.The &quot; completion&quot; was marked by the end of the 12 year transitionalperiod and the adoption of an independent financial system. &quot; Deepening &quot;,necessarily a continuing process, has admittedly only been achieved partially.But in the last twelve years the advances made in fields like regionalpolicy, social policy, environment, the internal market and the establishmentof the EMS are far from negligible achievements.15. As for enlargement, my presence here today is proof of achieve-ment. In 1973 and again in 1981 the Community grew by the admissionof new members. For Member States both old and new, that process hasbrought changes, new opportunities and-inevitably-some problems aswell. But experience has shown that adjustments take place to mutualadvantage. Take for instance the development of the United Kingdom&apos;strade with the rest of the Community. In 1972 before we joined theCommunity, some 30 per cent of our total trade was done with the EC;56
last year that figure was nearer 42 per cent. Enlargement has also widenedEurope&apos;s horizons, made it more representative of the people of Europe,enhanced stability and democracy in our continent and added to itsinternational weight.16. The Community now stands once more at a crossroads. Decisionsvital to its future development are due to be taken. If we are to succeedwe must retain a vision of where Europe is going and of the Europe wewant if we are not to become obsessed by our current problems. I shouldlike to propose a second triptych. Its first element should be &quot; renewal&quot;,the second, once more, is &quot; enlargement&quot;; and the third I shall call&quot; identity &quot;.17. I choose the word renewal because there can be no question ofoverthrowing or discrediting the real achievements the Community hasmade. The problem is to modify, adapt and strengthen existing policiesand where necessary to elaborate new ones. The Community and itsactivities require renewal if we are to tackle the problems of the 1980sand beyond.18. Enlargement means a successful repetition of the negotiations thatled to the admission first of Britain, Ireland and Denmark and then ofGreece. The admission of Spain and Portugal will mean more than theextension of the Community to the Iberian Peninsula. It will mean astrengthening of the forces for peace and democracy.19. By identity I mean the impact that Europe can and should haveon the events of the world outside if it is to protect and to further itsinterests. By the active exercise of influence in the world outside, Europecan develop the identity of which the Community is a symbol. And onlyif we are conscious of that identity can we play the active role ininternational affairs of which our citizens and those of the world outsidebelieve us to be capable.20. The basis of the Community&apos;s renewal must be the restructuring ofthe Community budget and the review of the Community&apos;s expenditurepolicies that goes with it. A useful start has already been made. TheCommission has put forward ideas and there has been a first discussionbetween Heads of State and Government. The Council agreed on 30 May1980 to aim for decisions by the end of this year. The British Presidencymust therefore make it a major objective to achieve decisive progress in thesix months ahead. Whether we succeed will not of course depend on usalone.21. The task before us is not insuperable as some might have youbelieve. There is already an emerging concentration on the three mainelements that must contribute to the restructuring that is required, and theseare reflected in the Commission&apos;s paper.22. The first is that there should be changes in the Common AgriculturalPolicy to discourage the production of surpluses and to limit the costs towhich they give rise. It can not be right that about half of the Community&apos;sbudget should be spent simply on the storage and disposal of surplus food.57
This is an expensive and wasteful anomaly that must be corrected-butnot so as to undermine the principles of the CAP or to lose the benefitEurope gains from having a healthy agricultural industry and security of foodsupplies. The Community must continue to support its agriculture asevery other country does. But we need to do it more economically. Thedebate last month in this House and the resolution then adopted shows thatview to be shared and supported by a wide spectrum of political opinion inall our countries.23. The second fact on which there is wide agreement is the mirror imageof the first. Just as too much is spent on agriculture so too small a share ofthe budget is devoted to other policies. In the 1950s it was reasonable toargue that the agricultural sector was particularly in need of support. Industryand the service sector could look after themselves. All they needed wasthe conditions of free competition provided by the Common Market. Thatis no longer the case. The relative security of income and employmentwhich many farmers enjoy has now, as a result of the recession, been deniedto many other sectors of the economy. The Community needs to devotemore resources to policies dealing with the problems of the &apos;80s: regionaldevelopment, rehabilitation and training, energy, and perhaps new policies forindustrial re-generation and urban renovation.24. The third element is to fulfil the pledge given on 30 May that noMember State is ever again to be faced with an unacceptable budgetarysituation. That is not, of course, to say that every Member State shouldreceive from the Community till a sum equivalent to that which it pays in.Policies have to be designed to be effective as policies, not just to ensurethat their cost is equally shared out. But if a Community based on consensusand the common good is to flourish and advance, then every Member Statehas to be broadly satisfied that the Community&apos;s financial basis is sound andequitable.25. There are two factors which act both as a constraint and as astimulus to decision making. The first is that the Community is fastapproaching the 1 per cent limit on the VAT contributions that make up thebulk of its budget resources, In a period in which so many Governments inEurope are facing unprecedented budgetary and financial discipline it is notsurprising that many people in the Community consider that the Communitytoo should live within its ceiling. It is in any case politically unrealistic toask for resources to be increased until it is clear that the budget has beenrestructured in such a way as to ensure that the excessive rate of growth ofagricultural expenditure has been curbed and that Member States will not becalled upon to make unreasonable or unacceptable contributions to it.26. The second factor is that of enlargement. It would not beappropriate formally to associate the two applicants with the decisions theCommunity must take. But it would be unjust and unwise not to takeaccount of the effects their membership will have. The objective after allis to make unacceptable situations impossible for any Member State, andthat must include the future as well as the actual members if we are toavoid disputes and if our agreement is to prove lasting.58
27. But the Community is about much more than just the budget. Theword renewal implies developing the Community to keep abreast of changesin the world outside. For a leading industrial power like the Community thatmeans developing our industrial base. If we are to win the fight againstinflation and unemployment we must adapt our industrial capacity to takefull advantage of advanced technology. Advanced technology is an areawhere Western Europe can and must be among the leaders. Only that waywill new jobs be created and our position in the world guaranteed.28. Renewal also means completing the Common Market. TheCommon Market in agriculture is an accomplished fact. So too to a largeextent is that in industrial products, though much work remains to be doneon non-tariff barriers and we intend to press ahead with that. But nowadaysthe service sector is almost as great a source of wealth and employment as isindustry. Services like insurance, banking and air travel, deserve to sharethe advantages enjoyed by their colleagues in manufacturing industry. Onlythat way will Member States and their people secure maximum benefit frommembership of the world&apos;s largest area of free trade.29. Renewal also means adapting the Community&apos;s regional and socialpolicies to the need of the 1980s. We need to continue the restructuringof traditional industries such as steel, textiles and shipbuilding so that theycan compete profitably in the modern world. We must enable our workforces to find jobs in the new industries that will have partially butincreasingly to replace the old heavy manufacturing industries. If we cannotcompete in this area, our prosperity will be at risk.30. The second word of my triptych was enlargement. The potentialfor enlargement is inherent in the Treaty of Rome. The recent accession ofGreece was welcome to us all. We now look towards Portugal and Spain.These countries&apos; admission to the Community will crown their return todemocracy. It is our duty to encourage and stabilise the new democraticsystems in those countries. We must make a success of the negotiations sothat membership of the Community is soundly and fairly based and cannotgive rise to disillusion or disappointment.31. A further enlargement of Europe is bound to bring problems in itswake. The institutional and economic complications of a Community of 12will need to be tackled with imagination and goodwill. But a successfulenlargement will strengthen Europe. There is no reason why the Europeanidea should be diluted or weakened. The accession of Portugal and Spainwill increase the confidence with which Europe can act domestically and inthe world outside.32. As the third element in my triptych I have chosen the word identity.It was the existence of a European identity that provided the first impetustowards the formation of the Community. We need to find ways ofreconfirming that identity so that Europe can play the role in the world thatour history makes appropriate and which other nations expect of us. IfEurope is to extend her influence then we shall need to look carefully atthe practical possibilities for exercising it.   It will not be enough to issue.59
resounding statements in the name of Europe. Europe must equip itself withthe organisation needed to formulate common policies and give practicaleffect to them.33. Much of the impact of Europe&apos;s identity in the world outside comesfrom the existing policies of the Community itself. The Community is nowthe world&apos;s largest economic unit in terms of GDP. The Ten account for20 per cent of the world&apos;s trade. The Community is a vital part of the world&apos;seconomic system, and has a part to play in many fora. As major tradingnations the Community has a vested interest in preserving the open tradingsystem from which we have all so greatly benefited since the last war andwhose absence before it was so disastrous. But the open trading system isnot easy to sustain in a period of world recession. As with peace, the price ofits maintenance is eternal vigilance.34. The best example of the Community&apos;s influence in favour of the opentrading system was the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations ofthe GATT. These were successfully concluded at the end of 1979, and weare now working constructively to implement the outcome of that round.This complex task is intended to take eight years; we are still only in thesecond. The proposal for a Ministerial level meeting of the GATTcontracting parties during 1982, which will provide an opportunity to reviewprogress in carrying out this task, is therefore to be welcomed.35. Meanwhile the Community is now preparing its position for theimportant GATT negotiations in prospect over the extension of the MultiFibre Arrangement. These negotiations are of great importance to theCommunity and to suppliers in the developing world and we must seek anoutcome which takes account of their concerns while allowing our hardpressed domestic textile industries to adjust in an orderly fashion to thechanging patterns of world trade.36. Among developed nations the 7-power summits make a majorcontribution to maintaining the orderly development of the world economy.The Ottawa Summit is due to take place later this month. The Communitywill be represented there by the Commission and by the Presidency, reflectingthe views Member Governments have expressed in the preparatorydiscussions. At that summit the Community will be working to maintain anopen trading system. But we shall not ignore the difficulties posed for thatsystem by the trading policies of individual nation states and will tackle themrealistically and firmly. In particular our trade relations with Japan aregoing through a sticky patch. We think that, given the size of theCommunity&apos;s trading deficit and the problems caused by the concentrationof Japanese exports in a few sensitive sectors, we have a good case to askfor some restraint on their part and for a determined and conscious effortby the well organised and effective Japanese economic establishment toincrease their purchases from Europe. At the same time we see only mutualbenefit in building with our Japanese friends a closer political partnership.37. The Community is not only involved in discussion of world economicproblems with the nations of the developed world. We are every bit asclosely concerned with the dialogue between parts of the world at different60
stages of economic development. This dialogue has become of increasingimportance in recent years and on its success hangs the future harmony andprosperity of the world.38. The Community has been a pioneer in establishing mutuallybeneficial trade links with developing countries. The Lornd Conventionbetween the European Community and some 60 countries in Africa,Caribbean, and the Pacific is an admirable example of the way in whichtrade, aid and co-operation should be so blended together as to bring aboutthe common advantage of the developed and developing world. TheCommunity will therefore be well placed to make a contribution to North/South discussions. The Community intends to play a constructive role in theUN Conference on the least developed countries and on new and renewablesources of energy in August, while the Mexico Summit in the autumn will beattended by three Member States of the Community including the Presidency.39. The external role of the Community is partly justified by its strengthas an economic institution. But the Community is more than just aneconomic institution, and it is understandable that other powers wish todevelop a relationship which is not exclusively economic and commercial.This natural and healthy development has resulted in, for example, theEuro/Arab Dialogue where contact between the countries of Europe andthose of North Africa and the Middle East can make a useful contribution togreater mutual understanding, and, eventually, to a solution of the conflictsof that area.40. Another economic grouping which has much in common with theEC is ASEAN. We welcome the increasingly close and friendly relationshipthe Community is developing with ASEAN, and our long-standing andimportant relationship with the countries of Latin America. The admissionof Portugal and Spain can only serve to reinforce our links with a region ofthe world that seems set to expand in prosperity and influence.41. We hope that the period of our Presidency will see importantdevelopments in these relationships. A meeting of the Euro-Arab Dialogueat Ministerial level is due to take place in the coming months, probablyNovember. And there will be an opportunity for political discussionbetween European and ASEAN Ministers when we meet together in Londonin October. Meanwhile I shall be attending, as President of the Ten, theinternational conference on Kampuchea which has been called by theSecretary-General of the United Nations and which starts in New York on13 July.42. The success and vitality of the European ideal is not, however,limited to the areas covered by the Treaties. Political Co-operation is anembodiment of the principle that the Ten speaking as one have more effectiveinfluence than if they speak with separate voices. Since the Luxembourg andCopenhagen reports on which political co-operation is based, we have comefar. Particularly striking has been the unanimity with which the Tenhave pursued their objectives at the meetings in the CSCE process, atHelsinki, Belgrade and, now, Madrid. It has also been gratifying to seethe growing impact of the Ten as a group at the United Nations. The61
habit of co-operation is now I believe firmly ingrained in our ForeignMinistries at all levels. A greater solidarity in times of crisis has increasedthe confidence and security of us all.43. Political Co-operation has been one of the success stories of Europein recent years. But there is more to be done. The Ten have proved betterat reacting to crises than at taking initiatives designed to forestall or resolvethem. And there have been times when our reaction has been too weakand too late. Our failures are partly due to weakness in the mechanismsof Political Co-operation and partly to the weakness of the commitmentto act together.44. But I believe we are learning from our mistakes: on Poland,Political Co-operation has worked more smoothly. The statements of theEuropean Council at critical moments have served to put on record Europe&apos;sdetermination to react firmly and decisively should Poland&apos;s right to settleher own affairs be interfered with. The rapid decisions of the Communityto provide food at special prices made a useful contribution at a time ofparticular difficulty for the Polish Government and people.45. Meanwhile, the action of the Ten over the Middle East has markeda new departure. Here at last Europe is not merely reacting to a crisis, buttrying to make a positive and substantial contribution to resolving a longstanding problem. The importance of the Middle East for the EuropeanCommunity, and the disproportionate contribution to security and peacethat a settlement of the Arab/Israel dispute could bring, make it essentialfor us to devote every effort to bringing a settlement nearer. During ourPresidency we shall continue to build on the basis laid down in earlierstatements by the Ten and on the valuable contacts undertaken since then byMr. Thorn and Mr. van der Klaauw. A peace settlement in the MiddleEast depends first and foremost on the political will of the parties directlyconcerned-Europe does not seek to solve the problem on its own. Wealso recognise the crucial role played by the United States with whom, likeour Luxembourg and Dutch predecessors, we shall maintain close contact.European and US efforts have been and will remain complementary. TheTen&apos;s task is to persuade all who will listen of the importance of apeaceful solution and the need for each side to accept the rights of the other,in accordance with the two fundamental and mutually balancing principlesset out at Venice.46. A second example of Political Co-operation on the move is theinitiative on Afghanistan announced by the European Council on 30 June.This is a serious attempt to find a political solution to the crisis inAfghanistan. We are proposing a two-stage conference to be held earlythis autumn. The work of the first stages will be to work out internationalarrangements designed to bring about the cessation of external interventionand safeguards to prevent it in the future and thus to create conditions inwhich Afghanistan&apos;s independence and non-alignment can be assured. Theparticipants would include the permanent members of the Security Counciland countries of the region as well as the Secretaries-General of the UnitedNations and the Islamic Conference. The second stage would also includerepresentatives of the Afghan people and its purpose would be to reachagreement on the implementation of the international arrangements and on62
all other matters designed to assure Afghanistan&apos;s future as an independentand non-aligned state. The European Council&apos;s proposal has been widelysupported.47. I have just come back from Moscow where I have been discussingthis with Mr. Gromyko. In explaining the proposal I made it plain that Iwas speaking on behalf of the Ten Member States of the EuropeanCommunity. I emphasised that the problem with which it dealt was one ofglobal significance and whose solution was essential in the interest of peace,stability and the development of East/West relations. I reminded the SovietGovernment that the Ten-and indeed the great majority of the internationalcommunity-are convinced that the complete withdrawal of Soviet troopsis an essential element of any solution. Mr. Gromyko took the view thatthe proposal by the Ten was, as he put it, &quot; unrealistic &quot;, because the mainproblem was intervention by others in the affairs of Afghanistan, becauseit was not stated that the present Afghan regime should participate at theoutset and because the proposed composition of the conference was unsatis-factory. I told him that I did not find these arguments convincing.Mr. Gromyko did not say that he rejected the proposal and did not excludefurther discussion. For my part I made it plain that the proposal, whichhas already received an encouraging degree of support in the internationalcommunity, remains on the table and that a positive response from theSoviet Union was highly desirable in the interests of world peace andstability. The proposal provides the best hope of a negotiated settlement,which is wanted by the international community, and which the Soviet Unionhas also said that they want. It is obvious that a Soviet refusal to negotiateon Afghanistan makes it impossible to speak of normal relations andprejudices efforts to reach agreement with the Soviet Union on other matters.Ours is a serious proposal, and I hope that on reflection the SovietGovernment will react in a constructive manner.48. But the gap between Europe&apos;s potential influence in the worldand what it has actually achieved is still too wide. If Political Co-operationis to prove adequate to the expectations that are increasingly laid upon it,then we will need to strengthen the existing arrangements. The NetherlandsPresidency have already done good work in preparing for this. The UKPresidency will carry on the task. It is one to which I attach particularimportance and a number of my colleagues have made it clear thatthis feeling is widely shared.49. Progress in Political Co-operation can never be a substitute forprogress with the activities of the Community. They are, when all is said,but two sides of the same coin. We must build up our cohesion and unity onboth fronts.50. I have described the main themes which will guide the UnitedKingdom Presidency. I hope I have given sufficient indication of thecommitment and the determination which we intend to bring to the task.51. To say that Europe is at a turning point is not to say that Europeis in crisis. On the contrary, I think the triple objective of which I havespoken, renewal, enlargement and identity, could point the way forwardfor the Community.   The achievements and the progress of the last 2563
years are astonishing if one considers the different political and economicstructures and the varied historical traditions of the Member States. Thisprogress was achieved often painfully and in conditions of tension andnear crisis. Too often the agreements of the Community pass unnoticedand it is only the headlines about clashes and confrontations that areremembered. But in the sweep of history, it is the progress that countsand the difficulties that are forgotten.52. Today the success or failure of the Community has becomeincreasingly important to the world as a whole. A successful resolution ofour internal problems is essential if Europe is to make the contribution tosecurity and peace that the world requires and which it alone is capable ofoffering. Britain is committed to playing its full part in this commonenterprise in which we have all invested such high hopes. During ourPresidency we shall shoulder our responsibilities in the knowledge that thebest contribution we can make is to discharge our duties efficiently, fairlyand in the spirit of loyalty to the European ideal without which no progresscan be made.64
FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY&apos;S SPEECH TOTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: 17 DECEMBER 19811. I have a double duty today. I shall be reporting to you on thesix-month period during which the United Kingdom has held the Presidencyof the Council. And I shall also report on developments throughout thepast year in the field of Political Co-operation, the first six months ofwhich was under the chairmanship of the Netherlands.2. The President of the European Council spoke to you yesterdayabout the European Council meeting in November and her statement wasfollowed by a short debate. This afternoon will provide an opportunityfor further comments on the issues Mrs. Thatcher raised, as well as thoseI shall be covering in my own report.3. When I outlined the main objectives of the British Presidency tothis House on 8 July, I drew attention to the short time which a six-month period represents in the affairs of the European Community. Iwarned against exaggerated hopes for what could be achieved under anyone Presidency, and emphasised my belief that the keynote for thePresidency should be to contribute in a business-like and effective mannerto the continuum of the Community&apos;s affairs. This is what we have triedto do.4. Many of the agreements reached in any one Presidency owe muchto the efforts of its predecessors. And in many of the areas where thecurrent Presidency has worked hardest, results will only become apparentunder a succeeding Presidency. Ample evidence of this is to be foundin the memorandum(I) which I have circulated separately, to give honour-able Members as full as possible a picture of the state of the numerousdossiers at the end of the British Presidency.5. I think that, at a rough count, this shows that some 70 newcommunity measures were adopted by the Council in the past six months-most of them in fields to which your Parliament attaches importance.It is a record of solid if unspectacular achievement, in which all the organsof the Community have played their part. The Commission of coursehas a key role in helping to maintain the essential continuity betweenPresidencies. I believe the European Parliament too has its part to playin this by sustained support of generally agreed Community objectives.6. In the last six months, the Community has been faced withfundamental decisions about its own future development. There has alsobeen a growing awareness that political leaders in Member States must beready to look beyond the pressing daily problems which confront theCommunity towards wider horizons, so as to see more clearly the wayahead for Europe. I myself referred to this when I addressed you inJuly. I think that the same feeling is reflected in the proposals maderecently by the Governments of Italy and the Federal Republic of GermanyO Not printed-laid in the House of Commons Library.65
for a &quot; European Act&quot; and in the ideas put forward by the FrenchGovernment with particular reference to the development of the Com-munity&apos;s internal policies.7. In my speech in July I outlined a &quot; triptych&quot; which I suggestedmight form a basic framework for the future development of the Com-munity; those ideas I called &quot; renewal &quot;, &quot; enlargement&quot; and &quot; identity &quot;.I should like now to review briefly the progress made under these threeheadings at the end of the British Presidency.8. The basis for the renewal of the Community is the review of itspolicies to which Member States committed themselves in the agreementof 30 May 1980. It has been a major objective of the British Presidencyto make solid progress on this. Given the deadline set in that agreementitself, it would have been a serious dereliction of our duty to the Communityto do otherwise. The President of the European Council reported yesterdayon the outcome of the European Council meeting in London on 26-27November at which there was substantial discussion of this matter. I neednot therefore dwell on the detail of the discussions that have taken place.Foreign Ministers met on 14-15 December at the express request of theEuropean Council. We were able to have a useful discussion and askedthe President of the Commission to produce new texts on guide-lines onthe four outstanding issues, which I hope will enable agreement to bereached at a further special meeting to be held early in January. I wouldnaturally have liked to be able to reach agreement on this matter duringour Presidency, but I believe we have laid good foundations for the futurework, and it will now be for the Belgian Presidency to carry mattersforward. We for our part will give the fullest possible support to theirefforts to reach a speedy solution, which is in all our interests.9. But the renewal of the Community goes much wider than a simplereview of its expenditure policies. An important part of it is the comple-tion of the framework provided for in the Treaties, and on this I am gladto report that there has been some progress during the British Presidency.Though useful progress has been made over marketing, overall agreementon a new Common Fisheries Policy has still to be reached. It is nowlong overdue; the security and prosperity of the fishing industry in allour countries is at stake.10. Another area where much work has been done is the completionof the internal market, which was the subject of an important debate inthis Parliament on 14 October. We have tried to make a reality of theTreaty provisions for a single market in goods and services, and to makeprogress with eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade within the Community.Although we have made some headway, the Community has madedisappointingly little progress towards full liberalisation in such fields asinsurance and air transport. It is in the interests of all of us to makeprogress on these matters, since they offer the best hope of securing realbenefits from membership of the world&apos;s largest area of tariff-free trade.11. Renewal also involves developing the Community to keep abreastof changes in the world outside. The Community consists of some of theworld&apos;s most advanced industrial nations, and advanced technology provides66
us with a powerful weapon in the fight for competitivity and thus forlasting and secure employment. I am therefore glad to report that wehave made significant progress in this area during our Presidency,particularly on research and development. Nor has the social impact ofnew technologies been neglected. Ministers of Employment and SocialAffairs have discussed this question with the Social Partners.12. Energy policy is another vital field for a grouping of industrialisedcountries. Here there have been some valuable discussions about thegeneral need to restructure energy economies away from oil. The agree-ment reached on guidelines for dealing with a limited shortfall in oilsupplies and the agreement reached on energy pricing policy will be avaluable contribution to attaining the agreed Community energy objectives.13. I am glad to say that there have been significant achievements infields where ordinary people will benefit directly. These include environ-mental matters, on which a variety of useful decisions were taken by theEnvironment Council on 3 December, particularly in the fields of pollutioncontrol and public safety, and social affairs, where there have been importantadvances on provisions for the self employed and help for the disabled.14. In all these areas, and in the many others outlined in thememorandum, our approach has been based on a firm conviction. TheCommunity can only advance and prosper if it is able to secure and retainthe understanding and support of its citizens. To do so, it must show itselfto be flexible enough to keep pace with a world of rapid change; and dynamicenough to offer a lead rather than simply responding to events.15. The economic background to our work in the past 6 months hasbeen sombre. Unemployment has risen remorselessly in even the strongestof our economies. Inflation is proving stubborn. The difficulty of curbingGovernment deficits is exacerbated by the effects of recession. Divergenceamong Community states has increased rather than diminished. We mustredouble our efforts to create the conditions for that non-inflationary growthwhich is the only source of durable employment. We must resist the easybut fatal options of protectionism. We must ensure that our people appre-ciate that the challenge of competition in the 1980s requires us to adapt thestructure of our economies. And there must be the closest co-operation inthese efforts between all of us in the Community.16. The second of the three key issues about which I spoke to youon 8 July was enlargement. As Mrs. Thatcher told the House yesterday,the Ten Heads of State and Government confirmed in London theCommunity&apos;s commitment to complete the accession negotiations withSpain and Portugal. Meanwhile, in the accession negotiations themselves Iam glad to say that we have been able to build on the solid foundationsestablished by the Netherlands Presidency and to take the work forward insome significant respects.17. We believe that real progress has been made towards the objectiveswhich we set ourselves at the outset of the Presidency. But it must befrankly recognised that there is still a major task ahead for the Belgianand Danish Presidencies if the applicants are to realise their desire to accedeon 1 January 1984.67
18. Nobody underestimates the difficulties we face in the negotiations.Both the Community and the applicant countries have much to do toprepare for the new situation which will arise on accession. But theCommunity&apos;s political obligation to the future of democratic Europetranscends the individual issues which are at stake and compels us to takea wider view. It is time to give the negotiations a new political impetus, andto ensure that the statement which Heads of Government approved on27 November does not remain mere rhetoric.19. The third part of my triptych was &quot; identity &quot;, or the expressionof the Community&apos;s personality on the world stage. Throughout its periodof office, the British Presidency has tried to put into practice its firmbelief that the Community should exert an influence in world affairs moreappropriate to its position as the world&apos;s largest economic grouping, tradingentity, and donor of aid to the developing world.20. Here too there is some useful progress to report. Decisions weretaken both at the Development Council on 3 November and at meetings ofthe Foreign Affairs Council on ways to improve the effectiveness of theCommunity&apos;s aid to the less developed countries. Agreement was reachedon Community positions in a number of important trade negotiationsincluding the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, trade with Japan, and export credits.Successful joint Commission and other meetings were held with a number ofthird countries.21. The Community has also made an important and distinctivecontribution to a number of multi-lateral meetings, including the OttawaSummit meeting in July and the Cancun meeting in Mexico in October. Ithas been prominent among those endorsing the commitment of the inter-national community to a new round of global negotiations. Importantdecisions have also been taken on the further provision of food at specialprices to Poland.22. In my speech to this Parliament six months ago I referred to theLuxembourg and Copenhagen Reports on which Political Co-operation wasbased. I am proud to say that to those two documents we have added theLondon Report. Over the period since the Copenhagen Report was agreedwe have all found Political Co-operation to be useful and important. Wehave also found in third countries a growing expectation that Europe willspeak with one voice and a growing wish for a dialogue with the Ten assuch. It was therefore time for us to look again at the way PoliticalCo-operation was organised. We agreed to do this under the LuxembourgPresidency; much of the difficult work was done under the Dutch Presidencyand in our Presidency we brought it to a conclusion. But it is the work of allof the Ten: I believe it has been useful to register our strengthened politicalcommitment to joint action in foreign affairs, to set up an agreed procedurefor convening meetings quickly in a crisis and for giving extra support tothe Presidency in its increasingly demanding role. I note also that the LondonReport registers the Ten&apos;s legitimate interest in political aspects of securityand ensures the Commission will be fully associated at all levels with PoliticalCo-operation.68
23. During the British Presidency, the Ten have continued their effortsto promote progress towards a just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeldispute. This is a difficult period in Middle East diplomacy: Israel&apos;swithdrawal from Sinai is shortly to be completed; but the positions of theparties remain wide apart on the central questions of Palestinian rights andIsraeli security. We have seen the pursuit of peace becoming more, not less,complicated, most recently through the decision of the Israeli Governmentand Knesset to extend Israeli law to occupied Syrian territory in the Golanheights, an act which the Governments of the Ten strongly deplore. Thesedevelopments call for the Ten to adhere to a consistent policy based on thetwo principles clearly set out at Venice and universally accepted by theinternational community, namely the right to existence and security of allstates in the region including Israel, and self-determination for thePalestinians in the framework of a comprehensive peace.24. I believe that it is right for Europe to be closely involved, and wehave done our best to maintain the involvement in a positive and impartialway. During our Presidency I visited Riyadh on behalf of the Ten todiscuss the eight principles set out by Crown Prince Fahad, which weregard as an encouraging sign of movement in the Middle East. Four of theTen have also agreed to participate in the Sinai Multinational Force. TheTen have given their support to this decision. We believe that byparticipating in the Sinai force we can make a constructive contribution topeace in the Middle East.25. The Community has also contributed actively to internationalefforts to restore independence and non-alignment to Afghanistan. As theParliament knows the European Council in June put forward a proposalfor a two stage conference on Afghanistan; and I subsequently visitedMoscow to put this to Mr. Gromyko on behalf of the Ten. We believe thatthis proposal represents a realistic and practical way out of the current tragicand unacceptable situation. It has been endorsed by a large number ofcountries including many from the third world, and it remains on the table.The Russians bear a heavy responsibility for the terrible suffering whichthey have caused the Afghan people, and they must show the political willto remove their army of occupation from Afghanistan. The recent votein the UN General Assembly made it clear that the views of the Ten on thissubject are evidently shared by an overwhelming majority of the nationsof the world.26. An area of particular concern to the Ten throughout the BritishPresidency has been East-West relations. On 15 December, the Tenexpressed their concern at recent developments in Poland together with theirprofound sympathy for the Polish people in this tense and difficult time.They reiterated their view that the Polish people should solve their problemspeacefully and in a spirit of compromise, and without outside interference,so that the process of reform and renewal can continue.27. In the 48 hours since the Ten Foreign Ministers met in Londonthe Polish skies have continued to darken.  We are familiar, alas only too69
familiar, with natural disasters, but here in the heart of our continent is aman-made disaster on a colossal scale. Although news is censoredand communications cut and diplomatic facilities suspended, we read ofarrests and detentions and evictions. There has almost certainly been someloss of life. There is an ominous silence about the fate of Lech Walesa.I should not want to see the situation made more difficult by any wordsof mine. There is much that I could say but will leave unsaid. But twothings seem to me clear. First, as has been said so often before, there mustbe no foreign interference whatever. And second, there must be an earlyresumption of the process of negotiation and conciliation, including therelease of those in detention. That alone can produce a solution to Poland&apos;sproblems. I note that assurances on this subject were given yesterday inWarsaw by what is called the Military Council of National Salvation. ThisParliament and the world will be watching to see how those assurances areput into effect. The Ten will continue to follow events in Poland withparticular attention and we stand ready to arrange urgent consultations ifthese should become necessary.28. In Madrid we have been working for a balanced and substantialconclusion to the CSCE meeting. Some progress has been made, butproposals for a Conference on Disarmament in Europe and in the field ofhuman rights remain unresolved. The Ten have been clear and united inour wish for real progress rather than vaguely worded or cosmetic agree-ments. I should add that co-ordination in Madrid with other friendlydelegations, including the United States, has been excellent. There have,however, been more positive developments in East-West relations. Wewarmly welcome the start of talks on intermediate range nuclear weapons inGeneva between the United States and the Soviet Union and the constructiveproposals made by President Reagan. We hope that the Soviet Union willrespond positively. The full and frank talks Chancellor Schmidt had withPresident Brezhnev were also particularly welcome given the emphasis placedby the European Council in November on the importance of keeping openchannels of communication for dialogue with the Soviet Union.29. Time does not permit me to give a full account of all the activitiesof the Ten, but I should draw attention to the interesting and importantmeeting I and my colleagues had in London with the Foreign Ministers ofthe ASEAN countries. I have circulated in the Parliament a statement bythe Ten on the progress made over the Code of Conduct on employmentpractices in South Africa, which we believe is an important instrument ofpeaceful change there. I should also like to mention the high level ofco-ordination by the Ten at the United Nations in New York. Performancecannot be measured only by common statements and explanations of votebut it is nevertheless encouraging that we have done better than ever beforein this respect-a reflection I think of the growing importance we attachto working together.30. Finally, I should say that I have noted the keen interest thisParliament takes in Political Co-operation. A Presidency Minister waspresent throughout the Parliament&apos;s recent debate on Political Co-operation,and we have listened with care to the views of members.  I have conducted70
two interesting colloquies with the Political Affairs Committee of theParliament and these also have proved a useful channel of communicationbetween the Presidency and the Parliament.31. When I last had the privilege of speaking before this House, inJuly, I emphasised the British Presidency&apos;s determination to make ourrelations an effective dialogue and not an exercise in mutual frustration. Weare partners, not adversaries, in the enterprise of making a success ofEurope; and this important truth has been reflected in many ways duringour Presidency. I should like to take this opportunity formally to welcomethe contribution of the Parliament and say how grateful my colleagues and1 have been for the warm welcome you have always given us and for theco-operation we have enjoyed (and 1 should like here to pay tribute to thework of our respective Secretaries who have had to shoulder their shareof the extra efforts we have been making which, without them, would havebeen much harder).32 As I said at the beginning of my speech, the time which a Presidencyhas at its disposal to realise even the most modest of its objectives is limited.Nor would it be right for me to suggest that all has been plain sailing duringthis period. What I might call the dark side of the picture is the number ofcauses we have for regret that progress was not made. It is not to theCommunity&apos;s credit that we have not been able to meet the deadline set bythe 30 May mandate; nor that after six years of discussion and live meetingsof Finance Ministers during our Presidency alone, we have not been able toagree on the non-life insurance services directive; nor that Foreign Ministershave been unable to agree on important measures in the field of tele-communications because of disagreement over one word.33. I am sorry to say that one of the pieces of unfinished businessderived from the outcome of your vote this morning on the 1982 Budget.As the President of the Budget Council said, this goes beyond what theCouncil was prepared to agree and therefore budgetary procedure remainsincomplete. I understand all this will be discussed by the Council inBrussels. I can only express the hope that we are not now heading, for athird year running, towards a budget dispute.34. The paradox which the Community needs to resolve is that in thesetimes of political and economic uncertainty it seems to be becomingincreasingly difficult, at the same time as it becomes more necessary, to getdecisions. We have tried to demonstrate the tenacity and endurance whichare needed in every Presidency; but even they are not enough if there is nocommon will to reach conclusions, and that is what I fear has too often beenlacking in our deliberations.35. I sometimes hear it said that the Community makes no progress andthat the Council in particular is indecisive. I think that the record of thepast six months, like that of previous Presidences, shows that this is onlypart of the truth. Progress has been encouraging particularly in areas suchas the environment, social policy and energy policy which are still relativelynew sectors for Community activity. As I have said, there remain manythings which we would have liked to have done during our Presidency, and71
some important outstanding problems remain. I have no doubt however thatwe can find solutions to these questions and I commit the British Governmentto giving the Belgian Presidency every support we can in this task.NOTEFigures illustrating United Kingdom visible trade with the Communityduring 1981 are not available due to industrial action by civil servants.20995-13   313831   Dd 0593004  C13 3/82
