CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO q qC(82) 21 February 1982CABINETALTERNATIVES TO DOMESTIC RATES:  NEXT STEPSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment*. In my minute of 17 December to the Prime Minister: I said that Iplanned to consult our supporters in Parliament about the Green Paper,&quot;Alternatives to Domestic Rates&quot; (Cmnd 8449).    I thought it would be usefulto put to colleagues the basis on which this consultation is about to proceed.2. The present position is that we have invited comments on the GreenPaper by 31 March, and that further interdepartmental work on &quot;gainers andlosers&quot; under the alternative taxes should be available in April.    In the normalcourse of work, I would therefore be coming forward to colleagues in May withconclusions based on this further work and an analysis of the results of thepublic consultation.    The Green Paper of course points to one of the forms ofLocal Income Tax (LIT) and Local Sales Tax (LST), supplemented by poll taxor &quot;reformed rates&quot;, as the front-running alternatives if we go for a new mainlocal tax.    The preliminary analysis of &quot;gainers and losers&quot; published in theGreen Paper suggests that the better off would pay more with these alternativesthan they do with the present system.3- Our supporters however will expect us to act before the next GeneralElection.    This would point, at best, to enactmsnt of legislation before theElection or, at the very least, the issue of a White Paper in 1983 based ondetailed propositions followed, if possible, by the publication/introduction of aBill before the Election.ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION4- In considering a timetable for action, we should have in mind severalconsiderations.    The most important is the time which would elapse betweenthe enactment of any legislation to provide for an alternative tax and itsimplementation.    As the Green Paper explained, in the case of LST this wouldhe well into the next Parliament (1987) and in the case of LIT well into thefollowing Parliament (the early 1990s).    In both cases, as set out in the GreenPaper, progress with computerisation of Pay As You Earn and Value AddedTax is critical.    But other considerations are that a major tax change needs a1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlong period of consultation in order to ensure a smoothly running system, inaddition to working through the details;  and that in this case there will almostcertainly be complicated repercussions for the block grant system. Forthese reasons, legislation in 1982-83 would be impracticable.    Legislation onUT or LST even in 1983-84 would entail a dangerous risk of inadequateconsideration, yet would not advance the starting date for the new tax. Giventhe time that would elapse between enactment and implementation, this wouldlead to serious embarrassment.    (The timings are set out in the annex to thispaper.)5. If this analysis is correct, the only option discussed in the Green Paperon which we might be able to introduce legislation in 1982-83, if we put work inhand now in advance of the outcome of consultation on the Green Paper, is areformed rating system based on capital valuation, which would be implementedabout 1988 on completion of new valuations.    This, hov/ever, would meet onlyone of the objections to the rating system, and in particular would not relaterates to ability to pay.    I would add too that my own view is that such aProposal is politically unacceptable to our Party.    It would also be possible toinclude in that legislation, if we wished to do so, some of the alternatives forredistributing the burden of rates a little more fairly.    (Paragraphs 4.14-4. 25of the Green Paper. )6. Colleagues, and, in particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Education and Science, will wish to note that there maybe some support for reducing rate bills by transferring some or all of the costof education to the Exchequer, as discussed in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Annex Bto the Green Paper.    There are obvious difficulties:  we would appear to goback on a Manifesto commitment;  there would be an additional financialburden for the Exchequer requiring some tax or taxes to be increased; and nr supporters in the local education authorities would not be happy with adiminution of their role.A WHITE PAPER BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION7- An alternative to enactment of legislation before a General Electionwould be to set our sights on the issue of a White Paper next year, so that weenter the General Election with a convincing posture on an alternative tax.This would mean that we would reach a conclusion on a package in the summer,after we have completed further work on &quot;gainers and losers&quot; and analysed theresponse to the Green Paper.NON-DOMESTIC RATES8  In considering domestic rates, we must bear in mind that although non-domestic rates do not come directly within the scope of the Green Paper, dis-content with them is growing steadily and that we shall come under increasingPressure to state our intentions as to their future form and scope. This dis-content will diminish to the extent that inflation is brought under control.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALChapter 10 of the Green Paper makes clear, however, that the only reliablesafeguard for the non-domestic sector following a move to a new domesticsystem would be to exercise control over non-domestic poundages in a waywhich would effectively turn non-domestic rates into an assigned revenue.CONCLUSION9. In the light of the timetables summarised in the annex, I invitecolleagues&apos; views on:a. whether to decide now to legislate in 1982-83 for &quot;reformed&quot;domestic rates (paragraph 5);b. whether to examine urgently the possibility of taking over all orpart of financial responsibility for education from local government(paragraph 6);c. whether instead to proceed towards the issue of a White Paper in1983 following consideration this summer of the outcome of consultationon the Green Paper (paragraph 7).M HApartment of the EnvironmentF ebruary 19823CONFIDENTIAL
