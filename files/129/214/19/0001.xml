SECRET-UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 19COPY NO    0 05 May 1982CABINETTSRB REPORT No. 18:  OPTIONS FOR ABATEMENTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. Cabinet on 29 April (CC(82) 21st Conclusions, Minute 3) agreed toaccept the rates of pay for senior civil servants, senior Service officersand the Judiciary recommended in the 18th Report of the Top SalariesReview Body (TSRB) subject to an abatement in the range of five percentagepoints to one-third of the increases in pay which would result from fullimplementation.    I was invited, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor,the Secretary  f State for Defence and the Lord Privy Seal, to produceoptions for implementing this decision.2. The reasons behind Cabinet&apos;s decision were:-a. We believed that acceptance in full of the recommendations ofthe Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) (which would have ledto an increase in the pay cf Doctors and Dentists averaging 9 per centas from;l April 1982) would jeopardise the success of the currentnegotiations on National Health Service pay and that accordingly therate of increase to be implemented for Doctors and Dentists should bereduced on average to 6 per cent.b. We did not believe that we could ask the Doctors and Dentiststo accept this proposal if a similar cut were not also made in therates of pay recommended in the 18th Report of the TSRB for seniorcivil servants, senior Service officers and the Judiciary.3. The attached table illustrates three options for achieving the abatementwe had in mind:-a. Option AReduce the increase in the pay of those covered by the TSRB reportby 5 percentage points (the amount by which on average their currentpay falls short of that recommended as appropriate at 1 April 1980).It could then be argued that both the TSRB and DDRB groups werebeing asked to absorb existing shortfalls on past review bodyrecommendations.    However, apart from the fact that the shortfallson past TSRB and DDRB salary recommendations relate to differentperiods (TSRB is a shortfall on 1980 recommendations:  DDRB on 1983recommendations) this option takes no account of changes in theinternal relativity of TSRB pay rates which have occurred in recentyears# notably ao a yooult of the rcotrueturing of judicial salariedwhich took place in I98I.1SECRET
SECRETb. Option BReduce the increase in the pay of the TSRB groups by on--third.This could then be presented as an equivalent sacrifice to that beingsuffered by the DDRB groups (whose pay this year will be ir creasedby 6 instead of 9 per cent).    Again this is not an easy option to defendin detail.    The average actual cut in the proposed increases in TSRBsalaries would be 7 percentage points out of 2.2 and the problem ofinternal relativities would remain.c. Option CIn view of the difficulties with both options A and B I haveillustrated in the table a third option (Option C) which, while basedon the one-third cut option, seeks to allocate the increases toindividuals in ways which preserve the pattern of internalrelativities set by TSRB 18.    It is also very modestly moregenerous to the lowest ranks in each group in order to provide alittle more &apos;clear water&apos; between them and the ranks immediatelybelow (eg Brigadiers and equivalents in the Armed Forces whosepay is now to be increased, following the Armed Forces Pay ReviewBody recommendations, to  22, 750 and the senior AssistantSecr3taries whose pay, following the Civil Service ArbitrationTribunal award, will be  22, 200).    Additionally I have sought toensure that no individual will suffer a greater cut under this optionthan under option B.    The combined effect of my proposals is toreduce the weighted average increase in TSRB salaries from currentlevels from the 21.9 per cent recommended by the TSRB to16.5 per cent;  and the increases over 1980 recommended levelsfrom 16. 6 per cent to 11. 3 per cent.^ If we adopt Option C-as I myself recommend - we will still face adifficult task explaining to those concerned why they should be more harshlytreated than the Doctors and Dentists.    But I do not think we should seekelaborate mathematical justifications.    The internal line, I suggest, shouldbe the simple one that, having decided not to implement the DDRB report infull, we felt obliged to abate the TSRB recommendations and that the abate-ment we have suggested i3, in our judgment, the minimum, necessary in thecircumstances.    Externally our critics will concentrate on the size of theincreases not on that of the abatement.    Our answer to them should be robust.We have a duty to ensure that new reccuits to the judicial bench are ofsuitable calibre;  and we have a duty to provide adequate career prospectsand adequate rewards on promotion at the upper reaches of the Civil Serviceand the Armed Forces to enable them to function efficiently.    Our decisionsrepresent our judgment of the minimum pay increases needed to fulfilthese duties.5&apos; Cabinet on 29 April envisaged tha,t ws should  .*ek t  corns to aconclusion about the TSRB recommendations on 6 May, in order to be in aPosition to announce them, together with the other pay decisions, thatafternoon.   I accordingly attach a preliminary draft of a passage for possibleinclusion in the overall announcement.G HTreasury Chambers5 May 19822SECRET
SECRETDRAFT TSRB PASSAGE FOR THE PAY STATEMENT1. The Report of the Top Salaries Review Body recommends increasesin the pay of the higher Civil Service and senior officers of the ArmedForces averaging 13 per cent, and for the Judiciary 20 per cent, above thelevels they recommended as appropriate at 1 April i980.    The combinedincrease averages 16. 6 per cent.    Because the 1980 recommendations havefor the most part not been fully implemented the increases over the salariescurrently in payment are somewhat higher:  19.4 per cent for the CivilService and the Armed Forces;  24. 3 per cent for the Judiciary; and21.9 per cent overall.2. The Government has no dovbt that substantial increases in thesalaries of these groups are now justified.    It is in the national interestthat we ensure an adequate supply of candidates of sufficient calibre forappointment to the Judicial Bench, and we need to provide an adequatecareer structure and suitable differentials in the higher reaches of the CivilService and the Armed Forces to enable these vital organisations tofunction efficiently.    At the same time, and particularly in view of itsdecision on the pay of Doctors and Dentists, the Government does not feelthat it can implement the recommendations of the TSRB in full despite thepowerful arguments advanced in favour oi them in the Review Body&apos;s report.3. The precise level of abatement to be applied to the TSRB recommendaitions is a matter of judgment.    Full details of the Government&apos;s decisionsare being made available in the Vote Office as are copies of the TSRB reportitself.    Broadly speaking the Government&apos;s decision means a weightedaverage increase in the salaries of the higher Civil Service and seniorOfficers of the Armed Forces of 14. 3 per cent over salaries currently inpayment and 8.0 per cent over the recommended rates of salary for1 April 1980.    The equivalent figures for the Judiciary are 18. 6 per centand 14. 5 per cent.    The combined figures are 16. 6 per cent on averageabove current salary levels and 11.3 per cent above the salary levelsrecommended in 1980.NOTE:   The figures in the final three sentences above as bum e thai C\binetwill choose Option C.SECRET
