CONFIDENTIAL1-     The last year has brought no easing of tensions between East and West.Soviet Union has again displayed its readiness to make use of militaryPower both directly and indirectly in pursuit of political objectives. Sovietforces in Afghanistan are brutally suppressing popular resistance withcomplete disregard for international opinion and law. Soviet forces inEastern Europe were deployed on several occasions in recent months to increasePressure on the Polish people to halt the reform process; and Soviet leaders^re closely involved in planning the imposition of martial law in Poland.Above all, the rapid build-up of Soviet nuclear and conventional forces hascontinued unabated. . In the face of all this, Western governments have had no ohoice hut to&lt;ake  urther steps to strengthen their collective defences. For our part, we  . taken fundamental decisions to modernise our strategic nuclear deterrent, * to re-structure our conventional forces. This Statement on the Defencet i .t.. describe, those decisions in some detail, and sets out theconsiderations which led to them.Chapter 1 explains our reasons for modernising the United Kingdom&apos;segic nuclear deterrent with the Trident II system.    We acknowledge theCerity of those who criticise this decision on moral grounds, or who arguefor an -ialternative use of resources.   Nevertheless, we believe they are wrong.SeQgJV-ie people everywhere abhor the fearsome potential of nuclear weapons,and the Goveiand determination.    But while nuclear weapons remain in the hands ofirnment will pursue the cause of multilateral arms reductions withvi ourPotential enemies, we believe - as do our Allies - that it would be folly1CONFIDENTIAL

Chapter 4 deals with one of the greatest problems which we face in themanagement of defence - the rapidly escalating real cost of defence equipment^ a result of technological developments. This means that, although we arespending much more on defence equipment in real terms, we are getting eversmaller numbers of ships, aircraft and tanks. Since the publication of Cmnd8288, we have been seeking new ways of defining our operational concepts,formulating our equipment requirements and conducting our relationship withIndustry.   We must be prepared to adopt radically new approaches.Chapter 5 gives an account of our management of the defence budget, andPersistent   search   for  economies,  both  financial and manpower.

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTERwe announced on 15 July 1980 our, decision to replace our existing laris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) nuclear deterrent fce with the Trident I (C4) missile deployed in a new generation ofBritish-built submarines.I02. nuur reasons for retaining an independent deterrent were set out indetail iin Defence Open Government Document (DOGD) 80/23, but the main pointsareummarised here.    The question to be answered is whether the possessionthis country of an independent and invulnerable strategic deterrent wouldmake it- m ,*s more or less likely that the Soviet Union would mount a conventionalnuclear attack on us and our NATO Allies.   There can be no doubt aboutanswer.   Deterrence is a matter of showing to a potential aggressor thatrisks involved in starting a war far outweigh any possible gains hemightmake.   The striking power of our nuclear forces ensures the risk ofing damage to him - more damage than any rational being could regard asCePtable for a military adventure in Europe.   This is not to say that theUnited *ikingdom deterrent is a substitute for the American nuclear guarantee;the UnitedStates has consistently shown by its maintenance of strong conven-1-1CONFIDENTIAL
/ CONFIDENTIALtional and nuclear forces in Europe that it sees its own security asindissolubly linked to that of Western Europe.   But those who argue thatexpenditure on Trident would be better devoted to strengthening ourconventional forces must consider whether future Soviet leaders are morelikely to be deterred by an invulnerable second strike SLBM force or, f rexample, two additional armoured divisions with 300 extra tanks (even ifthis were a sensible alternative), given that the Warsaw Pact already outnumbers NATO in tanks by some 30,000.103.     At the time of our original Trident announcement we made clear thatfurtherbefore detailed decisions were taken on the design of the submarines, *?studies and discussions with the United States authorities would be necessa JThe main outstanding decisions related to the size of the hull, both i of the diameter of the boats and the number of missile tubes to be installin each; the nuclear propulsion plant to be adopted; and the design of thetactical weapons system.   The latter is the complex of sonars and otherdefensive aids which makes a major contribution to ensuring that the submaremain undetected, and hence invulnerable to pre-emptive attack, while onpatrol.    The United States&apos; decision, announced in October 1981, to developthe Trident II (D5) SLBM, with a view to its deployment by the United StatesNavy from 1989, was an additional factor to be taken into account.104.     On 11 March 1982, we announced our decisions on the design of ournd waSnew Trident submarines and the missile they should carry.    The backgrouset out in a further Open Government Document (The United Kingdom TridentProgramme - D0GD 82/1) but is summarised below.1-2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL105. The decisions to be taken on the front section of the submarine involvedthe tactical weapons system - that is, principally, the boat&apos;s sonars. WeW now decided that, rather than installing the sonars fitted to our currenthunter-killer submarines (SSNs), we should adopt for our new strategic sub-lines (SSBNs) improved sonars which are now being developed. The newerequips will significantly improve the submarines&apos; defensive capability,will have the potential for further development to counter increasedSoviet capabilities during the life of the force. As well as the improveddetection aids,   each  of  the  submarines  will have  torpedo  tubes  for selfdefence.106. We had originaliy planned to fit the new generation of SSBNs with theP^ssurised water reactor (PWR 1) which is being installed in the SSNs nowbuilding. But we have under development a new reactor and propulsion system^ 2) to power the next class of SSNs. This development programme isSigned primarily to give a longer reactor core-life (that is, the fuel inthe reactor will Qeed ^placement less frequently), reduced operating noise,Creased power and even better nuclear safety than existing reactors.Wger core-life and reduced operating noise are particularly important formaintenance   of  a  continuous  and  invulnerable deterrent.    In the lightofthe PWR 2all its advantages we have therefore decided to equip our new SSBNs withsystem.    Given the resulting increase in operational availability ur boats, we have concluded that it would no longer be sensible to con-sider ,naving   a   five-boat   force,   despite  the   increased   insurance againstc^dental loss   or   damage   which   this   would   provide.     We   are thereforeplarming for a four-boat force.1-3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL107. The final decisions to be made on the submarine concerned the centrsection of the hull, which contains the missile tubes and control systems.The diameter of the submarine hull depends critically on the choice of olSto be carried, both initially and at any later stage in the life of the f Its length depends on the number of missiles deployed.108. Our original studies had pointed to the conclusion that the UnitedKingdom Trident force should be deployed in a new class of submarine w. whichmissile compartment based on that of the American 640-class submarine;currently carries Poseidon and Trident I (C4) missiles.    Subsequent studilehave shown that the straightforward incorporation of the 640-class misssincecompartment into our new submarines would not, in fact, be practicatumuch of the related equipment will soon be out of production.   We shouldhave to re-design it to accept Ohio class equipment (the Ohio is the firSof the new American class of larger submarines designed to carry bothversions of the Trident weapon system), and this would involve a risky anexpensive United Kingdom programme.    Or we should have to adopt a miscompartment based on the Ohio design.to oPcremain^109.     Choice of the Trident II missile system would make it essentialfor the larger diameter hull based on the Ohio class.   But even if wewith Trident I it would still make sense to opt for such a hull so as toretain the flexibility to switch, if necessary, at some later stagelarger missile.   To adopt the 640-class hull would mean that we should beconstrained to run on our strategic force with the Trident I missile f rleast 20 years after the system had been withdrawn from service with the1-4CONFIDENTIAL
&lt; InCONFIDENTIALle^ited States  Navy.    The logistic and  other problems  which  such a coursewould entail  would   be  enormous,   and  extremely  expensive  to resolve.W therefore decided  that   our new  SSBNs   should be  built with a missilecompartment diameter based on that of the Ohio class submarines.&quot;0. Judgements as to the optimum number of missiles which each submarineshould be equipped to carry involved compromise between different factors.Because we shall only be able to guarantee one boat on patrol all the timeit is essential to ensure that the missiles deployed in each submarine are^selves sufficient to pose a credible deterrent. Given that missileare arranged in groups of four, our choice was between 12 and 16 tubes,^arly, the final choice of missile is a major factor in determining their^ber. This aspect of the submarine&apos;s design is therefore considered inm re detail later.ne&lt;&gt;Ul,ballistwe explained in DOGD 80/23 our decision to replace Polaris with anotheric missile   system  based  on nuclear-powered   submarines.    But  it hasbeenincreasingly suggested,  particularly following the United States&apos; deci-sion t0   deploy   submarine-launched   cruise   missiles   in   both   nuclear andentiona]_ roles,   that  an alternative based   on   cruise missiles would in/  oe cheaper.    Closer examination shows  that this  is not the case.112. Tweaving aside operational problems involved with cruise missiles, suchas theircomparatively short range (which means the submarines have less sea-n which to hide), each cruise missile carries only one warhead. Trident, ntrast,  carries multiple warheads.    We should therefore have to deploy1-5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTomany more cruise than ballistic missiles  for the same striking power,deploy them continuously we  should  need many more   submarines.    Given thigh cost  of  the boats  themselves,  this  means that  a  cruise missile f rcwould cost  more   both  to  build and  to  run.    The alternative  of install*08very small numbers of cruise missiles on our existing SSNs would make lictsense - apart from the doubtful deterrent value of such a small force,role of the SSNs is incompatible with that of a strategic deterrent force,both in deployment area and nature of operations.    On grounds of cost alontherefore, we remain convinced that Trident Is the best choice for the UniKingdom.aS the113.     When we decided in July 1980 to adopt the Trident I (C4) missilereplacement for Polaris, we thought that a decision by the United Stawhether to develop the Trident II (D5) system would not be made for anothtwo or three years.    In the event the new American Administration advanjij_ betheir decisions on the Trident D5 programme.

Shortly*t  we introduced the first of our Trident boats into service, therefore, e should become the sole operators of 04. This would give rise to aTber of logistic, operational and financial penalties, which stem from two *in causes. First,&apos; we should increasingly have to maae lodgements on our* ure programme of logistic support for the weapon system without the benefitof v    a  nn t-heir own continuing experience from f detailed American advice,  based on their own&quot;Ploying 04. Second, as long as wa retain ..commonality&quot; we receive all thebefits that accrue from the high priority that the United States gives to * strategic nuclear forces; if we became ..uni,u.  we should only get such-&quot;ice as we could afford and the Americans could fit into their programme.  ,.    The United States first deployed Trident 04 in 1979.    If we purchased&quot; ccbn force we should be many yearsu with a view to deployment in our new SSBN force wef thar behind their Trident programme than we were with Polaris. If, on* other band, we adopted the Trident 05 rather than the 04 missile for our ** seneration of SSBNs, we would expect to retain commonality with theStates&apos; system throughout its projected service life. This would*. us continued assurance of reliability without the large investment ogra e uhich aould otherwise be needed. We should also benefit from^flcantly reduced operating costs as compared to those of a system uni,ueto       United Kingdom.j CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL116.     The additional capital cost of adopting the D5 rather than the C4missile is assessed at September 1980 prices as some  390 million, or aboutseven per cent of the total programme.   It is hard to make a precise assessment of the likely cost penalties of remaining with C4, particularly sincethe timescale stretches over 30 years or more.   But there is every reasonsuppose that if we opted for C4 we should need to undertake some kind ofmid-life improvement programme.   With a smaller-diameter submarine thiscould only be a programme unique to the United Kingdom; and our experiencewith the Chevaline system shows just how expensive the resolution of problcan be in such circumstances.   With an Ohio-class hull initially equippedwith C4, a switch to D5 at a later date would be an alternative possibility&apos;f*Tiose ofbut even so, the total programme costs would be much greater than tnuf missileSan initial deployment of D5, not least because two complete sets orwould have to be installed over the lifetime of the force.     For all thes, Tridentreasons, therefore, we believe that it is now sensible to adopt tneD5 system for our next generation of strategic nuclear deterrent.117.     We could not make a judgement on the number of missile tubes toi f Asfitted in each submarine until we had decided on the missile itseli*have made clear, we believe that the Trident C4 missile carried in suwith 16 tubes would be adequate for our deterrence needs.    Since theof the D5 missile should give it the ability to carry a larger number ofwarheads than C4, a deterrent capability similar to the originally plannwebmarine3C4 force might be achieved by deploying a smaller number of D5 missilessea. We therefore considered whether we should build the new submarinewith only 12 missile tubes rather than 16.confidential
CONFIDENTIALH8.     Such a reduction in the size of the submarines would save about 80 million in the capital costs of the submarine programme - a relatively^all proportion of the total cost of the force.   Moreover, the larger numbeof tubes would provide flexibility to cope with possible improvements inSoviet anti-ballistic missile defences throughout the life of the force.*or this reason, and bearing in mind the relatively small cost premiumSolved, we have decided to build the new generation of submarines with 16tubes.   This should not, however, necessarily be taken to imply that we arecurrently planning to deploy the maximum number of missiles and warheads^at will theoretically be possible.   Like our predecessors, we do notcomment on the number of missiles and warheads carried by our SSBNs at any^ven time.    But it is right to make clear that the move to Trident D5 willA0t lnvolve any significant change in the planned total number of warheads^ociated with our strategic deterrent force, compared to the original intention for a force based on the C4.U9At the time of the July 1980 announcement the cost of the proposedTrinent force could not be estimated in detail: further discussions wereneeded with the United States authorities, and several decisions remained to6 taken about the submarine design.   The broad cost of the programme, at thePrice levels then prevailing, was assessed at  4,500 to  5,000 million.120.Since that time further work on refining the alternative programmesas&gt; of course, had an impact on our assessment of their cost.   At Septembei1980 Prices, the  4,500 to  5,000 million figure would have been  4,600 to&apos;125 million.    (Prices and exchange rates prevailing in September of each1-9CONFIDENTIAL

Iyear are used In the Ministry of Defence&apos;s annual review of its forwardexpenditure programmes;   we therefore use this basis in comparing costs).We now estimate that the Trident C4 force in 640-class submarines would costsome  5,100 million at September 1980 prices:   this is within the bracketestimated after our original, and limited, studies.   The improvements to thePropulsion and sonar systems, together with the adoption of the Ohio class* U, bring the cost of the C4 force up to  5,600 million.   The incrementthe adoption of Trident D5 rather than C4 is  390 million, giving atotal for the D5 force of  5,990 million (this compares with our original*aXimum estimate for the basic C4 force of up to  5,125 million).121.As we have explained, these figures are based on September 1980 prices.They ale -j?LSO assume the then prevailing exchange rate of 32.36 to the pound.ChanSing the basis of the estimate to gl.78 to the pound (the September 1981rate&quot;) =aaaaos some  700 million to the estimated cost of the project.   Of course,exchange rate could always move again in the opposite direction,lowing for inflation and using September 1981 price levels, the total costOf tune D5 force becomes  7,500 million. The composition of the cost increaseis srU90shown in Figure 2:    of the total cost, at September 1980 rates, only somemillion, or about 7%, results from the decision to move to D5. AtMember Wl rates, the figures are ,570 million and 7.6%.     An approximatebtsakdown of the expenditure is shorn in Figure 3.l -    The cost of Trident must be seen against the background of the capa-city which it will provide, compared to the costs of other capabilities -a*d from the defence budget, as illustrated in Figure I*   The attributions1-10CONFIDENTIAL

to the various capabilities are very broad, since equipment can often be^ed in more than one role. Nonetheless, it is clear that the plannedexpenditure on   the   strategic   deterrent   can  in   no   way   be   described as?^cessive in relation to planned expenditure on other capabilities. It isalso interesting to compare (see Figure 4) the cost of the Trident D5Programme ( 7,500 million) with that of the Tornado project which, costed onsame basis, is  11,300 million. Over a 15-year period in each case,^ident is likely to take a smaller proportion both of the defence budget^ of its equipment element than did Tornado. We remain convinced that noother way   of   spending   the   money  devoted  to  Trident   could   contribute ass nificantly to deterrence and hence to the maintenance of peace.123As for the impact on the defence budget, we estimate that the TridentProgramme will cost on average about  500 million a year over 15 years, ut ofa  total expenditure   of   14  billion a year at  today&apos;s  prices. Putanotherway,   it will take up  some  3%  of the total defence  budget  over theperiod during which it will be introduced into service.Valine124.The Chevaline development programme, which will keep the Polaris forceef feclve until Trident  enters   service,   is   now essentially  complete. Theghly successful series of missile test firings, carried out from HMS Renownoff QPe Canaveral earlier this year, represented an important final milestoneProgramme.    The new  system  will enter operational  service shortly.lQ the1-11CONFIDENTIAL
Polaris125. Work is now in hand to fit new motors to our Polaris missiles to ensuretheir operational reliability until Trident enters service.   The cost of theprogramme is expected to be some  300 million.Strategic Nuclear Arms Control126. As we explain on page [      ] we remain committed to seeking practicalbalanced and verifiable measures of arms control.   This is an essentialelement of our security policy, and the decision to adopt the Trident D5system does not alter that commitment.127. We welcome the&apos;United States&apos; intention to resume negotiations withthe Soviet Union on the reduction of strategic arms (START) and hope thattalks will get under way in the near future.    The United Kingdom&apos;s strategicdeterrent force cannot feature in these negotiations, which are bilateral, Tn anybetween the two superpowers and concern their strategic forces alone,event, the British deterrent represents only a very small proportion of thestrategic forces of the United States or the Soviet Union, and is of theminimum size compatible with ensuring a cost-effective deterrent at axxThis will remain the case with Trident as it is with Polaris now. Shouldthese circumstances change significantly we would, of course, be prepared treview our position.1-12CONFIDENTIAL

The Alliance is therefore introducingnuclear-capable aircraft like the F16 and Tornado to replace the olderand Vulcans.   The process of modernisation has been taking place much tno?newrapidly in the Soviet Union, with the introduction since 1975 of threetypes of intercontinental ballistic missile, three new submarine-launched1-14CONFIDENTIAL

On taUng office, oar first priority was to bring all three Services up  eogth. In April 1979, the Navy was U below Its then retired trainedlength; with voiuntary wastage at 7% and recruiting achieving only W or*  target, the outloo* was unfavourable. Indeed, during 1979/30 nine ships- *. active fleet were put into the standby squadron, mainly as a result of*  Mortage of certain specialists. The Regular Army was nearly 10X* t of its recrement for trained men, armoured regiments in BACK were 10%-* strength and only 78% of our front-line tanks were manned; similar under-- Ut was typical of many other units; and the Territorial Army (TA) was^ Wlow Its establishment.

CONFIDENTIALESSAYUSE OFNATIONAL RESOURCES1.This essay is intended to stimulate discussion on how national resourcesmighthecauscontribute more effectively to our defence effort.   We include it note we judge that an emergency is more imminent now than in recent yearsthedefexistence of sensible plans to make use of national resources for theence effort implies no more than the existence of the Armed Forces^selves.   But if our deterrent posture is to be credible, it must be seent0 he as effective and as widely based as possible.   And there are many waysl* which civil resources could be used to increase our deterrent and defencelabilities either directly or by freeing defence resources for tasks thatCai* only be carried out by Regular Armed Forces.2.The United Kingdom committed itself in the late 1950s to all-volunteerArmedForces. We do not intend to change this policy, which makes a higher Portion of Servicemen available for operational duties by reducing theamountWebeli f effort that needs to be devoted to training. Like our predecessors,eve it is important to maintain experienced and professional Armedrce8&gt;   The military support organisation is kept as lean as possible, and&quot;Quid011 civilhe fully committed in a crisis.   We would therefore have to rely heavilyresources to mobilize our full national strength.3.Wealready plan for this in several ways, concentrating on supplementingserviCe capacity in time of need rather than on seeking civilian substitutesCONFIdInTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfor Service personnel or equipment on any permanent basis. Existing planshave two main elements:a.     Manpower.     The Regular Reserves play an essential part in ourdefence plans and the reinforcement of BAOR depends on mobilising theTA.    By reorganising BAOR and expanding the TA we shall increase thecost-effectiveness of our contribution to the Central Front.   But therare several anomalies and problems associated with the Reserves whichneed to examine.   For example, three years ago, a report identified34 different categories of reservists.    The reasons for this profusi0lie in history;    but as the roles of the Armed Forces have evolved, thneed for so many different classes of reservists has reduced.   We arecurrently working on ways of simplifying the picture.b. Logistic Support. Plans already exist to make use of civiltransport for the Services in the event of war.    There are, forexamP1*ndagreements to employ the haulage resources of civil contractors a-layingplans for the rapid conversion of ferries and trawlers for mine-and mine-sweeping operations.4.     Arrangements of this kind are, however, only a starting point.Itf theshould be possible to develop them, at small cost, so as to fill many 0gaps that now exist and thus greatly improve the nation&apos;s strength in aTn seekingcrisis, without imposing a crippling burden in time of peace.make better use of the skills and facilities of the civil community, weshould be guided by two principles.   First, there should be little or noto2-22CONFIDENTIAL

We must focus our attention onPeople exercising their normal skills and on equipment which can be employedin its normal role, or with as little modification as possible.We have already studied a number of possibilities, including:&quot; Further expansion of the Reserve Forces;- Greater use of the reserve liability of those who have served in theRegular Forces;- A more flexible system of call-out of reservists;~ The use of the Services&apos; recruiting and training organisations in war~ The provision of manpower for ships and aircraft taken up from tradeto be used in reinforcement;- The development of airfield damage repair teams.several .ot these ideas have been put into effect.   Many of them involveAe - consultation with other interested parties, both within Governmentand ir, tJ-n Industry.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6.     The Regular Reserves are for the most part dedicated to direct operationacommitments.   Logistic and other specialist support requirements are, however,likely to grow;   as will the need for trained men to carry out tasks relatedto home defence.    To meet these demands, we might release from their formalcommitments some reservists whose Service experience has been overtaken byadvances in weapons technology and warfare, so that their particular skiHscan be applied to other, civil, tasks.   We could also expect many people, wnofor good reasons are unable to meet the training requirements of the RegularReserves, to come forward in a crisis.    Some would be a vital element in tnewider voluntary civil defence effort;    others could have an important rolein support of defence operations in the United Kingdom.   Time would notpermit the re-training of such volunteers, but in many cases their everydayskills could be put to good use.   The list of likely occupations is a longand varied one, ranging from manual workers, drivers and cooks to sea-goi ^officers.7.   Where logistic support and equipment are concerned it would be theGovernment&apos;s task to ensure that whatever is available is used in the nati ninterest as a whole.    Although our existing plans focus mainly on the transpsector, there is a variety of tasks which could be carried out with civilortequipment.   Light aircraft and helicopters could be used for transportliaison duties;   helicopters could help in naval control of shipping;earth-moving and construction equipment could assist in home defenceoperations; and oil tankers offer a potential for refuelling at sea.and2-24CONFIDENTIAL

The fact that the distance of the Soviet Union from CentralUnit Pe is only some 450 miles, compared with at least 3,000 miles for theed States,    affects the balance of both conventional and nuclear forcesand crcreates significant problems in terms of arms control.

CONFIDENTIALNuclear Forces303.     The balance of nuclear forces at the end of 1981 is shown in Figure7.   At  the   strategic  level,   both the United   States and  Soviet Union havecontinued to   observe  the provisions   of the   SALT I Treaty and  the initiallimits on weapons set by the unratified SALT II agreement.   Below the strategiclevel, the main change since the end of 1980 was the Increase in deploymentsof SS20 missiles,  which have a  range of  some 3,000 miles,  from 120 to 190(these figures relate only to launchers within range of targets in Europe -a further 90 were located in the far east of the Soviet Union).    Some of theolder generation   SS4s   and   SS5s  have   been withdrawn  but,   since   each SS20carries three warheads,  there has been a  sharp rise in the total number ofSoviet intermediate-range   missile   warheads   deployed.     Among shorter-rangesystems, particularly  significant  is  the  introduction  of  the new SS21, 22and 23 missiles which have ranges up to 650 miles.    All of these are moreeffective and accurate than the Frog,  Scaleboard and Scud systems which theyreplace.    The only NATO missiles in the same category - Pershing I and Lancemissiles - were Introduced in 1962 and 1973 respectively.   These developmentsunderline the trend which we noted  in  1981:    . marked and  growing nuCleardisparity between East and West in Europe.304. Despite this, the Soviet Union claims that there is already nuclearparity in Europe, which the planned NATO intermediate-range nuclear forcemodernisation will upset. They have been making this claim since 1979,although between then and the end of 1981 they deployed in total a further160 SS20s and 25 Backfire bombers, while NATO has not deployed any equivalentnew systems. It is clear from Soviet statements that their claim is basedon selective exclusion of their own systems compared with NATO&apos;s.   Thus, ft*3-2

The figures for NATO include Frenchforces but exclude US Navy ships from the Strike Fleet Atlantic because theiravailability in the Eastern Atlantic cannot be assumed at the outbreak ofhostilities.

All this gives only a general overview of the balance as we seedocument of this length cannot cover every aspect of the question. Thereare, for example, a number of important equipment developments which we havnot spelled out in detail.    But there is one area which we believe deservesro thespecial mention:    space.   The Soviet Union devotes enormous resources udevelopment and operation of spacecraft.   This effort is steadily increasingThe number of satellites launched gives an indication of the scale of theSoviet programme:    in 1981 the total was 124.    By contrast the West launched28.   A comparison of the number of rocket launches used to put single ormultiple payloads into orbit shows an all-time total by the end of 1981 of1437 for the Soviet Union, 786 for the United States and 45 for the rest ofthe world.    Some 80% of Soviet satellites have a potential military role.Specialist Soviet spacecraft are often used to aid missile targeting, anclothers are employed to calibrate radars.   An anti-satellite has also beendeveloped;    this carries a conventional warhead and is capable of interceplow-orbit satellites, most of which are used for reconnaissance.   The Westhas as yet no equivalent system.3-6CONFIDENTIAL

This problem lies at the heart of the continuing deadlockin the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction negotiations. The Allianceis convinced that the East has an advantage of over 150,000 troops in thearea of Central Europe concerned. The Warsaw Pact denies this, claimingthat rough parity already exists, but refuses to enter into seriousdiscussions to resolve the discrepancy between Western and Easternfigures.Militarily significant measuresThe history of recent negotiations inevitably raises questions about theSoviet Union&apos;s commitment to serious arms control measures. Many Sovietinitiatives, particularly in fora involving large numbers of neutral andnon-aligned nations, are essentially designed for propaganda purposes.They typically involve sweeping declarations which emphasise the peacefulintentions of the Soviet Union but are of no practical significancewhatever. A recent example was a United Nations draft resolution onUrgent Measures for Reducing the Dangers of War; this was tabled by theSoviet Union only 10 months after the invasion of Afghanistan. Further-more, the Soviet Union is not prepared to ensure that a measure hasreal value by backing up rhetoric with practical action. Thus, havingtabled a proposal for a general 10% reduction in military expenditure,the Soviet Union refuses to provide any credible figures for its truemilitary spending.

Collaboration offers us good prospectsof sharing high research and development costs and the technical risksassociated with modern complex weapons;    it also offers improvements inproduction economics because of the pooling of separate national requirementWe have explored collaborative routes on all our major weapons systemdevelopments in recent years, and many of our major equipments now have acollaborative background.    Collaboration has not, however, been withoutproblems.   The harmonisation of differing military requirements can lead toundue complexity, undermining the cost advantages both in development andproduction, as well as giving rise to the higher in-service costs associatedwith greater sophistication.   The management problems of involving a numberof countries with one project are also considerable.   We must learn fromexperience and seek new ways of managing collaboration, so that the potesavings and advantages can be fully achieved.415. We intend to make further improvements in our procurement and P_ujL--processes.     The Ministry of Defence is the largest purchasing organisati nin the country and accounts for some 80% of central Government purchasessupplies and services.   But it is the nature and complexity, rather than thvolume or value, of the purchases which characterises defence procurementand makes it unique.   Our contract procedures have to take account of tneof netffact that almost all major defence equipment projects require the useducti011technology, involve special development programmes and are put into proby a single, and nowadays often monopoly supplier.4-8CONFIDENTIAL

Against a backgroundof sme  dissatisfaction  in  Industry,   the  Government has   asked  the ReviewBfor Government  Contracts to look at the present  arrangements  for thePticins or  non-competitive  contracts.    Industry must  be provided with roomhealthy profit if defence work is  carried out well, but exposed to theof a reduced profit, or even a loss, if performance is poor.

But the prompter execution of work ondefendcontracts (and the subsequent presentation of bills) by Industry in recenyears has forced us to make a number of changes.419.     Following a special study of control of expenditure in 1981 (seeparagraph 506)  we have been strengthening procedures within the Department&lt;.&quot; onIn 1981/82 we tightened the programme by reducing the &quot;block adjustmentthe equipment  budget  (the discount  applied to  its  aggregate  estimated c f in thein the expectation that not all of the programme will be carried outfinancial year).    1982/83  will be tauter again.

The onus is now much more clearly on managers toexpenditure within cash allocations.420.     But internal measures of this kind can only take us so far; they neto be complemented by development of the relationship between the, ofMinistry of Defence and defence contractors.    Over the past year a serimeetings has been held with trade associations and individual firms to ensnthat Industry  understands   the  need to  keep  Increases   in  costs (incln^*overheads) to a minimum.

CONFIDENTIALESSAYMANAGEMENT AUDIT1.     The Ministry of Defence is the most diverse and complex of Departments.It is both a Department of State and an operational headquarters;    it mustreflect not only the existence of each of the Services as separate manageunits, but also the need for central control of policy and resources in theinterests of a single, coherent defence policy.ment2. The Department buys equipment worth some  6 billion each year and runsseveral major concerns:- the Royal Dockyards, on their own comparable in terms of employmentwith Vauxhall Motors;- the Royal Ordnance Factories;- the Research and Development establishments; and- the Service supply, repair and maintenance organisations.The total payroll is about 600,000, including approximately 332,000 in theregular Armed Forces and 221,000 United Kingdom-based civil servants - morethan three times the size of the largest private employer in the country*3.

It also recommended that inspection of linePerf*iremanagersandmance and audit of control systems should be more selective andtowards those areas where audit was most needed;   that the qualityraining of auditors should be improved, and the various forms of auditCoordinate(1.ea  and that management audit, combining all three forms of inspec-tio &apos;na audit, should be developed.5.We havefi*st stallygenerally endorsed the study&apos;s recommendations and have, as aeP&gt; appointed a Director General of Management Audit and a profession-qualified deputy with responsibility for staff inspection, internal5-12

By 1 October 1981, the defence estate in the United Kingdom had beenreduced to some 249 thousand hectares of freehold and leasehold land, about17 thousand   hectares   less   than   in  October   1972.     Because  of   the greaterconcentration of the Services in the United Kingdom and the expansion orTA we now have an increased need  for training land,  and this has preventesome disposals.   Even so, we now have four thousand hectares which have beereleased for disposal.620.

Z Finance and tradeThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 5of Volume 1. The meanings of certain financial terms are givenin the glossary below.Industrial analysis of Defence expenditure in the UnitedKingdom: estimated allocation by commodity group (Table2.7). The figures shown are based in part on an analysis ofcontract payments. Each contract let is allocated to aparticular industry, as defined in the Standard IndustrialClassification, according to the nature of the goods or servicesto be supplied. All payments against the contract are thenrecorded to that industry, irrespective of the actual industry towhich the establishment supplying the goods may be classifiedin other official statistics. Non-contract expenditure isallocated on the basis of its Vote designation.Exports and imports of defence equipment (Tables 2.8 and2.9). Certain exports and imports of defence equipment can beidentified through the Customs and Excise Tariff (at fob andcif prices respectively). A revision to the Tariff enabled somemilitary communications and radar equipment to be identifiedfrom 1978 onwards. As a result of the Civil Servicedispute figures of defence equipment trade covering the wholeof 1981 are not currently available. The Society of BritishAerospace Companies compiles statistics on the sales of goodsand services by its member companies from which it is possibleto identify the exports of other aerospace products formilitary purposes, most of which cannot be separatelyidentified in the Customs statistics. To give a more completepicture of the exports of defence equipment these figures,together with information supplied by individual electronicsand motor vehicle manufacturing companies, are shown in asupplementary table. It should be noted that the figures inTable 2.8 refer to actual deliveries of defence equipment. Assuch they are on a different basis from the figure given inpa*e 2r* -f&gt;k of Volume 1 whichconstitutes a forecast of expected sales in the Estimates year1982*83 and also covers infrastructure projects outside thescope of the statistics in this table.Defence balance of payments: invisible transactions. Table1.10 covers transactions by the British Government in relationto defence and includes receipts from the AmericanGovernment in respect of forces stationed in the UnitedKingdom. The figures for local defence expenditure representthe drawings of foreign exchange necessary to support ourforces overseas. They take no account of offsetting factorssuch as the reduction in imports to the United Kingdom andthe generation of exports from the United Kingdom whichresult from the stationing of forces overseas. In additionestimates are made of non-governmental transactions relatingto defence. Official payments by the American Forces in the.

Table 3.1 relates to thecosts of intra-mural and extra-mural research anddevelopment, the production of new equipment and spares,repairs, and the associated costs of managing the equipmentprogramme which cover the pay of MOD personnel and otheradininistratrve costs. The figures exclude intra-muralmaintenance costs, which are not easy to identify.Defence research and development expenditure (Tables 3.2and 3.3). The figures relate to defence research anddevelopment (R&amp;D) carried out both in MOD R&amp;Destablishments and extra-murally by industry and theuniversities. Table 32 differs from the similar data on defenceR&amp;D expenditure published periodically in general articles onthe subject (see, for example, Economic Trends, August 1981pp 94 et seq), in that it includes payments to civil votes andcentral government funds. Table 33 gives details of the cost ofR&amp;D to the Defence budget, ie gross expenditure less receipts.3.1Equipment procurement expendlturalService supply systems: major depots.

The totalnumber of Service children in primary or secondary schoolingin the United Kingdom and overseas was estimated to be148,300 in 1980. The 1980 Armed Forces Accommodationand Family Education survey also revealed a total of 25,400Service children in nursery schools. Enrolment in SCEAschools also includes children of MOD and other UK CivilService employees serving overseas.Social expenditure included in the Defence budget (Table6.11) The Defence budget provides certain social services, eg.medical facilities, for members of the Armed Forces and theirfamilies. These are also of benefit to UK-based civilians servingoverseas.
