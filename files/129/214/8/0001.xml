CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOC(82) 82 April 1982CABINETTHE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTREMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. Last year Cabinet considered the financing of the InternationalConference Centre.    It decided, given that extra public expenditure was notavailable, that the Centre should be financed by a leasing arrangement withPearl Assurance.2. Since then circumstances have changed.    Exchequer and Audit haveexamined the proposed contract with Pearl.    They are highly critical of it.They point out that the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) have several timessaid they are opposed to this way of financing Government projects.    They notethat in the case of the Centre it would cost much more than direct publicfinancing, but that the Government would bear all the risks associated withconstruction and operation.    They pcint also to two particular features of theproposed agreement which are potentially very expensive.    The first is theabsence of a break clause, in a contract lasting for 125 years.    The absenceof a break clause is all the more risky in view of another provision in theproposed contract, that rent reviews must always be upwards.    The second isthe rent review provision itself.    It now emerges that, for a reasonsummarised in the Annex, this would work in a way which substantiallyincreases the cost of the contract, above what we expected last year.3. Cabinet did not know when it considered the matter that there would beno break clause and that the rent review provision would take the veryexpensive form it has.    The arrangement is nov a much worse deal for theGovernment than we believed at the time.    I now calculate that it would costfour times as much to finance the Centre in this way as by direct Governmentfinancing, as compared with the two to three times I estimated last year.The discounted cost of financing the Centre through Pearl would be some 120 million as compared with only about some  30 million through directGovernment finance.     The return to Pearl would also be much higher than thefigure of just over 6 per cent we believed at the time.    Although it will startat 6 per cent, it will rise to 8-10 per cent after only five years and stay at thatlevel for the remainder of the 125-year contract.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. I am sure that it would be wrong and damaging to proceed with thiscontract.    We would be accused of saddling the taxpayer with an arrangementcosting him several times more than it need.    It would undermine all ourefforts to get better efficiency and value for money in the Government and pub-lic sector generally.    The Exchequer and Audit enquiries show that PAC willPick up these points.    TLey could indeed make the matter a major embarrass-ment to us.5. I am not seeking to reopen the decision to build the Centre.    I acceptthat it should be built, in the timescale now planned.    I propose that it shouldinstead be built with public finance, and I am prepared to make the extra sumsavailable accordingly.    These would be  6 million in 1982-83,  13 million in1983-84,   16 million in 1984-85 and  5 million in 1985-86.    I would also beready in principle to agree to some reimbursement of the abortive expenditureincurred by Pearl and the Government&apos;s advisers.    The sums would be minutecompared with the savings from giving up the contract.6. The arrangement I propose would therefore enable us to build theCentre exactly as planned but It would avoid substantial unnecessary costs andhighly damaging criticism of our failure to protect the taxpayer&apos;s interests.L BTreasury Chambers2 April 19822CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEXRENT REVIEW CLAUSE IN DRAFT AGREEMENT WITH PEARLThe initial rent will be fixed in 1986, when the Centre is due to be complete.There will be reviews in 1991 and at five-yearly intervals thereafter.    But atthe first review in 1991 the rent will be increased in line with rents in the areanot since 1986 but since 1981.    Subsequent rent reviews will start from thishigher base.    Inflation from 1981 to 1986, before the Centre was completed,will therefore be built into rents from 1991 and throughout the life of the con-tract.CONFIDENTIAL
