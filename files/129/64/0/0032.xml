SECRET Copy NoC. (53) 33226th November, 1953CABINET72UNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN DEFENCECOMMUNITYMemorandum by the Foreign secretary in February (C.C. (53) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4), the Cabinet approvedarrangements for British association with the European Defence Community(E.D.C.), notably-(a) close co-operation between the United Kingdom forces and the E.D.C.forces;(b) consultation between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C. about the levelof forces to be maintained on the Continent at any given time;(c) a United Kingdom Minister to attend meetings of the E.D.C. Council ofMinisters for discussion of questions of mutual concern;(d) a United Kingdom mission to be appointed to the Board of commissioners of the E.D.C. in order to maintain day-to-day contact.2. After further consideration in May and July, the Cabinet agreed that these arrangements should be recorded in a formal Agreement on the lines of the draft annexed to C. (53) 158 (C.C. (53) 32nd Conclusions,. Minute 3 and 39th Conclusions,Minute 2).3. As a result of discussions in Paris with officials of the E.D.C. Governments,a revised draft Agreement has now been prepared for submission to Governments(Annex A). There is no change whatever in substance but the wording and theorder of the Articles have been improved and clarified. It has been proposedin the E.D.C. Interim Committee that the draft Agreement should be initiallednext week by representatives of the United Kingdom and E.D.C. governments and that its signature and publication should take place later, i.e., at a time most likely to help the French ratification debate.4. The French have however now suggested a further exchange of lettersdefining our consultation obligations in a way implying further United Kingdomcommitments.  I am firmly resisting this and propose to continue to do so.5. Discussions have taken place with the military experts of the E.D.C.Governments in order to agree practical steps for co-operation between the UnitedKingdom and E.D.C. forces. A draft Statement of Common Policy has been drawn up (Annex B). This has been approved by the Chiefs of Staff and it isnow proposed that it should be adopted as a basis for future common action.This Statement does not require to be signed but I recommend that it should bepublished at the same time as the draft Agreement in order to show the full extentof United Kingdom co-operation with the E.D.C. I understand that the Chiefsof Staff see no objection to this.6. The French have also been anxious to extend the North Atlantic Treatyfrom 20 to 50 years to preclude any possibility of denunciation during the lifetime of the E.D.C. While I am in sympathy with this desire, I do not think that theUnited States Administration could get this through Congress. The French arenow, I understand, hopeful that the Americans might nevertheless produce some45237 BPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1953

Military Association Between the Forces of the United Kingdom and theEuropean Defence CommunityDraft Statement of Common PolicyPart I. -Common Aims1. In order to bring about the effective and continuous co-operation between their respective armed forces placed under the command of the Supreme allied commander, Europe, provided for in Article II (a) of the Agreement regardingco-operation between the United Kingdom and the European Defence Community,the authorities concerned of the parties to that Agreement have agreed that it isnecessary to reconcile, on a basis of reciprocity, differing techniques in as manyfields as possible, so leading to a common military outlook. They recognise thatthis reconciliation will be attained by progressive measures of adjustment and in thelight of experience, and that the first step will be the exchange of the necessary information in the various fields. The ultimate aim is to enable the armed forcesof the United Kingdom and the European Defence Community to operate together in the.circumstances described in Article 68 (paragraph 3), 69 (paragraph 3) and 70(paragraph 3) of the Treaty Establishing the European Defence Community, withoutreducing their effectiveness.2. The following are among the particular fields, applicable to the three services, in which a common military outlook shall be sought:  Tactical Doctrine and Staff Methods(a) In order to ensure the best co-operation between units of the two armed forces, tactical doctrines and staff methods shall be reconciled as far aspossible. To this end, a continuous exchange of documentary informa-tion shall take place between the military authorities of the UnitedKingdom and of the European Defence Community. After the establish-nient of the European Defence Community a joint study group shall beset up to examine the means of evolving common doctrines. Observersat tactical demonstrations and exercises shall be exchanged.Logistics(b) The common aim is to remove such differences in logistics between the armed forces of the United Kingdom and of the European defence community placed under the command of the Supreme Allied Com-mander, Europe, as might prejudice active operations in the field. Thiscalls for the harmonisation of their logistic systems and the standardisation-tion of their equipment.Harmonisation of Logistic Systems(i) As a first step the elimination of differences in logistic organisation shallbe sought in certain of the less controversial fields through the agency of joint study groups.Standardisation of Equipment(ii) Co-operation in this field shall be closely related to the work of the MilitaryAgency for Standardisation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.As an immediate step, a common system of equipment referencing shallbe sought. The military authorities of the United Kingdom and of theEuropean Defence Community shall exchange all the necessary docu-mentary information on equipment and shall arrange the appropriatedemonstrations.Training(c) The training methods employed by both armed forces shall be, as far aspossible, on similar lines. This will be achieved from the early stages of the formation of the European Defence Forces by the Exchange of
personnel and of documentary information, and by the allocation of vacancies in United Kingdom military schools and training establish-ments to personnel of the European Defence Community, and recipro-cally. At a later stage, exchanges of units may also be arranged.These measures will in many cases represent an extension of similar facilities and arrangements at present in force between the UnitedKingdom and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries and will besubject to similar financial arrangements.The manner in which these measures can be applied in the three services is set out in more detail in Part II.3. It is recognised that the extent to which the common aims can be achievedwill be conditioned by the following factors:  (a) the obligation to conform with the doctrines and policy of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation;(b) the stage of evolution of the European Defence Forces;(c) the special characteristics of each Service:  it is probable that the closestassociation can be achieved in the case of air forces;(d) such security regulations as may be laid down by the parties;(e) the resources which may be available, bearing in mind the other commit-ments of the United Kingdom and of the European Defence Community.These resources are likely to vary between each Service.Part II. Measures to be taken by each Service for Practical Collaboration betweenthe Forces of the United Kingdom and the European Defence CommunityAir Force1. In the early stages of the formation of European Air Force the Royal AirForce will assist, if desired:  (a) in the establishment of the Headquarters of the European Air Force,including the secondment of officers;(b) by the secondment of officers, at all levels, to the European Air Force forcommand and staff service, including technical and administrative, andfor flying duties;(c) in the formation of the European Air Defence Command and TrainingCommand;(d) by providing some initial and refresher flying and technical training, and inthe organisation of and supervision in technical schools.2. When the European Air Force is more fully established collaboration may take the following form:  (a) secondment of Royal Air Staff officers for duty with the Headquarters ofthe European Air Force and vice versa;(b) secondment of Royal Air Force officers to the European Air Force forcommand and staff service, including technical and administrative, andfor flying duties; and similarly of European Air Force officers to theRoyal Air Force;(c) participation in integrated headquarters  staffs  in  the  circumstances described in Article 69 (paragraph 3) of the Treaty Establishing theEuropean Defence Community;(d) Royal Air Force assistance in the organisation of European air defence,including the setting up of close links between control and reportingsystems of the European Defence Forces and those of the Royal AirForce;(e) joint study of the possibility of the correlation of the aircraft productionand air training programmes of the European Defence Community andthe United Kingdom.3. A close association will be established between the European Air Forceand Royal Air Force formations placed under the command of the Supreme allied commander, Europe. The detailed measures of association which may be arranged
will be determined by joint consultation with SACEUR. Such arrangements may include:  (a) the acceptance of individual European Air Force squadrons and completeEuropean Air Force wings within Royal Air Force formations, and vice versa, where military considerations make this desirable and logisticconsiderations make it practicable;(b) training by the Royal Air Force of such squadrons as may be nominated by the European Defence Community.Army4. In the early stages of the formation of the European Army, the british army will, if desired, assist them in their planning in the following ways:  (a) by the secondment of officers to the Headquarters of the European Armyand to its training and logistic staffs;(b) by the extension to the European Army of the present arrangements whereby vacancies are made available at United Kingdom schools toforces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. (The United King-dom schools concerned are the Staff College, Arms Schools, the school of Land/Air Warfare, the Joint School of Chemical Warfare andadministrative training establishments);(c) by the provision of suitable tactical demonstrations at the request of theEuropean Army.5. Once the European Army is established the following arrangements maybe made:  Exchanges of Personnel(a) These will be similar to the arrangements already existing for the exchangeof personnel between the United Kingdom forces and forces of othercountries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Until, however,common doctrines are developed by the United Kingdom and european defence Forces, the level and numbers of such exchanges will necessarily be limited and on the following lines:  (i) between European Army staffs and those of the Headquarters ofthe British Army stationed on the Continent, including an exchange of liaison officers where appropriate;(ii) between officers of combatant and administrative units, for limitedperiods;(iii) between students at such schools and training establishments as maybe agreed.Training(b) (i) Large-scale joint United Kingdom and European Defence Communitymanoeuvres may be organised within the framework of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation. In this case the directing and umpiringstaffs may be integrated temporarily,(ii) United Kingdom divisions may be made available for training and exercises with the European Army under the overall command ofthe Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and vice versa. In similar conditions small units of the European Army may participate information training with the British Army and vice versa.Navy6. Close association already exists between navies of the countries of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Royal Navy, and will be extendedto the European Defence Community. Assistance during the build-up period maybe of particular value.7.   The Royal Navy will co-operate in the following ways:  (a) by the provision of limited training facilities;(b) by the participation of Royal Navy units in training and at naval oramphibious exercises, which include European Naval Forces;(c) by close co-operation with the European Defence Community in theorganisation, working and function of the European Admiralty,including the appointment of a liaison officer; .(d) by advising on the development of. the European Navy.
