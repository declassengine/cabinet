Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRETB copy copy No.63C. (53) 34712th December, 1953CABINETRELATIONS WITH PAKISTANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached records of myconversations with members of the Pakistan Cabinet.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1953.The Secretary of State accompanied by the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner called on 19th November on the Honourable Khan Abdul Qaiyum Khan,Minister for Food and Industries. The following were the main points ofdiscussion.(a) The Minister paid tribute to the integrity of British firms in this countryand to the value of their assistance. The Secretary of State could, withhis full authority, assure the City and would-be investors at home that so far as the Minister was concerned there would be a square deal forBritish firms and that they could rely on a friendly and co-operativeapproach. He realised fully the value of the contribution they werein a position to make. A conspicuous example at the moment ofco-operation between British industry and the Pakistan Governmentwas afforded by the arrangements that were being made with the BurmaOil Co. for the exploitation of the great pocket of natural gas that hadbeen discovered in Baluchistan.(b) He was bound to admit that the Pakistan Government machine creaked agreat deal. But he was not going to tolerate interference with the legitimate activities of British firms by obstruction in the machine.Partly because of its weakness he had to do very much more himselfthan need otherwise be the case. He probably saw some 20 to 30principals a day on matters in the field of his portfolios. Corruptionwas a grave evil in this country and he was doing everything possibleto eradicate it.(c) The food position was, in the Minister^ view, now pretty comfortable.There had been an excellent monsoon, the &quot; Grow More Food&quot;campaign was being pursued, and the great generosity of the UnitedStates of America and also of Canada, Australia and New Zealand had,he thought, got the Pakistan Government round the corner.(d) In the political field, the Prime Minister^ absence through illness in theimportant closing stages of discussions in the Basic Principles Com-mittee had been most unfortunate, for as a result the fanaticallyreligious element had secured advances that might otherwise have beenresisted.   All was not lost by any means, since the Constitution hadSWINTON.
still to be finalised; and once the Prime Minister was back and theEast Bengal elections out of the way it might be possible to securecertain improvements. As it was there was some ground for satisfac-tion. The parity agreement between East and West Pakistan was] of outstanding importance. The board of Mullahs to examine legislationchallenged on the ground that it was non-Islamic had been eliminated.The reference to the Supreme Court (after the enactment of legislation and not before it could be enacted) was a very substantial safeguard.Above all, financial and monetary affairs in their widest sense had beenexempted for a period of 25 years from challenge on the grounds that action proposed in regard to them was un-Islamic. In the last coupleof days agreement had been reached with East Bengal that money bills,instead of going immediately to a joint session, should be introduced in the Lower House. This was reached only after long and contentiousargument. The question of the State language had still to be settledbut there was, he hoped, no great hurry about that. He thought therewas much to be said for the Bengali claim that special recognition shouldbe given to Bengali. But what was going to happen was that Englishwas going to remain the principal language since it was the only: one.... which was common to the two sides of the State.(e) Development. Pakistan was at a decided disadvantage because of hershortage of foreign exchange. For all that, development schemes were going ahead actively, and this was particularly true of the hydro-electricfield. The loan which we had given to Pakistan had been of great value. But she was very short of technical knowledge and remained in need of much help and advice from outside.(/) The Secretary of State asked Qaiyum what would happen to Ministry ofCommerce; would the Prime Minister continue to hold it? Qaiyumreplied Prime Minister ought to lighten his load. It would be logicalto link Commerce and Industry; and the Secretary of State thoughtQaiyum would like this. He said Food was now simpler, and he wouldnot mind being quit of that; but he added wryly that his mother had told him God had chosen him to feed his people and he must stickto food.(g) The Secretary of State strongly urged the Minister to go on to Londonwhen he had finished his work at the F.A.O. meeting in Rome forwhich he would be leaving on 22nd November. Not only Ministers,but leading British firms interested in Pakistan, had been very dis-appointed when his illness at the time of his visit for the Coronationhad upset their plans for talks with him. He would find a warmwelcome, and the Secretary of State hoped himself to have returnedto London before the Minister was likely to arrive. The Ministerexpressed his warm appreciation of Lord Swinton&apos;s kindness and saidthat he would certainly try to visit London and would communicatehis probable arrival date later. Quite apart from meeting Ministershe would greatly value discussion with firms interested in or withbusiness in Pakistan.(Signed)        GILBERT LAITHWAITE,United Kingdom High Commissioner.23rd November, 1953.The Secretary of State, accompanied by the United Kingdom High Com-missioner called on Chaudri Mohamad Ali, Minister of Finance, on Friday,20th November.2. The Finance Minister said in reply to questions that the Cabinet was a united Cabinet and in that respect a vast improvement on its predecessor. It wasnot, as he had found on his last visit that people thought in Delhi, divided withinitself. There might be internal differences from time to time. But the Cabinet were working well to a unified policy.  -
,,., 3. In the Punjab he thought that.Sir Firoz Khan Noon&apos;s Ministry was, prettyconif ortable. The. fact that the Leader of the Opposition, The Khan of Marndot,had rejoined the Muslim League was a real accession of strength. On the otherhand there were signs that Mr. Daultana was beginning again to emerge. Theenquiry into the Punjab riots of last spring, which was now proceeding, had not so far caused any appreciable injury to his position.- 4. As regards Kashmir. He could not say.whether or not Pandit Nehrureally wanted a settlement, though he had very little doubt that the Indian cabinet would welcome one, and that there were elements in it that would be glad of anearly settlement. There was, he thought, some division in that Cabinet as towhether the Plebiscite should be in .1955 or 1956 (he feared that these were theearliest dates that they had in mind in Delhi because of their anxiety to build upBakshi). He had had friendly talks with Mr. Deshmukh, who was an old friend,and with others, while in Delhi for the Colombo Plan discussions. But the keyto the situation was Pandit Nehru. It was doubtful if anyone really knew his mind, but no one else could give the answer.5. As regards the outcome of the Mohammed Ali/ Nehru discussions, theposition was that the Plebiscite Administrator was to be nominated by the end ofApril. The preliminary committees were to deal with demilitarisation and civilorganisation. The Secretary of State said that Pandit Nehru had hinted thatPakistan either was very slow in replying to communications on this subject ordid not indeed reply at all because of the Prime Minister^ illness. ChaudriMohamad Ali said that it was true that there had been no reply sent for that reason to one letter. But they were most anxious to press on with these com-mittees and the correspondence with Pandit Nehru had been resumed. It was extremely difficult to tie Pandit Nehru down. He shifted from one somewhatvague proposition to another. At one stage he had written to Prime MinisterMohammed Ali to say that he was strongly averse to having an American suchas Admiral Nimitz as Plebiscite Administrator, and thought that it would be worthtrying to get the Administrator from one of the small neutral nations such asSweden, Switzerland or possibly from an Asian country. The Pakistan Cabinet asalways had expressed their readiness to consider this, but before they had been ableto do so, there had been a leak in Delhi which made it clear that this was theline the Pandit was taking, which of course made it correspondingly more difficult for the Pakistan Government to consider it, and had had an unfortunate effecton the atmosphere. In the latest stages of this correspondence Pakistan had expressed her willingness to see committees established at once and had askedPandit Nehru for his ideas as regards time, place and membership. He repliedsaying that he agreed to the establishing of committees., but ignoring the other points that had been raised. The Pakistan Government, who wished to press on with this matter, had now replied giving their own proposals for membership,place and date, and asking Pandit Nehru for his suggestions on these points.In his judgment, if India gave the right instructions to her representatives in thecommittees, they could finish their work within a week.6. The Finance Minister said that he agreed at the same time with theSecretary of State that a deadlock might arise, either because of delays in con-nection with the conclusion of the work of the committees or because agreement could not be reached on either Admiral Nimitz or someone to take his place asAdministrator, or indeed on a thousand and one other points. But that was a risk that had to be faced. So far as Pakistan was concerned they were deeplyanxious to make progress, and while the Prime Ministers illness had been unfor-legitimate in this as in other fields, there was nothing for it but to go ahead as quickly as possible and to see how things turned out.7. Progress over the Constitution had been good, and the mullahs had suffered a severe set-back! He deeply regretted the walkout by the Hindu minority. he himself felt that they were entitled to receive and would receive guarantees-asregards their personal law and rights that would reassure them. He would go further than that. He thought the arguments for a common roll were very-strong.He himself would favour giving.the Hindus joint electorates for the caste Hindusimmediately, and for the scheduled castes (who still needed a period in which tobuild themselves up) after 10 years,7 V 8. It had to be remembered in considering criticisms of East Bengali Muslimintransigence (and he did not deny that they had been very difficult to deal with)that they had for generations been held down by the Hindu element and placed at
a disadvantage in every way. Some allowances had to be made for the naturalreactions of people who, after along period of subservience, suddenly found thefn-selves in power. But in the interests of keeping the State together it was essentialthat deference should be paid to legitimate Hindu demands. Once the East Bengalelections were over it would, he hoped, be possible to make an advance in thisdirection.9. On the language controversy, the Finance Minister questioned whether therewas any real need to take an early decision. This was the sort of thing that couldbe argued over for quite a long period. It did not arise on the report of the basic principles Committee. In practice English was going to emerge as the commonlanguage, since it was the only one in which Bengalis and Punjabis could under -stand one another. But the question of whether or not there should be Statelanguages and whether Bengali should be one of-them was not of such vital urgencyas to hold up general constitutional progress, and he saw no reason why considera-tion of it should be a stumbling block.10. The agreement that had been reached about parity was of fundamental importance. In the financial field he was well satisfied with, the compromise underwhich financial matters were to be exempt from challenge on the grounds that theywere un-Islamic for so many years to come.11. Communism. Communism was of no importance in the West, where thearrests at the time of the Rawalpindi conspiracy had set back its adherents badly.It was of much more importance in the East. West Bengal had been badlypenetrated by the Communists, it was all the more important to ensure that theEast Bengal Hindus were treated sympathetically and encouraged to regard them-selves not as a separate element, but as an integral part of Pakistan. Failing this they might well be fruitful ground for Communist propaganda^12. Development of an Opposition.-Mx. Mohamad Ali thought that oncethere had been elections under the new Constitution an Opposition was likely todevelop. Within the Muslim League there might be divisions, and particularly oneconomic matters, though he thought the Muslim League likely to hold its own forpossibly some years. The East Bengal Flindus, even if their grievances had been met, were likely ordinarily to be on the opposite side to a predominantly MuslimGovernment.13. Economic. The Finance Minister said that the food problems had for thetime being ceased to exist. There remained the question, whether Pakistan wouldtake up the outstanding 300,000 tons of American wheat. It would be important to have a substantial quantity of wheat in hand before the new crop came in in the spring, and the Finance Minister left the impression that he would see advantage in obtaining the outstanding balance to serve as a reserve.14. Over cotton he had much hope that the discussions with Lancashire wouldbe fruitful and expressed appreciation of the help that had been given towards theestablishment of a Lancashire-Pakistan Cotton Committee. A brief discussionfollowed on the latest difficulties that had arisen owing to the proposal of the raw cotton Commission for an alteration in the standard form of contract, the objec-tions to which the Secretary of State accepted.15. Cloth. The Pakistan Government had now decided to import on Govern-ment account 4 crores worth of textiles. The 4 crores corresponded to the  3,500,000worth that had been promised to Japan and the  500,000 worth that had been promised to the rest of the world, for the second half of this year. They wouldprobably try to dispose of this cloth partly through the fair-price shops. They hadbeen driven to take this action because the trade had shown itself selfish and greedyand had forced prices up. The best way of dealing with the trade was to importa quantity of textiles so substantial as to give them no room for exploitation. he hoped himself that within a year or two Pakistan would be self-sufficient in thecoarse counts and there would be no need for further imports of this type. Thefiner counts remained available for the United Kingdom.&apos; 16. Sui Gas. The Minister said that this was a development of first-class importance. He gave a brief description of the financial arrangements that were under discussion with the World Bank and the Burma Oil Company as a result ofwhich, and of the failure to interest American capital, British capital was likelyto be brought in (an arrangement in which in the circumstances of the present casethe Secretary of State saw real advantage) and paid a tribute to the Burma oil company for their co-operation.
17. In conclusion Mr. Mohamad Ali again thanked the Secretary of Statefor all he had done to obtain the  10 million loan. That and the money given bythe World Bank were between them really responsible for seeing Pakistan throughthe present period, and he was deeply grateful to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(Signed) GILBERT LAITHWAITE,United Kingdom High Commissioner.23rd November, 1953.The Secretary of State, accompanied by the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner, called on the Honourable Mr. Gurmani, Minister of the Interior, on Friday,20th November.2. Mr. Gurmani said that he felt that such misunderstandings as there hadbeen between the United Kingdom and Pakistan had been due to a large extent tothe fact that the same words did not mean the same things to both parties, As aresult they had on occasions found themselves at cross purposes. Complete frank-ness, which he was sure would not be misunderstood, was the only way to provide against this.3. In reply to a question by the Secretary of State he said that whatever mightbe thought outside, there were no divisions inside the Cabinet. Inevitably personaljealousies and ambitions reflected themselves from time to time in the Cabinet.But they were quite solid on their policy.4. The Constitution had made good progress, though the Prime Minister^absence through illness had been a great handicap. So had been the over-ridingnecessity for ensuring a successful outcome to the East Bengal elections in February.Members of the Muslim League in Bengal had unfortunately made various unwisepromises in the past, not only on the setting up of an Islamic State, but in respectof various features of it. With an election ahead these promises were coming home to roost and it had been necessary in consequence, much against his will, to go agreat deal further in the direction of concessions to extremist religious opinion than would otherwise have been the case.5. For all that the mullahs had suffered a substantial defeat. It was true thatthe State was to be described as an Islamic State, but they had been severely rebuffedby their failure to secure the proposed board of mullahs and by the exemption offinance, &amp;c, for a period of twenty-five years from challenge on the grounds that action was not Islamic.6. Unfortunately the deference that had to be paid, because of the EastBengal elections, to extremist religious pressure, had led to a Hindu walk-oxittowards the end of the discussions in the Basic Principles Committee. He deploredthis and thought it most unhappy from every point of view. Here again it was tobe hoped that an accommodation could be reached in due course with the Hindus.They were in his view entitled to firmer and more specific guarantees for their personal law and rights than had been given, and he did not see why there need be difficulty over this. He was himself in favour of considering their demand for jointelectorates and a common roll, which was the only really democratic device, though some arrangement might in the initial stages be necessary in respect of the scheduledcastes. While the Government had had to defer to pressure at this stage there wasa basis of understanding with the Prime Minister of East Bengal that these matterscould be reconsidered once the election was over.7. As regards the time-table for the new constitution, he thought that it wouldbe taken up after the budget and it might conceivably be possible to completeconsideration of it by June or July and to introduce it in about a year&apos;s time. Itwould clearly be impossible, if any advance was to be made, to resume discussionsuntil after the East Bengal elections were over.8. Kashmir. The discussions between Prime Minister Mohammed Ali andPandit Nehru had resulted in agreement that the Plebiscite Administrator shouldbe appointed at the end of April next year. Under questioning by the Secretaryof State it emerged that the Minister had not quite faced up to what would happen
The Secretary of State, accompanied by the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, called upon the Law Member, Mr. Brohi on Friday, 20th November.. 2. Discussion was almost exclusively on the constitution and connectedquestions, and the following points emerged:  (d) The Prime Minister^ absence had placed the Government spokesmen at agreat disadvantage, and concessions had been made to the mullahs Whichcould otherwise have been avoided. It was to be hoped that once theEast Bengal elections were over it would be possible to regain some ofthe lost ground. But Mr. Brohi was far less optimistic than some ofhis colleagues as to the extent to which this could be done.if India continued to refuse to accept Admiral Nimitz as Plebiscite Administrator,or if, because the Admiral was reluctant to serve, agreement could not be reached with India over a substitute; or again if there was delay in appointing the pre-liminary committees contemplated by the Nehru/Mohammed Ali discussions; or if these committees had been unable to cover the ground assigned to them beforethe date fixed for the appointment of the Plebiscite Administrator. He agreed asto the danger that in such circumstances it might be impossible to work to thetime-table at present in view. He remained very emphatic as to the importance ofa solution to the Kashmir question. He had told Pandit Nehru with the utmostfrankness as far back as 1948 that there was no future for Kashmir with Indiaand no possibility of absorbing Kashmir as it stood in his secular State. He shouldnot overlook that if Kashmir did not go to Pakistan, it might well prefer itself tolink up with China. The religious situation in Kashmir had, after all, resemblancesto the religious situation in Sinkiang, where there was a substantial Muslimpopulation, with which Kashmir had territorial links. The possibility of Chinataking an interest in its fate if agreement could not otherwise be reached over itsstatus between India and Pakistan could not be overlooked.9. Religious Teaching in Christian Schools.-Th.Q Ministers insistence inconnection with the grievances of the Hindu minority on freedom to practise religionwithout interference gave an opportunity to bring up the question of the allegedthreat in the Punjab to insist on Islamic teaching even in schools conducted by thevarious Christian denominations. Mr. Gurmani said that he thought there wasno reason for any concern about this. In the latter days of the last Governmentthe religious element had brought pressure to bear for compulsory Moslemreligious teaching in all schools. Mr. Fazlur Rahman had made some unwisestatements in that sense at the centre, and in the Punjab the Daultana Governmenthad been weak about it. He was quite clear himself, after discussion with Sir FirozKhan Noon and members of the present Punjab Government that there was norisk of action on these lines. For one thing these Christian schools were of theutmost value to the country (his own daughter was being educated at one of them)which could not dispense with them at the present time. Secondly, it would be intolerable that religious tests or obligations of this kind should be imposed.Thirdly, even if that were not the case, there would be the greatest difficulty, becauseof the differences between the various Moslem sects, in ensuring that religiouseducation satisfactory to all Muslims could be ensured. He was aware of thearrangements that had been made in East Bengal by the Roman Catholics, whorequired, before accepting a Muslim pupil in one of their schools, a certificate fromthe child&apos;s parents that adequate provision had been made by them for religiousinstruction for the child in its own faith.10. In conclusion, the Minister, in somewhat involved terms, referred to thegreat goodwill towards the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth that therewas in Pakistan, but said that he wished to emphasise that the traffic must be two-way.(Signed)        GILBERT LAITHWAITE,United Kingdom High Commissioner.23rd November, 1953.
(b) The agreement regarding parity in East Bengal, the abolition of the boardof mullahs and the securing of a reference to the Supreme Court incases where legislation was challenged as un-Islamic, were all greatadvances. But he deeply regretted the use of the word &quot; Islamic &quot; inthe title of the State, though we would note that the report underlinedthat this was only a question of name. He had secured various other amendments, the implications of which had not always, he thought,been realised by those who had passed them, which were designed to counter Islamic influences. But he was deeply disturbed at the walkoutof the Hindu minority. Their absence had meant that in the later stages of the debate there had been no constructive discussion on the clauses under consideration. While he fully appreciated the importanceof winning the East Bengal elections, he felt that East Bengali Muslimshad been most unreasonable and shortsighted in the attitude they had adopted. As regards specific. Hindu grievances, there was no difficulty about giving them full reassurances about their personal law and rights.There had been misunderstanding because proposals in this sense hadbeen brought up at the wrong point in the section dealing withrepugnancy. He had taken the line in the House that this was not theright place for these assurances and had made it clear that when theappropriate point was reached in consideration of the constitution, theywould be given. As regards the Hindu demand for joint electorates,he personally was all in favour of the common roll, subject possibly toa period of perhaps 10 years of separate electorates for the scheduledcastes. He hoped that progress might be made in this, once the EastBengal elections were over and the Prime Minister was back at work.(c) As a lawyer and a draftsman he was most unhappy at the detail into whichthe proposed constitution looked like entering. The Report of the basic principles Committee, which was effectively the basis of the constitution,contained a vast quantity of material entirely unsuitable for inclusion in any constitution ^details about Parliamentary and legislativeprocedure, &amp;c. He would himself have preferred to see a constitutionof not more than 100 clauses, whereas the constitution on present form looked like running, to something over 400. In reply to theSecretary of State he said that unfortunately the great detail embodied in the Report of the Basic Principles Committee reflected old anxietiesin the provinces and in many cases undertakings or promises that hadbeen given. Knowing his countrymen as he did he thought that thetask of satisfying them that these were inappropriate in a constitution and could either be left to develop by convention or be provided foroutside the constitution itself, would be one of almost insuperable difficulty. Nor could we overlook the misunderstandings that might arise if, after all the thought and time that had been given to the Reportof the Basic Principles Committee, it was now to be suggested, howeverstrong the case on merits, that the constitution should be recast anddrastically pruned. Anxious as he was to secure a workmanlike andcompact constitution, he saw very little hope of any substantial improvement in that direction.(d) The Minister said that he would greatly appreciate it if Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment could lend him a draftsman, and that he was writing tothe High Commissioner on the subject. In reply to questions by theSecretary of State it emerged that what he needed was a constitutionaladviser of the quality of Professor Wheare, in addition to a draftsman.He agreed, finally, that if someone of Professor Wheare Y quality were willing to come to Pakistan to advise, it might not be necessary to ask him to spend more than one or two months in this country. (Mr. Brohisubsequently touched on the possibility of himself flying home to consult Professor Wheare on a draft.) The draftsman would be needed for a longer period, probably six months to a year. The Secretary ofState said that while he and Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be mostwilling to give any help in their power once the. Minister^ request wasreceived, the difficulties in sparing a Parliamentary draftsman wereinsuperable. The draftsmen were few in number and working underintense pressure all through the session.  We would, however, consider
the matter further on receiving the Minister^ letter. . There might possibly be a retired draftsman.(e) The Minister thought it likely that an Opposition would develop in thenormal course once elections to the Centre had been held under thehew Constitution; but he did not appear to have given close thought to the elements or considerations on which it was likely to be based.3. In conclusion the Minister gave the Secretary of State and the HighCommissioner copies of the Report of the Basic Principles Committee embodying the amendments that had been made in paragraphs 1 to 130 by the ConstituentAssembly during its recent session. This, he said, he had had specially preparedfor the Secretary of State, who was receiving the first copy that was being handed to anyone.(Signed) GILBERT LAITHWAITE,United Kingdom High Commissioner.23rd November, 1953.The Secretary of State, accompanied by the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner, called on 21st November on Dr. Shuaib Qureshi, Minister for information and Broadcasting, Kashmir Affairs, and Refugees and Rehabilitation.2. Refugees. The Secretary of State said that he had been much struck bythe number of refugees about Karachi, and the distressing conditions in which theywere living. Dr. Qureshi said that refugees, were still pouring in at the rate of4,000 a month. The traffic was almost entirely one way. In East Pakistan alsothere was a substantial flow of refugees across the East Bengal border. It mightarguably be due to some extent to the inability of Muslims to adjust themselvesto a secular state, but. he did not himself think that was the explanation. Theproblem was one of. the greatest difficulty for Pakistan. There was much misery,as these people came across the border destitute. They were not easy to absorb,particularly the urban element. While some had been able to start small tradesthere was no opening for others, and there was a tendency, too, for refugees whohad been provided for in the countryside to drift back to Karachi, where they hoped to find employment, and where there was the company, of a large population.Subsistence was a problem, but there were obvious dangers in any issue of freefood, and no end to a concession of that nature.. 3. Kashmir. In reply to an enquiry by the Secretary of State as to what theMinister thought prospects were of a settlement of the Kashmir issue. Dr. Qureshimade a long and at times rather passionate statement, the main points of whichwere as follows:, (a) Pakistani record in this matter over these last two or three years was- impeccable. She had agreed without qualification to the successiveproposals for solving the problem that had been put up from whateverquarter, Mr. Menzies, Sir Owen Dixon, Dr. Graham, the Common-wealth Prime Ministers, and so on. India, on the other hand had consistently negatived every solution that had been put forward. Itwas hard in these circumstances to believe that India was likely to change her tune; the strain on Pakistan was great.11 (b) The solution of the Kashmir issue was a test case for U.N.O. Afterthe first world war the natural desire of human beings for some tribunal which could, objectively consider international issues and find a solutionof them had been met by the establishment of the. League of Nations.The League had failed. It looked now as though U.N.O. was goingto fail also- That would be a profound blow to the aspirations and.hopes of right-thinking men all through the world. But the Kashmircase was a test case.&apos;(c) The United Kingdom and the United States should have done more thanthey had. Lord Mountbatten carried a responsibility for the turnthings had taken because of his handling, of affairs while Viceroy.
(d) As regards the recent Mohammed Ali/Nehru correspondence, he found it quite impossible to be sure what India had agreed to. Pandit Nehrucontinued to take refuge in vague evasions. At first he had been extremely slow to make a move about committees, then Pakistan hadpinned him down and had secured his agreement to the committeesbeing set up in principle. Pakistan had then put-forward specific pro-posals for membership, place and time. Now a reply had beenreceived proposing that there should be a steering committee for thetwo committees. Why was this necessary? Surely it was only anotherexample of Pandit Nehru&apos;s reluctance to settle, and his evasive tactics.The Pakistan Cabinet would probably be perfectly ready to agree to afurther meeting between the two Prime Ministers, but he was verypessimistic about any advance. As for Admiral Nimitz, Pandit Nehruhad written on 21st September suggesting considering dropping the admiral and possibly finding an Administrator in his place from some small neutral country or from Asia. But even before that letter was issued a United Press leak in India, which was obviously well informed,told the public the whole story and made it impossible for Pakistan toconsider these proposals in the detached atmosphere which they wouldhave wished.4. The Secretary of State found it difficult to pierce through the inspissatedgloom of Dr. Qureshi, or indeed to pin him to any precise solution of the difficulties to which he had referred.  He made the following points to him:  (a) Whatever truth there was in what he said about U.N.O., the practicalissue before us now was how to make an advance towards a solution,which the whole Commonwealth were most anxious to see.(b) It was no good starting from the beginning and considering whether ornot this or that particular international organisation had failed to givethe results expected from it. We were all members of U.N.O. and wehad to work through it. The Kashmir issue was before U.N.O. If asolution could not otherwise be found it would have to go back tothe Security Council.(c) Indian tactics would be likely to be to try so to handle matters as to getthe Kashmir issue from it to the Assembly. It would be most unfor-unfortunate from the point of view of Pakistan if that were to happen. Allthe advances that had so far been made and all the points that hadbeen gained by Pakistan would again be thrown open to general dis-cussion in a very large body, ill-informed as to particular aspects ofthe case, and likely to be moved by tactical consideration. It was most undesirable that there should be any risk of that.(d) He did not quite understand what solution Dr. Qureshi favoured.  War,which would be suicidal from the point of view of both countries, wassurely out of the question? Dr. Qureshi agreed. Had he in mindeconomic sanctions? Dr. Qureshi thought even economic sanctions would not be necessary. What then did he contemplate? He mighthave in mind a formal condemnation by U.N.O. of India? But what-ever might be the arguments for that, how much further was thatgoing to take us? In the first place the Secretary of State did not believe. it would be possible to get the Security Council to agree to such acondemnation. Next, even if they did, surely it would only hardenthe Indian attitude, or increase the risk, to which he had already referred,of having the matter remitted to the Assembly, which would unquestionable-ably play into Indian hands. Dr. Qureshi said he thought there was agreat deal to be said for some public condemnation of India&apos;s tacticsand her refusal to co-operate. It might well be that things were as theSecretary of State had said. But he knew India well and he knewPandit Nehru well. There was undoubtedly an element in India which took a more reasonable view than Pandi Nehru on this business andhe felt that condemnation by the world would so strengthen the handsof the element which wished to bring pressure to bear on Pandit Nehruto get a settlement of this matter, that an advance might result. TheSecretary of State repeated that he saw no prospect of the security council agreeing to anything of this nature.
3oo23rd November, 1953.5. Further discussion did not shake Dr. Qureshi in his critical attitude orelicit from him any new suggestion as to how the situation could best be handled.He agreed that the terms of the correspondence between Pandit Nehru and thePrime Minister Mohammed Ali probably left it open to India in certain circum-stances to continue delaying tactics. The Secretary of State pointed out theimportance of being quite clear in these two-men discussions as to what was agreed,and preferably of going into action with a specific note of points or proposals fordiscussion. It was in any event important that Pakistan, her record being as good as the Minister had pointed out, should continue her temperate approach, but should lose no opportunity of putting on record the number of propositions which over aperiod of years she had been ready to accept without a corresponding acceptancefrom the Indian side. Dr. Qureshi said that he agreed as to the importance of a specific written agenda. In fact a note had been made of what passed in theMohammed Ali/Nehru conversations. A copy of that note had been sent to theIndian side and there had been no challenge to it from them. To that extent theymight be regarded as not dissenting from it as a correct statement of facts.6. The conversation ended somewhat inconclusively, the Secretary of Stateagain urging on the Minister the importance of maintaining Pakistani co-operativeattitude.(Signed)        GILBERT LAITHWAITE,United Kingdom High Commissioner.
