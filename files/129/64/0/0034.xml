Printed for the Cabinet, November 1953SECRET Copy No.     60C. (53) 33426th November, 1953CABINETEND OF PUBLIC TRADING IN SULPHUR AND PYRITESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theMinister of MaterialsI am glad to inform my colleagues that I shall cease public trading in sulphurand pyrites the raw materials of sulphuric acid at the end of this year and revoke the three remaining statutory controls on the sulphuric acid industry. TheChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade agreed with my predecessor last May that this should be done, but it has taken time to work outthe details and dispose advantageously of a troublesome pyrites contract.2. Although from 1st January, 1954, imports of sulphur and pyrites will nolonger be on Government Account, the amount of sulphur to be imported for makingsulphuric acid will be restricted by import licensing to the amount necessary to meet requirements after the fullest possible use has been made of alternative materials,viz, pyrites, which are imported mainly from Spain and Cyprus; spent oxide, whichis a by-product of gas works; and anhydrite, which is a mineral found in thiscountry. This may well lead to complaint from those manufacturers who would prefer to use sulphur, on the ground that sulphur burning plants, fully operated,would be cheaper and more convenient.3. The main source of sulphur is the United States. Sulphur became veryscarce in 1950. The resulting shortage of sulphuric acid, of which we made 60 percent, of our requirements from sulphur, was very serious. In our own interest, andunder considerable pressure from the United States Government, everything possiblewas done to persuade manufacturers to build new plants, or convert existing ones,for the use of materials other than sulphur. Some  25 millions have been invested in this programme and by 1955 we shall be in a position to meet more than 80 percent, of our sulphuric acid requirements from alternative materials.4. If we do not ensure that these plants are kept in full use and that contractsare maintained for the materials which they use, and especially pyrites, we shall find ourselves in serious difficulties in the event of a recurrence of a shortage of sulphur.Such a recurrence is by no means unlikely in view of the heavy dependence on theUnited States, which provides 90 per cent, of the world&apos;s exports of sulphur, andof the small margin between supply and demand for sulphur at the present time.5. It is therefore my intention, in agreement with the President of the Boardof Trade, for the time being to restrict imports of sulphur, as I have indicated inparagraph 2. The amount permitted for acid making will be shared on a basisof past usage amongst the manufacturers using sulphur-burning plants by theNational Sulphuric Acid Association, which is fully representative of the industry;and the manufacturers will be free, in the interests of rationalisation of sulphur-burning plants, to arrange amongst themselves for its use. This is not an idealarrangement, but there are good grounds for believing that it will not be abused.45242
6. I intend to keep a close watch on the situation in order that any practicablerelaxation of the arrangements I have described may be made without delay. Thiswould in any case be necessary if it should no longer be possible to defend import licensing of sulphur on currency grounds: but, so long as this is possible, thecontrol of imports provides a useful support to the process of changing over tothe manufacture of sulphuric acid from other materials.W.Ministry of Materials, S.W. I,23rd November, 1953.
