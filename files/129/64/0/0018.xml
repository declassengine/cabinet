COPY NiMILITARY AID TO JORDAN IN THE EVENTOF ATTACK BY ISRAEL,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The increase of tension between Israel and Jordan since the Qibyaincident has brought to the forefront the questions of (i) our obligation to goto war to assist Jordan if she is attacked by Israel, and (ii) what, if any, military measures we should take as a deterrent to Israel, either forthwith or in theevent of a further incident which, though serious, did not lead to war.United Kingdom obligation towards Jordan2. The text of Articles 2 to 4 of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of Allianceof 1948 is annexed.   Under Article 3 we are obliged to go to Jordanls aid if she becomes engaged in war, provided that she has duly concerted with us to try and settle the dispute by peaceful means, and subject always to theobligations  of both parties under the United Nations Charter and other international agreements.   Since Article 51 of the United Nations Chartersafeguards the right of collective self-defence pending action by the security council, it would seem that the only United Nations action which could relieveus of our obligation to assist Jordan if she were attacked would be a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII (the &quot;sanctions&quot; chapter) of the charter, on which the United Kingdom would, of course, have a veto.3. A further complication is that Jordan is obliged under the Arab LeagueTreaty of Joint Defence (1950) to go to the aid of any other party to the treaty which may be attacked.   It is thus possible, e.g. that Jordan might call uponthe United Kingdom for assistance under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty as a resultof defending Syria against aggression by Israel.   Our obligations in such acase would depend very much on the precise circumstances.4. Our obligation to assist Jordan in the event of attack might not arise if we could argue that the Jordan Government had not carried out its obligationto seek a peaceful settlement (Article 2 of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty), or to concert measures of defence with us under the second part of Article 3,   Itis, however, clear that, whatever the precise legal position, a failure on our part to defend Jordan against at any rate a direct attack by Israel would provokeintense bitterness in the Arab world and destroy the value of our Treatyconnections, especially with Jordan and Iraq.   The Jordan Government werereassured about six weeks ago of our intention to defend Jordan in case of war;with the rider that border incidents or limited reprisal raids would not, inour view, constitute a casus foederis.Question   of stationing British forces in Jordan.5. The Chiefs of Staff, I understand, take the view that in presentcircumstances Israel could probably overrun Jordan before she could beSECRETC. (53) 31813th NOVEMBER, 1953.CABINET
effectively assisted by United Kingdom forces.   It is, therefore, forconsideration whether we should seek to deter Israel and stabilise the situation by sending limited British forces into Jordan in peace-time as an earnest ofour intention to implement the Treaty.   The Cabinet agreed in principle on29th October (C.C,(53) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 5) that we should accept the invitation of the Jordan Prime Minister to despatch an armoured squadron toMaan in Eastern Jordan, ostensibly for training with tine Arab Legion,   I have,however, suspended formal confirmation of our agreement pending the outcome of the Security Council debate on Qibya,   In addition to the armoured squadron,the forces which we should be able, if the Jordan Government agreed, to despatch to Jordan might consist of a battalion and four R,A.F. squadrons,6. The arguments for such a despatch of token forces to Jordan are:-(i) they would diminish the likelihood of our being called upon tocarry out our engagement to assist Jordan in war, since the Israelies would be more hesitant about committing an act of aggression against Jordan;(ii) if we nevertheless had to fulfil this engagement they would help usto do so more effectively;(iii) apart from the Israel-Jordan question,   it is in our general strategicinterest to station troops in Jordan as an alternative to the canal zone.   The despatch even of token forces would enable us to get afoot in the door,7, The arguments against are:-(i) The despatch of British forces to Jordan would be regarded inpro-Israel circles   as an unjustified intervention in the Israel-Jordandispute.   The weight of this argument may be affected by the outcome of the current debate in the Security Council;(ii) if British forces are stationed in Jordan there will be strong pressure on us to use them against the Israelis, certainly in caseof war, and perhaps even in the event of a further serious borderincident.   Consequently, our freedom of political manoeuvre asbetween Israel and the Arabs might be circumscribed.Re commendation8, I consider that the move of an armoured squadron to Jordan, authorised by the Cabinet on 29th October, should not take place pending the discussion of theQibya incident in the Security Council.   Subject to the outcome of this discussion,however, we should, at the same time as we proceed with the move of the armoured squadron to Maan, suggest to the Jordan Government that this shouldbe supplemented by an additional battalion and four R.A.F. squadrons as soonas possible,A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.I.13th November, 1953.
