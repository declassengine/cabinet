Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1953SECRET Copy No. ? 6C (53) 31613th November, 1953CABINETGERMANY, AUSTRIA AND SECURITY ARRANGEMENTSNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues herewith a report made to me by Sir Frank Roberts,Deputy Under-Secretary of State in the Foreign Office, on recent conversations in Paris between United Kingdom, United States and French officials aboutGermany, Austria and Security Arrangements.2. Much of the work of this Tripartite Official Study Group has beenovertaken by the Soviet Governments refusal to meet us at Lugano. But someof the subjects discussed, and more especially the question of Security arrangements and the possible American desire to make some public statement of policy inregard to Germany, are still of immediate practical relevance. These are questionswhich may have to be considered at the forthcoming Bermuda meeting between4th and 8th December and probably shortly afterwards at the Ministerial meetingof the North Atlantic Council in Paris between 14th and 16th December.3. I am giving further thought to these questions, on which I shall want to consult my colleagues later this month. Meanwhile, I thought they might liketo know of the preliminary work which has already been done by officials of thethree Western Governments.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. I,11th November, 1953.Secretary of StateTRIPARTITE OFFICIAL TALKS ON GERMANY, AUSTRIA and security  ARRANGEMENTSHeld in Paris 21st October-2nd November, 1953I submit herewith the report on the tripartite talks at official level on Germany,Austria and Security Arrangements, held in Paris from 21st October to 2nd Novem-ber, at which I led the United Kingdom Delegation. It was agreed between theUnited Kingdom, United States and French Delegations that the report, althoughit covers certain matters where the three Delegations were not in full agreement,should be submitted as an agreed report to the three Foreign Ministers. It covers the following subjects:  I. General objectives and tactics.II. Security arrangements.III. Austria.IV.-Germany.45175
(i) proposed &quot; Declaration of Intent &quot;;(ii) free elections;(iii) status of the all-German Government;(iv) heads of a peace treaty;(v) economic questions.2.   The purpose of the Paris meeting was threefold:(a) to prepare the ground, as instructed by the Foreign Ministers in Washingtonlast July, for quadripartite discussions at Lugano, if the Russiansaccepted our invitation;(b) in the event of failure at Lugano, or of the Russians refusing our invitation,to consider in broad outline our course of action in the coming months;(c) to carry out the instructions issued by the three Foreign Ministers inLondon to examine the question of security arrangements.3. The Soviet note of 3rd November has made our work under heading 2 (a)to a large extent academic. I shall therefore try in this minute to draw attentionto those parts of our work which are still of immediate importance.4. The work done at the Paris meeting was exploratory and ad referendumto Governments. All three delegations made it clear that they could not committheir Ministers in any way. Where our views differed on matters of substancethere was no attempt to &quot; paper over the cracks &quot;; as we were working on anumber of hypotheses it was thought that the three Foreign Ministers would prefer to have the different arguments before them and to defer some of their decisions until we all knew better where we stood with regard to a meeting withthe Russians.I. General objectives and tactics5. There is no longer any need to consider the second part of this paper containing recommendations on the tactical handling of the Lugano meeting. Thefirst two pages of this paper, however, setting out in very summary form what seemto be the main objectives of (a) the Three Powers, (b) the Soviet Union, (c) theGermans, and (d) the Austrians in regard to a German and an Austrian settle-ment respectively, are of long-term significance.II. Security arrangements6. This is, I think, the most important paper emerging from the Paris talksand one which is of immediate relevance despite the Russian refusal to come toLugano. My impression is that the French delegation consulted M. Bidault at every stage, and I would therefore expect him to approve the report itself andthe first or more comprehensive of the draft declarations in paragraph 6 of thereport. The first five paragraphs are a brief statement of the problem. Paragraph 6contains the two alternative draft declarations. The American draft is clearlyquite useless for public opinion, and I do not think the Americans would insist upon it if and when the time came to make some declaration. They werenaturally anxious not to be committed too far in an attempt to meet what areat present hypothetical contingencies. The first or Anglo-French draft does,I think, go as far as it would be possible to go in the immediately foreseeable futureby way of unilateral declarations. The object is to dispose of Russian accusationsthat the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and the European defence community (E.D.C.) are not defensive and are a menace to Russian security.Apart from this, the essential feature of this declaration is a solemn Germanrenunciation of recourse to force buttressed by a statement by the three western powers, and, we hope, eventually the other N.A.T.O. Powers, solemnly with-holding all forms of support should the German or any other Government violatethese undertakings Given the existence of the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-SovietTreaties, which commit us to support the Soviet Union against German aggression,this additional pledge involving the United States goes a very long way to meetlegitimate Soviet security requirements. Indeed, it goes so far that the americans have raised the bogey of possible Congressional difficulties. My own impression,however, is that we might eventually get the Americans to go as far as this but no further. The American Delegation in Paris made it clear that their refusal to accept this wider draft now by no means excluded favourable considerationlater on in the light of future needs and requirements.
7. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the report deal with the ideas that have been putforward for (a) demilitarised zones in Germany, and (b) limitation of Soviet and western forces in Germany. The Tripartite Group came down strongly againsteither of these proposals at this stage. This is, incidentally, in accordance with theviews of the British Chiefs of Staff.8. The last part of the paper deals entirely with tactics and the only para-graph which is still relevant is paragraph III (1), which deals with the situationnow facing us, i.e., no Lugano.III. Austria9. The Austrian paper is mainly concerned with how to handle the Austrianquestion at Lugano and has, therefore, now been largely overtaken by events.We did, however, succeed in persuading the Americans to drop their insistenceupon reopening the famous economic Article 35, on the understanding that theAustrian Government would themselves be encouraged to ask, with our support,for alleviation of the economic burdens which this Article would continue to impose upon Austria.10. The part of the Austrian paper which is now relevant is the second partproposing action in the event of there being no Lugano. The recommendation is, briefly, that we should now reply to the Soviet note of 28th August, accompanyingthis with oral enquiries through the Ambassadors in Moscow as to how theRussians think negotiations can best be pursued &quot; through diplomatic channels.&quot;IV. Germany11. The papers on which early further consultation with the German federal chancellor would still be useful are those dealing with free elections and the all-German Government.12. (ii) Free Elections. We agreed that recent events had shown that theGermans could now be relied upon to vote anti-Communist, and that a detailedsystem of guarantees was no longer required. We must, however, ensure secrecy of the vote, security of the ballot boxes, accurate counting of the votes and amachinery of local and central supervision by observers, including preferablyneutrals, representatives of the four Powers, and Germans from East and West.The main question at issue was whether the three Western Powers should continueto insist upon the preparation and promulgation of the electoral law by the fourOccupation Powers or whether they could safely go some way to meet the Sovietview that this law could be prepared by East and West Germans. Our conclusion in Paris was that we must adopt the four-Power procedure, while, of course, fullyconsulting the Federal German Government, for the simple reason that the WestGermans would never agree to any procedure which might be interpreted as opening the door to recognition of the East Germans. The whole question is one of closeconcern to the Federal Government and their views must carry great weight.13. (iii) Status of the all-German Government. This is a much more difficult question indeed the most difficult question with which we dealt at Paris exceptfor that of security arrangements. The basic problem is to prevent the Russiansbringing about &quot; an Austrian situation &quot; in which a German Central Government,itself a product of free elections, would still be at the mercy of the Russians, who could make further progress towards a peace treaty dependent upon the abandon-ment by Germany of the E.D.C. and similar concepts. We might then be facedwith the worst of all worlds in which there was an all-German Government but nopeace treaty, and we had lost the Federal Government and with it the E.D.C., &amp;c.14. There are broadly two alternative approaches to the problem. The first,rather surprisingly favoured by the French, was to accept all the risks inherent inthe logic of our previous position, i.e., that the all-German Government issuingfrom free elections must be free to decide whether to maintain or begin membership of the E.D.C. The French were confident it would reach the right decision. Onthis hypothesis, the Federal and East Zone Governments would disappear the minute the all-German Government was set up. The more cautious approachfavoured by ourselves and the Americans (and incidentally by the Russians in theirAugust notes) was to limit the powers of the all-German Government mainly tothe establishment of a constitution and the negotiation of a peace treaty, whilethe Federal and East Zone Governments remained in being until the peace treaty
had been finally concluded. In our view, the more serious practical difficulties about such a proposal could be overcome by Dr. Adenauer, as Chancellor, beinghead of the all-German as well as the Federal Government, as would probably bethe case if there were free elections to-day.15. There are strong arguments both ways and there is every advantage inobtaining Dr. Adenauer&apos;s considered views before reaching any final view ourselves.16.-(iv) Heads of the Peace Treaty and (v) Economic Questions. Papers (iv)and (v) dealing with the &quot; heads of the peace treaty &quot; and &quot; economic questions &quot;require no immediate action. There are some rather important differences betweenthe three Western Governments on such questions as reparations, and more especi-ally over an American suggestion that we should not follow the normal treatyprocedure of covering our own economic interests within it, e.g., on such matters as the German debt settlement, because of the difficulties the Russians would createfor us, but that we should instead rely upon our relations with the future all-GermanGovernment to ensure that it carries out the existing obligations of the federal government. Neither we nor the French felt we could agree to accept thiscalculated risk. However, no decisions on either of these papers are requiredunless and until we get nearer to an actual negotiation with the Russians.17. (i) Declaration of Intent. The first Germany paper entitled &quot; Declarationof Intent &quot; is, however, of more immediate relevance. The Americans have had it in mind for some months to take the initiative in Germany by some resoundingpropaganda statement of policy. Their original draft went much further thanthe draft now submitted, which still includes many brackets. We and the french have hitherto taken the line that there is no demand in Germany for such a state-ment, which might have undesirable repercussions in France and elsewhere, andthat it is, therefore, far better to concentrate for the next few months simply upongetting the Bonn and Paris Treaties into force. If we met with setbacks over this or if the internal situation in Germany changed for the worse, then would be thetime to consider making such a Declaration of Intent. The draft emerging from the paris meeting is pretty anodyne and could well form the basis for such a statement,if and when required.Conclusion and Suggestions for Action18. Consultation with the Chancellor on free elections and the status of anall-German Government and further action in regard to an Austrian Treaty arebeing dealt with separately. There remain the questions of security arrangements and that of some declaration on policy towards Germany. I think it will be inthe general interest for the Western Powers to make some declaration of our policyin regard to N.A.T.O., &amp;c, which could also cover the question of security arrange-ments. The timing will have to be carefully considered in the light of progress on the E.D.C., &amp;c, but we should, I think, have something ready for consideration at the North Atlantic Treaty Ministerial meeting next month. The americans will, on present form, want to accompany anything of this kind with some declara-tion of German policy on the lines of the Declaration of Intent. Again the timingwill have to be carefully considered. We are going into all this urgently with a viewto a separate submission. If it is decided to aim at some declaration at the N.A.T.O.meeting in mid-December, there will not be too much time for the necessary preliminary consultations with (a) the United States and the French, (b) Dr.Adenauer, and (c) N.A.T.O.FRANK K.

TRIPARTITE OFFICIAL TALKS ON GERMANY AND AUSTRIA,PARIS, OCTOBER 21-NOVEMBER 2, 1953A meeting of officials of the United States, United Kingdom and France washeld in Paris from October 21 to November 2, 1953. Their purpose was to examinejointly the problems likely to arise at an eventual Lugano meeting, and to define the position of the three Western Allies in regard to Germany and Austria in theevent of this conference not taking place. The results of this work are set out inthe following documents:  I. General tactics.II. Security.III. Austria.IV. Germany (i) Declaration of Intent.(ii) Free elections.(iii) Status of an all-German Government.(iv) Heads of a Peace Treaty.(v) Economic questions.2. Appropriate communications will be made to the Government of theFederal Republic, the Austrian Government, the Benelux Governments and theNorth Atlantic Council.Paris, November 2, 1953.Document No. IOBJECTIVES AND TACTICS FOR LUGANOI.-The Objectives of the Three PowersA. Germany1.   The following are the basic objectives of our policy towards Germany:  (i) To reunify Germany by means of free elections resulting in an all-Germannational assembly and the formation of an all-German Government.(ii) To conclude a freely-negotiated Peace Treaty with unified Germany,(hi) To ensure the integration of unified Germany (or, failing unification, ofthe German Federal Republic) into the Western European community,which itself will form a part of a constantly developing atlantic community.2. With these principles in mind, our objectives at the Lugano conference should be:  (i) To reach agreement with, the Soviet Union on German reunion infreedom, which would open the way to a general settlement.  :(ii) Failing that, to establish that our proposals represent the only means of re-establishing German unity in freedom.(iii) To show that our proposals on Germany form part of a general programme which takes into account the security requirements of all european countries, and of the Soviet Union, and is designed to ensure the peaceful co-existence of the Soviet Union with the West.(iv) To throw light on Soviet intentions. If the Soviet Union takes a negativeposition, to make it clear that the Russians alone are responsible forthe maintenance of the division of Gerrhany and of Europe.(v) To keep open the prospect of further negotiation with the Soviet Unionat a later date. (See paragraphs I, II and III of the Declaration of intent.)   (Document No. IV (i).),
B. Austria3. (i) To conclude an Austrian Treaty which will ensure the political andeconomic independence of Austria,(ii) In the event of Soviet obstruction, to make it clear that the latter aloneis responsible for failure to agree on a treaty.II. Presumed Soviet ObjectivesA.-iBasic Objectives4. (i) To frustrate the policies of the North Atlantic Alliance and to prevent theestablishment of the E.D.C.(ii) To achieve the elimination of N.A.T.O. bases and the withdrawal of UnitedStates troops from Europe.B. Germany5. (i) To prevent, if possible, the integration either of the Federal Republic orof unified Germany within the Western European community, and inparticular to prevent German military and economic resources from increasing the Western defence potential.(ii) To isolate Germany from the West so that eventually she may fall underSoviet domination.(iii) Pending the achievement of the foregoing objectives, to restore the Sovietposition in the Eastern Zone of Germany and, to this end, to build up the prestige of the discredited East German Administration (D.D.R.).C. Austria6. To obstruct the conclusion of any Austrian Treaty until the German prob-lem has been settled in a manner satisfactory to the Soviet Union.III. German Objectives7. To obtain German reunification in freedom and within the framework of western European integration.IV. Austrian Objectives8. To achieve the speedy evacuation of Austria and, to this end, obtain a peace treaty as quickly as possible, even if this entails risks.V. Suggested Tactics for the Three Powers at LuganoA.-Germany9. (i) Before the usual wrangle on the agenda, the Conference should begin witha general discussion, in which Ministers could present a broad outline oftheir views on Germany and Austria and on the problem of security, and could set out the principal objections to the proposals advanced by theSoviet Union during the past few years, and in particular to those containedin the Soviet draft Peace Treaty first submitted in March .1952 and resub-mitted in August 1953. Ministers could make it quite clear that theessential problem facing the Conference is that of free elections and theformation of an all-German Government; and that the work of theConference should concentrate in the first place on these two points.(ii) If we are to achieve our basic objectives, we must avoid a breakdown ofthe Conference on the establishment of an agenda, particularly on theproblem of the order in which the various points should be discussed(i.e., whether free elections or a peace treaty should come first, or whetherthe Austrian problem should be dealt with before the German problem).(iii) In their note to the Soviet Union of October 18, the three Powers said thatthe Lugano meeting would enable the Soviet Government to state its viewson any aspect of the German and Austrian questions which it might wishto present. We cannot, therefore, object to the Russians setting out theirviews on a German Peace Treaty. If they can be brought to accept dis-cussion of this question after the question of free elections, this discussioncould follow the lines indicated in the paper on the Peace Treaty. It seemsalmost certain, however, that the Russians will demand that the question
of a peace Treaty should take precedence on the Conference agenda. Inthis event, we should not allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into making this demand a breaking point. However, the three Ministers would confinethemselves to hearing the Soviet representative and to indicating that, fortheir part, they can only discuss the peace treaty with the participation oflegitimate representatives of the whole of Germany,(iv) The Russians may propose that representatives of the Federal republic and of the East Zone Government should take part in a discussion of this or of other questions. We consider that this is an unacceptable suggestion.Dr. Adenauer has consistently shared this view. A Russian proposal of this nature would, of course, call for immediate consultation with the federal government.B. Security Arrangements10. It would be preferable not to table a formal proposal on this subjectduring the opening exchange of views, but only to speak of it in general terms,since a detailed discussion of the problem at this stage would enable the russians to sidetrack us into a Palais Rose discussion.11. The Russians may advance their usual demands for the suppression ofE.D.C. and N.A.T.O., elimination of bases, &amp;c. In this case, we should reply thatwe are not prepared to discuss the fundamentals of our security. Alternatively,they may ask us to state the nature of the security arrangements we have in mind.They might just conceivably show interest in a security guarantee, once germany is reunified, or even possibly propose quadripartite control of German rearmament.In this event, we might indicate that we would be prepared to take effective stepsto prevent Germany from changing by force the eventual territorial settlementresulting from a German Peace Treaty. But this could only be done after thereunification of Germany and conclusion of the Treaty. Thus, if concrete progress could be made on our proposals in this respect, we would be willing to discuss ageneral security system with the Russians. As far as German rearmament isconcerned, the E.D.C. offers the best immediate safeguard.12. If the Russians continue to press us, we should bring the discussions backto the essential issue of reunification in freedom.13. At this stage it is impossible finally to decide the text or timing of any formal declaration to be made on security. This will depend on whether or notreal progress is made at Lugano. (See also Section III of paper on securityguarantees (Document II) for a more detailed discussion of these tactics.)C. Austria14. We should press for a general exchange of views by Ministers, in whichthey would examine the question of participation by the Austrian Government and,if possible, would agree upon an Austrian treaty. We could, however, as suggestedin the report on Austria, recommend that the question be rapidly referred to the deputies. We should naturally refuse to establish any link between the Austrianquestion and the German question.
SECURITY ASSURANCESI. General considerartions the demands put forward by the U.S.S.R. since the war under the guise of security requirements have led them to seek concrete guarantees, either of a terri-torial nature or by means of intervention in the internal affairs of other States.This policy has led to a deep feeling of insecurity throughout the rest of the world.2. The U.S.S.R. has several times rejected any kind of juridical guaranteerelating to its security. Thus it rejected the U.S. draft treaty for the demilitarisation-tion and disarmament of Germany proposed in April .1946, and again in April1947. Furthermore, after Sir Winston churchill&apos;s speech of May 11, 1953, theSoviet press declared that Locarno type guarantees had no value since they&quot; authorised all realignment of powers,&quot; i.e., the maintenance of those alliancesnow existing in the West.3. The U.S.S.R. has publicly defined the optimum conditions for its own security in Europe: break up of N.A.T.O., discard of E.D.C., and elimination ofmilitary bases on foreign territory. The Soviet Union has contended until now that its security could only be assured if Europe were evacuated by american forces and if Germany were militarily controlled and prevented from joining anyalliance. Therefore, until proof of the contrary, Russian security remains, in soviet eyes, primarily dependent upon the conclusion of a peace treaty conformingto its views.4. The Western Powers have sought to ensure their own security by organisingtheir defence as far to the East as possible in Europe and with this in view, byproposing to associate Germany in the common effort. The attitude adopted sofar by the U.S.S.R. gives these Powers no choice but to pursue these defensiveefforts. They are, nevertheless, ready to consider the assurances which they could give to the U.S.S.R. in regard to its legitimate security requirements.5. The security guarantees which we could offer to the U.S.S.R., in additionto those which it already enjoys in virtue of commitments stemming from theU.N. Charter and from the existing treaties, of the strictly defensive character ofour policies and of the present de facto situation, are of two kinds: either supple-mentary agreements, or declarations of intention of a non-contractual nature.As far as agreements are concerned, there are two possibilities: guaranteepacts calling for mutual assistance, and non-aggression pacts. The principalobstacle to the conclusion of a guarantee pact is that the frontier to be guaranteedis not final. Should this frontier be established, there would still be numerousproblems to solve before one could take steps in this direction. The obstacle tothe conclusion of non-aggression pacts is that France and the United Kingdom arealready bound to the U.S.S.R. by mutual assistance pacts; in a more general con-text, non-aggression pacts have little intrinsic value and, in the absence of sanctions,carry no more than illusory assurances.Furthermore, we must realise that by the initiating of discussions with theRussians either on guarantee pacts or non-agression pacts, we would risk arousingfalse hopes in the mind of the Western public which would hamper the commonrearmament effort, particularly if the U.S.S.R. succeeded in dragging out the nego-tiations by formulating counter-proposals e.g., the neutralisation of Germany of a kind liable to confuse public opinion. In present circumstances, therefore, itseems that the only possibility is a unilateral declaration defining the general policy we intend to secure.II. Proposed Declaration6. This should be as far-reaching as possible and should be so worded as toleave no doubt of the sincerity of our intentions. With these considerations inmind, the following formula, which the French and British Delegations favoured,might be envisaged:  &quot; A.   The Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and France,Resolved to devote their efforts to the strengthening of peace, in accord-ance with the general principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and inparticular with the purposes defined in Article 2 of the Charter;
Determined to safeguard the purely defensive character of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation which is clearly expressed in the Treaty estab-lishing this Organisation;Considering that the European Defence Community by its very structureconstitutes a strictly defensive organisation;Formally take note that the German Federal Republic has undertaken toaccept the obligations of the Charter of the United Nations and in particular of Article 2 thereof;Record the declaration of (date) by the terms of which the Governmentof the German Federal Republic,Recalling that the provisions of the Treaty establishing the european defence Community, relating to the integration of forces and pooling of resources and armaments of the member States on the European continentmake any individual armed action on the part of these States impossible,Undertakes to refrain from any action likely to revise or impair eitherthese provisions or the strictly defensive character of the European defence community of which the forces cannot be employed except, for the protectionof the territory of member States against an armed attack in Europe;Undertakes in consequence in no case to have recourse to force, but to resolve by peaceful means any disputes which may arise between the federal republic and other States.B. The Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Francedeclare that they will withhold all forms of support from any Government com-mitting any action in violation of the above-mentioned undertakings and to regard themselves, wherever they consider it necessary to this end, as automatically released from their commitments to that Government.They accept a similar obligation in case the Government of unified germany should have recourse to force to modify the frontiers settled by the Treaty of Peace.C. The Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Francewill use their best efforts to obtain the association of the other member States ofthe N.A.T.O. with the declaration and the obligation set out in the preceding paragraph.&quot;The American Delegation, for its part, favoured the following formula:  &quot; A. The Governments of the United States, United Kingdom and France,dedicated to the task of strengthening the peace, and faithful to the principles of theUnited Nations Charter, note with special satisfaction that the Government of theGerman Federal Republic, acting in furtherance of Article 3 (1) of the convention on Relations between the three Powers and the Federal Republic, has pledged itselfto accept the obligations set forth in Article 2 of the United Nations Charter:  (i) To settle its international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered;(ii) To refrain in its international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State orin any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations;(iii) To give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes inaccordance with the Charter and to refrain from giving assistance toany State against which the United Nations may take preventive orenforcement action.B. The Governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Franceconfirm that they will be guided by the principles of Article 2 of the United nations charter in their relations with Germany.C. The three Governments recall that under Article 1 of the North atlantic treaty all member States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have under-taken the firm obligation to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations fromthe threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations; and that likewise the signatories of the Treaty establishing the european defence Community have declared that the objectives of the Community areexclusively defensive.
- D. Furthermore, the three Governments draw attention to their solemn obli-gation, also shared by all members of the United Nations, to take whatever stepsmay be necessary in accordance with the provisions of the Charter for the hiain-tenance Of international peace and security, and for ensuring that States which arenot members of the United Nations shall act in accordance with the Charter so faras such may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security.&quot;7. It does not appear desirable to propose to the Soviets the creation of ademilitarised zone. The security resulting from the existence of such a zone wouldbe very questionable. A demilitarised zone might well become the scene of frequentincidents and, in the final analysis, the cause of peace might stand to lose more thanit gains. Furthermore, there are other serious military objections to the establish-ment of a demilitarised zone in Western Germany. Any suggestion of this kind would, moreover, give the Moscow Government the opportunity of carrying the debate into the field of the neutralisation of the whole of Germany. This is a subject in which the Russians have much more freedom of manoeuvre than we havebecause of their established position in the satellite countries. If the discussions were to take this direction, the Russians might thus be able to secure a seriousadvantage vis-a-vis public opinion.8. Finally the possibility was considered of proposing to the U.S.S.R., afterthe coming into force of the E.D.C. and its effective implementation, the conclusionof an arrangement setting a ceiling for the total forces of the West stationed in theterritory of the Federal Republic and the forces stationed in Eastern Germany.The purpose of such an arrangement would be to avoid an increasing concentration,on either side, of forces in Germany itself. But a formula of this kind would have serious drawbacks in the military field. Moreover, the discussion to which it would lead would supply the Soviets with pretexts for outbidding us and thus place us inan embarrassing position. It should therefore be decisively discarded under present circumstances.III.-Tactics9. The declaration provided for in paragraph 6 will be quite easy to use ifthere is no Lugano Conference. A Soviet refusal to attend the Conference, evenif it is obscured by general counter-proposals, would leave the initiative in our hands. In this case we would have to select the most suitable moment for putting forward our proposals in the light of general developments and taking our needsinto account.10. If the Russians accept our invitation to a conference the problem willbecome more difficult. The Allied Note of the 18th of October declares that &quot; real progress towards a solution of major international problems including the problemof European security can be made by frank discussions on Germany and Austriaat a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, U.S.S.R., UnitedKingdom and France.&quot; Strictly speaking this sentence does not commit us toexamine the question of security at this stage. In fact, however, it makes it unlikelythat we can avoid a discussion of this question should the Soviet Delegation askfor it.11. It has been explained above that the principal advantages of a unilateral declaration were that it provided a means of offering assurances to Russia without,however, linking ourselves to her by a negotiated agreement. If we wish to retainthese advantages it seems preferable that we should not introduce our declarationat the start of the Conference. The Russians would seize upon it and would wishto discuss it or, more probably, reject it. We should thus be deprived of any possibility of making use of, it at an appropriate moment.12. If we do not wish to introduce the declaration at the start of the LuganoConference we must consider how to handle the security discussion. This will depend essentially on the tactics adopted by the Soviet Delegation. There arefour main possibilities: -;-(a) the Soviet Delegation may express the views contained in the various notes of the Soviet Government (elimination of the E.D.C. and N.A.T.O. andof Allied military bases, &amp;c);
(b) they may confine themselves to questioning us as to how we envisagethe security problem, referring in particular to Sir W. churchill&apos;s speech of May 11;(c) they may go further and indicate that they would be interested in guaran-tees of a contractual character in the event of a German settlement;(d) finally they may propose limitations on German rearmament underquadripartite control.13. In these varying circumstances our replies might draw on the following considerations:  (a) the Western Powers cannot discuss the fundamentals of their security.they are not asking the U.S.S.R. to give up her system of pacts in eastern Europe, and Russia cannot therefore ask them to renouncetheir own network of alliances. This argument could not of course be taken to imply a recognition of the present de facto situation in eastern Europe;(b) the Western Powers recognise that the problem may arise of preventingGermany from changing the eventual territorial settlements resultingfrom a German Peace Treaty. However, they find great difficulty in examining this question in a positive manner at the present time asthe frontiers have not been fixed. If our discussions lead to concreteprogress towards reunification and a peace treaty, the Western powers will be seriously encouraged to discuss the setting up of a reciprocalsecurity system;(c) the answer to this would have to depend on the Russian attitude onguarantees and might be based on the above considerations;(d) any control system imposed by authoritarian means is bound to be fragile.Earlier experience in this field has been disappointing. It goes without saying that we have never envisaged unlimited German rearmament.The possibility of a limitation system could not usefully be examinedexcept in the light of concrete results achieved on other aspects of theGerman settlement. Any broader discussion of this problem shouldbe within the general context of a wider agreement on limitation or reduction of armaments.14. In all these different sets of circumstances we need not limit ourselves to giving the Russians the replies set out above; we could explain clearly how the system adopted by the West provides by its very nature assurances of security and constitutes the best proof of our peaceful intentions.15. None of the above suggestions is fully satisfactory. The Russians canalways ask us to explain our views with greater precision. But we can send theball back into their court by asking for clarification of their own views and we can bring the discussion back to the essential problem of reunification, it being under-stood that if the discussions are fruitful the question of security will have to bemore carefully examined in due course.16.   At the next stage two courses of action must be envisaged (a) the Conference may agree on free elections and on the question of theprovisional German Government. In this case we shall have to decideif the declaration is to be kept in its present form or if it should be looked at again in the light of the results achieved;(b) the Conference may not lead to an agreement. In this event the unilateralsecurity declaration would be used in a form and manner which willhave to be determined. In particular we shall be faced with the questionwhether it should- be made public at the end of the Conference or atsome later date.
AUSTRIAA. Treatment of the Austrian Question at LuganoProcedure1. Should the Soviet representative propose to confine the Austrian question to &quot; diplomatic channels,&quot; we should argue strongly that, while diplomatic channels are always open, it should be discussed at the Conference. If the Austrianitem could be delegated to the Deputies during discussion of the procedure, thiswould be preferable; otherwise the Austrian item should follow the German one,after the West has made clear during the &quot; general exchange of views &quot; that wedo not link the Austrian Treaty in any way with a German settlement and intend to achieve the prompt conclusion of the Austrian Treaty. Reference of the Austrianquestion to the Deputies should include with it specific instructions for completionof the assignment prior to the end of the Conference.Austrian Participation2. The Western Foreign Ministers should support the Austrian request forparticipation which will have been made to the Conference, and invite the Sovietview thereon. The degree and manner of participation will depend upon the Sovietattitude, but we should be in favour of full participation.Abbreviated Treaty3. If the Soviets refuse to negotiate on the grounds that the Western powers have not withdrawn the short treaty we should point out that we have in factalready withdrawn the short draft and are prepared to negotiate on the basis ofthe long draft treaty.Choice of Tactics4. It is essential that the Lugano discussions do not permit the Soviet to evadetheir responsibility for the non-conclusion of the treaty. The three Ministers would indicate at the outset that they are ready to negotiate on the basis of the long treaty.To go beyond this draft on any point would appear to them out of the question and incompatible with the commitment of the Four Powers to re-establish theindependence and sovereignty of Austria.The most delicate point concerns Article 35. The intention of the three governments is to alleviate the burden which this article imposes on Austria andto restrict the extra-territorial position which the Soviets might claim in post-treatyAustria under the present wording of Article 35. The Ministers, or their Deputies,would seek thereafter to open the discussion with a declaration by the austrian government. In the course of this declaration the latter would ask for an allevia-tion of the provisions of Article 35. The three Ministers, or their Deputies, would support the request of the Austrian Government. They would then propose toproceed to a review of the unagreed articles in their numerical order.In case the Austrians do not raise the question themselves, and if seriousnegotiations take place, the three Ministers will consult in regard to the manner of reconciling their intentions to alleviate the burden on Austria with their concern to leave to the Soviets the responsibility for a failure of the negotiations.If the Soviets seek to discuss:  (i) Trieste. We should refuse to discuss it on the grounds the issue has norelevancy to the Austrian treaty.(ii) Denazification and Demilitarisation. We should refuse to discuss them on the ground they are covered by Austrian legislation and by actionalready taken by the four High Commissioners in Vienna. Shouldthe Soviets attack Western support of the Austrian gendarmerie pro-gramme, we should point out that no legal bar exists* to preventAustria taking steps to see it has adequate security forces.
Neutralisation5. Any Soviet proposal to neutralise Austria to the detriment of western and Austrian security should be resisted at once. The Austrian Government havealready declared their unwillingness to join post-treaty military alliances. Wewould argue that this should be sufficient to allay Soviet fears, but if the Austriansthemselves should insist on further making a formal declaration, the western powers must ensure that such a declaration would leave Austria free to enter intoassociations compatible with the principles and purposes of the United Nations.It is important that such a declaration should not in any way be annexed to thetreaty. Although the cases are not parallel we should also have to bear in mind the possible consequences in Germany and elsewhere of Austrian neutralisation.Moreover, it would increase the difficulties of the West in aiding in the developmentof an adequate post-treaty Austrian army and of defence planning between theWest and Austria.Unagreed Articles6. We should initially seek Soviet agreement to the Western versions of allunagreed articles. Failing this, we might bargain one for another, or eliminatesome or all. In any case, the conclusion of a treaty should not be prevented solely by refusal to accept the Soviet version of these articles.B. Continuance of Discussions for an Austrian Treaty in the Event of a soviet Refusal to Attend the Lugano conference. If the Soviet Government refuse to take part in a Conference of foreign ministers as proposed by the Western Powers, the latter should take some positive action to make clear their intention of pursuing negotiations for an Austrian Treaty.The Working Group accordingly proposed that the Western Powers should reply tothe Soviet note of August 28 and should instruct their representatives in moscow to make an oral communication at the time they deliver this reply.2. Such a reply should be as short as possible and should put the issuessquarely before public opinion. It would point out that the Soviet Governmenthave now on three occasions prevented the resumption of negotiations for anAustrian Treaty by their refusal to attend discussions of the Deputies in London inMay and in August and of the Foreign Ministers in Lugano. This last refusal is all the more surprising in that the three Powers in their note of August 17 have withdrawn the short draft treaty. The three Powers are strongly of the opinionthat negotiations should be resumed by the Foreign Ministers or their Deputies assoon as possible.3. In presenting this note to the Soviet Foreign Minister, the three WesternAmbassadors in Moscow might orally request precise clarification as to what the soviets mean by negotiations through diplomatic channels. They would point outthe difficulty of carrying on such complicated negotiations by exchanges of notesand would enquire whether the Soviet Foreign Minister would envisage a meetingof diplomatic representatives other than the Deputies. They would also enquire atthe same time exactly what treaty the Soviet Government are prepared to sign.The Ambassadors would not enter into a detailed discussion of the treaty at thisstage and, if the Soviet Foreign Minister raised any concrete points, would reply that they would report to their Governments.4. Alternatively, it would be possible for the three Governments to limit their action either to the sending of the note or to a tripartite oral demarche.5. In the event of the action described above being unsuccessful, the three governments might consider the advisability of a report to the United Nationsdescribing the steps which the three Governments have taken in an effort to carryout the United Nations General Assembly resolution of December 20, 1952.C-Action to be Taken Pending the Conclusion of a Treaty1. The problem of further alleviation of the burden of occupation, includingpossibly the revision of the Control Agreement of 1946, should continue to be studied by the Western High Commissioners in Austria.
2. The Austrian Government will doubtless urge the Western governments to take further action along these lines. The Austrian Government have alreadyraised the question of German assets which is now being studied by the three governments. - -.-.        .:.:3. It is suggested that the three Governments should give urgent study to thelong-range problem of Austrian neutrality and should decide whether our viewsshould be made known to the Austrians.D. Information to be Given to the Austrian GovernmentFor the time being the three High Commissioners should confine themselvesto indicating to the Austrian Government that the problem of the Austrian treaty was raised in the course of the Tripartite Meeting in Paris in preparation for theconference in Lugano. After the three Governments have approved or modifiedthe recommendations of the Working Group they may authorise the High Coidtmissioners to inform the Austrian Government on certain aspects of therecommendations.2. In particular, the three High Commissioners should in this connexionexplain to the Austrian Government (i) the manner in which they would wish the Austrian Government to raisethe problem of Article 35 in the course of any future quadripartitenegotiations;(ii) the position taken by the three Governments on Austrian participation in treaty negotiations;(iii) the way the Western Governments propose to handle the problem of austrian neutrality at Lugano;(iv) finally, the High Commissioners might indicate to the Austrians that incase the Soviet do not agree to go to Lugano it is the intention of their governments, in consultation with the Austrian Government, to con-tinue their efforts for an early conclusion of the Treaty. The three governments intend in particular in this connexion to demand fromthe Soviet Government an explanation with regard to the meaning of&quot; diplomatic channels &quot; mentioned in the last Soviet note.
AnnexDeclaration of IntentI. The Governments of France, the United States and the United Kingdomreaffirm their intention to continue their efforts directed toward the conclusionof a German peace treaty prepared by France, the United States, the UnitedKingdom, the U.S.S.R. and a unified Germany. They desire to emphasise that,in spite of the disappointing results obtained hitherto, they have no intention ofrelaxing their determination to bring about the peaceful unification of germany by agreement among the Four Powers having special responsibilities with regardto Germany..    GERMANY(i) Report on the Declaration of IntentWhile the Soviet Government have published proposals for a peace treaty with Germany, the Western Powers have never stated their precise intentions withrespect to such a treaty and the Soviet Government have frequently tried to makecapital out of this. There has not as yet been any demand on the part of either the Federal Government or German public opinion for the Western Powers toput forward their proposals. On the other hand, the occasion may soon arise when it will be opportune to give the Federal Government and public opinion,both in Germany and in other countries of the West, a clear idea of the sort ofaction we should take for a German settlement once all-German elections havebeen held and it becomes possible for a unified Germany to play a free and equalpart in the negotiation Of a peace treaty. There is also the more immediate consideration that the three Western Governments have to clear their general ideasbefore meeting the Russians at Lugano.2. Such proposals should be embodied in a Declaration of Intent. A draft declaration was considered during the course of the tripartite talks in Paris andthe resulting document is attached as an annex to this report. On points where itwas not possible to reach agreement the views of the individual delegations are indicated.3. The Declaration of Intent might be used in any of the followingcircumstances:  (a) In the event of a Soviet refusal to attend the Lugano meeting it mightbe desirable to reassure public opinion in Germany and elsewhere ofthe intentions of the Western Powers to continue to work for Germanunification and a peace settlement. ..(b) Should a Foreign Ministers&apos; Conference actually take place at Luganowithout agreement being reached, there might then be advantage insuch a statement by the Western Powers.(c) At some later stage, e.g., at about the time of the entry into force of theBonn and Paris Agreements a fresh statement of Allied policy mightbe desirable.4. Apart from the above, a Declaration of Intent, without being made public,could serve as a background to the discussions at Lugano and could be drawn upon by the Western Foreign Ministers in the course of explaining their views on aGerman settlement to the Soviet Foreign Minister. In so far as the draft annexedhas had to be drawn up in the form of a public declaration which might be used at varying times and in varying circumstances, it is necessarily very general in character. This statement of principles could however be modified or expandedat any time to meet particular requirements.
II. They recall that the Bonn Agreements specifically provide for the retention-tion of these responsibilities with regard to Berlin, the unification of Germany andthe peace treaty, as a concrete expression of their determination in this respect.The Bonn and Paris Agreements together constitute an arrangement which, farfrom being an obstacle to the re-establishment of German unity, is designed to accomplish this by peaceful means.III. [The Three Powers are determined, for their part, to do nothing, whichmight deepen the division of Germany. The Three Powers trust that the soviet union, for its part, will adopt a similar attitude. This is applicable particularly to Berlin, which constitutes the symbol of the future unity of Germany, and withrespect to which the Three Powers desire to recall their previous declaration con-cerning the security of Berlin.]0IV. Eight years have passed since the defeat of the Nazi armies, during which time the people of Western Germany and West Berlin, with the assistance of theThree Powers, have reorganised their institutions on a democratic basis. Withthis and the foregoing considerations in mind, the Governments of France, theUnited States and the United Kingdom wish to record their view that the three powers and the Soviet Union should endeavour to reach early agreement on asettlement of the German problem and on a German peace treaty, embodying thefollowing principles.V. As soon as agreed by the Four Powers, an all-German ConstituentAssembly shall be created on the basis of free elections throughout Germany, with adequate supervision and safeguards to ensure their genuinely democratic character.This Assembly shall at once draft a Constitution for a unified German State witha view to forming an all-German Government. The legitimate representatives ofunified Germany will take part on a free and equal basis in negotiations for aGerman peace treaty.VI. The peace treaty should include the following provisions:  1. Germany shall be recognised as a fully sovereign State.2. Germany shall apply for membership of the United Nations and shalldeclare her intention of conforming to the principles of the united nations Charter. The Powers signatory to the peace treaty should undertake to support this appplication.3. Germany shall immediately undertake to conduct her foreign relations inaccordance with the United Nations Charter and to assure her defence as provided by Article 51 of the Charter. Germany shall accept theobligations set forth in Article 2 of the Charter, in particular:  (a) to settle her international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, arenot endangered;(b) to refrain in her international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence ofany State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposesof the United Nations;(c) to give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takesin accordance with the Charter and to refrain from givingassistance to any State against which the United Nations may take preventive or enforcement action.For their part, the signatory Powers would be guided by theprinciples of Article 2 of the United Nations Charter in their relationswith Germany.4. In view of the provisional nature of the Potsdam clauses affecting frontiersthe question of frontiers shall be the subject, in the peace treaty, ofa settlement freely negotiated between the interested Powers, includingthe government of a unified Germany, in the spirit of points 1 and 2of the Atlantic Charter and Article 1 of the United Nations Charter;(!) United States reservation because Berlin is regarded as a special problem less suitably emphasised in the context of this paper.   United States therefore prefers omission of this paragraph.
5. [In the opinion of the three Governments, the peace treaty with Germanyconstitutes an essential element of an understanding between the interested Powers on the establishment of the conditions necessaryto consolidate peace in Europe. The entry into force of this treatywithin the framework of a general European settlement would permit the withdrawal of occupation troops and the removal of attendantburdens in Central and Eastern Europe within a determinate periodthereafter.](2)6. The return of all German prisoners of war and internees shall be carriedout within the shortest possible time and shall be completed without exception not later than 90 days after the coming into force of thepeace treaty.7. [International agreements in force between the Federal Republic orEastern Germany and any other State or States should remain in forceand be automatically extended to the whole of a unified Germany,unless specifically denounced by a constitutional all-German Govern-ment or unless the other parties refuse to agree to the extension of such agreements.](3)[It will be left to the all-German Government, subject to theprovisions of. the peace treaty, to take the necessary action to put ormaintain in force with respect to unified Germany international agree-ments concluded before its assumption of office. The consent of theother parties to these agreements will, however, be required, particu-larly in those cases where extension of an agreement to unified germany will necessitate adjustment of its terms.](4)8. The peace treaty should contain no provisions which might prevent thepeople of unified Germany from building and maintaining a prosperouseconomy, continuing the progress achieved in the Federal Republic.[There should be no further reparations. Claims against Germanyarising out of the war and occupation, to the extent that they have notbeen settled, should be reciprocally waived.](5).The treaty should ensure to Germany the unfettered freedom toregulate its own economy which is the normal prerogative of everysovereign State, subject to its international obligations. The treaty would provide for surrender and disposal, in accordance with appro-priate German legislation, of any industrial enterprises in Germanywhose ownership or control was acquired after May 8, 1945, by or onbehalf of any foreign Government, unless such acquisition hasquadripartite approval and the interest so approved is subject to german law.9. The Signatory Powers to the peace treaty should include all States, or thesuccessors thereof, which were at war with Germany.(2) United States believes it desirable to include this paragraph to counter reiterated Sovietproposals for troop withdrawal. United Kingdom and French prefer to omit it because they fear that a reference to troop withdrawal would have an unsettling effect on public opinion in Europe.(3) United States preference to avoid submission of existing agreements to renegotiation in peace treaty with Soviets.. (4) United Kingdom preference since they consider that certain existing German obligationsshould be compulsorily continued by the terms of the peace treaty. The French consider that both texts are equivalent from the judicial and practical point of view, and that the United States textwould probably be preferable as a clause of a peace treaty, but could give the impression that theWestern Powers have evolved a complicated legal formula aimed at binding the all-German Govern-ment in advance.   The French prefer the second text in a declaration which is to be published.(5) French reservation both on the question of substance and on the appropriateness of anymention of these two problems in the declaration. The French consider in particular that a formalrenunciation of the right to reparations would have a most unfortunate effect on French publicopinion. United Kingdom reservation on second sentence only. Her Majesty&apos;s Government arenot prepared to renounce their claims against Germany in advance of negotiations for a peace treaty.United States prefer inclusion of both sentences in order to counter Soviet proposals on the cessation of reparations and because the United States consider it desirable to complete the settlement of theclaims question by reciprocal waiver.
(ii) Report on the Organisation of Free Elections in the Whole ofGermanyI.-Preparation and Promulgation of the Electoral law. The Soviet proposal to entrust to the two German Governments the task of preparing an electoral law should be rejected, principally for the following reasons: (a) The East German representatives would inevitably attempt to extend thecontact made at the technical level with the delegates of the federal republic by raising countless political problems.(b) Entrusting the preparation of the electoral law to the Germans themselves would weaken our argument about the need for international super-vision of the elections.(c) Dr. Adenauer has expressed opposition to any meeting of representativesof the two Germanies even if restricted to the preparation of anelectoral law. He would only accept such contacts after promulgationof the law, within the framework of its implementation and between representatives of the various political parties rather than of theGovernments.2. Thus the Four Powers must themselves both prepare and promulgate the electoral law in close consultation, as far as the three Western Powers are concerned,with the Federal Government.3. However, a situation could arise in the course of the Four-Power confer-ence where Soviet refusal to take part in the preparation of the electoral law couldrisk stopping the work of the conference. In this event the breakdown of themeeting of the Four Powers should not appear to public opinion as being due to a refusal on the part of the Western Powers to entrust the task of preparing the electoral law to the Germans themselves. It would then be appropriate to consult the Federal Government with the object of avoiding such a misunderstanding.II. Guarantees for Free Elections1. Since the events of June 17 there can be no doubt about either theopposition of the bulk of the inhabitants of the Eastern Zone to the Communistregime, or about their willingness to display such opposition despite the risks involved. Moreover, the results of the September 6 elections in the federal republic indicate in any case that a large pro-Western majority would emerge from elections held throughout Germany.2. It is therefore unnecessary to plan a complete and detailed system of guarantees, the formulation of which at a Four-Power conference would lead to considerable difficulties to no purpose. Moreover, excessive demands on our partin this field would diminish, in the eyes of the public, the effect of a Soviet rejection of our request for free elections.3. In particular, it does not seem essential to insist that democratic freedomsbe guaranteed for a long period before polling day.4. What is of prime importance is to ensure secrecy of the vote, security ofthe ballot boxes and accurate counting of the votes. However, the fundamentalguarantee for free elections lies in the existence of a supervisory organisation.III. Supervision of the Elections1. Supervision should be carried out by commissions of observers covering the whole German territory and radiating out from a central body to the variousregional and local levels. :    &apos;2. The composition, functions and powers of these bodies are less important than is their presence itself which would give the population of the Eastern Zonethe impression of an irrevocable change in the political situation.3. The task of the supervisory organisation would be to supervise, observe,and to report and not to intervene directly in 1 ocal administration.4. The best solution would be for the commissions to be composed of&quot;neutrals&quot; with the participation, at the highest level, of representatives of theFour Powers.
5. The selection of the neutrals will probably cause difficulty in the Four-Power conference. The Soviets have already taken a stand against a purelyquadripartite system of supervision. We for our part cannot agree to entrust theresponsibility for supervision solely to the representatives of the Bonn and PankowGovernments.6. The United States delegation believes that a compromise solution mightbe envisaged, if put forward by the Federal Government. This would be to havecommissions composed of Germans under the direct supervision, at least on thehighest levels, of representatives of the Four Powers. The French delegation forits part, wonders if such a composition might not destroy, for the Eastern Zonepopulation, the psychological effect expected from the creation of a supervisoryorganisation an effect which, in its opinion, only the participation of neutralelements could cause.IV.-Consultation with Federal Government1. The principles set forth under the three preceding headings derive fromthe conclusions of the report dated September 21 of the Allied High Commissionand from the first indications the latter had received concerning the views of theGerman authorities. As soon as the Federal Government has made known its final opinion on all these points, it is recommended that the High Commissionprepare a new abbreviated version of its report as an appendix to this paper. Thisreport should take into account the German views, and should contain in particularrecommendations concernina the electoral law.(iii) Report on Status of an All-German GovernmentThe French, United States and United Kingdom representatives agree that theirpolicy in regard to the status of an all-German Government must be determinedby the following principles:  (a) The unification of Germany must not be obtained under conditions whichwould preclude the integration of Germany into the european community.(b) We must not create an all-German Government in conditions which would allow the Soviet Government to play cat and mouse with it, and, bywithholding a Peace Treaty, keep it at their mercy indefinitely, i.e., an&quot; Austrian situation.&quot;(c) While safeguarding these essential interests, we should do everything possible to make it clear that the responsibility for maintaining the par-tition of Germany lies with the Soviet Union and not with the western allies.2. Against this background there are two hypotheses to be considered. If theall-German elections take place after the E.D.C. enters into force, it is important toavoid any break in the continuity of Germany&apos;s international obligations. If theelections take place before the E.D.C. enters into force, it is important that thesolution adopted should be such as to facilitate its entry into force so far as germany is concerned.3. As regards procedure, it is agreed that the first step should be the holding of free all-German elections which would establish an all-German national assembly. It is further agreed that this Assembly should in any event have thetask of drawing up a Constitution, and that there would necessarily be a certaininterval before the formation of an all-German Government could ensue. It is also agreed that, during that interval, the existing Governments of the Federal republic and the East Zone would have to remain in being.Alternative Approaches4. On the other questions concerning the status of the all-German Govern-ment, there are two alternative approaches, based on different opinions as to thebest means of attaining the above-mentioned objectives.
I. -Continued Existence of Federal and East Zone Governments5. The United Kingdom and United States representatives favour an approach under which the Federal and East Zone Governments would continue their functions during the negotiation of the Peace Treaty, and would co-exist withthe authority or Government resulting from free elections and charged with theresponsibility of participating in treaty negotiations. Such negotiations would begin immediately after the all-German elections.6. The United Kingdom representatives considered that, following the enact-ment of the Constitution by the Assembly, which might be possible long beforecompletion of the peace negotiations, an all-German Government should at once be established in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The new government would take over the negotiations for the conclusion of a Peace Treaty(if not yet finished) and would assume power, progressively, in conformity with theConstitution, beginning with internal administrative responsibilities, but leavingwith the Federal and East Zone Governments the responsibility for foreign policy,defence and the enforcement of public order until the Peace Treaty came into effect.Not until such time would the all-German Government exercise full governmentalfunctions throughout Germany, and the Federal and East Zone Governments cease to exist.7. The United States representatives considered that it would be preferable for the formation of an all-German Government to take place only when both thedraft Peace Treaty and the Constitution had been agreed, at which time full powers would be taken over at one time.8. In favour of the continued existence of the Federal and East Zone Govern-ments the following arguments are adduced:  (a) It is the most cautious approach to the problem of German unification.The Federal Republic and the Allied Powers have with great painscreated an active, prosperous, and democratic State in Western Ger-many, closely allied with the West in its efforts to achieve more effectiveWestern European integration. The continuation in being of theFederal Government ensures the element of stability in this situation andthe continuity of German participation in such organisations as theEuropean Coal and Steel Community and the European Defence Com-munity. If the Federal Government disappeared, a gap would ensueduring which there would be no legal basis for German association withthe E.D.C. and the other organisations concerned. With the Sovietsstill occupying the Eastern Zone and no Peace Treaty in sight, there might well be a doubt whether an all-German Government could or would immediately assume obligations in this respect. The UnitedKingdom and United States representatives therefore considered thatthe Federal Government should be preserved in existence until progress had been made in establishing an all-German Government and until theAllies could foresee what kind of peace settlement might be had. TheAmerican view was that it would be even safer to retain the federal government until the draft Treaty was agreed upon by all Four Powersand the Constituent Assembly.(b) The solution of a limited central all-German body, with the temporaryretention of the Federal and East Zone Governments, offers the strongestnegotiating position from which to press the Soviets on the issue of free elections.(c) On either hypothesis, agreement would have to be reached with the Sovietson free elections, freedom to draft a Constitution, and freedom to par-anticipate in the Treaty negotiations. On the alternative hypothesis of a central Government with broad powers, however, agreement with theRussians would also be needed on all the powers to be exercised by thatGovernment.(d) Either hypothesis would raise the question of the &quot; reserved powers &quot;(including the power to ensure the security of their forces) to be exercised by the four Governments until a Peace Treaty came into force. On thepresent hypothesis any provision for this would involve no addition of substance to the powers at present exercised by the three Western Allies
in Western Germany and by the Soviet Government in the East Zone.On the alternative hypothesis, however, a wider area of agreement would be needed with the Russians on a new basis.(e) Any final decision on the question must clearly take full account of theviews of the Federal Government. Although he has not been con-resulted on behalf of the Three Powers, Dr. Adenauer is known to haveexpressed a tentative preference for a solution of this type. From hispoint of view there would be advantage in having both the all-Germanand the Federal Government in existence and under his control, as inpractice he would probably do on the basis of all-German elections heldin present conditions.II. Disappearance of Federal and East Zone Governments on Establishmentof an All-German Government9. The second alternative, which was initially favoured by the French Delega-tion, envisaged that, on the promulgation of the Constitution, an all-GermanGovernment should be established with full governmental powers, includingauthority to lay down the procedure by which power would be transferred from theFederal and East Zone Governments. The negotiation of a Peace Treaty wouldnot be begun until after the establishment of such a Government.10. In favour of this solution the following arguments are adduced as regardssubstance:  (a) It is essential to reach agreement on the reunification of Germany.  Thisreunification must be real and not merely apparent, otherwise it would work out to the advantage of the Soviet Union, which would maintainfull control over its Zone and would in fact acquire the right to intervene throughout the whole of Germany.(b) In the past, the three Governments have frequently emphasised the need to set up an all-German Government, based on free elections, beforediscussing the Peace Treaty. It seems difficult to modify this basicprinciple of our policy.(c) From the point of view of German opinion, all-German elections must befollowed, at an early date, by the disappearance of the East ZoneGovernment. The result of the elections in the East Zone would depend to a large extent on the certainty with which the voters could count onthis happening.(d) The difficult problem of maintaining the policy of European integration inthe transitional stage of German unification seems more easily solubleunder a strong central Government, looking towards the West, than under a system which would give the central authority only limited powers.(e) In view of the elections in the Federal Republic and recent events in theEast Zone and in Berlin, it is reasonable to suppose that the all-GermanGovernment would be very similar in complexion to the Bonn Govern-ment. Ex hypothesi this Government can only be established if ourconditions are fulfilled, that is to say if agreement is reached in allowingit complete freedom of choice. There is no reason to suppose that itwill disown the engagements entered into by the Federal Republicunder the Bonn Conventions in regard to the policy of integration(Article 7, paragraph 3 of the Convention on Relations). If, while theConstitution was being worked out, we felt uncertain on this point,we should have ample means, in both the political and juridical fields,for obtaining appropriate assurances from the future rulers of Germany.(/) A solution on the above lines avoids postponing the application of Article7 (3) of the Convention on Relations, and has the advantage of avoiding the difficulty that a West German Government would in fact be para-lysed, psychologically and politically, by the existence of all-Germaninstitutions. It also avoids the difficulty which, on the alternativesolution, would arise from the denial of all responsibility for foreignaffairs to the authority entrusted with the negotiation of the peace treaty. The more the powers of this authority were reduced, the moreexposed it would be to Soviet pressure. It might in fact be tempted to
accept a clause in the Treaty providing for the neutralisation ofGermany, a development which would have unpredictable effects onthe policy of the West German Government.11.   As regards tactics at Lugano,(a) We can never pin the blame on the Russians for refusing unification if we ourselves propose a solution based on maintaining the division ofGermany.(b) A breakdown of the negotiation arising simply from our insistence that free elections must come before the formation of an all-German Governmentwould, from a propaganda point of view, be disadvantageous to theWestern Powers.(c) The Soviet Government will themselves propose limiting the powers ofthe all-German Government. There is, therefore, in any case no advantage in our taking the initiative in a similar sense.(d) It is to our advantage that discussion with the Russians should centre, noton the status of an all-German Government but on the principle that itshould be set up as the result of free elections. While their wish tomaintain their control over the Eastern Zone constitutes the weak pointin the Soviet Governments case, the Western Powers risk exposingthemselves to criticism if they reveal too openly their anxiety to subordinate German unification to the execution of their plans for european integration.(e) It seems preferable to maintain our previous position without amplifyingit further. The powers of an all-German Government need not be studied in detail until after agreement had been reached on the principlethat such a Government should be set up as a result of free elections.Conclusion12. Whichever of the above two solutions is adopted, there may be a long period between the holding of all-German elections and the signature of a peace treaty. Indeed under neither arrangement would the Russians necessarily sign a peace Treaty at all. The maintenance of German membership of the E.D.C. andother such organisations throughout the period of waiting cannot be absolutelyensured under either alternative. The views of the Germans themselves are essentialbefore any further decision can be taken.Recommendation13. It is recommended that the Allied High Commission should be invited toask the Federal Government for a firm statement of their views on the questions involved (including the enforcement of public order after the all-German elections)as soon as they are in a position to give them, and that, in the light of those views,the matter should then be considered further by the three Governments.(iv) The German Peace treaty in the general paper on tactics for the Lugano Conference (Document No. 1)it is recommended that the three Powers should insist that consideration of thequestion of free elections and the formation of an all-German government must be completed before we agree to discussion of the principles of a peace treaty.It is intended to concentrate on those subjects, on which our case is strongest, sothat any resultant deadlock may clearly be seen to be principally due to Sovietrefusal to discharge their responsibilities with regard to German unification.2. Nevertheless, in drafting their Notes of September 2 and October .18,the three Powers took account of the fact that there may have to be a discussionof the question of a German peace treaty, at least in general terms.3. Any discussion on a peace treaty, however, presents two main disadvan-tages. First, it might enable the Russians indefinitely to divert the conferenceaway from its consideration of the questions mentioned above. Secondly, it would tend to draw us into a debate on the delicate topics of the Oder-Neisse frontier and the problem of neutralisation, which we wish to avoid. If a deadlock resulted
from such discussion of those questions, it might be difficult for the three Powersto lay responsibility squarely on the Russians; and might prejudice the subsequentprosecution of our European policy.4. During the general discussion which we intend should take place at thebeginning of the conference, Ministers will probably wish to set out the main principles of their own policy toward Germany, drawing on the Declaration of intent, and to underline the inadequacies of the Soviet proposal put forward onMarch 10, 1952, and reiterated on August 15, 1953, and its danger with respectto security. On the other hand, during the actual discussion of any agenda itemregarding the Peace Treaty, we could only accept a preliminary discussion on a programme of work (setting out, for example, the principal questions which mustbe settled in the Treaty) as well as the procedure for negotiating the Trcaly.(&apos;)5. At the appropriate moment it should be stated that the frontier problem is one of those which has to be settled (in view of the provisional character of the potsdam clauses). The principle by which the three Powers are guided is that theeastern frontier of Germany should be established in conditions which take accountof all the interests involved and would ensure a maximum degree of stability inthat part of Europe. We would, however, refuse to enter into any discussion ofthe frontier problem at this stage. We would base ourselves on the impossibility of taking a position on this subject before having heard the legitimate representa-tives of the whole of Germany.6. As regards neutralisation, there are two possible solutions: to adopt thesame position as that regarding the frontier problem or, on the contrary, to declareat the outset that any formula of this nature is unacceptable. The latter solutionhas the disadvantage of providing the Russians with a good pretext for breakingoff, but on the other hand enables us to state this fundamental principle of our policy.(&apos;) Since we do not wish to become involved in detailed discussion of the Peace Treaty, we shouldnot attempt to table at the Lugano Conference any paper suggesting possible Heads of a Peace Treaty.We should, however, clarify our own ideas on this subject in advance of the Conference. To thisend, the United Kingdom Delegation have submitted a paper on Heads of a Peace Treaty, a copyof which is at Annex I, as a basis for study in the other two capitals. A paper on procedural questions,a copy of which is at Annex II, has also been submitted. Section I, which recapitulates the previouswork done on this subject in the Council of Foreign Ministers, has the concurrence of all threedelegations. Sections II to IV, which suggest the attitude to be taken in future by the three Powers,have been put forward by the United Kingdom Delegation as a basis for study by the United Statesand France.
ANNEX 1HEADS OF A GERMAN PEACE TREATY(Paper submitted by United Kingdom Delegation)The following are suggested heads of a draft peace treaty between a unified Ger-many and her enemies in the late war, based upon the models of the Versailles Treaty,the recent treaties with Italy, the former Eastern European Satellites of Germany and japan, the draft Austrian State Treaty, and the Bonn Conventions; and taking account of the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements: I. Preamble This would refer to the creation of a unified Germany and the desire to re-establishpeaceful relations and to settle matters arising out of the war and the occupation. Itwould contain a list of the contracting powers.II. Political Clauses (a) International Status of Germany ?An affirmation of German sovereignty and independence.   ?A guarantee of&quot;German independence by the Powers.   ? A link with other security arrangements between the contracting parties Q).Abolition of the occupation, and a definition of German competence in regardto repeal &amp;c, of occupation legislation.German adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter, and intentionto apply for membership of the United Nations; an Allied promise of support for germany&apos;s application.O (Note. This section and section III (a) below will largely depend on any decision which may be reached between the Four Powers and Germany on mutualsecurity arrangements on which a separate report has been submitted (see Docu-ment No. II). For example, the Russians might wish to include here a passageregarding the evacuation of foreign troops and the neutralisation of Germany. TheWestern Allies will wish to provide for German obligations under the E.D.C. and inharmony with the security arrangements just referred to, on which they will try toreach agreement with the Russians. The Japanese Treaty (to which the U.S.S.R.was not a party) says &quot; The Allied Powers for their part recognise that Japan as a sovereign nation possesses the inherent right of individual or collective self-defencereferred to in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations and that Japan mayvoluntarily enter into collective security arrangements.&quot;).(b) Frontiers Definition of Germany&apos;s frontiers covering, in particular, the Eastern Frontierwith Poland and Czechoslovakia, the areas now incorporated in the Soviet Union(East Prussia), Schleswig-Holstein, the Saar, the frontier adjustments with the Nether-lands, Belgium and Luxembourg.German recognition of Austria&apos;s independence. (The inclusion of this in any german Peace Treaty is provided for in Articles 3-4 of the draft Austrian StateTreaty).German renunciation of all territorial claims, or, at least, an undertaking not topress any claims by other than peaceful means.(c) Human Rights Allusion (preferably in Preamble) to the ideals proclaimed in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and acceptance by the German Government of theobligations incurred by the Federal Republic under the European Convention on human Rights.id) Democratic Institutions and Suppression of Nazism Germany to maintain democracy and ensure the dissolution of all Nazi orFascist organisations.(e) War Criminals This should presumably contain provisions as follows: (i) An affirmation of the validity of the sentences already inflicted.(ii) A German undertaking to hold prisoners now in custody until expiry of sentence or until release is approved under agreed procedure. .(iii) (Possibly) A German undertaking to bring to justice any war criminals not sofar apprehended.There should also be a special provision regarding the major war criminals heldat Spandau.   In all cases, we should prefer custody to be a German responsibility.References to comparableclauses in other treatiesV = Versailles Treaty.I = Italian Treaty of1947.J = Japanese Treaty of1951.A = Draft AustrianState Treaty of1950.Bonn Conventions of1952G.C. = General Con-vention.S.C. = SettlementConvention.I., Preamble and Art. 73.G.C., Arts. 1-4.S.C., Chapter 1.J., Art. 5.A., Art. 33.V,.I-,J.,Arts. 27-30.Arts. 1-5.Arts. 2-4.J., Arts. 8 and 10.J., Preamble.A., Art. 8.I., Art. 15.J., Art. 11.I., Art. 45.A., Art. 11.S.C., Chapter 1.,Arts. 6-7.

The Versailles Treaty also contained (Articles 321-373) Clauses relating to: (i) General freedom of transit traffic through Germany.(ii) Freedom of navigation and equal treatment for Allied ships in German ports.(iii) Declaration of parts of the Elbe, Oder, Niemen and Danube as internationalrivers.(iv) The Rhine and the Moselle.(V) International rail traffic,(vi) German free ports.On (i), the Treaty should re-affirm the adherence of Germany to the BarcelonaConvention of 1921 on this subject.(3) The problems raised in connection with this section have been discussed inthe report of the Working Group on economic questions, which was approved byHeads of Delegations at a meeting on October 31. The method of presentation inthis section is based on the United Kingdom position as stated in that report.
VI.-Claims (*)-(a) Reparations  vAcceptance by Germany of the measures of confiscation already taken by the   S.C., Chapter 6, Art. 3.Allies (the Settlement Convention, Chapter 6, Article 3, says &quot; The Federal Republic   I., Art. 79.shall in the future raise no objections against the measures which have been or will be   I., Arts. 14, 16.carried out with regard to German external assets or other property seized for the   A., Arts. 34, 35.purpose of reparation or restitution The question of German assets in   V., Part VIIIAustria is to be settled in the Austrian State Treaty.) (Arts. 231-247)vAllied agreement that no further reparations would be taken.(The Russian Note to the Three Powers of August 15, 1953, proposed that &quot; with effect from January 1, 1954, Germany is completely freed from the payment of reparations.&quot;    Russia is, in fact, the only Power to which this clause would nowapply, for practical purposes.)[(b) External Occupation Costs (if necessary) ? A renunciation by the Allied Powers.](c) Compensation  I., Art. 78.I., Art. 14.There are three types: (1) Pre-war claims.   (2) Loss of, or damage to, property,   S.C., Chapter 4, Chap-rights and interests, as a result of the war.  (3) Ill-treatment, personal injury and loss.      ter 10, Arts. 3 and 6.(4) Victims of Nazi Persecution.   The Treaty with Japan contains provisions   J., Arts. 15 and 18.regarding (1) and (2), and those with the Satellites and Italy contain provisions for (2)but not for (3).   The Russian attitude made it impossible to obtain the inclusion of(3) in the Italian and Satellite treaties.   The question of a settlement of types (2) and       *(3) is left open by the Settlement Convention.   Chapter 4 of the Convention dealswith type (4), but certain improvements may be desirable.(d) Restitution (Internal) The Settlement Convention provides for (i) German implementation of Allied legislation for the restitution of property.   S.C., Chapters 3, 4.(Chapter 3.)(ii) The setting-up of a Supreme Restitution Court.   (Chapter 3.)(iii) Compensation for victims of Nazi persecution.   (Chapter 4.)Something on these lines will have to be included.(4) The questions dealt with in this section have been considered by the working group on Economic Questions and the divergent views of the three delegations onthe subject are set out in the Group&apos;s report mentioned in the footnote to Section IVabove. The line proposed in this paper is in harmony with the United Kingdomviews expressed in the Working Group.On (ii), this should be secured by the provisions in IV (a) above. In addition, theGerman Government should re-affirm the adherence of the Federal Republic to theInternational Convention on the Regime of Maritime Ports (1923).On (iii) (a) the Elbe, the Treaty should re-affirm the freedom of navigation on theElbe as an international waterway. Beyond this it is difficult to go at present. Itseems doubtful whether the Elbe Commission, on which Czechoslovakia was formerlyrepresented, could now be restored, (b) The Oder and the Niemen. Notwith-standing the provisions of the Versailles Treaty, no international regime was estab-lished for these rivers. It is difficult to forecast discussion on this point under present circumstances,   (c) The Danube.   The situation is complicated because(i) the Third Reich withdrew from the 1921 (Fluvial) Danube Commission and(ii) in 1948 the Soviet bloc set up a separate Danube Commission, which the western powers do not recognise. It would be desirable, if feasible at the time of negotiation,for the Peace Treaty to regulate this problem as well as that of the European Com-mission of the (Maritime) Danube, which was liquidated in 1940 by the German,Italian and Roumanian Governments.On (iv), the German Government should continue the membership of the federal republic on the provisional Rhine Commission and should be bound to join thePermanent Commission, when the latter is re-established.On (v), the German Government should be required to become a party to theBerne Conventions (last revised in 1952) on International Rail Traffic.(d) Deconcentration and Decartelisation An undertaking (such as is contained in the Settlement Convention, Chapter 2)   S.C., Chapter 2.to maintain the spirit of Allied legislation.V. Treaties Provision for the re-application to Germany of certain bilateral and multilateral   V., Arts. 282-295.instruments to which the former German Reich was a party; for the adherence by   I., Art. 44.Germany to certain multilateral instruments; and for Germany to apply for member-   A., Art. 14.ship of certain international organisations and Communities established since thewar.

Similar provisions should figure in the Treaty.(/) Foreign Interests in Germany The Settlement Convention (Chapter 10) provides for: (i) Equitable treatment for United Nations nationals (in so far as this is notsecured by the provisions on Restitution, &amp;c).(ii) The maintenance of certain Allied Legislation.(iii) The creation of a special agency for foreign interests.The Treaty should contain provisions on the above lines.(g) Debts The Treaty should contain a re-affirmation by the German Government of V., Art. 296.German obligations under the Agreement on German External Debts of February 27,   S.C., Chapter 8.1953, between the Federal Republic of Germany and a number of creditor countries  I., Art. 81.including the Western Allies, and an undertaking to review the Agreement inaccordance with the terms of Article 25 thereof (dealing with appropriate action onthe re-unification of Germany).The Treaty should also impose on the German Government the obligations  J., Art. 18.assumed by the Federal Republic in respect of post-war debts to the three Western  A., Arts. 48, 48 bis-.Powers, under bilateral agreements with those Powers concluded at the same time as the Agreement on German External Debts.(The Russian Note of August 15, 1953, proposed the abandonment of all post-warState debts.&quot;) .(h) German Renunciation of Claims - S.C., Chapter 9.A renunciation by Germany of all claims against the Allied Powers or their  I., Art. 76.nationals.   Provisions to this effect are contained in the Italian, Japanese and  J., Art. 19.Austrian Treaties.   A similar provision is contained in the Settlement Convention,   A., Arts. 38, 39.Chapter 9, but is made &quot; without prejudice to the terms of a peace settlement withGermany.&quot;(/&apos;) General A number of other technical matters within the economic field may have to be covered (possibly in Annexes to the Peace Treaty ), e.g., German-owned patents.
oANNEX IIPROCEDURE FOR NEGOTIATING A GERMAN PEACE treat. Previous Work in the Council of Foreign Ministers (C.F.M.)1. The Deputies&apos; ReportThe Foreign Ministers&apos; Deputies submitted a report on procedure to theC.F.M. at Moscow on April 12, 1947. This was amended in November 1947, andthe amended report was submitted to the 5th plenary session of the C.F.M. inLondon, November 25-December 15, 1947. It was referred again to the Deputiesand no progress was made.  The following is a summary:  A. Drafting of the Treaty(i) The Treaty to be prepared by the C.F.M., consisting for this purpose ofthe three Western Powers and the Soviet Union.(ii) The C.F.M. to establish four permanent committees:  (a) On the political and constitutional structure of Germany;(b) On the territorial adjustments and related problems;(c) On the economic organisation of Germany and reparations;(d) On disarmament and demilitarisation.(iii) The work of the permanent committees to be directed and co-ordinatedby the Deputies. The committees to submit reports and recommendations, includingdraft articles of the Treaty. Such reports to reflect divergencies of view and toinclude proposals made by the Allied States participating (see B (1) (c) below). Eachof the four permanent committees to appoint sub-committees, as necessary.B. Consultation with other Governments(1) Consultation with Allied States(a) The 18 Allied States are: Australia, Belgium, the Byelorussian soviet socialist Republic, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Greece,India, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Ukrainian soviet socialist Republic, Union of South Africa, Yugoslavia. (Note. The UnitedKingdom, United States of America and France wished Pakistan to be added tothe list; and France and the U.S.S.R. also supported the addition of Albania.)(b) C.F.M. to give representatives of Allied States full opportunity to present their views on the German problem, orally or in writing. In addition, such states to be invited to take part in the discussion of questions relating to the German peace Treaty in which they had a direct interest.(c) Agreement was not reached on the part to be played by the Allied states in the work of the permanent committees and sub-committees referred to in(A) (iii) above. The United States of America and United Kingdom were, ingeneral, willing that a convenient number of representatives from the Allied states should be permanent members of the committees, while France and the U.S.S.R.wished such representatives only to be invited by the Four Powers to take part inthe consideration by the committees of problems concerning them. There was similar disagreement on the composition of the sub-committees.(d) C.F.M. to establish an Information and Consultation Conference of AlliedStates, with the following duties :  (i) To keep Allied States informed on the peace-treaty work of the C.F.M.(ii) To communicate to the Allied States documents, reports and directivesarising from the work of the C.F.M. on the peace treaty.(iii) To organise consultation among the representatives of the Allied States.The Chairmanship of the conference to be held in turn by representatives ofthe Four Powers. They were to act in concert on instructions from the foreign ministers or their Deputies. The composition was undecided. The United Statesproposed that the conference should consist of the representatives of the four powers, of all States at war with Germany and of Allied States which wereneighbours of Germany. The U.S.S.R. wished it to consist of representatives ofthe Four Powers and of the Allied States which were neighbours of Germany or whose armed forces fought against Germany. The United Kingdom and Franceproposed that the conference should consist of representatives of the Four Powers
and a very small number of Allied States (which should include Iran). other allies and ex-enemy States which later took part in the war on the Allied sideshould be kept informed, and should be allowed to transmit in writing to theconference their observations on the documents submitted to them.(2) Consultation with Other states the Governments of other Allied belligerent States and of ex-enemy states who subsequently fought against Germany to be afforded, at an appropriate stage in the preparation of the peace treaty, the opportunity to state their views on theGerman problem, orally or in writing, to the Deputies or the C.F.M.In addition as mentioned in (1) (d) above, various proposals were put forward for the association of these States with the work of the Information and Consulta-tion Conference of Allied States.C. The Peace Conference(i) Convening of the ConferenceWhen a basic draft of the peace treaty had been completed, the C.F.M. wasto convene a peace conference to discuss the treaty. Britain, France and theUnited States of America wished to include China in the C.F.M. for the purposeof convening this conference. All Three Powers at the time assured the ChineseGovernment (then the Nationalist Government) in writing that this was the viewthey would continue to maintain. The Soviet Government declined to accept thisview and so informed the Three Powers and the Chinese Government.(ii) Composition of the conference it was agreed that the United States of America, the United Kingdom,the U.S.S.R., France and China should all be represented at the peace conference.In addition, the United Kingdom proposed, with United States support, thatthe 18 Allied States listed at paragraph B (1) (a) above and Pakistan should alsobe members of the conference, and the U.S.S.R. proposed that Albania (butnot Pakistan) should be included in this list. The United Kingdom and UnitedStates also wished the conference to be able to invite, by a majority vote, repre-sentatives of other Allied belligerent States and of ex-enemy States which had subsequently fought against Germany, to be associated in the proceedings, topresent their views and to take part in the work of any commissions which theconference might establish. On the question of German participation in theconference, the United Kingdom, United States of America and U.S.S.R.proposed that German representatives be allowed to state their views at theconference. The French, however, thought that the conference should decide onthis in the light of circumstances at the time.(iii) Final Text of the TreatyAfter the peace conference was ended, the C.F.M. was to draw up the final text of the peace treaty in consultation with the Allied States and taking intoconsideration the recommendations of the conference.D. Signature and Entry into Force of the Peace Treaty(i) The final text of the peace treaty to be signed by the representatives of theStates represented at the conference. The United Kingdom, United States ofAmerica and U.S.S.R. agreed that the peace Treaty should be signed by an adequateGerman Government but France reserved her position. The United Kingdom,U.S.S.R. and France proposed that the text of the Treaty should be presented tothe other United Nations who were in a state of war with Germany. The UnitedStates of America reserved their position.(ii) The peace treaty to enter into force immediately after its ratification bythe three Western Allies and the U.S.S.R. The treaty would come into force forother signatories on the date of their ratification. The peace treaty would alsobe ratified by Germany.2. 6th Plenary Conference of the C.F.M., Paris, May 23 to June 20, 1949No progress on the procedure for preparing a Peace Treaty was made at thismeeting. There has been no further discussion of the matter since, and no furthermeetings of the C.F.M.
II. Line to be taken by the Three Governments in any Future DiscussionA. GeneralThe question of German participation in the preparation of a Peace Treatyhas only arisen incidentally in previous discusssions in the C.F.M. The western allies have declared that a Peace Treaty must be negotiated with a free all-GermanGovernment, resulting from a freely-elected Assembly. In any future discussion on procedure for negotiating a Peace Treaty, therefore, the Allies will have to state at the outset that the all-German Government must be a party to such negotiations.B. Drafting of the Treaty(i) The draft Treaty should be prepared by representatives of the three western Powers, the Soviet Union and the German Government. (Hereafterreferred to as the Drafting Group.) The Soviet Union may wish for this purpose to revive the C.F.M., on the lines of I A (i) above. From the point of view of drafting the Treaty there might be advantage in this, since it would definitelyexclude China. The Potsdam Protocol, which established the C.F.M., said that, forthe preparation of peace settlements the Council &quot; will be composed of the membersrepresenting those States which were signatory to the terms of surrender imposedupon the enemy State concerned &quot; (in the case of Germany, this excludes China).On the other hand, it might resurrect the Chinese difficulty in connection with the convening of a peace conference (See I C (i) above and D (i) below). On balance,therefore, it seems better to resist the formal revival of the C.F.M. which is in anycase a body of unhappy memory, associated with policies now outdated.(ii) The Drafting Group to establish such committees or sub-committees as it considers necessary. The suggested four committees described in I 1 A (ii) above are not now all required; but committees, e.g., on frontiers and economic questionsmight be desirable.(iii) The work of these committees could be directed and co-ordinated by the deputies to the Drafting Group and their reports submitted as in I 1 A (iii) above.C- Consultation with the Governments of Allied States and of other States(i) Consultation with Allied states in general, this could be on the lines of I 1 B (i) (a) and (b) above. TheGovernment of Ceylon should be added to the list of Allied States. As regardsthe part to be played by the Allied States in the work of any committees set upby the Drafting Group, there seems no reason at this stage to change the UnitedKingdom view set out in the report of the Deputies to the C.F.M. (see I 1 B (1) (c)above); but any reasonable solution would be acceptable.A difficult problem may again arise in connection with China, which is one ofthe &quot; Allied States.&quot; The Soviet Union will presumably insist that the CommunistChinese Government should be consulted. At present it is difficult to see a solution.The attitude of the three Governments may have to depend on the progress madeat the Korean Political Conference and on developments in the United nations general Assembly on China. If the Russians raise the question at Lugano, weshould concentrate on obtaining agreement on the composition of the DraftingGroup set out in II B (i) above and should suggest that consultation with other states can be discussed when a freely-appointed German Government is ready tonegotiate a Peace Treaty. (The same applies to the possibility of Ceylon andAlbania being treated as &quot; Allied States &quot;).It may prove necessary to establish something on the lines of the &quot; information and Consultation Conference of Allied States &quot; referred to in I 1 B (1) (d) above.If so, there seems no reason to insist on the previous United Kingdom view on the composition of this body. The smaller the Group, the more efficient it will be;but an acceptable compromise can no doubt be reached.(ii) Consultation with Other StatesThere is nothing to add to the line taken in the Deputies&apos; report (seeI 1 B (2) above).
D.  The Peace Conference(i) Convening and Composition of the conference the Conference should be convened by the Governments represented on the drafting Group. Again, this will raise the Chinese problem. The three western powers are committed (see I C (i)) to the view that the Chinese Government should form part of the C.F.M. for the purpose of convening the Conference. The SovietGovernment are equally committed to the opposite view. Now, the SovietGovernment may support the inclusion of Communist China in the list of con-vening Powers, and it is at least arguable that Her Majesty&apos;s Government couldbe held bound, by its undertaking to the Nationalist Government (when the latter was recognised by Her Majesty&apos;s Government as the de jure Government of China),to support the Soviet position; which the United States and France will pre-sumably resist. Again, (as in II C (i) above) no solution can be suggested atpresent; thought it might not be too difficult to argue (a) that the C.F.M. no longerexisted or (b) that the circumstances under which Her Majesty&apos;s Government gavetheir undertaking to the Chinese Government have so radically changed as tomake it inevitable for them to revise their previous position. The problem ofChina also arises, of course, in connection with the composition of the conference.The report to the C.F.M. agreed unanimously that China should attend theConference. Obviously no agreed decision can now be reached. As regards other participating States, the United Kingdom might maintain the line, taken inthe Deputies&apos; report, that the eighteen Allied States plus Pakistan and Ceylonshould be members of the Peace Conference and that representatives of other states should be invited by a majority vote to be associated in the proceedings and topresent their views.When the Conference has finished, the Drafting Group should draw up thefinal text on the lines suggested in the Deputies&apos; report (see I 1 C (iii) above)&apos;.E. Signature and Entry into force of the Peace TreatySignature should be by the representatives of the States represented at thePeace Conference on the one side and the German Government on the other.Ratification as suggested in the Deputies&apos; report (see I, 1, D above).III. Additional Consultation with other Governments(a) The commonwealth in addition to the procedures indicated above for associating commonwealth governments (along with other Allied Governments) with the preparation of a peace Treaty, it will be necessary for the United Kingdom Government to maintainvery close liaison with the other Commonwealth Governments, keeping them intouch with the drafting at all stages. Commonwealth Governments have in thepast emphasised to the United Kingdom and other Governments, the importancethey attach to being given an adequate share in the preparation of a German peace Treaty, and in 1947 circulated memoranda to this effect to the Deputies ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers. In connection with the Peace Treaties with italy, Bulgaria, Roumania, Hungary and Finland they indicated their strong objections to a procedure which in effect presented them with a fait accompli.(b) With BeneluxThe Three Powers have special obligations to the Benelux Powers to consult them in regard to Germany. They will therefore have to devise some moreintimate form of consultation than that suggested above for the Allied States ingeneral.IV. Conclusions(i) The basic drafting of the Peace Treaty should be done by the three western Allies, the Soviet Union and Germany.(ii) The &quot; Allied States &quot; should be invited to present their views orally or inwriting, and to take part in discussion of questions on the Peace treaty in which they have a direct interest.
(iii) Other ex-Allies or former enemies who subsequently fought germany should be given an opportunity to express their views to the DraftingGroup.(iv) A &quot; Consultation Conference &quot; of Allied States may have to be established,in order to keep the latter informed on the drafting work.(v) A Peace Conference should be convened by the Governments represented on the Drafting Group to study the draft Peace Treaty. In additionto the Four Powers and Germany, the Allied States (including China)should be present; and other States invited if a majority of the PeaceConference so desires.(vi) After the Conference, the Drafting Group should prepare the final textfor signature by the States represented at the Conference. The treaty would enter into force on ratification by the Four Powers and Germany.(vii) Specially close consultation should be maintained with the Common-wealth and Benelux Governments.(viii) At Lugano, the three Powers should not go beyond agreement on (i) andgeneral acceptance of (ii) to (vi); full agreement on these pointsbeing reserved for later discussion when free elections have been heldin Germany and an all-German Government formed.V. Economic Questions connected with a German Peace treaty in transmitting the attached report to the Plenary MeetingO the working group drew attention to two problems which arose in the course of their discussion and which seemed to lie outside their competence.(a) The Working Group noted that the American draft of paragraph 7 of theDeclaration of Intent makes no provision for cases in which the termsof the existing treaties and agreements between the German federal republic, or D.D.R., on the one hand, and other countries on the other,may be inconsistent with the provisions of the peace treaty itself.(b) The United Kingdom members pointed out that the United States draftof paragraph 7 of the Declaration of Intent did not deal with thequestion of the succession of unified Germany to the treaty rights and obligations of pre-war Germany.2. The United Kingdom and French members considered that the UnitedKingdom-French version of paragraph 7 did not prejudice any decisions whichmight be made in respect of these two points.3. The Working Group recommended that these two points should be furtherstudied in the three capitals.introduction the Working Group were instructed to review economic questions in prepara-tion for the Lugano Conference and within the framework of the Conference theeconomic aspects of a German peace settlement. The Working Group have concluded that the problems involved can best be studied under three main headings:  I. The United States draft &quot; Declaration of Intent respecting Germany.&quot;(See Document No. IV (i).)II. Heads of a German Peace Treaty.  (See Document No. IV (iv).)III. The position to be taken at Lugano on the Soviet economic proposals.I. The United States Draft &quot; Declaration of Intent respecting Germany &quot;A. Paragraph 7The principle underlying this paragraph is that, instead of the German peace treaty containing specific provisions for the application between the All-GermanGovernment and. the other parties to the Treaty of such rights and obligations of the Federal Republic or the D.D.R. vis-a-vis such countries as the All-GermanGovernment is willing to assume, these rights and obligations should automaticallybe assumed by the All-German Government, unless it chooses to denounce them.The United States arguments in favour of this position are as follows:  2.   The Allies have had bitter past experience of negotiations with the soviet union over economic clauses in the Treaties of Peace with Italy and the Satellites.O Subsequently approved by Plenary Meeting.
and the draft State Treaty with Austria. The Russians have been persistentlyobstructive in all such negotiations, which were protracted, wearisome and oftendisadvantageous to the West. Given the great complexity of German economic problems, it seems likely that negotiations over such problems with the russians would be equally interminable. The Russians would make propaganda overindividual points, would endeavour to whittle down the Western proposals andto complicate the problems as far as possible. Indeed, their approach to some ofthe subjects involved (e.g., pre-war contracts) is so radically different from thatof the West as to make it difficult for them to understand our problems.3. On the other hand, many of these detailed subjects have already been dealt with in agreements between the Federal Government and other western powers. The United States therefore propose that a calculated risk should be takenin attempting to eliminate from the Peace Treaty all economic problems, except those few which can be settled only with the participation of the Soviet Union(see paragraph 7 below) and to leave in force all the existing agreements betweenthe Federal Republic or the D.D.R. and other countries, allowing the all-GermanGovernment freedom to denounce them within a specified period of time. TheUnited States consider that an all-German Government resulting from free electionswill wish to align themselves with the West and that therefore, in general, theywill maintain the existing agreements entered into by the Federal Government andwill denounce those entered into by the D.D.R.4. From the economic point of view, the United States has particularly inmind the following principal agreements:  (i) the Bonn Conventions;(ii) the London Debt Agreements of February 1953;(iii) the complex of agreements covering European economic co-operation;(iv) the European Coal and Steel Community;(v) the Agreements with the International Monetary Fund, the international bank and G.A.T.T.5. It would be necessary for the all-German Government to take positive action to denounce any of these Agreements. In the case of multilateral agree-ments, continued German participation would be subject to the agreement of theother parties. In the United States view, it is unlikely that an all-German Govern-ment resulting from free elections would wish to take that positive action to breakits ties with the West which would be entailed in the denunciation of these basicagreements. On the other hand, there is great risk in attempting, in negotiationswith the Russians for a German Peace Treaty, to obtain provisions in the peace treaty satisfactory, from the economic point of view, to the Western Allies.6. The United Kingdom and French members of the Working Group havebeen unable to accept the position of principle involved in the United states proposal.  They have advanced the following main objections:  (i) From the Allied point of view(a) While it is reasonable to believe that the sympathies of the all-GermanGovernment will be with the West rather than with the U.S.S.R., it seemsdangerous to enable that Government, by specific provision in a Peace Treaty,to denounce unilaterally agreements of great economic importance to theWestern Allies or, which is possibly more likely, to use the threat of such denunciation as a means of exerting pressure on the Western Allies to modify the terms of such agreements. Many of the Federal Republics obligationsaffect not only governmental but also private interests. Ministers would haveto explain to their Parliaments and public opinion that they had taken acalculated risk with such interests. This is a very difficult position to expectMinisters to accept.(b) The interests of many other Governments are involved (the UnitedKingdom have particularly in mind the Commonwealth Governments). TheFrench and United Kingdom Governments might find it difficult to commit themselves to such a position without prior consultation with &apos; otherGovernments.(ii) From the German point of view the American proposal entails the assumption, subject to denunciationby united Germany, of D.D.R. obligations to Russia and the satellites. These
could no doubt be denounced, but the wholesale denunciation of such agree-ments would be an unhappy beginning to relationships between unitedGermany and the Soviet Union. The Germans may well raise difficulties over this.(iii) From the Soviet point of view the Soviet Government are likely to recognise that a free all-GermanGovernment will probably be pro-Western and therefore will probably, if giventhe opportunity, denounce agreements reached between the D.D.R. and theSoviet Union and its satellites. While it is therefore true that difficulties canbe expected with the Russians in any negotiation of detailed economic clauses,it seems possible that equal difficulties may be encountered if such an obviousattempt is made to avoid negotiation with the Russians of such clauses.B. Paragraph 87. The United States proposal on this paragraph is connected with theproposal regarding Paragraph 7 of the Declaration of Intent. It is that germany should be restored to full economic sovereignty. The all-German Governmentshould be free to enter into agreements in the economic field without restriction.No economic obligations to the Soviet orbit should be undertaken in the peace settlement and all properties seized by the Soviets in the Eastern Zone should bereturned. The slate should be wiped clean of all claims against Germany arisingout of the war and the occupation to the extent that such claims have not been settled, and of all similar claims by Germany. Beyond the provisions necessaryto dispose of problems connected with the war, in which Soviet participation wouldbe required, the treaty would in general not deal with economic subjects.8. The United States proposals entail a statement by the Western Allies inthe Declaration of Intent regarding the following:  (a) Reparation9. The United States and United Kingdom propose that the Three powers should declare that there will be no further payment of reparation by Germany.They consider that no other course is feasible. They also base this proposition onthe provisions of the Bonn Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out ofthe War and the Occupation, Chapter 6, under which the Western Allies agreed totake no reparation out of current production. Furthermore, at the timeof signature of the Bonn Conventions, the United States and United kingdom governments declared that they did not intend to assert any claim for reparationout of current production and would oppose the exaction of such reparations byany other Power.   In their opinion no other source of reparation exists.10. The French members recalled that under the terms of the Bonn Con-ventions referred to in paragraph 9 above, Chapter 6, Article 1, it is provided thatthe question of reparations shall be settled in the Peace Treaty between Germanyand its former enemies. Moreover, this provision is in accord with those of the paris Agreement on Reparations. In accepting the provisions of this article ofthe Bonn Conventions regarding current production, the French government recognised a situation of fact; the consequence of this was not to prescribe theright to reparation. Neither French public opinion nor the French parliament would accept a renunciation of this position designed only as a reply to a soviet propaganda gesture. The French members in addition pointed out that otherGovernments are concerned in this question and should be consulted at theappropriate moment.(b) External Occupation Costs11. The New York Agreement of 1950 between the Three Foreign Ministersprovided that &quot; the regulation of expenditure on external occupation costs shouldbe deferred until a general peace settlement.&quot;12. The United States proposal entails the abandonment by the western powers of claims in respect of these costs as part of a general reciprocal waiver ofunsettled claims arising out of the war. The United States considers that it isunrealistic to expeet the recovery of these costs from the German Government,particularly now that the Soviet Government have proposed their abandonment(see Section III below).
13. The United Kingdom and French members agree that, if the Luganomeeting is successful and results in the negotiation of a peace treaty within a com-paratively short period with an all-German Government resulting from free elec-tions, it is unrealistic to expect that Government to agree to any provision in thetreaty for repayment to the Allies of external occupation costs. In view of the uncertainty of the present prospects of achieving such a settlement however, and thepossibility that, when a peace settlement is ultimately achieved, the situation mayhave changed, they consider that the Western Powers should not at this stage take any final decision on this question. They recognise that the United Kingdom andFrench claims could only be revived later in unforeseeable circumstances, but arenot prepared at this stage to state publicly their intention of abandoning the claims.(c) Other claims against Germany arising from the war. (These include, forexample, claims in respect of loss of or damage to property, rights or interestsresulting from the war.)14. The United States proposal entails the abandonment by the Allies of all such claims. So far as the Western Allies are concerned, the United States positionis based upon the Paris Agreement on Reparations of 1946, under which the signatory Powers (which include the principal Allied Powers, other than the soviet union and Poland, which took part in the war against Germany) agreed that theirrespective share of reparation under the Paris Agreement should be regarded ascovering &quot; all their claims and those of their nationals against the former GermanGovernment and their agents of a governmental or private nature arising out of thewar (which are not otherwise provided for).&quot; The United States maintain that this formula must include all claims in respect of war damage, &amp;c.15. Apart from the purely legal aspects of the question, the United Statesbelieves that it would be unwise and inappropriate to open up the subject of suchclaims so long after the war. To do so by distinguishing &quot; compensation &quot; from&quot;&apos; reparation &quot; might open the door for the Soviet bloc to put forward vast newclaims based upon losses sustained in the East. As experience with Austria and the satellites has demonstrated, the Soviets are adept at this strategy.16. The United Kingdom and French position is that there is a clear distinc-tion between &quot; compensation &quot; and &quot; reparation.&quot; The Paris Agreement, in their view, dealt solely with reparation. Moreover, specific provision was made in theBonn Settlement Convention that the Convention was not intended to cover claims of this nature and should &quot; not affect the right of any of the United Nations to advance during negotiation for a peace settlement any claim for compensation ofthis nature with respect to its own or its nationals&apos; property, rights or interests.&quot;17. In addition the French member has pointed out that the scope of theformula employed in the American draft of the Declaration of Intent is much wider than that of the Paris Agreement on Reparations. In particular the Americanformula entails the abandonment of a certain number of claims, resulting more orless directly from the war, which, because they are claims against private persons,are not covered by the Paris Agreement on Reparations. The United Statesmember reserved his position with respect to the application of the United Statesdraft to such claims.18. The United Kingdom and French view therefore is that the peace treaty should provide for a settlement of such claims. While recognising that there is some validity in the United States view expressed in paragraph 15 above, theyconsider that it would be totally unacceptable to public and parliamentary opinion in the two countries if the Three Powers now publicly stated their intention of abandoning all such claims.19. The Working Group has not thought it necessary to develop in greater detail the divergent views on this point, since the positions of the United states on the one hand and the United Kingdom and France on the other are well knownto all concerned and have been advanced on numerous occasions in the past.20. It will be seen from the foregoing statement of the differences betweenthe Three Powers on these three important subjects that the first bracketed sentence of paragraph 8 of the draft Declaration of Intent is unacceptable to the Frenchmember and that the second bracketed sentence of that paragraph is unacceptable to the French and United Kingdom members.   The Working Group are agreed
that, if any Declaration of Intent is to be made, it would be desirable for it to contain a paragraph covering the principal economic problems involved. Withoutany reference to the three major problems mentioned above, the paragraph wouldbe lifeless and would have little effect upon German opinion. While all three members are agreed that the peace treaty must provide for a waiver of Germanclaims, whether or not it contains a reciprocal waiver, to insert a statement tothis effect would not be helpful at this stage. In the absence of agreement on thethree major problems, the Working Group has found it impossible to agree ona text satisfactory to all three delegations.II. Heads of a Peace TreatyTripartite agreement on detailed heads of a peace treaty depends on whateveragreed position may be reached on the point of principle discussed in Section Iabove, in connection with paragraph 7 of the United States draft Declaration of intent. The Working Group have not attempted to establish a complete list ofeconomic questions which would have to be resolved, in one way or another, withinthe framework of a definitive settlement with a unified Germany. To compile an exhaustive list of this nature requires more detailed investigation. The grouprecommends that a study on this subject should be further pursued in the three countries. At present it seems sufficient to indicate the main problems which wouldhave to be studied in connection with a settlement. An indication of the natureof these problems which can be used as a basis for further study in the threeCapitals is provided by a United Kingdom paper on draft Heads of a Peace Treaty.This paper is at Annex I to the report on a German Peace Treaty (DocumentNo. IV (iv)).2.   In general the problems can be divided into the following categories:  (a) those which are dealt with in the Bonn Conventions (the Settlement Con-vention) and in the other Agreements concluded with the federal republic.It should be noted that in the case of certain of these problems a definitivesettlement is expressly reserved, under these conventions and agreements, for thepeace treaty.(b) those which, have not been dealt with in the Conventions and Agreementsconcluded with the Federal Republic.Among the latter should be mentioned in particular questions which are dealtwith under treaties prior to the 1939-45 war.3. It will be seen from the analysis, contained in Section I above, of the differences between the United States on the one hand and the United Kingdomand French on the other hand regarding the point of principle underlying para-graph 7 of the United States draft Declaration of Intent that there are two possible methods of approach to the preparation of a peace treaty:  (a) The American Conception. The peace treaty would contain only a certainnumber of economic clauses, in particular on reparations, claims resulting from thewar and the occupation, victims of Nazi persecution, and perhaps, certain of thequestions which form the subject of provisions of treaties or agreements prior tothe 1939-45 war.(b) The French and United Kingdom Conception. In order to ensure a bind-ing commitment by Germany in respect of her obligations in the economic fieldtowards other Powers, it would be necessary to include in the peace treaty clausesrelating to all those economic questions which would normally be dealt with in a peace treaty, including in particular the subjects covered by the Bonn Conventions(for example, foreign interests, war damage, restitution, civil aviation). TheLondon Debt Agreements should also be covered in an appropriate way.4. In the view of the United States Delegation, if the United Kingdom-French approach to paragraph 7 of the Declaration of Intent were adopted, itwould still be desirable to seek ways of settling the economic questions which arenot of interest to the Soviets with the Government of unified Germany withoutSoviet participation. The United States Delegation considers that even under thishypothesis every effort should be made to restrict the economic clauses of the treaty to the barest possible minimum and to seek assurances with respect to economic relations with an all-German Government as far as possible in other ways.
5. The three Delegations agree in principle that it would, in any case, be preferable to negotiate a peace treaty containing the minimum of general clausesnecessary to settle problems such as those set out in the United Kingdom paperreferred to in paragraph 1 above rather than a treaty dealing in detail with each ofthese problems. The group recommends that this question should also be furtherstudied in each of the three countries. In any case, it would be advisable, at the initial stage, not to take too rigid a position on a question which to some extentdepends on the position which the Soviets themselves will adopt during Four-Powernegotiations.III. Position to be taken at Lugano on Soviet Economic Proposals1. In its note of August 15, 1953, the Soviet Government made severalproposals for &quot; the alleviation of Germany&apos;s financial and economic obligationsconnected with the consequences of the war.&quot; These proposals were not com-mented on in the Allied reply of September 2. In the new Soviet note ofSeptember 28, the Soviet Government called upon the Allies to make a definitivestatement of their position on these subjects. The Allied Foreign Ministers will certainly be confronted with the necessity of speaking on these points at Lugano.2.   The text of the Soviet proposal of August 15 was as follows:  &quot; The alleviation of Germany&apos;s financial and economic obligationsconnected with the consequences of the war.&quot; Considering that Germany has already fulfilled a significant part ofits financial-economic obligations with regard to the U.S.S.R., England, theUnited States and France, connected with the consequences of the war, and taking into account the necessity of alleviating the economic position ofGermany, the Government of the U.S.S.R. recognises the urgency of takingappropriate decisions in connection with this.&quot; (a) The Soviet Government considers it also necessary to restrict thescale of expenditure connected with the presence of the troops of the four powers on the territory of Germany. With this aim it is proposed that theamounts of expenditures on the maintenance of these troops in the courseof a year should not exceed 5 per cent, of the revenues of the State budget of the German Democratic Republic and the German Federal Republic andthat in any case they should not exceed the amounts of the occupation expendi-tures in 1949, when the formation of the North Atlantic Bloc had not yetaffected the scale of occupation expenditures.&quot; The Soviet Government proposes in addition that Germany should be completely freed from the payment of indebtedness on the foreign occupationexpenses of the Four Powers which arose after 1945.&quot;3. In the Soviet-D.D.R. Protocol signed in Moscow on August 22, 1953, theSoviet Government in effect agreed to place the proposal regarding expenditureswithin Germany (internal occupation costs) in force as of January 1, 1954, withreference to the operations of its own forces in the D.D.R.4. The Soviet proposals are essentially of a propaganda character, designedto draw some advantage from the concessions which the Soviet Government was forced to make in the East Zone, both for economic reasons and because of the june 17 riots. They apparently are directed toward what the Soviets considerweak spots in the Western position. The reply of the Allies to these proposals should be made in the light of our achievements in Western Germany. It should bring out the contrast between the steps which the Allies have taken to facilitate the economic recovery of the Federal Republic and the development of normal trade relations between Western Germany and the world at large, and the policy the Soviets have adopted of exploiting the Eastern Zone of Germany.5. The following is the position with respect to the individual points raisedby the Soviet Government:  (A) ReparationsThe difference of view on this subject between the United States and UnitedKingdom on the one hand and the French on the other hand is set out in Section Iabove. From the United States-United Kingdom point of view the attitude to betaken by the Ministers at Lugano is conditioned by the position publicly adopted as a result of discussions in Bonn immediately before the signature of the Bonn
Convention by the United States and United Kingdom Governments. (See para-igraph 9 in Section I above.) It would be impossible for the United States and united Kingdom Foreign Ministers at Lugano to say anything which conflictedwith that undertaking. Since it has proved&quot;impossible for the Working Group to resolve this difference, the Group have confined themselves to preparing thefollowing statements which set out positions on the problem corresponding to thedivergent points of view.United States-United Kingdom proposal the Western Powers should take note of the Soviet proposal that, beginningon January 1, 1954, Germany should be freed completely of payment of reparations.The policy of the Western Powers toward reparations was made abundantly clear at the time of the signature of the Bonn Conventions. They, therefore, confirm that for their part they will not ask further reparations from Germany and statethat they would be opposed to the inclusion in the peace settlement of provisions for further reparation for other countries.[The U.S. member suggests that in taking note of the Soviet proposal theForeign Ministers should make some reference to past Allied statements onthe subject of Soviet takings of reparations from the Soviet Zone and theSoviet A.Gs. The preparation of a suitable statement will require referenceto documents on past conferences.]French proposal the three Powers consider that the whole question of reparations must be finally settled within the framework of the peace treaty, in relation with other provisions in the treaty, and after consultation with interested Powers.If the Soviet Government desires to discuss the question during the present conference the three Powers do not refuse to do so. They are prepared, to theextent to which the Soviet Government are prepared to do the same, to accountvery precisely for everything which has been transferred or seized as reparation forthe benefit of the Western Powers.While the Soviet Government were pursuing in their zone a policy contraryto agreed undertakings, particularly as regards the economic unity of Germany, the actions of the three Powers in respect to reparation have been taken openly andwith full respect for these undertakings. The three Powers have never exploitedfor their own benefit German industrial undertakings; the dismantling of factoriescame to an end in 1950; and the three Powers have never at any time exactedreparation from current production.(B) The Post-war Inter-governmental DebtsThe Soviet proposals are an attack on the bilateral agreements under whichpartial repayment is being made for the aid which the Western Allies extendedto Germany after the war. These agreements form an integral part of the Londondebt settlements. This is again purely a propaganda move and Ministers will nodoubt wish to avoid being drawn into any discussion on it. If some such discussionbecomes necessary however, the following points might be made:The economic assistance which the three Powers have furnished to western germany after the war has made a great contribution to the restoration of theWest German economy. While the three Western Powers were pursuing thisgenerous policy, the Soviet Union for their part were pillaging the Soviet Zone.Under the post-war debt agreements the three Powers have agreed to accept greatly reduced amounts in settlement of their claims. The payments provided for underthese agreements represent the normal obligation on any debtor, who has attaineda considerable degree of prosperity, to pay his debts. This subject has noconnexion with the problems confronting the four Foreign Ministers at their meeting.(C) External Costs of OccupationThese costs represent that portion of the expenditures for maintaining allied forces in Germany which has been borne as a direct charge on the budget of theAllied Power concerned. These costs are extremely large. The difference of view on the subject between the United States on the one hand and the United Kingdomand France on the other is set out in paragraphs 13 to 15 in Section I.The proposed positions for the discussions at Lugano in the light of these differences are as follows:  
United States proposal the Western Powers should state their willingness to waive their claims toreimbursement for external costs of occupation in the peace settlement as part ofa general reciprocal waiver of such claims arising out of the war as remainunsettled.United Kingdom-French proposal the Western Powers should take note of the Soviet proposal that germany should be completely free from the payment of indebtedness on the externaloccupation costs of the four Powers which arose after 1945. They have alwaysconsidered that a settlement of this problem should be reached within the frame-work of the German Peace Treaty. Until the Soviet Union have agreed to the holding of free all-German elections and the subsequent conclusion with anall-German Government of a freely negotiated peace treaty, we are not preparedto discuss this question.(D) The Level of Internal Occupation costs the Soviet proposal that internal occupation costs should be reduced to5 per cent, of the budgets of the Bonn and Pankow Governments respectively andshould not in any case exceed the 1949 level (i.e., before the entry into force of theNorth Atlantic Treaty) is a pure piece of propaganda and obviously constitutes a part of the Soviet attack upon N.A.T.O.Background(i) There has never been quadripartite agreement on the level of occupation costs. All efforts to reach agreements with the Soviets during the early days ofthe occupation, when we were trying to achieve the economic unification ofGermany, proved fruitless.(ii) The increase in Allied Forces in Germany since Korea has necessarilyresulted in a substantial rise in the cost of support of the Allied Forces. BeforeKorea, Allied occupation costs amounted to approximately DM. 4-4 billion. Forthe last several years (and at present), they have been running at the rate of overDM. 7-2 billion per year. Soviet Occupation costs for the year 1954 were fixed in the Soviet-D.D.R. Protocol of August 1953, at DM. 1-6 billion (East Marks).(iii) Soviet costs as officially published in the Eastern Zone have been reduced from the 1949 level. However, we have no information on what goes into theirfigures and they no doubt have other expenditures and sources of income. (Themilitarised police in the Soviet Zone are in effect an agency of the Soviet occupation authorities but their maintenance does not figure in occupation costs.) On theother hand, because of the high standards of the forces of the Western Allies and because of the number of their dependents in Germany, Western occupation costs are undoubtedly proportionately higher than Soviet costs on any basis of comparison.(iv) The Soviet proposal is very cleverly designed to take advantage of the differences in the budgets of the Bonn and Soviet Zone Governments. In view ofthe differences in the political and economic structure of the two parts of thecountry, the budgets of the Federal Republic and the D.D.R. are in no waycomparable.(v) Acceptance of the Soviet proposal would reduce the funds available tothe Western Allied Forces to 1 / 6 of the present rate of expenditure.Position to be PresentedIt is recommended that the Western Foreign Ministers should not allow themselves to become engaged in discussions of details of this subject, but that theyshould base their reply on broad political grounds.   The following points mightbe used:  (i) Until such time as there is a Government of a unified Germany, whichpossesses full powers, including the control of a unified currency and of the taxrevenues of Germany, there is no occasion for agreement among the occupying powers on the level of Occupation costs.(ii) Since the form of the Soviet proposal suggests that the subject will be used as a basis for allegation that the N.A.T.O. build-up (of which the increase of costin Western Germany is a reflection) is aggressive, the Ministers may wish to comment on this point in their reply.
