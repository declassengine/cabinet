W; Harrison^ Assistant Under-Secretary of state in the Foreign Office, and the Swiss Minister in London on 4th November,A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.6th November, 1953.RECORD OF CONVERSATION WITH THE SWISS minister the Swiss Minister paid one of his periodic visits this afternoon,this time with a questionnaire on Trieste,   He was in particular anxious toknow whether Berne had been seriously considered as a possible venue fora Five-Power conference, as had been reported in the Swiss Press.   I told him that we had not yet really discussed the question of a venue but that,should either Italy or Yugoslavia prefer an eventual conference to meet on neutral territory, Switzerland would seem an obvious choice,M, de Torrente then went on to say that he himself had been considerably surprised by the Yugoslav reaction to the proposed solution along the zonal frontier.   When he had discussed this question over the past yearfirst with M. Brilej and   later with M. V/elebit, he had received the strongimpression that the Yugoslavs would accept such a solution.   If, however,the Italians insisted on the return of a strip of Zone B, then the Yugoslavswould require in exchange a corridor through to the sea south of the City of trieste,   M, de Torrente added that, when he had mentioned this recently toM, Velebit, the latter had said that there had obviously been a misunderstandingand that M, de Torrente was mistaken in his impressions,   M, de Torrentesaid that he himself was, however, quite clear that there had been a change of attitude on the part of the Yugoslavs, which he attributed to pressure from the left Wing of the Yugoslav Communist Party,   I confirmed that that was ourown impression, adding that Tito had also no doubt been under strong pressure from the Slovene Nationalists, who held positions of influence in his Governments
