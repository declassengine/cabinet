(53) 30329th October, 1953CABINETVISITS OF THE PAYMASTER GENERAL TO AUSTRALIA AND THEUNITED STATESMemorandum by the Paymaster general  circulate for the information of my colleagues the report which the cabinet invited me to make on my visits to Australia and the United States (C.C. (53)59th Conclusions, Minute 1).A ustralia2. The main object of my visit to Australia was to endeavour to make sure that a sufficient supply of uranium would be available to enable us to embark ona programme of industrial development for the generation of electricity in theUnited Kingdom. I was to propose an Anglo-Australian partnership for thedevelopment of atomic energy. We were to place the whole of our industrial&quot; know-how&quot; at the disposal of the Australian Government. In return the australians were to grant us an option on a part (say two-thirds) of the uraniumproduced in the Northern territory (outside the Hundred of Goyder, where theuranium is already under contract to the Combined Development Agency (C.D.A.).We were to make United Kingdom capital available for the exploitation of theseuranium resources in roughly the same proportion.3. At the first meeting Mr. Menzies seemed taken with the idea of a jointenterprise of this sort but on meeting the Australian Cabinet it became evidentthat other Ministers were by no means enthusiastic. They attached much less importance than we had hoped to the knowledge which it had cost us so many millions to acquire. And it was clear that, having no serious atomic energyprogramme on hand, they thought that if one developed later on they would beable to get the &quot; know-how &quot; from somewhere. While, therefore, Ministers wishedthat we should commit ourselves to provide the &quot; know-how &quot; so as to make it lookas though they had got something in return for anything they might offer, theydid not themselves attach much importance to it. Also, the offer of UnitedKingdom capital did not prove very alluring, particularly to the Minister for supply who was convinced that private enterprise capital could be attracted.Furthermore all the Ministers became uneasy about the whole negotiation in viewof the press campaign which developed at this stage and the political implicationsin relation to the forthcoming election.4. At a subsequent meeting Mr. Menzies said that the Cabinet had discussed the question and the furthest they could go was that we should be &quot; preferredcustomers &quot; at current world prices for any uranium which might be found, not already committed to the C.D.A., and surplus to Australian requirements, whether for stockpiling or use. Subsequently, after further consultation with his colleagues,Mr. Menzies sent me a draft of the letter setting out these proposals. In a furtherconversation he said that the uranium offer was not to be conditional on our under-taking to supply the Australians with all the &quot;know-how.&quot;   At this stage he45078
seemed-to realise that it would be asking a great deal to seek such an undertaking in return for his very vague offer, but he hinted that he hoped that we should meet their requests just as Australia gave us facilities for atomic bomb tests withoutasking conditions. Next day I submitted a draft reply saying that I would consultmy colleagues and that we would then let him know whether, in the circumstances,we felt that the Australian offer was sufficiently sure ground to enable us to approach the Americans for a modification of the modus vivendi which prohibitsthe passing of classified information to any nation except Canada.5. At this stage Mr. Menzies had to go to Melbourne for his brothersfuneral, and the other Ministers apparently met and decided against making anywritten offer whatsoever. Mr. Menzies came to Sydney and spent the eveningbefore my departure with me. He then explained this change of front but saidI could keep his draft letter as an aide-memoire showing the way in which theAustralian Cabinefs mind was working6. There seems little doubt that the Australian Cabinet was stampeded by theviolent Press campaign. This stemmed from a grossly inflated idea in the mind of the Australian public about the value of their uranium deposits and fromdistorted versions of the secret C.D.A. contract. This latent unpopularity of theC.D.A. contract originally directed against the Americans was largely trans-ferred to my mission once public attention, was directed to it. On the last three days of my stay in Australia there was scarcely a paper which did not warn thepeople not to sell their birthright; or, if they did sell it, to do so only at a very high price. This led to a huckstering attitude on the part of some of the AustralianMinisters which was out of place in the preliminary discussions, although it mighthave been natural in subsequent official discussions relating to the price formula.7. We must now consider whether we should offer the Australians all thetechnical &quot; know-how&quot; which it has cost us scores of millions of pounds to accumulate, in return for a vague option on a vague part of any new finds ofuranium. Frankly, I personally was somewhat disappointed at the prospectsafter I visited the uranium mines, though I must make it clear that my pessimismis not shared by our leading geological adviser. In any case it seems to me thatthe difficulties of exploitation are such that private capital is unlikely to be attracted in adequate amounts. It might therefore be argued that it is hardlyworth our while to enter into any arrangement which involves us in an awkwardapproach to the Americans with whom, in the C.D.A., we still have to work.8. On the other hand an option, however vague and whether confirmed inwriting or not, might at least give us priority over the Americans for such futureAustralian supplies as they may be willing to export. Again, however much it hascost us to acquire the &quot; know-how,&quot; to disclose it will cost us relatively little, while not to do so might lose us some Australian good-will particularly in the matterof future weapon tests. This is all the more likely since we have reason to believethat the Americans are planning to alter their legislation so that they can offerindustrial &quot; know-how &quot; to uranium-producing countries. This would suggest thatwe ought to try and get some return for our disclosures before they lose part oftheir value.9. I am therefore inclined to think that it would on balance be worth while to make an offer of full technical assistance though I doubt whether we shall beable to make any progress before the Australian election.10. The possible lines of action are being studied by officials and a recom-mendation will be submitted in due course.America11. I had arranged to return via America in case it became necessary to dis-cuss a modification of the modus vivendi following successful negotiations with the australians. In the event, of course, this did not arise. The Chiefs of Staff howeverhad asked me to take this opportunity of endeavouring to persuade the Americans(i) to exchange technical information in the intelligence field on the Russianatomic bomb tests with a view to agreeing on the interpretation of the data;(ii) to tell us about the effects of atomic weapons so as to enable us to improve our defence and strategy in the event of atomic war.
. 12. With these matters in view Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador took me to see thePresident on the morning of my arrival. He appeared to be entirely sympatheticbut reminded me of American difficulties over the McMahon Act. I told him wefully realised this but pointed out that the whole situation was now changed sincethe Russians knew almost as much as, if not more than, the Americans and ourselvesdid about bomb production. It would therefore be lamentable if we failed to discover all we could about the Russian situation owing to technical difficulties incomparing views on intelligence. Much the same argument held as regards weaponseffects though in this case special regard had to be paid to the protection of theUnited Kingdom which would be in the forefront of the battle owing to the UnitedStates bases here. The President asked me to talk with entire frankness to Strauss(Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission) who happened to be an old friend of mine. Strauss professed himself entirely sympathetic and promised to examineall the possibilities within the Act. In the intelligence field we reached an agree-ment which should be significant. It seems, however, that certain people, both in congress and in the Administration, will press for any disclosures to be limitedto those which the United States is prepared to make to all members of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation. This would of course greatly reduce the value ofthe whole process.13. I subsequently discussed the matter of weapons effects with AdmiralRadford, Chairman of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and with members of theDepartment of Defence and of the Atomic Energy Commission. The usual stringof. legal difficulties were enunciated, not to say paraded. But I am convinced that most of the officials concerned even Le Baron, Assistant Secretary of the Depart-ment of Defence, who has hitherto been so isolationist would like to find a wayround these.14. I fear we shall only discover how far the Americans are prepared to goafter Congress meets in January. There is a great deal of talk of amending theMcMahon Act, and if Congress and the Administration have realised the changed situation arising from the great advances made by the Russians, it may well be a real step forward. If, on the other hand, the amendment of the Act is like thelast one, it will prove of very little value and we shall be left once again with the shadow, not the substance, of co-operation.C.Paymaster General&apos;s Office, S.W. 1,28th October, 1953.
