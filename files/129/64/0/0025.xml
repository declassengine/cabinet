confidential. (53) 32518th November, 1953OFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited by the Cabinet on 30th July (C.C. (53) 47th Conclusions,Minute 6) to arrange for the scheme outlined in my paper C. (53) 206 to be examined further by the Departments concerned, and to report the results.2. My colleagues will remember that the essence of the scheme was toprovide that, without any means test, a minimum increase of 10 per cent, shouldbe given on all service officers&apos; retired pay and on all public service pensionsawarded up to (roughly) 1945, where this is more favourable than any increasealready provided under existing Pensions Increase measures (paragraph 5 ofC. (53) 206). The cost is set out in paragraph 8 of C. (53) 206 at  400,000.3. It has now been carefully studied between the Departments concerned.Briefly, the upshot of this study is that the Service Departments would welcome thescheme, which would, they say, remove a grievance without causing any internalService difficulties; but that the Civil Departments would all expect it greatly to stimulate further demands for improvements on the lower level. It is common ground that any concession given to retired officers of the Armed Forces wouldhave to apply also to comparable Civil Servants, and that it would also be necessaryto cover, as a charge to United Kingdom funds, certain Indian pensioners.Views of the Service Departments4. My colleagues will be aware of the arguments for the grant of a specialbenefit to retired officers, as strongly advocated by the Minister of Defence, andI need not reiterate them here. The Service Departments consider that a 10 percent, increase is preferable to the restoration of the &quot; 9\ per cent, cut&quot; as such,since this would keep the increase within the framework of the existing automaticPensions Increase scheme. At the same time it would remove a long-standing causeof grievance, without direct repercussions on the existing Service pension codesand without prejudicing the basic principle that pensioners have no right to benefitautomatically from improvements in pension codes which occur after their retire-ment. The Service Departments are naturally not in a position to forecast whetherthe grant of the concession would reduce public and political pressure for other measures designed to benefit Service and other pensioners, but they are convincedthat it would take one particular sting out of the present agitation.5. The Commonwealth Relations Office also have an interest: they considerthat comparable treatment would have to be given on the ground of equity to pensioners who were British Officers of the Indian Civilian Services as well as thoseof the Indian Army. This compensation would have to be at the expense of her majesty&apos;s Government because the Governments of India and Pakistan and Burmawill not accept liability.The views of Civil Departments6. The Home Office, the Ministries of Housing and Local Government,Health and Education and the corresponding Scottish Departments, have betweenthem primary responsibility for public service pensioners other than civil servants.These Departments unanimously agree that a scheme benefiting retired service officers and Civil Servants would have to be extended to other public service pensioners local government officials, police, teachers, &amp;c. . They are alsounanimous in thinking that a concession on the lines proposed for those with the copy No.  g ^CABINET45207Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1953
higher pensions would lead to serious pressure from those with small pensions (whowould get nothing out of this proposal) for larger and more extensive increases thanthe existing Pensions (Increase) Acts provide. Some groups, such as the teachers,would certainly press for abolition of the present income limits governing eligibility for pensions increase. There is, moreover, no chance whatever that claims on theselines will fail to materialise. The interests of these pensioners are zealously pursued by powerful Unions and Associations who could not possibly fail to exploit thegolden opportunity provided by any concession to retired Service Officers and senior Civil Servants. Some of these Associations have as their expressed policvthe automatic adjustment of pensions to follow changes in the cost of living. TheHome Office think it likely that certain groups, such&quot; as the higher ranking police officers, would press their claims even if the scheme were limited to Service Officers(which it cannot be) in spite of the fact that these groups did not originally undergoanything comparable to the &quot; 9f per cent, cut.&quot;7. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance are also affected by any proposals to relate increases of pensions to changes in the cost of living or to reductions in the purchasing power of the pound. The British Legion are about to launch a nation-wide campaign for increased war pensions which will, in part bebased on these grounds. There is also certain to be considerable pressure from various quarters at least to raise National Insurance benefits and pensions to fullsubsistence level at a net cost of about  140 millions a year. While, therefore, theMinistry realise that on many grounds pensions and retired pay due in respect ofservice in the Armed Forces are distinguishable from pensions payable for wardisabilities or under the National Insurance Acts, they feel certain that at this juncture any proposal to increase contractual pensions on the grounds now suggested would be used as an additional argument for urging increases in the ratesof the pensions and benefits for which they are responsible.conclusion. After studying the opinions of the Departments, I cannot but be more than ever impressed with the dangers of this scheme, to which I drew attention in para-graphs 9-14 of C. (53) 206. Thus: -(a) We cannot provide for senior service officers without simultaneouslydealing with senior civil servants. The case of the latter is every bit asgood as that of the former, and they are becoming well organised andvocal.(b) Having once abandoned the hardship criterion which has governed allprevious approaches to the problem after both wars, I am clear thatthere is no logical stopping point short of bringing all past awardsup to the level of current pensions which would be quite prohibitivelyexpensive (i.e., it might cost  40 millions). The danger that we shallhave to do more is greatly increased by the fact that the present schemeis of no benefit to any but those in the highest ranks, i.e., it gives aGeneral  127, a Major  8, and nothing below.(c) We must weigh the embarrassment and political danger in offering improve-ments in the pensions of a limited section at a time when we are unableto improve the position of the old-age pensioner and the war widow,and when we have set up the Phillips Committee to advise us on thewhole problem of the provision for old age.9. In spite of this the Cabinet wish to approve this scheme and the promise of a statement next week clearly commits us to some extent we must brazen it out as best we may. But we must recognise that we have taken a first (admittedlysmall) step away from the recognised test in these matters of meeting real hardshiponly. We shall be pushed and badgered to do more, both for State servants onthe smaller pensions and for other public pensioners at an ultimate cost whichthe economy cannot face. We shall therefore have to resist these claims with theutmost obstinacy having unhappily weakened our position by failing to reject,as has been done up to now, a claim on behalf of senior State servants which is bound to be put forward from time to time but which is hard to justify asdemanding special and isolated treatment.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,17th November, 1953.
