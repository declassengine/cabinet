I now circulate for the information of mycolleagues the report of the Working Party (Annex 1).2. I am giving immediate study to the implications of this report and con-sidering whether its recommendations are politically acceptable and, if so, how they fit into the general picture. The Zone Commander has made a number ofreservations on the Report which are also being studied.3. I also attach a subsidiary report by the Working Party (Annex 2) Oh theproposal that the City of Trieste might be handed over to the Italians, while theremainder of Zone A continued to be administered by Allied Military Government.A.

ANNEX 1REPORT OF THE UNITED STATES/UNITED KINGDOMWORKING party . The United States/United Kingdom Working Party made an exhaustivestudy of the possibility of handing over the administration of Zone A to the Italianswhile retaining United States /United Kingdom Forces in the Zone. The militarymembers of the Working Party, including those from Allied Military Government(A.M.G.), Trieste, separately examined all the implications of such a proposal and submitted their views to the Working Party (see Appendix).2. In the light of these views, that this action would present unacceptabledifficulties from both the military and administrative points of view, and after further discussion by all members of the Party, the Working Party decided toconsider what functions and services of government in Zone A, additional to thoselisted in the Memorandum of Understanding of 9th May, 1952, could be progressively handed over to the Italian Administration.3. The Working Party had before them a plan submitted on behalf of the zone Commander which would provide for a progressive transfer of the adminis-tration of Zone A in two stages. During the first stage of the plan Allied military government would be completely Italianized, with the exception of certain keypersonnel. The Zone Commander would retain full authority and responsibility in the Zone until the completion of the second stage, which would begin a fewdays before the final Allied withdrawal.4. The Working Party took account of the view expressed by the ItalianGovernment that the departments reserved to the Zone Commander under theLondon Memorandum of Understanding should be progressively turned over to italian administration. The Working Party felt that this process could be gearedto the progress of the Five-Power Conference, if held. The Working Party recog-nised the desirability of convincing the Italian Government of the sincerity of theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments in putting into effect the decisionof 8th October and of their determination to effect a progressive transfer, bearing that mind that the administration of Zone A must be passed to the ItalianGovernment as a going concern.5. With these considerations in view the Working Party recommends that theUnited States/United Kingdom Governments inform the Italian Government in confidence that the functions and services of the present administration of Zone a would be transferred to the Italians in the following manner, probably commencingas soon as agreement had been reached for the holding of a Five-Power Conference.The Italian Government would:(a) Provide 8 Majors of Carabinieri to understudy and later replace certainAllied officers in the Venezia Giulia Police Force. Only 6 Allied officers would then remain in command of the Police Force.*(b) Provide a Director of the Port of Trieste, the Zone Commander to retain a residual authority over the port facilities and services for his military needs.*Note 1. The Zone Commander is unable to agree to hand over the control of the Port during thefirst stage, as he considers that without this control he cannot ensure the safety of the UnitedStates/United Kingdom forces, particularly during the final stage of the withdrawal. He is, however,willing to admit an Italian understudy to the Director of the Port.2. The Working Party gave full consideration to the Zone Commander&apos;s objections to allowing the Italians to provide a Director of the Port of Trieste in Stage One. The United Statesand United Kingdom members of the Party prefer to leave the wording in sub-paragraph 5 (b) as now written for the following reasons:  (1) As long as the Zone Commander retains supreme authority in the Zone, along withcommand of the United States/United Kingdom forces and the Venezia Giulia police force, he has the means at his disposal to guarantee the use of the port facilities requiredfor the final embarkation of his military units, their equipment and supplies.(2) If Italian naval vessels moved or attempted to move into the Port of Trieste in violation of the Zone Commanders wishes, this could not be prevented by any one Allied officialas Director of the Port. Rather, the Zone Commander should call upon the UnitedStates and United Kingdom Governments for necessary action.(3) The retention of residual authority over the port facilities and services should meet the zone Commander&apos;s military needs.
(c) Take over the Shipping Control Office.(d) Provide 7 officials to take over the administration of displaced personscamps.   This would leave one Allied officer in charge of displaced!    persons until the final Allied withdrawal.   The Italian Governmentwould be invited to appoint an officer to understudy this Allied officialin order to take over his duties on the date of final withdrawal.(e) Provide Press and Broadcasting officers to take over these functions of theAllied Public Information Office. The present Allied Director of public relations would remain until the final withdrawal, but the ItalianGovernment would be invited to provide an understudy to him.(/) Be invited to appoint an understudy to the Comptroller of Accounts, totake over from the latter on the date of final withdrawal.(g) Provide officials to take over progressively the internal administra-tion of Allied Military Government (personnel, equipment, stores,buildings, &amp;c).(h) Be invited to appoint an understudy to the office of the Chief of Staff(A.M.G.) to take over this function on the date of final withdrawal.(i) Be advised that:  (1) the Directorate of Legal Affairs will remain directly responsible tothe Zone Commander until the final withdrawal in order to assistthe Zone Commander on legal matters. This will involve theretention of 3 officials only and will not affect the Italian legalstructure now functioning in Zone A;(2) the Zone Commander will retain until the final withdrawal thepresent Military Permit Office;(3) while the Post and Telecommunications are turned over to them, itwill be necessary in the interest of military security to retain untilfinal withdrawal of United States/United Kingdom militaryforces the one remaining Allied official in this organisation.The details of the arrangements in sub-paragraphs (d)-(h) above would be worked out directly by the Italian Government and the Allied Military Government.6. The Working Party believes that implementation of the above plan wouldenable the Zone Commander to retain control over the Zone for a reasonable periodof time before final authority is transferred to the Italian Government simultaneously with the withdrawal of the United States /United Kingdom forces.Appendix to Annex military Implications of Proposal to Hand over Zone A to the Italianswhile Retaining Military Forces in the ZoneThe Military members of the Working Party consider that the separation ofthe Civil administration from the Military command would create the followingproblems:  2. Situation with Respect to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)(a) Italian Administrative Authority over Zone A while United States-UnitedKingdom troops remain in occupation would appear to place the Zoneautomatically in a N.A.T.O. status. Any attack on the Zone would thus permit Italy to invoke Article 5 of the N.A.T.Q. agreement Thiswould seem to place Italy in an ideal position to provoke Yugoslavattack by pursuing an expansionist policy towards Zone B.(b) There are many ways in which, deliberately or otherwise, the Italians couldcreate incidents to provoke the Yugoslavs. These could take the formof minority persecutions, inflammatory radio or press attacks, populardemonstrations or mob violence, or border incidents, either within or45099 b 2
without the Zone. Thus the Italians would have the power to createsituations affecting vital United States-United Kingdom nationalcommitments even to the extent of open armed conflict.3. Legal Status of Forces(a) The situation of United States-United Kingdom forces in Zone A underItalian administration would require the legal safeguards of an Occupa-tion Statute to protect both individuals and property. The existingAllied Military Government Courts could no longer operate to furnishthis essential protection nor would the N.A.T.O. Status of ForcesAgreement be adequate or applicable. Even should the Pella Govern-ment be able to pass an acceptable Statute, it is questionable whethertime is available for the necessary legislative processes.(b) Other vital but related legal problems would be created under this proposalfor which no solution is apparent within the time available. these include the entire field of fiscal and customs legislation, the rights ofmilitary requisition, status of statal and para-statal housing, and criminal and civil jurisdiction.4. Internal security the primary instrument of the Military Commander in the execution of his present responsibility for the maintenance of the internal security of the Zoneis the Venezia Giulia Police Force, which would presumably pass to Italian control under this proposal. All existing emergency plans, either for internal or externalsecurity of the Zone, are predicated on the use of the V.G.P.F., and would thus beinvalidated under the proposal Therefore if the Italian Administrative authority should call on the Allied Military Commander to use troops to maintain public order, such action would be without legal basis. Also purely from the considerationof the safety of his own forces, the protection of military property and the accom-plishment of his mission, the Allied Military Commander would require certainemergency powers for which no legal provision exists.5. Morale(a) There is a great weight of human unhappiness among the United States/United Kingdom Forces, as the result of the sudden division of families,particularly so for a period of uncertain duration. To this must beadded the considerable financial hardships inevitable when homes arebroken up at short notice and officers and other ranks are compelledto make emergency arrangements for their personal effects and for thetemporary accommodation of their families in conditions far fromsatisfactory and which are aggravated by indefinite tenure.ib) These factors are bound to have an adverse effect on the morale of theindividual soldier. Further factors which may affect morale will berelinquishment of requisitioning powers which will limit facilities fortraining, organised sport, welfare and amenities.6. MaintenanceThe maintenance of the United States /United Kingdom Forces in Zone A is dependent upon the availability of essential services, such as transportation, port facilities and public utilities. This would depend upon Italian co-operation bothon a local and a national basis. Thus the logistic support and maintenance ofthese forces would be placed at the mercy of the local or national Governments.7. General Winterton who has been Supreme Commander of the A.F.T. forthree years cannot be expected to assume a position of lesser importance in the zone. It would therefore be necessary to ask General McFadyen or some other general officer to take command of the United States/United Kingdom Forcesremaining in Zone A under this proposal.8. As a final consideration it appears that the Military Commander of theUnited States/United Kingdom Forces remaining in Zone A, under Italianadministration of the Zone, would be placed in the unacceptable position of havingresponsibility without authority.
ANNEX 2Subsidiary Report of the United Kingdom /United States Working PartyThe Working Party has been asked to consider the practicability or otherwise of handing over the City of Trieste entirely to Italian civil administration while retaining Allied Military Government control in the remainder of Zone A of theFree Territory. This has been suggested as a possible means of bringing both Italyand Yugoslavia to agree to come to a Conference.The Working Party has outlined below its views on the local administrative,military and political implications of such a hand-over. In this connexion it shouldbe noted that Zone A is divided into six communes with the Trieste Communeincluding contiguous towns and villages, several of which are peopled predominantlyby Slovenes. There is no separate governing body for the City of Trieste. TheWorking Party therefore considered the Commune in lieu of the City of Trieste. Itshould further be noted that apart from one or two units all the United States and united Kingdom troops are quartered within the boundaries of the Commune of trieste.A. AdministrativeAdministratively the hand-over would involve the division of the present allied military Government into two separate administrations. This would involve inparticular the following departments:-(i) Police the greater part of the Police would have to be left in Trieste(which contains over 80 per cent, of the total population of the Zone)as it is virtually only in the City that serious disturbances occur. Thepresent Allied officers, however, would presumably not remain as thispart of the Police would come under the Italian administration. the morale and efficiency of this part of the Police would inevitably date-riorate. Furthermore, the Headquarters of the Police, including thecentre of their communications net, is in the centre of Trieste. A separateHeadquarters and Communications Centre for the Venezia GiuliaPolice Force would have to be set up outside the Commune. this process would take at least two months if accommodation could befound. A second inner frontier between the two areas would have tobe created under Police Control.(ii) Zone Presidency this office at present operates throughout the wholeZone, dealing with such matters as roads, taxation, the local appli-cation of Allied Military Government orders, &amp;c. Presumably theCommune of Trieste would have to be excluded from the ZonePresidency&apos;s jurisdiction and the Zone Presidency would have toestablish new offices outside the Commune.(iii) The Education Office and the Departments of Commerce, Labour, finance and Health all of which are staffed with Italians, within the present organisation of Allied Military Government would also have to be divided, part remaining in Trieste under the Italian administration, partremaining under Allied Military Government outside the Commune.(iv) Telephone and telegraph communications are centred in the Commune of trieste. It would be impossible quickly to construct a separate centreoutside the Commune to serve the remainder of the Zone. allied military Government would therefore be dependent in this respect onthe goodwill and co-operation of the Italian administration in theCommune of Trieste.(v) Allied Military Government Headquarters and both Military Headquartersare at present located in the Commune of Trieste. They would eitherhave to move to a new location outside the Commune or remain in theCommune where Allied Military Government would have ceased tohave authority. The former would seem the only practical alternative.While the two military Headquarters could quickly transfer to the field
on a tactical basis, the move of the long-established Allied military government Headquarters would be difficult to achieve in a short periodof time.(vi) In the field of law, it would be necessary to set up an entirely new judicialsystem for that part of the Zone remaining under Allied military government, and to find officials to staff it.B.-MilitaryMost of the problems that would require resolution if the civil administrationof Zone A were handed over to the Italian Government with United States/UnitedKingdom Troops remaining in the Territory would also arise in the event of thetransfer of the Commune of Trieste only to Italian civil administration. these include particularly:(i) the question of an occupation statute to cover amongst Other things thestatus of troops in the Commune in the course of duty or otherwise;(ii) continued communications through the Port, which Allied Military Goy-ernmeht would have ceased to control, and the use of road arid failfacilities in the Commune of Trieste;(iii) the manner in which the Commander of the United States/United King-dom Forces would, or could, intervene to maintain order in theCommune of Trieste either if requested to do so by the ItalianAdministration or if he considered it essential in order to keep hischannels of communication open.C. PoliticalThe Working Party considers that the reaction to the handover of the Comniuneof Trieste to Italian administration would be unfavourable in both Italy and yugoslavia.The Italians would consider a handover limited to the Commune of Triesteas a repudiation of the decision of 8th October and would probably reject theproposal. Such a proposal would almost certainly provoke anti-Allied demonstra-tions in Trieste which, for the reason given in Section A (i) above, the Police wouldbe less able and willing to control.The Yugoslavs might well consider such a handover to the Italians, with allied military Government remaining in control of the rest of the Zone, as anotherexample of the &quot; pro-Italian &quot; bias of Western policy over the Free Territory. Theywould probably, therefore, demand to be given the civil administration of theSlovene areas as a condition of acquiescence in a settlement. The resulting positionof Allied Military Government and the United States /United Kingdom Forces inthe remainder of Zone A would be most difficult.conclusions as a result of the considerations set out above, the Working Party has con-eluded that the difficulties arising out of a handover of the Commune of Triesteto Italian administration would be many and complicated; and that, although some of these difficulties could be overcome in time, they are such as to render sucha handover in the short term both impracticable and dangerous.
