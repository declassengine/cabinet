(53) 35011th December, 1953CABINETFOOD prices memorandum by the Minister of food the Cabinet agreed that increases in food prices should be made so. that the subsidies would be running at an annual rate of  220 million by the end of thecurrent financial year; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labourand I were asked to work out a time-table (C.C. (53) 57th Conclusions, Minute 7).Timing2. The approach of Christmas and the importance of the wages negotiations that have been taking place make it especially necessary to time price increaseswith care. Unfortunately the mechanics of the rationing system restrict our choiceto two dates 27th December and 21st February, next if, as is obviously desirable,all the increases are to be made at the same time. My colleagues will probablyagree that the former is too near Christmas, and I suggest that the operative date should be 21st February.The Immediate Problem(a) Straightforward Price Increases3. At the time of our last discussion the subsidies were estimated to be running at an annual rate of about  250 million after excluding non-recurrentelements from this year&apos;s total. It therefore seemed practicable to reduce the rate to about  220 million by making the following changes, which would save ratherover  30 million in a full year:  Increase in        Effect on price Cost-of-Livingd. per lb. IndexButter............... 4 4-0-26Cheese..........-..... 2 4-0-10Beef     ............... 2 4-0-35*But more recent calculations show that the current annual rate of subsidy is about 270 million. To get down to a rate of  220 million we must now therefore findfurther savings equivalent to  20 million in a full year. Since pork has recentlybeen selling well, I should be ready to look for an additional saving of about 10 million as follows:  Effect on Cost of increase in Price     Living IndexPork     ............      3d. per lb. 4-0-15*But this would still leave us with an annual rate around  230 million.* The estimated effect on the Index allows for a reaction on the price of sausages.45347
(b) Other Possible Price Increases4. In Appendix I the subsidies which remain after making the price increasesindicated above are set out in detail. My colleagues will observe that the scope for further changes is now very narrow, and we have hardly any room for manoeuvre. I assume that we should not be ready to find a saving by reducingthe direct agricultural subsidies carried on the Votes of the Agricultural Depart-ments, and indeed we are pledged to the present rates at least until the end of this financial year. I take it also that we should not wish to curtail expenditure on welfare schemes. Thus, having virtually eliminated the subsidies on butter and cheese, we are left with bacon, meat, milk and bread. The two increases on meatrecommended in paragraph 3 take us up to the highest prices than can at present be charged without reducing consumption. Bacon prices are also as high as iscommercially practicable, and like the subsidy on pork which forms a large partof the remaining meat subsidy, the subsidy is the result of the high price paid topig producers in this country.5. We could consider adding \d. per pint to the retail price of milk after31st March (we are firmly pledged to maintain the present price until then) at thecost of 0-43 on the Index. But it is far from certain that this would yield any appreciable saving. It is now increasingly difficult to sell all the milk surplus toliquid requirements, which has to be disposed of for manufacturing. The average price realised for manufacturing milk, which was about 2s. Ad. per gallon a yearago, is likely in any event to be down to Is. Sd. per gallon next year. A further increase in the retail price of liquid milk, which would be likely to have a sharpereffect on demand than similar increases in the past when the price level was lower,would probably reduce liquid consumption&apos; to an extent that would aggravate the disposal problem and force us to accept even lower sale prices for manu-facturing.  In the end any saving to the Exchequer might be negligible.6. An increase in the price of bread, however, would yield a definite saving,and on nutritional grounds is to be preferred to any further increase in the price of milk. We have moved a long way from the age when bread was the staple dietof the working class, and in the recent Debate on the Cost of Living the Oppositionthemselves made the point that it was illogical and nutritionally undesirable to concentrate subsidies on the so-called &quot;filler&quot; foods which are within the reach of all. Moreover, the bread subsidy will on balance tend to increase if we make no change in the price of the loaf, because the gradual increase in the costs ofbaking more than outweighs such reductions as have so far occurred in the costof flour. The administrative risks of allowing the subsidy to continue at itspresent level are considerable, for we cannot in practice maintain an effective check on the inflation of claims which this high rate makes so tempting. Unless we areto adopt the view that bread is properly regarded as a solitary exception to the rule that the consuming public should pay an economic price for their food, it is nowtime that we made some increase in the price of the loaf. There is no prospect that the current fall in the world price of wheat will serve to eliminate the subsidyor even to reduce it substantially, for the subsidy would only disappear when theprice of wheat fell to 70 cents a bushel, an event likely to be so disastrous in its economic consequences that we must hope that it will not occur.An increase of \d. in the retail price of the If lb. loaf would save just under 10 million in a full year and would add about 0-29 to the Cost of Living Index(by comparison with 0 - 43 for \d. per pint on milk).Future Problems7. I must warn my colleagues that in the financial year which begins next april, we shall have to face more fundamental issues. Whatever we do now,there are clear indications that the rate of subsidy is likely to rise again. On thebasis of such information as we already have, it is.estimated that, after allowing for the effect of the price increases indicated in paragraph 3 but assuming no changein the prices paid to producers in this country, the rate would in the course of next year rise to about  290 million, of which details are given in Appendix II. Butwe are now working in conditions in which precise forecasting is quite impossible,and the ultimate Exchequer liability might well exceed this figure by a widemargin. None can say with any certainty what the cost of the Government^guarantee to agricultural producers may turn out to be when our new marketing arrangements begin to operate. A sharp break in international cereal prices could in itself raise the Exchequer liability by some  20 million; and there are several other unpredictable factors.
8. We no longer have any room for manoeuvre. Even this year we cannotbring the rate of subsidy down to the predetermined level without raising the priceof bread. Next year, even if we were willing to contemplate complete elimination of this last of the true consumer subsidies, we should not be able to bring thetotal Exchequer liability below some  250 million; and as I have shown it mightbe much higher. For the future, if there is to be a limit on Government expenditurein this field, that limit must be maintained either by control of imports or, more directly, by putting some limit upon the cost which the Government is preparedto incur under the Agriculture Act, 1947.9. It would no doubt be theoretically possible to reduce the cost of agriculturalguarantees by reducing imports so as to maintain by scarcity a high domestic price level for food. But I thing my colleagues will agree that it would be impossibleto reconcile that either with our international obligations or with our general economic and commercial policy. The abolition of food rationing has been well received, but only because we have been able to raise supplies of food to a level which made rationing unnecessary. If after abolishing rationing we were deliberatelyto recreate scarcity so that the consumer, already deprived of subsidies designedto depress retail prices, might be made to pay the cost of agricultural subsidies,we should not only cause much anger and distrust at home, but would also holdup the general revival of international trade which we have striven so hard to foster.10. The only alternative is to place some direct limit upon the cost of our agricultural policy.. It is becoming essential that the farming industry should begiven a new objective which would combine the expansion of physical output withthe increase of efficiency by reduction of costs. I recognise, of course, that we mustnot endanger the basic principles on which the Agriculture Act is founded, and wecould not resort to a blunt statement that the cost of carrying out our obligations under the Act during next year will not be allowed to exceed a certain figure withoutcreating alarm among producers. But in any event a year is a very short period onwhich to base a sound plan for agricultural expansion and I feel that the time hascome when we should be addressing our minds to a programme extending two or perhaps three years ahead. I understand that it is now unlikely that the original programme of 60 per cent, expansion of output can be achieved by 1955/56; butwe should gain no credit from announcing a failure, and it would be better to takethe opportunity of presenting a new two or three year programme with a firmstatement of the expenditure which the Government is prepared to incur over thewhole period. If such a plan were carefully presented, it might give positiveencouragement to farming rather than create new apprehensions, for the industryis shrewd enough to see that the ever-mounting level of Government expenditure could lead to breakdown and would be reassured by a definite programme ofexpenditure over several years. It is only by such means that the cost of our agricultural policy can be properly integrated with our general economic policy.11.   I invite my colleagues (i) to approve the price increases indicated in paragraph 3 above to take effect from 21st February;(ii) to decide whether an increase in the price of bread should be made at thesame time;(iii) to consider the wider issues of future policy outlined in paragraphs 7-10.G.
