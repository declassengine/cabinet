THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1953SECRET Copy No.   86C. (53) 33024th November, 1953CABINETPOLICY IN THE FAR east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs place the following considerations before my colleagues as a suggested basis for general discussion of this question at Bermuda&quot;.&apos;2. It is in Eastern Asia that Communism has made its greatest gains in recentyears; it is still making strenuous efforts there and sees wide opportunities before it.It is of particular importance that British policies and those of our Commonwealthpartners and our European Allies on the one hand and those of the Americans onthe other should be closely aligned in this area.3. We are in broad agreement with the United States Government that Com-communism must be contained in the Far East, as elsewhere, by building up our strengthand that of our friends, by encouraging collective security and stamping on Com-munist aggression and subversion.  Differences arise over:  (i) the methods to be used in pursuing these aims;(ii) the choice of friends on whom to rely, and(iii) the machinery of co-operation to be set up.(i) Methods4. The American attitude towards China is the product of emotional, politicaland military pressures. These make many Americans disinclined to accept thefact that Communism in China has come to stay, responsive to suggestions that theChinese people could and should be assisted to liberate themselves by interventionfrom outside, and suspicious of attempts to reduce China&apos;s dependence on russia by establishing commercial or diplomatic contacts with Peking. In the face of suchviews the United States Administration find it difficult to pursue a realistic policy towards China.5. We should seek to convince the United States Government, and encourage them to convince American opinion, of the Tightness of our own approach, basedupon acceptance of the facts of the situation, the avoidance of provocation, gradualprogress towards more normal trading and diplomatic relations, and the need tokeep a toe in the door in case divergencies between China and Russia develop and can be exploited.(ii) Allies6. The United States has mutual defence treaties with Japan, South korea and the Philippines, in addition to the ANZUS pact with Australia and NewZealand. The United States Government have helped with equipment and trainingin building up the Chinese Nationalist forces in Formosa and have undertakenunilaterally to defend Formosa against attack. American financial and materialaid has been provided for the defence of Indo-China and growing interest is being shown in developing Siam&apos;s defensive capabilities. In some American quartersimpatience is expressed with the &quot; neutralism &quot; of India, Burma and Indonesia andit is sometimes claimed that the only friends who matter are those with large armiesand strong anti-Communist convictions. The Administration are aware of the need45235
to gain the support of Asian opinion as a whole, but their policies often appearunco-ordinated and political and military pressures might push them into ill-considered courses.7. We should make clear our full support of American policies designed tokeep Japan in the free world and deny her resources to Communism. We can also approve the United States Government^ policy of defending Formosa. Butwe should urge the need to formulate a carefully thought out policy for the area as a whole and to resist the temptation to rely solely upon militant anti-Communists.We should press the United States Government to explain what steps they are taking to keep Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek under control and to ensure that their forces are used only in support of agreed allied policies.(iii) Machinery8. There is talk from time to time in the United States of the need for a widerPacific defence pact. Here again the Administration, so far as is known, haveno clear plans. They say they cannot extend ANZUS to include the UnitedKingdom without also bringing in Asian countries such as the Philippines and thus reducing the usefulness of the organisation. They are probably alive to the dangers of any alliance based solely upon anti-Communist Asians. They are also aware that other important Asian countries such as India and Indonesia are. not yet readyto participate in an anti-Communist defence organisation. While the United states military authorities are co-operating actively in the military planning work of theFive-Power Staff Agency, the United States Government are probably still unwilling to assume any further formal defence commitments on the Asian mainland.9.! The only effective organisation to which the United Kingdom belongs isthe Five-Power Staff Agency. Though it has done good work its usefulness is limited, since it can only prepare military plans without commitment to Govern-ments. The time is coming when it will need further political backing and supportif it is to continue to do useful work. There are obvious political difficulties about this. But we might propose to the Americans that the Five-Power Staff agency should continue to be fostered as the only existing organisation in the Pacific forthe exchange of views and co-ordination of plans between the major Allied powers in the area. They might also be asked whether they have any plans in mind forthe eventual more effective co-ordination of defence policy at political and militarylevels on a wider basis.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd November, 1953.
