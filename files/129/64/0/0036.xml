The arguments ih favour and againstsupplying them are set out in my memorandum (D. (53) 46). r.   ;^ s2. The Chiefs of Staff were also invited to prepare an appreciation of themilitary advantage which Argentina would obtain by the possession of these^-M helicopters from the United Kingdom.  I am in full agreement with the viewson the military significance of these sales, which the Chiefs of Staff express in^-M the attached report.3. After reviewing the whole question, I still consider that the balance ofadvantage lies with approving the proposed orders and I therefore invite mycolleagues to agree to this.^mmm iy        &quot;ii  &apos; &quot;* ^&quot; mm*Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,26th November, 1953.^kW t .45255. | ^jfifi
? &quot;I    r &apos;&apos;f &apos;I&apos;   . I ISUPPLY 0E?^EL|^PTC;RS ilk ARG-ENTINA.AND CHILE ?Report by the Chiefs of Staff HVJwJj Introductions&lt;\&gt;  Tne question of the supply of helicopters to Argentina and Chile has been ftfjtratrer consideration by the Defence Committee.  We examine below the raferfw ^|which helicopters might be put by these countries and the strategic implications H?Jwjj                 thereof. ^|?Jwfl Types of Helicopter Involved2. The types of helicopter which the Argentinians and Chileans wish to Hpurchase are the S. 51 and S. 55. The S. 51 is a small machine of poor performance, HVJwJj                  and the S. 55 is the same type as that now being used in Malaya and in squadron VJservice in the Royal Navy. Type S. 55, when fitted with the latest type of engine, Hhas a radius of action of abut 160 miles with 800 lbs. pay-load, though this ratio Hcan be varied from a lift of 8-10 passengers over very short distances to a ferry Hrange of over 1,000 miles with special fuel tanks and crew only.  It is of interest Hthat icing of the rotor blades-to which helicopters are susceptible-has a very HVfVJ                  marked effect on performance. VJ3. So far as can be ascertained, American-supplied helicopters are already Hbeing put to the following uses: - H(a) Argentina H(i) .Six (believed to be S.51) in service with the navy on communication Hand air-sea rescue duties. At least one of these is known to have HPAwl                                   been used in the Antarctic.                                       &apos;.;*&quot;   &apos;. H(ii) Twe/ve Be// 47.-Civilian-owned and used for crop-spraying and Hinternal communications to outlying areas. H??fl f S- ^ C/&quot;7e I[Affl                             Tftree Be// 47 in service with the air force for communications and air-sea HOther Uses to which Helicopters could be put Hvsr 4.  We think that the only other use Which Argentina and Chile would be Hhkely to make of additional helicopters would be the improvement of commuriica- Htioris between their Antarctic bases. For this purpose they could be operated also Hfrom naval transports, although weather conditions are frequently unsuitable. HVJwJf                  Their possible use in acts of provocation against our own bases cannot, however, HVfffl                 be discounted. H^^^1                   Strategic Implications H5. The Chiefs of Staff have previously stated that our strategic needs in the H^^^1 area can be met by the retention of the Falkland Islands themselves, and that there HVJwJI are no military requirements in the Antarctic Dependencies. This view did not H^^^b                  take into account considerations of prestige or the possibility of mineral deposits. H6. In the unlikely event of war between ourselves and Argentina, the addition Hof helicopters would not have any effect on the ability of the Argentine to capture HVfffl                  the Falkland Islands, since she already has a heavy preponderance of air and naval H^^^H                  forces in the area and, using surprise, should be able to do so without difficulty. HIn any case, the distance of the Falkland Islands from the Argentine mainland is Hsuch that S.55 helicopters would be operating at extreme range and with an Hinsignificant pay-load. H7. We therefore consider that the supply of helicopters to Argentina and HChile would have no significant strategic implication. We wish to emphasise, Hhowever, that we have not taken into account the effect on British prestige of the H^^^B                  possible use of these aircraft to our disadvantage in Antarctica. H^^^H                  Recommendation H8. We recommend that the Minister of Defence should inform the Cabinet Hthat the supply of helicopters to Argentina and Chile has no significant strategic H^^^fl                  implication, provided that the possibility of these aircraft being used to our HVfffl                  disadvantage in the Antarctic is politically acceptable.
