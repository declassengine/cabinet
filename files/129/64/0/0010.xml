Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1953SECRETC. (53) 31013th November, 1953.CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICES: REPORT OF THEDROGHEDA committee memorandum by the Lord Privy seal i am in some difficulty in this matter. A Committee of Junior Ministers have considered it and have produced a memorandum to which the Foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary have given their assent (circulated as C. (53) 305). TheCommonwealth Secretary has, however, not seen it, and to judge from his memo -randum C. (53) 260, he may well not wish to approve all its recommendations,though they have been agreed at the departmental level so that the parliamentary under-Secretary of State has felt able to sign it.2. I feel I must reserve Lord Swinton&apos;s position rather than try and reconcilethis memorandum with what I think may be in his mind which, however, mayhave changed as a result of what he has seen and heard on his tour.3. But I am sure that Lord Swinton would wish the attention of his colleagues to be drawn to the fact that the Drogheda Committee were not called upon todeal with the all-important question of priorities in information activities andexpenditure on a global basis. They have dealt with the needs, as they saw them,area by area, but they have not indicated, within the framework of their recom-mendations, what areas or what media should have first call on any additional provision for information expenditure which the Cabinet may feel able to authorise.4. The Committee have drawn special attention to the need for increasedinformation staff and services in the &quot; new &quot; Commonwealth, with which I feel sure Lord Swinton would agree in principle. He has already recommended thatthe British Council representation in Australia and New Zealand should be closed down and that Information activities in these countries should correspondingly beincreased. But I think he would also feel that some expansion in the older Common-wealth countries, particularly Canada and Australia, to which the Committee havealso made special reference, will be called for at an early date.5. The proposal of the Overseas Departments to spread the drogheda committee&apos;s recommendations over a five-year programme would mean that theCommonwealth Relations Office Vote in 1954-55 would only be increased by approximately  30,000 (i.e., 10 per cent, of current expenditure, exclusive of the element of rising costs). This would do no more in essence than enable theCommonwealth Relations Office to open up one regional office in Canada, toprovide for some small strengthening of the establishment in Australia and to reinforce certain other Commonwealth Information posts.6. Lord Swinton would, I am sure, wish his colleagues to take note that themodest expansion proposed for the Commonwealth Information Services falls far short of the recommendations in the Drogheda Committee Report and of what isrequired to meet the immediate needs and responsibilities of the commonwealth relations Office.7. I feel compelled to recommend that consideration of the whole problem,so far as the Commonwealth Relations Office Information Services are concerned,be deferred until the return of the Secretary of State.H. C.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,4th November, 1953.Copy No.6645120
