(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER! Y-OF-HKR BRITANNIC -MA JEST-Y-&apos;-S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 329 COPY NO^21st NOVEMBER, 1953.CABINET4f;&quot;,british HONDURASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the New ConstitutionEarly in 1953 Her Majesty&apos;s Government approved the introductionof a new constitution in British Honduras, based on the recommendations of aCommittee appointed in 1947 and consisting solely of local persons of moderate opinion.   This provides for:-(i) Universal adult suffrage.(ii) A Legislative Council of 9 elected members and 6 ex officioand nominated members.(iii) An Executive Council, which is to be the principal instrument of policy, of 5 official and nominated members and 4 elected members.(iv) The delegation by administrative arrangement of responsibilityfor particular departments to unofficial members in theExecutive Council.(v) Reserve powers enabling the Governor to take executive actionagainst the advice of his Executive Council and to put throughlegislation against that advice, when he considers it expedientin the interests of good government.2. Elections are due to be held under the new constitution about the endof next March.Comparison with 3ritish Guiana3. The present situation in the Colony has, however, certain unwelcomesimilarities to that in British Guiana.   There is in British Honduras only oneproperly organised party (the Peoplels United Party (P.U.P.)),   This has a close connection with the main trade union (the General Workers&apos; Union) which isrun by the same leaders.   The party, which aims at complete independence, isviolently anti-British and though it has no known affiliations with internationalCommunist organisations it is suspected of being supported financially and otherwise by the Guatemalan Government.   The latter, which is generally regarded as Communist, has for many years pressed a claim to british honduras, but has recently shown signs of changing its tactics and substitutingits support for an independent state when it suits it to do so.4. There are, however, differences from the situation in British
Guiana, most of which are favourable.   In British Honduras the population(which is only some 71,000) is more divided geographically, local sentiment beingstrong, so that it is more difficult for a single party of achieve domination.There is also a strong Roman Catholic influence which, although inclined tobe anti-British, is strongly opposed to anything savouring of Communism.   TheGovernor&apos;s opinion, which is shared by the Minister of State for Colonial Affairswho has recently visited the Colony, is that there will be no more than a partial P.U.P. victory which will be insufficient for an overall majority in theLegislative Council,   We cannot, however, rely on this and a difficult and possiblydangerous situation would be created if the P.U.P. won a complete victory atthe forthcoming elections.   There is no power to legislate for theColony by Order in Council but   it is proposed in the local ordinance providingfor the new Constitution to give the Governor power to make regulations in anemergency,5. On the other hand even if the P.U.P. win all the seats, they will only have a small majority in the Legislative Council, and unlike British Guiana willbe in a minority in Executive Council,   Further, the arrangements for givingdepartmental responsibility to some elected members on Executive Councildo not rest on legislation.   These responsibilities would be allocated to individualsat the Governor&apos;s discretion and could be withdrawn by him without a breach ofthe constitution.   Further, although elected members could normally only beremoved from the Executive Council by vote of the Legislature, the Governor has power to remove them in certain circumstances with the consent of ExecutiveCouncil on which the elected members themselves are in a minority.6, Finally, one company of United Kingdom troops has for some time past been stationed in the Colony.   They should be an adequate insurance against any collapse of the morale of the police in the face of any attempts at subversion.Possible Deferment7, I have considered whether in view of the events in british guiana the constitutional changes in British Honduras ought to be deferred,either for a period, or for a further enquiry by an outside body.   The arguments in favour of doing so are strong:-(a) Economically the Colony needs firm government, capital from outside and enterprise if it is to improve its standard ofliving and get away from its present dependence on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment,   An enquiry in the light of events in British Guianamight help to ensure that our plans for constitutional advanceare sound,(b) The dangers of interference by Guatemala either directly or through a party which it may be financing cannot be ignored,8. The counter-arguments are, however, in my view even stronger:-(a) The Governor has reported (in the attached telegram) thatdeferment would be disastrous in its effect in the Colony andwould strengthen the P.U.P,(b) Deferment would undoubtedly have most unfortunate repercussionsthroughout the Colonial Empire, in particular in the West Indies,We should be suspected of having changed our liberal policyand that would lose us the valuable support we have had,
especially from West Indian labour leaders, for our actionin British Guiana.   In all our statements about the suspension of the British Guiana constitution, we made it clear that this action was in no way to be taken as an indication that we weredeparting from our liberal policy of encouraging politicaladvance in Colonial territories.   This was affirmed in thefirst statement issued by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and inmy speech in the House on 22nd October I said:-&quot;Let us remember that in other West Indian Coloniesdemocratic government is becoming more frimly established and is looking to still wider horizons.  none of the millions in the Colonial Territories need have anyfear that the setback in British Guiana will lead us to reverse our policy. &quot;This theme has been reaffirmed on other occasions.   Iconsider therefore that we are publicly committed since there have been no recent developments in British Hondurasitself which would enable us to withdraw without a breach of faith.conclusion, I therefore propose that we should allow the new constitution tocome into force in the spring of next year.O.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.20th November, 1953.APPEND DCTELEGRAM DATED 24th OCTOBER, 1953, FROMTHE GOVERNOR OF BRITISH HONDURAS TO THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.New Constitution.I note with regret that legal Instruments will be antedated.I am strongly opposed to any deferment of constitutional plans.There is little change in assessment of chances at the elections.If anything, there is a slight improvement.   P.U.P. has lost some roman catholic support by a too obvious attempt to gain control of the Co-operative movement.   Candidates opposed to the P.U.P. are beginning to bestir themselves and look like having a reasonable chance in at least four electorates if votesare not split.The situation is not (repeat not) parallel with British Guiana asthe winning party would not wield same power. There will be a nominated and official majority on the Executive Council and any association of its members
with administration will not (repeat not) involve Ministerial powers.Administration will therefore remain under my direct control.   However muchthey are assisting Communist aims, P.U.P. depend largely on the roman catholic support and could not risk proof that they had direct Communistconnections.   If they cannot get their own way they will probably try to frustrate thenormal business of Government by blocking Finance Bills etc., but leaders haveneither  education nor organising powers of P.P.P. leaders.   They must win aminimum of eight seats to obtain a majority in the Legislative Council and, ifcontinuing efforts to organise opposition are successful, I do not think that theywill do this.   My answer to (b) in your telegram is therefore &quot;yes&quot;.Any withholding of the Constitution for any purpose would be disastrous in its effect on all opinion in the country except small group ofdie-hards.   Repercussions in Central America and among other interested anti-Colonialist powers would be unfortunate.   Guatemala would exploit it.   It would strengthen P.U.P. and the G.W.U. would be likely to call for protest strikes.Reactions in other emergent Colonies would, I suppose, be equallyunfortunate.I am sure that we must go through with the elections at earliestpossible date.   The earlier the better when British Guiana lessons are freshin people&apos;s minds.   We cannot afford NOT to take the risk, and I thinkodds are in our favour of no more than a partial P.U.P, victory, i. e.insufficient for a majority.   If about two thousand pounds sterling could be foundto help the opposition I should have no doubt.   Thereafter I would expect the more moderate elected P.U.P. supporters could be taught to be reasonable so thatunrelenting opposition of extremists would stimulate rather than hamper good government.
