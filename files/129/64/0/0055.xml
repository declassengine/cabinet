Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRETC. (53) 35516th December, 1953CIVIL SUPPLY 1954-55Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am much concerned about the prospect for civil supply expenditure nextyear. Forecasts of civil expenditure made in July last indicated an increase of 121 millions in 1954-55 over the original Estimates for the current year. TheEstimates as at 1st December have now been received and show an increase over1953-54 original Estimates of  138 millions. This is in addition to a net increaseof nearly  70 millions which is to be expected on the. Defence Programme.2. On 7th October I wrote to my colleagues and asked them to carry out an immediate review of all possible major economies and let me have their pro-posals. Frankly, the response has in general been very disappointing to me. I donot underestimate the difficulty of changing policies or slowing down activities, andI realise that in certain fields (e.g., salaries) increases are more or less automaticor inevitable. I feel, however, that there has been a tendency to let things run on as they are rather than face the possible embarrassment of changing them. Atany rate the overall outcome of the review has not so far contributed anythingtowards easing my budgetary problems; indeed, as the Estimates figures I havequoted show, the position has worsened.3. I cannot in the course of this paper take up particular issues with mycolleagues: I shall wish to discuss them separately. But I am most anxious that all should be aware of the general situation as a background to these particular dis-cussions and that, in conducting them, I should be assured of the general supportof the Cabinet for my efforts to achieve economies.4. There are some issues to which I am sure it would be useful to refer atthis stage.Food Subsidies5. I am most grateful to the Minister of Food for the way in which since we came into office he has helped me in reducing the cost of the food subsidies.These have made the major contribution to economy in the last two Budgets. TheCabinet on 13th October (C.C. (53) 57th Conclusions, Minute 7) decided that steps should be taken to ensure that the total of the food subsidies, which was running at a figure considerably above that provided in the Budget, should be reducedto a rate of  220 millions by the end of this financial year. The timing of theintroduction of the necessary increases in price was left for separate consideration,and in the result, mainly because of the Minister of Labour&apos;s reluctance to agreeto anything which would increase the cost-of-living figure at a time, when decisions were about to be taken on the claims of engineering workers, these increases willnot be put into force until sometime in the New Year; in C. (53) 350 the Ministerof Food has suggested that the operative date should be 21st February.6. As the Minister^ paper explains, it appears that the price increases decided upon in October will not now suffice to bring the rate down to the total of 220 millions; increases in the price of pork and in the price of either milk or45372-i E G O R D C O P YCopy No. f2CABINET
bread (the Minister favours the latter) will be required to achieve this result. during next year, in the absence of major decisions on milk and bread, the subsidy rate would rise to about  290 millions, and, as the Ministers paper makes clear, thescope for controlling what we have up to now called the &quot; food subsidies &quot; is becoming greatly limited by the extension of de-control of food-stuffs, the subsidies are to a great extent ceasing to be consumer subsidies and are becomingsubsidies to agricultural producers which, unless we are willing and able to restrict imports, can be limited only by the prices we fix at the Annual Reviews under theAgricultural Act, 1947. (Although the amount at stake is relatively small, the marked increase in the cost of subsidising the fishing industry part of which is included in the &quot; food subsidy &quot; total is a matter of great concern.) Indeed, theonly remaining consumer subsidies in 1954-55 will be those on bread and milk(which will amount to  44 millions and  45 millions respectively, apart from 47 millions for welfare schemes). I should wish to reserve major decisions aboutthe food subsidies until the over-all budgetary prospect for 1954-55 becomes clearer;but I do not think it will be possible for us to avoid taking major decisions aboutbread and milk before the next Budget.Strategic Reserves7. The department proposals for expenditure on strategic reserves amountto  79 millions; this is  27 millions more than last year. The Estimates are com-plicated by provision for transfer from trading stock in both years, but even ifthis element is left out of account, the increase proposed is  18 millions. I do notthink we can afford this increase. Indeed, I must ask for a reduction and I shallbe making proposals on this subject to the Ministers concerned.Civil Defence8. Present civil defence planning has been on a basis of a three-year pro-gramme costing  210 millions (including some non-Exchequer payments) to becompleted in the three years 1953-56. Exchequer expenditure (partly met out ofloan) in 1953-54 seems unlikely to exceed  60 millions and, in consequence, Depart-ments were planning to increase this figure substantially in 1954-55 (the second year). I do not think we can afford to spend more next year than  60 millions,nor do I think it would be right to do so until we know the outcome of the review which is being conducted by officials into the problem of civil preparation againstatomic war. I have, therefore, asked that Departments should frame their Estimateson the basis that no fresh commitments should be entered into pending the resultsof the investigation mentioned and that the total of Exchequer expenditure by civil departments on defence preparations should not exceed  60 millions. I hopemy colleagues concerned with this matter will co-operate in observing this limit.Housing9. This isr a most difficult matter. The burden of housing on the taxpayernext year will amount in all to some  80 millions.. The new &quot; patching &quot; subsidywill, of course, add to this load. There is a clear case for a reduction in the subsidies next year on account of the reduction in the rate of interest on loans from the Public Works Loan Board, but, apart from this point, we did refer in theWhite Paper on Houses to &quot; the ever-growing burden of housing subsidies which,in the interest of the general body of taxpayers, cannot continue indefinitely atthe present rate.&quot; I know that the Minister of Housing and Loval Governmentis giving close attention to this matter. While little or no saving would arise in1954-55, I must ask that he and the Secretary of State for Scotland will make proposals providing for substantial relief to the Exchequer over and above the relatively small savings which would result from bringing the subsidy into line with the Public Works Loan Board rate. I hope also that the Minister will beable to bring forward proposals to reduce progressively the expenditure onrequisitioned houses.Education10. The Education Estimates show a rise of  17 millions before providingfor the improvement in teachers&apos; salaries recommended by the Burnham Com-mittee. This latter will, if accepted^ itself increase the Education Votes by afurther  7^ millions. It becomes all the more necessary, therefore, to press theproposal to increase the rate of contribution by education authorities and teachers
to the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Fund. This would save the Exchequer some 2-\ millions. I am in communication with the Minister of Education and theSecretary of State for Scotland on this question, and I hope that my colleaguesgenerally will agree to the very early legislation necessary to give effect to thechange. I have also made some other suggestions as to possible economies in educational expenditure.Civil Service Staff Numbers1.1. So far we have done quite well in this field, and the total of the CivilService was reduced by nearly 28,000 between 1st January, 1952, and 1st October,1953.12. The Ministry of Food expect to be able to make a large reduction of staffby the summer of 1954. But, apart from this, the forecasts given by Departmentsshow that they expect to make very little reduction in staffs over the next 12 months.Indeed there is a risk that the total staff of the Civil Service will begin to rise again,more particularly if the staffs of some of the Defence Departments are allowed toincrease as they forecast.13. This tendency can only be counteracted in two ways: first, if furtherpolicy decisions are reached which involve dropping activities; secondly, by con-tinued attention in all Departments to making administrative economies wherever possible. I must ask my colleagues to see to it that both these points receive theutmost attention in their Departments.General14. Paragraphs 5 to 10 indicate the main fields in which we must seekreductions (or avoid increases) in the Estimates. But the prospect for next year&apos;s  such that I must pursue all possible opportunities of economy. I cannot feelthat my colleagues have fully grasped the seriousness of the situation. On all sides defence, agriculture and food, atomic research and development, housing,education and others I am faced with the prospect of rising expenditure. In sucha situation the acceptance of new or deliberately increased commitments isunthinkable unless corresponding savings are made. Nonchalance about expendi-ture will not do: my colleagues must face the reality that unless we economise inall fields we shall fail to achieve the objectives which we as a Government have setfor ourselves, namely, to reduce burdens on industry and the taxpayer.R.
