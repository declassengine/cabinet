Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRETC. (53) 34812th December, 1953CABINETRELATIONS WITH india memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached record made bythe United Kingdom High Commissioner in New Delhi of my talks with certain members of the Indian Government.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1953.I accompanied the Secretary of State on the 17th November, when he paidcalls on the Minister of Commerce (Mr. T. T. Krishnamachari), the Minister ofFinance (Mr. C. D. Deshmukh), and the Minister of Education (Mr. M. Azad).The following are the main points which emerged:  Mr. T. T. KrishnarrtachariThe Secretary of State opened the conversation by referring to japanese competition and the recent discussions in regard to Japan and the G.A.T.T. he explained that we had considered it essential to retain a free hand and hoped that india would do likewise. Mr. Krishnamachari fully agreed and said that Indianinterests were identical with ours, but naturally they had some inhibitions in expressing them publicly in relation to an Asian country. India, however, fully supported us in our attitude, and it was his object also to retain as free a hand aspossible.Mr. Krishnamachari said that he, too, was very distrustful of Japanesemethods. The line he had taken in his Department was &quot; we know and are usedto United Kingdom methods of doing business, but they haven&apos;t got the money;the Americans have got the money but we don&apos;t know their ways; why should weturn to a country which has not got the money and whose ways are strange to us as well? &quot;Mr. Krishnamachari added that all the same Japan was likely to get some important markets, e.g., Pakistan, Indonesia and also in Burma. The fact had tobe faced that in the case of Japan the cost factor was of little or no account. this made matters very difficult in relation to India which, like the United Kingdom,had a free economy.Turning to India&apos;s economic position, Mr. Krishnamachari said that thecountry was doing reasonably well both internally and in its overseas trade. the biggest worry at the moment was the fact that each year there were 1 - 4 million new entrants into the employment market. This was much more than industry couldabsorb. The emphasis in the Five-Year Plan was very much on agricultural development, but agricultural expansion could not by itself afford much help to industry except through gradually increased consumption of the agricultural population. How then to cater for the 1-4 million coming each year into theemployment market remained a very serious problem.45339&apos; - W$REGOHl)&apos;copy copy No;     ^
la reply to Lord Swinton&apos;s questions regarding the role of British enterprise,Mr. Krishnamachari said it was his Governments view that British enterprise andmanaging agencies were needed in this country, in India&apos;s own interests, particularly for maintaining standards and giving continuity of development. Tfre Govern-ment&apos;s policy in regard to this had been worked out by the Minister of Finance and -himself, with the Prime Ministers approval. In brief it was the assurance ofnational treatment, subject only to the acceptance of national obligations. He had set this out in his speech to the Associated Chambers of Commerce last year, andhe could assure Lord Swinton that this was a fixed policy in which there would, beno change. There was naturally a desire that British undertakings should employas many Indians as possible, but there was no intention on the part of the Govern-ment to interfere and lay down percentages as had been done in certain othercountries. On the contrary, it was the policy to leave progress in this field to thegood sense of the firms concerned. It was fully agreed that British firms would need to be permanently assured of British control and will desire to have perman-ently a Britisher at the top. This meant that there must be a continuous leaveningof British recruits who could be trained up to take their places in the highermanagerial grades. He was quite prepared for this process to continue, but at thesame time Indians in our mutual interests must be given increasing opportunities.He was happy to say that he enjoyed very good relations with the AssociatedChambers of Commerce, whose Chairmen were in constant touch with him. Inthis connection he paid a special tribute to Mr. Pakes, the present Chairman, and tohis predecessor Sir Charles Innes, and said that as a result of his various talks withthem full understanding had now been established and matters were, he thought,going very smoothly.In conclusion, Mr. Krishnamachari referred to the dangers of disinvestmentand said that he was worried not so much by the prospect of British firms stayingas of their withdrawing. There had recently been some awkward cases where,through firms selling out, undertakings had got into the wrong hands. The Secretaryof State and I assured him in reply that there was no question of any deliberatewithdrawal but the effects of death duties in the United Kingdom and the high rateof taxation generally sometimes led to enforced sales of shares, which the companies concerned could not themselves absorb. Mr. Krishnamachari said he understoodthis but the issue was a live one and he was considering now, with the Ministerof Finance, whether means could not be found whereby the Government of india could help to ensure continuity. It had occurred to him, for example, that theymight,lay down that on an enforced sale it should be compulsory for the sharesto be offered, in the first instance, to the company itself in order to avoid anychange in Directors. There might be difficulties in this but it was so clearly to thegeneral interest that there should be continuity that he hoped that some effectivesafeguard on these lines could be devised.Mr. C. D. DeShmukhMr. Deshmukh confirmed that the Indian economy was doing well and thatthere was every reason to be satisfied with the results to date. The balance ofpayments was a little better than expected. The figures had recently been sentto London and he was much looking forward to the Sydney meeting and tocomparing notes again with the Chancellor. The food situation in India was much improved. There had been good rains and a good harvest throughout the country.He had recently received a, tentative offer of one million tons of United States wheat which could be held as an insurance and this was now under consideration.The agricultural part of the Five-Year Plan was, he thought, pretty well upto date except for community projects which had tended to lag behind owing to lackof trained personnel. As regards the Five-Year Plan generally, the weakest elementat present was transport. This was considerably behind-hand owing chiefly to thedifficulties experienced in obtaining delivery of locomotives and wagons. Prospectswere now improved, but he thought it would take some two or three years to getthis part of the Plan up to schedule. Further large orders had recently been placed for locomotives and these, after open tender, had gone to Germany, Austria and japan. Unfortunately, United Kingdom prices had been higher. So far as he knew no credits,had been granted by the supplying countries, nor had any beenneeded or asked for, it had been a matter of straight competition.Some discussion ensued on the question of world trade and the prospect of getting the United States Government to move towards reduction of their tariffs.It was agreed that there was no early prospect of this and that perhaps the best
Ml25th November, 1953.hope for the present lay in the simplification of customs procedure. On the ques-tion of the United States and G.A.T.T., Mr. Deshmukh agreed with Lord Swinton&apos;view that the United States were not very safe partners, since they were very apt,while urging others to adhere to the rules, to beak the rules themselves when itsuited them to do so. On the other hand, the United States were so enormouslynecessary to us that we could not afford to fall out with them on this account.In reply to Lord Swinton&apos;s questions on the future of British enterprise,Mr. Deshmukh spoke on much the same lines as the Minister of Commerce. Britishenterprise was definitely needed in India and could be assured of a&apos; square deal.He had a very good understanding, with the Minister of Commerce, and the policy adopted which he thought had been admitted on all sides to be a very fair one, hadbeen worked out in consultation with him. ,.This policy had the agreement and support of Mr. Nehru, though he admitted that Mr. Nehru was a man &quot; whosejudgment was sometimes swayed by a temporary factor.&quot; However, the Ministerof Commerce himself could be relied upon to ensure that the present policy was continued.Mr. M. AzadThis was purely a courtesy call, Mr. Azad speaking, as usual, through an inter -preter. It was, however, made interesting by a moving tribute which the Ministerpaid to Britain and to the British connection. The settlement with Britain, he said,was without parallel in history and had been marked by the greatest magnanimityon both sides. Although it had been put through by the Labour Party, he fully realised that no single political party in Britain could have initiated and carried through such a settlement, involving such tremendous implications, unless the motives and ideals underlying it had been shared by the British people as a whole.In other words the settlement was in the true British spirit and was an historic actfor which not only India but the whole world owed gratitude. As a result, theformer feelings of bitterness had entirely disappeared and had been replaced bygenuine friendliness throughout the country. This had made it more abundantly clear than ever that it was in Indian interests to remain in the Commonwealth andhe felt that this was now fully recognised and appreciated by all shades of political opinion (apart, of course, from the extreme Left who did not count).P.
