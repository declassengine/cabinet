confidential.(53) 33327TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINETAIR POLLUTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Minister for Welsh affairs my colleagues and I have considered the report of the BeaverCommittee on Air Pollution and the question of what statement of government policy can be made simultaneously with its publication.2.        We recommend that the report should be presented to the House ofCommons as a White Paper on Wednesday, 2nd December, and madeavailable to the Press on the same day for publication on the following day.3.       Annex A to this memorandum contains the draft of a short statement,summarising what has been done already to abate air pollution and its effects, and what can be done in the immediate future.    We recommend thata statement on these lines should be made in the House of Commons, onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, on the same day as the Beaver report is laid before the House.    The statement should be made by the Minister of housing and Local Government, since of the three Ministers to whom theBeaver report was presented (the Secretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Housing and the Minister of Fuel and Power), he is the onechiefly concerned.    Annex B contains a draft of a statement which it isproposed to issue to the Press for their guidance.4.        The present report by the Beaver Committee is only an interimone, suggesting certain palliative measures, and that Committee proposesto go into the long-term problem of air pollution much more fully anddeeply.    This however will take time, and a further report cannot beexpected from the Beaver Committee for nearly a year.    &quot;We cannot restfor so long on the statement which it is proposed to make to-morrow onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and people will expect, with some justification, that the Government should announce some further activity(what one might call a middle-term policy) before a year is up.    Onepositive thing which can be done is to encourage the use of smokeless fuelsin the home, but this implies the installation of modern-type grates capableof burning these fuels.    Such grates can help our coal exports by burningthe kind of coal which is not suitable for export; and they can help to abatethe &quot;smog&quot; nuisance by burning smokeless fuels, such as coke, which isnow plentiful.    But these grates cost money.    There is a statutory powerto proclaim smokeless zones in the great cities; but before this can bedone in a residential area, we should have to ensure that every house in ithas one of the modern grates.    It would be difficult to make such expenditure by the householder compulsory, and the possibility of a subsidy to encourage their installation, or some other form of assistance, is being investigated.    The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the/ iCOPY NO.  hi
Minister of Fuel and Power have agreed to consider together the problem of stimulating the domestic use of smokeless fuels and to present their findingsin a paper for the Coal Committee, in the same context as the whole questionof the country1 s coal supplies and exports.    We should aim at making afurther public statement on this matter in about three months&quot; time.5.        We have considered whether there would be any advantage in announcing the appointment of a Ministerial Committee in order to suggest to the public that the Government is doing something about a matter which,with the help of the Press, has very much caught their imagination.    Onthe whole, however, we think it best not to announce publicly the appoint-ment of such a Committee;  it is against normal practice to announce theexistence or constitution of Cabinet Committees and, if we did so in this case, it would almost certainly lead people to expect too much in the wayof results and would provoke a spate of questions.    We do not think thatthere is any need for a special inter-departmental organisation to follow up the Beaver Committee^ recommendations;  this should be theresponsibility of the Departments concerned, who will consult together as necessary.D.M. F.Home Office, S.W.1,.26TH NOVEMBER, 1953.
ANNEX AAIR POLLUTIONDraft Government statement the interim report of the Committee on Air Pollution is being published to-day, and the Government have given it careful consideration.2.       As the Committee point out, the problem of air pollution, and ofsmoke in particular, has been the subject of much study and research overmany years.    A large volume of technical knowledge is available.    Amongthe measures taken in recent years to reduce smoke mention may be madeof the development of domestic heating appliances, including improvedtypes of open fires, which will burn smokeless fuel efficiently and well.These improved appliances have been installed in all local authority houses built since 1948, and, for this winter, the domestic allocation of coke hasbeen increased from if to 2 tons.    The Ministry of Fuel and Power have provided a fuel efficiency advisory service to industry, and have madeavailable special loan facilities to industry for the installation of fuelsaving equipment.    Also, statutory powers to establish &quot;smokeless zones&quot;have been conferred on a number of local authorities.3.        As the Committee emphasise, it must be accepted that the completecure of pollution, if indeed it ever be attainable, is bound to take many years.Although means of averting some of the worst evils are within reach, themain question is one of balancing the cost and inconvenience of enforcinga more efficient and scientific use of our fuels against all the advantages to be obtained in health, convenience and economy from a clear atmosphere.The Committee are now embarking on a detailed examination   of the manypractical difficulties involved.    The Government for their part will continueto give the problems their earnest attention.4.        The &quot;smog&quot; which covered Greater London for five days, 5th to9th December, 1952, was of exceptional density and duration.    Nevertheless,similar conditions may recur in London or in other towns.    As a matterof immediate concern the Committee have, therefore, considered whatprecautions might be taken to avoid during the coming winters the worsteffects of &quot;smog&quot;.    On 17th November, before the report was submitted,doctors were authorised to prescribe masks under the National health service for patients suffering from heart or lung disease living or working in an area where smoke-polluted fog is likely to occur.    It willbe for the doctor to judge whether a mask would be advisable in any suchcase.    But it must be admitted that no measures that can very substantiallychange the present position can be put into effect in the near future.    Never-theless,  it is possible to secure some reduction of the amount of smokethat is discharged into the atmosphere.    The Government endorse the viewthat this is a matter for everyone who uses or controls the use of fuels;everyone has both a duty and an opportunity.5.        Following the Committee^ recommendations, the Government havealready arranged for the Meteorological Office to issue through the usual channels warnings when serious fog is expected to prevail for at least24 hours in areas of normally high pollution.    These fog warnings will be accompanied by advice to the public about the ways in which they can help to reduce smog and its ill effects.
6.       The Cornmittee,s report stresses the fact that the largest singleproducer of smoke is the domestic consumer and the following advice isbased on their recommendations.Householders in large towns who are dependent on solid fuel and who normally burn coal should at once lay in a stock of, say, onehundredweight  of coke or other smokeless fuel for use in periods ofpersistent fog.    A mixture of coke and coal will burn reasonably welland will greatly reduce smoke.    Stocks of coke at gas works are high and supplies are readily available for the reserve hundredweight to be kept in readiness by those who normally burn coal.    Those already burningcoke will benefit from the increase of half-a-ton in the coke allocation(from if to 2 tons) recently announced by the Minister of Fuel and Power.When persistent fog is forecast:-(1)     Householders who can use only coal should take special care not to make more smoke than can be helped; fires should not be banked up at night.(2)     Those who can use smokeless fuels should confinethemselves to those fuels during periods of fog.(3)     Rubbish should not be burnt nor bonfires lit whilethe fog lasts.(4)     Elderly people and those suffering from chronicheart or lung conditions might be helped by wearinga mask or scarf wrapped round the mouth and noseif they must go out in a fog.    (As previously stated,masks can be prescribed under the National health service for people suffering from heart or lungdisease).    Healthy people are not exposed to thesame risks but may also find it helpful to wear ascarf round the mouth and nose,(5)     The general public should refrain from bringingmotor vehicles into densely-populated areas,7,      The report states that smoke-control measures in industry,shops, offices, and hotels etc. should be brought up to peak efficiencyat once and checked at frequent intervals throughout the winter.Special efforts should be made to prevent smoke when stoking.    Much ofthe smoke from factory furnaces can be prevented and it is theresponsibility of managements, particularly in times of fog, to see thatsmoke is kept to the minimum.    Managers of industrial plants, hospitals,offices and other establishments should keep a special check to ensurethat dark smoke is not emitted from their chimneys either by night orday and particularly in the early morning.    This check can best be madeby the installation of a simple smoke-density indicator.    The reportcontains drawings of simple devices which can be made up cheaply bymost small works.    Copies of these drawings can be obtained from theMinistry of Housing and Local Government and from the Department ofHealth for Scotland,    The Fuel Engineers of the Ministry of Fuel and power are working in co-operation with the Inspectors of the localauthorities in a special drive to bring home to managements the importanceof fuel efficiency in the interests of smoke abatement.   Full use shouldbe made of these services by any business in doubt as to its proper course.
All these measures together, if conscientiously carried through, will help to alleviate and reduce the injury which might be doneby another series of &quot;smogs&quot; this winter.    It may be difficult to resistindulging ourselves in the traditional coal fire, especially at Christmastime, but the task will be made more easy by the reflection that it is the domestic consumer who is mainly responsible in certain conditions forthe production of smog and that self-denial in this matter when a warning has been issued will help to reduce the toll of loss caused bythis self-inflicted danger.The Government are studying further steps which might betaken to ensure their application and make them more effective, whileawaiting the next report of the Beaver Committee.
2 o\  Interim Report of the Committee on Air Pollution, Cmd. No.H.M.S.O.   Price.......The extent to which the Government have accepted the recommendationsof the Committee is indicated in the statement made today in theHouse of Commons by the Minister of Housing and Local Government.DRAFT PRESS NOTICEB.3.C, to Issue Fog WarningsAdvice to Public on &quot;Anti-Smog&quot; MeasuresHalf the Smoke comes from Home FiresInterim Report by the Committee on Air PollutionThe Interim Report is published today of the Committee on air Pollution.The report makes it clear that there is no quick or easy way of abolishing air pollution, but it stresses that practicable means ofarresting at least the worst evils of pollution by smoke and grit are within reach.Although the report says that the fog conditions from 5th to9th December last year were exceptional, it recommends the following main precautions to be taken immediately:-(1)     Warnings to be issued by the Meteorological Officethrough appropriate channels, and in particular theB.3.C., of areas of normally high pollution in whichserious fog is expected to persist for at least 24 hours.(2)    Advice to the public and industry on what action they can take to alleviate &quot;smog&quot; and its effects.    Nearly halfthe smoke comes from house chimneys and about an equal amount from industry.The householdersThe Committee urges that householders in large towns v/ho are dependent on solid fuel and who normally burn coal should lay in a stock of, say, a hundredweight of coke or other smokeless fuel for use inperiods of persistent fog0    A mixture of coke and coal will burnreasonably well and will greatly reduce smoke.    When persistent fogis f ore cast:-(1)     Householders who can use only coal should take special care not to make more smoke than canbe helped.    Fires should not be banked up at night,(2)     Those who can use smokeless fuels should confinethemselves to those fuels during periods of fog,(3)     Rubbish should not be burnt nor bonfires lit whilethe fog lasts.
(4)     The general public should refrain from bringingmotor vehicles into densely-populated areas;and in serious fog drivers of all vehicles shouldswitch off their engines whenever traffic isstationary.(5)     Less &quot;smog&quot; will find its way indoors, and roomswill be kept warmer, if draughts can be prevented.(6)     Elderly people and those suffering from chronicchest and heart conditions would be well advised tokeep indoors and to rest as much as they can if thefog is very thick.    If they must go out they will find that a closely-fitting simple gauze mask, or even awoollen scarf wrapped round the mouth and nose willgive some relief by filtering out some at least of thesolid contents of &quot;smog&quot;.IndustryRegarding industry the Committee recommend that:-(1)     Smoke-control measures in factories, shops, offices,hotels, etc., should be brought up to peak efficiency atonce and checked at frequent intervals throughout thewinter.(2)     Special efforts should be made to prevent heavy smoke whenstoking.    Much of the smoke from factory furnaces canbe prevented, and it is the responsibility of managements,XJarticularly in times of fog, to see that smoke is kept tothe minimum.(3)     Managers of industrial plants, public utility undertakings and establishments such as hospitals, institutions, offices and laundries, should institute a special continuous checkto ensure that dark smoke is not emitted from theirchimneys either by day or by night, and, particularly,during the early morning before daybreak.    This checkcan best be made by the installation of a simple smoke-density indicator.    The report contains drawings ofsimple devices which can be made up cheaply by mostsmall works, copies of which can be had from theMinistry of Housing and Local Government and department of Health for Scotland.The AuthoritiesIn addition to the fog warning system, the authorities are advised to make every effort to provide adequate supplies of smokelessfuels to domestic consumers in London and other densely populated areasliable to bad fog during the winter, so that they may, at least, lay ina small stock for use when fog is developing.The appropriate authorities are urged to bring home to the-public in areas liable to &quot;smog&quot; the fact that the largest single producer of smoke is the domestic consumer and that every individual can help toreduce the risk of smoke.
Fuller and more frequent measurements of pollution are recommended, especially during severe &quot;smogs&quot;, in order to determine the peak concentrations reached.    Local authorities can do most valuableservice in this respect.Effective Action Stage by stage the Interim Report is divided into two parts.    Part Isummarises the facts and the problem, and gives recommendations forimmediate action.    Part II is a more detailed and more technical survey of the problem of air pollution.    The field of enquiry is indicated and existing measures of amelioration or of control are described.&quot;To deal fully with all the factors so as to make positiverecommendations will inevitably take time&quot;, say the Committee.&quot;But that does not prevent ameliorative action being taken effectively andprogressively stage by stage.    To that end, and in order to put the whole matter into proper perspective, we think it desirable to submit an interimreport forthwith at this stage of our enquiry&quot;.The causes and remedies of pollution by smoke are known, say the Committee.    The problem is one of practicability and economics, andof the education of the whole community.    &quot;Complete cure for both solidand gaseous pollution, if indeed it be ever attainable, is bound to takemany years, but means of averting at least the worst evils of air pollutionby smoke and grit are within practicable reach.    It is simply a questionof balancing the cost and inconvenience of enforcing a more efficient and scientific use of our fuels against all the advantages to be obtained in health, convenience and economy from a clear atmosphere.    this problem, with all that is involved in a real attack on the menace of airpollution, is one which must be faced&quot;.Medical experience leaves no doubt that whilst the clean whitefogs to which this sea-girt island is inevitably prone may haveuncomfortable effects on people in certain states of health, the harmfuland dangerous &quot;smog&quot; occurs only when smoke and oxides of sulphur and perhaps other deleterious substances are present in the fog in quantity.Health suffers wherever &quot;smog&quot; is prevalent even in the absence of fogor mist, but it is their combination that does real harm.On the material side, it is known that vast damage to metals and building materials results from the corrosive sulphur acids, formed fromthe sulphur in fuels.    The total cost to the community may be more than 100 millions a year, apart from the cost of wasted fuel which smokerepresents.Both medical opinion and chemical investigation indicate thatthe deleterious effects of the oxides of sulphur, formed by combustion,are greatly enhanced by the presence of smoke particles, formed byincomplete combustion, and the Committee conclude therefore that thefirst objective should be to prevent the emission of coal smoke and oilsmoke, and of grit.
The home fire the biggest smoke producerThe home fire is named as the biggest smoke producer.&quot;The householder himself creates much, and in some areas nearly all,of the smoke that causes damage to his own property, expense and heavywork in washing dirty fabrics, and ill-health to his family&quot;.Of the total of 2,100,000 tons of smoke emitted in 1952, nearly one half came from domestic chimneys, about the same quantity from industry, including public utility undertakings and road transport, andthe remainder from coal fires, locomotives and other sources.    But theseproportions will vary considerably according to the season and whether a district is primarily industrial or residential, and it has been estimatedthat in the London &quot;smog&quot; of last December up to 60 per cent of the smokewas due to domestic fires.&quot;It follows that a first, immediate and stubborn obstacle to thereduction of smoke is the preference of the majority of people fortraditional methods of heating.    The need for education and training inthese matters is urgent and vital&quot;, says the report.There are about 12 million old-fashioned grates, very few ofwhich use smokeless fuel.    About 4 million improved domestic heatingappliances have been delivered to the home market since 1947,&apos;    TheCommittee believe that increased use of these improved appliances andthe provision of smokeless fuels are the best means at present of reducing smoke from domestic chimneys.Industrial Smoke should be Li ght HazeWith few, if any exceptions, no industrial chimney need make morethan a light haze of smoke if the combusion arrangements are adequate and are properly operated,    &quot;To achieve this will in many instancesinvolve replacing or modifying existing equipment, or will involvecapital expenditure;  but it is completely possible&quot;, says the report.The Committee stress that there is no quick and easy way toremove all industrial smoke from the atmosphere within the next year or two.    But the Committee believe that much can be done by firmlytackling the problem of burning industrial fuel efficiently.Smokeless ZonesThe principle of smokeless zones is widely regarded as a simpleand easy solution of the &quot;smog&quot; problem, say the Committee,    But itsrapid extension in this country is subject to practical limitations.To have any material effect, the zones must be large, or they will receive smoke from surrounding areas, and it pre-supposes that everybuilding will be equipped with the right kind of appliances and that sufficient smokeless fuels will be avaiable.    Whilst supplies of thelatter  are limited their allocation only to smokeless zones would be atthe expense of other areas.    This suggests that any extension of smoke-less zones, if they are to have the best results, should be carefully plannedaccording to the needs of different areas.The Committee say they are investigating the practicability andeconomics of the extensive development of smokeless zones.
Other points from the report include:-Because of cost and availability it is unlikely that gas and electricity can displace solid fuel in meeting the major part of themain heating load in winter.Efficiency in the use of bituminous coal by industry falls far short of what is desirable and practicable.    Ministry of Fuel and Powersurveys indicate possible fuel savings of 16 per cent to 25 per cent.There has been small response to the Government loan scheme wherebycapital for approved industrial fuel saving projects can be obtained onfavourable terms.Fire doors which eliminate smoke have been devised by the fuel Research Station but only a small proportion of the 40,000 - 50,000hand-fired boilers in the country have been fitted with them.Evidence is to be taken on whether the exclusion of steamlocomotives from densely built-up areas is practicable.Washing flue gases from large boiler plants to remove sulphurdioxide is not easy and is expensive.    It has been suggested that, atleast in the immediate neighbourhood of the plant, the disadvantage of reduced dispersal cancels out any gain from the emission of cleaner gas,but so far it has not been possible to prove or disprove this.    TheCommittee propose to hear evidence on processes for the removal ofsulphur dioxide from chimney gases.The Committee is to consider whether the present legal powersto control smoke emission could be more effectively used, and whetherthey need strengthening.The Committee were appointed on 21st July this year by theMinister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister  of Fuel and Power, with the following termsof reference:-&quot;To examine the nature, causes and effects of air pollutionand the efficacy of present preventive measures? to consider what further preventive measures are practicable; and tomake recommendations&quot;.The Chairman of the Committee is Sir Hugh Beaver, M.
