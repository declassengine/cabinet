DELIMITATION OF TERRITORIAL &quot;waters memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs on 19th October, I was invited by the Cabinet (C.C. (53) 59thConclusions, Minute 3) to prepare, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the draft of an announcement of our decision to adhere to our traditional policy of delimiting territorial waters from low-watermark.    I now attach the text of a statement, in which the Secretary ofState for Scotland concurs.2. At the Cabinet meeting of 19th October, some doubt was expressed whether such an announcement should be made forthwith, or after further consideration.    I am in favour of making this statementwithout further delay, both in order to put a stop to current speculationthat we may be intending to adopt some form of the base-line method ofdelimiting territorial waters, and because a declaration of our intentionto adhere to our traditional method would confirm the line which we havetaken in our fisheries dispute with Iceland,    Moreover, the longer anannouncement of our own policy is delayed, the more difficult it willbecome to enlist the support of other nations against the growing numberof encroachments on the high seas, which are to our ultimatedisadvantage .3. My colleagues should however be aware that the danish government have agreed to enter into informal and confidential discussions with us about the new fishing limits, drawn on the base-linemethod, which they are proposing to introduce in the Faroe Islands;and that we are about to ask the Soviet Government to begin discussionsfor the conclusion of a new Fisheries Convention to replace the Anglo-Soviet Temporary Fisheries Convention of 1930.    I have fully consideredthe possible effect that an announcement of our own determination to adhere to traditional methods of delimiting territorial waters mighthave on these negotiations, and I am satisfied that the balance ofadvantage lies with making an early announcement.    In order to reassure the Danish Government that our announcement is not intended to prejudice their position, I propose to inform them of it in advance.As regards the Soviet negotiations, delay in making the statement mightslightly strengthen our bargaining position- by keeping the SovietGovernment in doubt as to our intentions, but I am convinced that thelong-term importance of preventing encroachments on the high seasoutweighs the possible value of this tactic. .4. I therefore suggest that this statement might be made atQuestion time in Parliament before the Christmas recess, and that itshould be given wide publicity.    If my colleagues concur in the textCOPY NOSECRETC.(53) 33728TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINET
suggested below, I propose to give the United States government confidential advance notice of the statement, since in talks last august the State Department gave us the benefit of their views on the subject.No doubt those Commonwealth Governments, whose views have beensought, should also be informed in advance.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,27TH NOVEMBER, 1953.annex draft PUBLIC STATEMENT ON UNITED kingdom policy REGARDING DELIMITATION OF TERRITORIAL &quot;WATERSFor some time past Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom have had under consideration the question whether the territorial waters round the coasts of the United Kingdom should be re-defined in thelight of the Judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice on18th December, 1951, in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries Case,    After full consideration of the matter they have come to the conclusion that thereshould be no change;   United Kingdom territorial waters will, therefore,continue to be delimited by a line drawn three miles from low-water mark,or in the case of bays and estuaries from a closing line drawn at the first point where they narrow to 10 miles in width.    The Judgment in theNorwegian Case has no binding force except in respect of the coast ofNorthern Norway.    In the opinion of Her Majesty&apos;s Government there isno warrant for the view that the application to other coasts of a base-linesystem of the kind authorised in that Judgment would necessarily be inaccordance with international law, and in such circumstances her majesty&apos;s Government hold that the principle of the freedom of the seasprevails.Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that, legal considerationsapart, an extension of United Kingdom territorial waters by means of the drawing of base-lines, such as have been adopted along the indented coast of Northern Norway, would be of some advantage to British inshorefisheries.    Nevertheless, while sympathising with the point of view ofthe inshore fishermen and conscious of the effect on them of the above decision, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusion that wider considerations, arising out of the naval, maritime and deep-sea fisheryposition of this country, must take precedence.Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the true interests ofall seafaring nations can best be served by giving the fullest possible effect to the principle of the freedom of the seas and they view withconcern the increasing encroachments on the high seas which have takenplace in recent years in many parts of the world.At the same time, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will continue toco-operate in securing the fullest possible measure of conservation of fisheries by means of international agreement through the permanent commision set up under the International Fisheries Convention of 1946,
