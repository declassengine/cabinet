CRICHEL DOWN INQUIRYCROWN PRIVILEGEMemorandum by the Attorney-general a difficult and embarrassing question has arisen in connectionwith the public inquiry which is to be held into the procedure adopted indisposing of the former Air Ministry bombing range at Crichel Down inDorset.2. The announcement of a public inquiry was made by the Ministerof Agriculture in the House of Commons on 23rd October in a writtenanswer to a question by Mr. Crouch, the Member for Dorset North.    On11th November, the Minister stated that the inquiry would be conducted bySir Andrew Clark, Q. C., with the following terms of reference:-To inquire into and report upon the procedure adopted -i(a) in reaching the decision that land at Crichel Downshould be sold to the Commissioners of crown lands;j(b) in the selection of a tenant by them; and thecircumstances in which those decisions were made,but excluding from the inquiry all questions of govermental policy and, in particular, anyquestion of whether preferential treatment shouldhave been given to any applicant on the ground of previous ownership or occupation of the land.3. With terms of reference so widely drawn, the question inevitablyarises whether and to what extent Counsel appearing for the Ministry atthe inquiry should be instructed to insist upon or to waive the customaryprivilege of the Crown in regard to disclosure of documents such as filesand minutes (including those containing advice to Ministers by civilservants).4. This privilege is based on a long-established principle,re-affirmed by the House of Lords in 1942 in the case of Duncan v.Camme 11 Laird fa Co. (1942 A. C. 624), when the Lord Chancellor,Lord Simon, said (Pp. 642-3):  &quot;The Minister .... ought not to take theresponsibility of withholding production, except in cases where the publicinterest would be damnified, for example .... when the practice of keepinga class of documents secret is necessary for the proper functioning of the        public service.    .... The same principle must also apply to the exclusion of oral evidence. &quot;-:-,-secret RE( DRD COPY&quot;c.(53) 361     . copy no. Q K29th december, 1953cabinet
5. The settled policy of successive Governments in adhering firmlyto this &quot;class&quot; rule was criticised by Devlin J. early last summer in thecase of Ellis v. Home Office and was discussed in a leading article in the times of 15th May, 1953.    In answer to a Parliamentary Question on21st May, the Attorney-General, with the approval of the Lord Chancellorsre-affirmed the Cammell Laird principles, and stated that &quot;Great careis taken by Ministers in applying these principles in every case&quot;06. The matter was subsequently reviewed by the Lord chancellor and the Home Secretary in July, 1953, with the assistance of the LawOfficers and the Treasury Solicitor.    Their conclusion was that, unlessthe &quot;class&quot; rule is maintained intact, good  government would be prejudiced through the inability of officials to advise Ministers, and toexpress personal opinions with complete confidence that their statements and views could not thereafter be disclosed or called into question.    Itwas also agreed that it would be impracticable either to authoriseDepartmental representatives to use their own judgment on the spot asto the disclosure of particular documents, or to leave the matter to the discretion of the Court.    It appeared that certain exceptions had been permitted, notably in connection with the National Health Service, but itwas considered that these might be justified as falling outside CrownPrivilege proper, and that in any event they provided no good reason forany change of policy,7. It is clear that any attempt to comply literally with the terms ofreference agreed for Crichel Down must involve a radical departure fromthe established practice.    If, however, it were to be accepted thatDepartmental minutes and Ministersr briefs could be disclosed at thepublic inquiry, or if officials were to be allowed to give oral evidenceabout them (which, as pointed out by Lord Simon, falls equally within theprinciple) a px^ecedent would be created, making it very difficult to refusea demand for similar disclosures at every public inquiry affecting any government Departments.8. We understand that it is proposed to call as witnesses the twoParliamentary Secretaries and several senior officials of the Ministry ofAgriculture and Crown Lands Commission, and, in view of certainunfortunate passages in the correspondence already disclosed, there is bound to be cross-examination as to the exact course of events,     Failurethen to insist upon Crown Privilege in relation both to documents and tooral evidence would create a very dangerous precedent, as already explained.    On the other hand, insistence upon privilege would be opento damaging criticism, both as being unfair to officials who ought to beentitled to defend themselves, and also as being inconsistent with theterms of reference.This dilemma must however be resolved on grounds of policy,and Counsel instructed accordingly, unless the inquiry is to be abandoned and some form of confidential investigation substituted for it.L, H0Royal Courts of Justice,,24TH DECEMBER, 1953.
