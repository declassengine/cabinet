2X7DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY  OF  HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTY^   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1953 &apos;secret. (53) 35822nd December, 1953CABINETSOMALILAND PROTECTORATE: EXCHANGE OF TERRITORY WITHETHIOPIANote by the Lord President of the council I attach a Memorandum by the Colonial Secretary which represents the agreed conclusions of the Committee appointed by the Cabinet to examine the detailed proposals set out in the memorandum annexed to C. (53) 263 (C.C. (53) 54th Con-clusions, Minute 5).I invite my colleagues to approve these proposals. v- .    S.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,21st, December, 1953. , -    -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the four suggested ways in which it might be possible to avoid the difficulties involved in the transfer to Ethiopia of the Zeila Corridor without consultation withthe tribes affected have been considered in detail by officials of the Colonial Office,Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office and there has been further consultation with the Governor of the Somaliland Protectorate. The conclusions reached are set out in the attached appendix, which shows that three of the suggestions do not in fact resolve the difficulties over consultation.2. The fourth suggestion that there should be an extension of the status quoin the Haud grazing areas, which are at present occupied by us under the termsof a temporary agreement with the Ethiopians made in 1944 may have morechance of affording a solution. Until recently we had understood that the ethiopians wished to negotiate on the basis of an exchange of territory and wouldnot agree to our continued occupation of the Haud without territorial compensation.There are now, however, indications that the Ethiopian Government may beprepared to view alternative arrangements with more favour.3. Mr. Frank Stafford, who is employed as an adviser to the ethiopian government and who for many years has been in close touch with the Emperorhas recently visited Hargeisa and held informal discussions with the Governor ofthe Somaliland Protectorate. He gave the Governor to understand that the ethiopians would not agree to any exchange or cession of territory but he addedthat he was sure that arrangements could be made for British occupation of the45393CABIN&quot;.!RECORDpyCopy No.71
Haud to continue for some /time, under arrangements similar to those existing atpresent (with any minor adjustments j necessary). Mr. !Stafford&apos;s views may notbe those of the Ethiopian Foreign Minister, but I consider that no chance shouldbe lost of extending the status quo if that is at all possible.v. 40/:f^ the negotiators should be instructed to negotiate an extension&apos;of; the status qu&amp; ?M*ih&amp;W:efo&amp;ffiT*&apos;sdf&amp;&amp; periddldngrehbugh&apos;to; give us real security of tenure. The arrangement should provide that the ProtectorateGovernment retajns: f uh\ judicial^ \and administrative control: there as - at&apos; prfesehti1 rv *5,v.;jw-pfopbse&apos;that  &apos;thc&apos;neg6fiatofs:&apos; should be kiithbrised, if these efforts :faik.to proceed to stage (i) of the negotiations as set out in paragraph 19 of Annex Ito (G. (53):263)i this involves Only slight variations from the status quo, tie., thatthey should; seek a lease affording rights of administration in the grazing areas for a period of 15 years or upwards for payment of an annual rent or, failing this,a capital sum, and that they should be instructed to obtain the most advantageous terms possible: (The details of the brief for the negotiators, in so far as theyconcern the amounts and the order in which offers of money should be made fordiffering lengths of lease, would be agreed in consultation with the Treasury.)6. If it nevertheless becomes clear during the negotiations that the ethiopian government will agree to the continuance of our occupation of the Haud grazingareas only if some territorial exchange is made, I propose that the negotiators shouldbe instructed to say that, as the Ethiopian Government will be aware, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have always seen great legal and other difficulties in effecting anyexchange of! territpry and the question will therefore have to be referred again to London for decision. In that event I should propose to lay the matter again before the Cabinet.7. I am-not optimistic about the outcome of negotiations on these lines.I am however: willing that a final effort should be made to avoid an exchange of territory. If it fails I shall then have to consult my colleagues once more on thequestion of transfer without consultation......... O. L.18th December, 1953.
-APPENDIX Xiniff;^Note on suggestions made with regard to the possible exchange of,  territory between the Somaliland Protectorate and Ethiopia(I) Possibility of limiting area exchanged to the territory of the Esa tribe and offer-ing compensation to the Sultan of the Esq. in return,, for his consent to the&apos;;;\    transfer    J&quot;,,,&apos;.&apos;.&apos;;!..&apos;.&apos;V^.,P1^:r,P&apos;&apos;V&apos;,E;^&apos;&apos;&apos;i,-Pi:;&apos;^ ^-,E.E/VrP;l.,.-r,The narrower of the two corridors shown on the map attached &quot;to G. (53) 263,proposed for offer to the Ethiopians in the first instance, is in fact occupied almost exclusively by the Esa. The Esa in the Zeila corridor are, however, unlikely toagree to transfer if consulted and any transfer would therefore have to be eitherwithout consultation or against their expressed wishes. Transfer without consulta-tion would appear to be less likely to involve trouble locally but there are obviouspolitical objections (which the Commonwealth Relations Office consider insuperable-able) attaching to both courses. The payment of compensation to the Sultan of theEsa, who lives in Ethiopia permanently, in return for his consent to the transferappears to be a very doubtful expedient. Such a show of consultation would notbear close examination by political critics in this country and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be open to allegations that he had agreed only under pressure from the Ethiopians. The Sultan has no moral right to dispose without consultingthem of the fate of those members of his tribe who at present enjoy the protectionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) Possibility of offering some other area in exchange for the HaudNo other suitable area to offer to Ethiopia in exchange for the Haud has beenfound which would not either: . ,.&apos;v(a) bisect the Protectorate, or(b) contain other tribespeople whose transfer wouid present difficulties equal tothose involved in the present proposals.(3) Possibility of arranging for an exchange of leases rather than a transfer of territory in perpetuityAlthough this arrangement would not give the Protectorate Governmentpermanency of tenure in the Haud, it would appear to have advantages over apermanent exchange of territory both from the political point of view because itwould make the exchange less open to criticism here and also because it presentsthe possibility of avoiding passing on to Ethiopia the &quot; railway servitude,&quot; whichthe Ethiopians find objectionable (see paragraph 10 of Annex 1 of C. (53) 263).The difficulties over consultation would, however, remain.(4) Maintenance of status quo for a further periodThis is discussed in paragraphs 2 to 4 of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum.
