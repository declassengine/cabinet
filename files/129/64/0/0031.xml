UNITED STATES-UNITED KINGDOM LOAN agreement memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in paragraph 5 of C. (53) 181, I set out the conditions which we have tosatisfy in order to claim the waiver under the Loan Agreement.    It is clearthat for 1953 we fully satisfy the first and second conditions, which are setout in Sections 5(a) and 5(b) of the Agreement.    But we are in difficulties aboutthe third condition, which is embodied in Section 6(iii) of the Agreement.2.        Two urgent and important questions arise for decision:-(a) whether we should continue pursuit of proposals we have already made to the Americans for revision of the Agreement;(b) whether we should invoke the waiver clause forthe year 1953.Fundamental Revision of the Agreement3.        In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 29th June(C.C. (53) 37th Conclusions, Minute 5) our Ambassador gave notice underSection 12 of the Agreement (Command 6708) that we wished to open negotiationsfor revision of the Agreement by the excision of Section 6(iii) which operated toprevent us from claiming the waiver in 1951 and 1952 when we sorely needed it.We have received no formal reply from the Americans to that Aide-Memoirebut several inconclusive discussions have been held with them.    the ambassador has just reported the result of the latest round of discussions(New York telegrams Nos. 1108-1110 - Annex A).4.        The up-shot of these discussions is that the Administration are nowapparently ready to explore with us the question of a fundamental revision ofthe Agreement and may be willing, eventually, to put something to Congress inspite of the political difficulties which they foresee.    In such a re-negotiationthe United States Administration may seek to substitute some other kind of provision for the existing Section 6(iii) but they have, apparently, as yet noproposals to make to us on this score.5.       Nothing has so far emerged to require any alteration of the decision which we took on 29th June to seek a fundamental revision of the Agreement,and I think we must continue to press the Administration on this point.    Clearly,however, their minds are moving very slowly and there is no prospect thatwe shall reach an early agreement with them on the kind of revision which ispossible - still less that they will be able to carry such revision throughCongress.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..UJ...C.(53) 33124TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINET
6.       In our last discussion about this Loan Agreement we decidedthat we should not specifically and separately raise then with the Americansthe question of the waiver for 1953, but should leave this to be considered in the light of the United States reactions to our proposal for revisionof the Agreement,7.       Three points (suggested in the Ambassador&apos;s report) arise on this question: -(1)     Is it worth our while claiming the waiverin 1953?(2)    Procedure,(3)     Timing,Merits8*      It is not clear whether the Americans see the same political difficulty in a successful claim of the waiver for 1953 as in there-negotiation of the Agreement:  but is must be assumed that a successful claim will be attended by a certain amount of unpopularitywith Congress,9.       For 1953 a successful claim of the waiver on the United StatesLoan (and consequentially in regard to the Canadian line of credit) means a saving of ^109 millions   for the Exchange Equalization Account and theExchequer,    The issue cannot, however, be judged in relation to a singleyear.    There remain 47 years of the Agreement when substantial,albeit annually diminishing, sums are involved.    The main point, however,is that the waiver is virtually a dead letter, unless we claim this year, orget a fundamental revision of the Agreement - and the latter cannot be counted on.    Moreover, it is clear from the course of the discussionssince delivery of our Aide-Memoire in July that the Americans will nevertake the initiative in this themselves.    If we do not take the initiative and keep up the pressure we have no real chance of getting the waiver atall.    No doubt claiming the waiver will involve us in some criticism butif that is taken as valid objection we will never claim the waiver at all.Moreover, next year there are the mid-term elections in the U.S.A, andthat would no doubt be suggested as another reason why we should notclaim for the first time in 1954.    In addition it is desirable that we should seek to establish the precedent of claiming the waiver in 1953, so that wecan have it established before the Collective Approach is again under active discussion with the Americans,10.      We have always claimed that Section 6(iii) of the Agreement was unreasonable and arbitrary in its result.    There are seven or morepossible interpretations of the Section,    As far as 1953 is concerned thereare four, and possibly five, of these which we could satisfy.     Whetherthe Americans would accept any or all of these interpretations, and whetherthey would regard their adoption as prejudicing our claim for fundamentalrevision is another matter.    At any rate, unless the Administrationreally want &quot;to prevent us from getting the waiver this year, there arereasonable grounds upon which we can be allowed to get it.    It wouldsuit us best not to choose among the various interpretations, but to getthe Administration to agree that we qualify because we qualify under anyof four or five interpretations,
11,    In view of the long-term considerations, that is, keeping the waiver clause alive and keeping up momentum behind our proposals forfundamental revision, and in view of the fact that we have reasonable grounds for claiming in 1953, I recommend my colleagues to take adecision in principle to invoke the waiver for 1953,Procedure12.   I recommend that we follow the procedure suggested by the ambassador in this matter, and attach a suitable draft telegram to him(Annex B),    He would be instructed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government havenow decided that the facts of the situation are such as to justify us in asking for the waiver this year and that we intend to do so, unless theAdministration declare that under the Agreement as it at present standsthey would reject the claim.    We would combine this with leaving our proposals for re-negotiation of the Agreement on the table.    It seems that only by direct action of this kind will we make them state their case clearly - both on political and technical grounds.Timing13.    If notification of our wish to invoke the waiver in 1953 isto be effective, it must be given immediately, otherwise we are liableto find that the Administration claim that the timing makes our proposalimpossible since they must consult Congressional leaders.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. ,24TH NOVEMBER, 1953.
ANNEX ANEW YORK TELEGRAMS NOS. 1108-1.110DATED 17TH NOVEMBER, 1953No. 1108Following from Sir R. Makins.Meeting took place at the Treasury yesterday.    Dulles couldnot attend but Humphrey had with him Stassen, Waugh, Overby and theprincipal legal advisers of the Treasury and State Department.Rickett was with me,2. At Humphrey&apos;s request I stated once more the case put to him at our previous meeting.    I said that our main object was to get theagreement revised in such a way as to put our claim to the waiver on a clear contractual basis.    We realized that to do this they would have toput the matter to Congress which would be difficult for them and wouldtake time.    But we also were faced with a difficult decision.    If theagreement remained as it stood, and if we refrained from claiming the waiver this year, our chances of getting it in future years might be seriously prejudiced.3. Humphrey said that as a matter of procedure it was clear thatthe agreement could not be amended without going to Congress.    On thequestion of substance he did not see how he could justify to Congress an amendment of the agreement which would remove Section 6(iii) altogether,especially in view of the fact that Section 10 had not been carried out andsome balances were not blocked.    This would mean that we should beentitled to claim the waiver even though other creditors were making noequivalent concession.    We should be taking money which we ought to bepaying to the United States, and handing it to the other fellow.4. I replied that circumstances had changed considerably since theagreement was drafted.    Sterling had not become convertible and there wasnot therefore such a direct connection between the dollars we paid to theUnited States and the sterling released to the balance holders.    It was notmerely that some sterling balances were not blocked.    Even where theywere, we could not arbitrarily reduce releases to comply with Section 6(iii)particularly since we might not know until late in the year whether or not we were going to make a claim.    The releases we made were part of our contribution to the Colombo Plan in which they, as well as we, were interested.5. Humphrey said that on the whole he thought that the best way todeal with the difficulty was to meet it head on and tell Congress that theagreement should be changed so that the British position could be protectedand they could get the waiver in the years in which they really needed it.But was this the right moment to put such a proposal to Congress?    Werethe Administration in proper shape to support it?    He personally was afraid that the result might be that we should be dragged into a discussionof the whole history of the agreement and of the extent to which we had succeeded in carrying out its provisions.    He would hate to see all thesequestions hashed over in Congress.    It might affect other matters inwhich we were interested.    This was, however, largely matter for Stassen.
6. Stassen did not at first make much response beyond saying that theywould have to develop an Administration position and then consult Congress.The matter was bound up with the whole range of questions now being studied by the Randall Commission.    At the very end of the meeting, however, he made the point that a new situation was developing with the tapering off ofdefence support aid.    It might be possible to argue that since the British economy would soon have to stand alone the waiver should be altered tomake it effective when it was really needed,7. There was some discussion about the effect of removing Section 6(iii)altogether as we had proposed.    The Americans argue that if the Section hadnot existed, we should have been entitled to the waiver in 1951, 1952 and 1953.Congress would undoubtedly conclude from this that if the Section disappearedwe should get the waiver in every year for the remainder of the agreement.This would be equivalent to a free grant of something like a billion dollars.I of course pointed out the fallacy in this and said that the main test of our need for the waiver was to be found in Section 5(a) and (b) of the agreement.They persisted, however, in maintaining that Congress would never agreeto remove Section 6(iii) altogether and put nothing in its place.    They would think this point over further and asked if we could make some suggestion.They seemed to be thinking of some additional provision along the lines ofSection 5(b) which would ensure that we only got the waiver &quot;when we reallyneeded it&quot;.8. They were also surprised to be told that in our view we should beentitled to the waiver this year even under Section 6(iii) as it now stands.Humphrey remarked at one point that if that was so, there was no realproblem this year and that the question of our claim this year and of are-negotiation of the agreement were quite separate,    Overby, however,was inclined to question whether the figures were such that we shouldqualify without doubt.    I replied that the Section was obscure and unsatisfactory.    That was why we wanted it altered.    If the Americansthought it undesirable for us to have the waiver this year and were bent ondefeating our claim, they could probably succeed.    But we thought that wehad a good case and that on a reasonable interpretation we should qualify.9. It was left that they would consider the matter further and thatwe for our part would report to you their proposal that we might put forwardsome further change in the terms of the agreement to compensate for the deletion of Article  &quot;sic/ 6(iii).10. See my immediately following telegram.No. 1109My immediately preceding telegram.Following from Sir R. Makins.The discussion was inevitably somewhat confused at times butI hope that Humphrey has now finally grasped the main issues.    I do notthink that he had really done so until recently.    The following commentsoccur to me.2. The Administration are prepared to explore with us the question ofa fundamental revision of the agreement and may quite possibly be willingeventually to put something to Congress in spite of the difficulties which
they undoubtedly foresee.    But you will have seen from my report of thediscussion the way in which their minds are running.    It is quite possiblethat if we persevere we may be able to work something out which will bemore logical and less arbitrary than Section 6(iii).    Whether it will havethe effect of entitling us to claim the waiver more often than we otherwiseshould be is, however, doubtful.3. I am afraid that you are now faced with a very difficult decisionespecially in view of the time factor.    I have no doubt that if we press forre-negotiation now, or if we successfully claim the waiver, there will be agreat deal of criticism of us in Congress and in the anti-British andisolationist Press, and all kinds of extraneous questions will be raked over.Moreover, in present conditions here we cannot rely on really firm support from the Administration against Congressional outcry.    That is whatmakes Humphrey ask &quot;is it worth it&quot;, and I think this is the first questionyou have to answer.4, The Americans have evidently not as yet considered seriously what their attitude will be if we claim the waiver this year, and I doubt whetherthey will do so until we give them a definite lead by showing our own hand.I am not sure whether Humphrey sees the same political difficulty in a successful claim to the waiver by us as he does in the request for re-negotiation.    I think it would be enough for us to say that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had now decided that the facts of the situation were such as tojustify them in asking for the waiver this year and that they intended to doso unless the Administration could show that such a claim would not bejustified under the agreement as it now stands.    We could combine this with leaving our request for re-negotiation on the table.    This move wouldoblige them to state their case both on political and technical grounds,5. While Stassen said that the Administration must now establish aposition on all this, Humphrey made a determined attempt to put the ballback into our court and I am not confident that they will do much homeworkon the question of re-negotiation until we return to the charge and reply toHumphreyIs request for a proposal to compensate for the deletion ofArticle 6(iii), that is to say suggest a re-definition of the conditions inwhich we think we should be entitled to claim the waiver in the future,6, See my immediately following telegram.No. 1110My immediately preceding telegram.Following from Sir R. Makins.A suggestion has occurred to us which would certainly mitigate the strong criticism which will follow a claim for the waive re    This is that we might be willing, if they gave us the waiver this year, to accept someequivalent reduction in aid, say in fiscal 1955.    If, as seems possible, weare going to be asked to take part of our aid next year in the form of surplusagricultural commodities on the lines of Section 550, there might be some advantage in swapping tied dollars of this kind for the free dollars we should get under the waiver.    At the same time, we should open up the waiverprovision and prevent it from becoming a dead letter.    I realise of course that there may be technical difficulties about this.    But I suggest that thepossibility is at any rate worth examining as something which might be useful if the Americans stress the political difficulties of our claimingthe waiver this year.
yDRAFT TELEGRAM TO H.M. AMBASSADOR,WASHINGTONYour telegrams 1108 to 1110 from New York.United States-United Kingdom Loan Agreement.Ministers have considered the matter in the light of your most useful telegrams.2. You should now as early as possible approach the United states administration on the lines set out in the latter part of paragraph 4 ofyour telegram 1109.    We assume that &quot;leaving our request for re-negotiation on the table&quot; means that we intend to pursue it.3. We do not think it worthwhile following the suggestion in yourNo. 1110.    In the first place, Congress has not yet voted any aid for fiscal1955 and the indications of intention given to us by Stassen for that fiscalyear cover only $75 millions for special aircraft purchase.    In the second place, it would be illogical to be claiming the waiver and at the same timegiving up claims for aid; and, finally, such a bargain might involve us in difficulties with Canada.
