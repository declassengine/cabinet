C..(53) 3437TH DECEMBER, 1953CABINETRETURN OF BRITISH GARRISON TO BERMUDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WayPast HistoryIn March, 1948 the battalion at Jamaica had to send one company to British Honduras,    This made it necessary to withdraw thecompany in Bermuda to Jamaica so as to give some reserve there in caseof further trouble in the Caribbean,20 In December, 1951 the Chiefs of Staff agreed that the retentionof a garrison in Bermuda was unnecessary on military grounds, and at ameeting in March, 1952, which I had with the Governor of Bermuda, theChief of the Imperial General Staff and a representative of the ColonialOffice, it was confirmed that the remaining garrison should be withdrawn,3, I told the Governor of Bermuda that if the situation allowed wewould try to return a garrison to Bermuda; but since then the Army&apos;scommitments have tended to increase and further demands for troops inthe Caribbean have been made.    Prospects are therefore less favourablenow than when the Bermuda garrison was withdrawn.Prime Minister^ Proposal4, The Prime Minister suggests that one battalion, or at least onestrong company, should be sent back to Bermuda with a band,5, There are at present no prospects of freeing the battalion nowin British Guiana and the Colonial Office estimate is that it will have toremain there for another year0    Therefore, if a battalion had to be sentto Bermuda, it would have to be found from elsewhere than the Caribbean,At present we are strained to the utmost with our existing commitments and we can ill afford this course,6, A company could be sent from Jamaica where there are atpresent three companies, the fourth being in British Honduras,    on military grounds this course cannot be recommended, since the threecompanies in Jamaica provide a handy reserve against trouble whichmight recur in such places as Grenada, Trinidad, Antigua, etc.    Todetach one company as far afield as Bermuda would weaken this reserve and would of course increase the overheads inseparable from isolatedcompanies performing garrison duties.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET . &apos;r&apos;!C  Copy No...^7.....c pi ( &apos; f\ p V
7. I fully recognise the importance of upholding British prestige in Bermuda, but in making the decision to withdraw the garrison we hadto balance prestige reasons against the increasing demands for british battalions to meet urgent operational needs all over the world,8, If it is decided that the Prime Minister11 s demand for apermanent garrison in Bermuda must be met, I think that it should be with a company and not a battalion.    If a company must be sent I do notthink it would be right to send it from Jamaica under present circumstances,and we would therefore probably have to take the most unsatisfactorycourse of detaching a company from some battalion far away from the carribbean.    As far as a band is concerned, I think we must make do withperiodic visits from the band in Jamaica.Costs9. The initial cost of re-establishing a garrison of one company in Bermuda would be about  35,000 and the annual additional cost ofmaintenance about  20,000,Future Outlook10. We are faced within the next three years with the disbandment of eight battalions.    There are as yet few indications of any markedreduction in our overseas commitments.    The Prime Minister&apos;s proposal will be an additional and lasting commitment at a time when it is likelyto become more and more difficult to meet even the most urgent rquirements.Conclusion11, On military grounds there is no case for sending a compasny,still less a battalion, to Bermuda,    If for reasons of prestige this coursemust be adopted, it can be done but at some cost to military efficiency and our readiness to meet sudden emergencies in the future,A.H,The War Office, S.W.I.,7TH DECEMBER, 1953,
