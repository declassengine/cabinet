CABINET OFFICESECRETC. (53) 34610th December, 1953CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Amendment of the Financial ProvisionsMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government tiresome, and highly technical, controversy has been going on for sometime between my Department and the Treasury about the method to be followed in providing the compensation money.If it were no more than this, I should not trouble the Cabinet with the matter,but yield with good grace to superior knowledge and authority.But there are, in my view, important political considerations involved. So i must ask the Cabinet to take the responsibility for a decision.2. The Act of 1947 provided that all development rights were to be purchased outright for  300 millions. Owners of land with development valuewere to submit claims; and these were all duly checked, good cases being&quot; admitted &quot; for payment out of the  300 millions. The total of admitted claimsamounted to approximately  350 millions.3. The Act of 1947 also provided, as a natural corollary, for the levy of a development charge wherever development was allowed.4.   We decided not to acquire development rights, but to leave them with theowners of the land, subject to planning permission.We also decided to abolish development charge.5.   Our reasons were (a) that to acquire all development rights in order to exercise planning control in individual cases was a waste of money, as well as inflationary;(b) that the development charge was acting as a bar to useful development.6. We shall however have to pay compensation, on the basis of the admittedclaims, wherever planning permission is refused. Local authorities and other public bodies will have to meet any admitted claim where they compulsorilyacquire land to which such a claim relates. We decided that where claims haveto be met they shall be met in full (i.e., within a total of  350, not  300 millions)plus an element of interest which had been provided in the Act of 1947 and whichwe could not take away.7. The original  300 millions was to have been paid in stock and charged to the Consolidated Fund. The intention was to amortise it over a period of twenty years.8.   The development charge was not specifically earmarked for this purpose.Indeed, nobody could tell whether it would be too much or too little.It would have gone to ordinary Revenue Account.Yet it is certainly true that the development charge would, in a sense, have beena revenue following the purchase of a capital asset.RECORD copy copy No.45334BPrinted for the Cabinet.

9. Under our Bill, admitted claims will be paid as and when planning permission is refused or land is compulsorily acquired.As soon as possible after the Bill becomes law claims will have to be paid, onall the &quot; back-log &quot;; the cases in which permission has been refused or land com-pulsorily acquired during the six years between the 1947 Act and the new Act.Claims will also have to be met where development charge was paid.10. I want the sums which will be paid out (the maximum of which is alreadyfixed in every case by the admitted claim) to be borne on the Consolidated Fund,and amortised by annual charges on the Votes as was to be done under the 1947Act. Payments will, however, have to be made in cash, not in stock, as they will fall due as and when a right to compensation is established.11. The Treasury want all the sums to be charged on the Vote in the year inwhich they are paid.12. In an appendix I have tried to put the technical, practical and consti-tutional arguments as fairly as I can.But I think the political argument is the one the Cabinet must really consider.13. The story of land values, unearned increment, and all the rest is a very long one; and we could, if we are not very careful, become involved in one of themost bitter of all political disputes.So far our scheme has been generally accepted. It has great difficulties,but most people admit that they can think of nothing better. The Opposition havenot made trouble over it; and I am most anxious not to provoke trouble.14. Everyone now accepts &quot; planning &quot; in the sense that the owner of landmust not be the sole judge of its use.Good agricultural land must be kept in agricultural use even though its value for building is much higher than its value for agriculture. The &quot; green belts &quot;round London and the other great cities must be preserved.The great advantage of the 1947 scheme was that neither planning authoritiesnor the Government were tempted to allow undesirable development in order toavoid the cost of compensation.We have undertaken that planning shall continue unimpaired despite theabandonment of development charge, and the decision to &quot; pay as we go.&quot;15. Everyone also accepts, though some reluctantly, that where land is needed for an approved public purpose the owner must not hold the community to ransom; and in particular that the owner ought not to get a price enhanced bybenefits which have been carried out at public expense.16.   Subject to these two conditions we are returning to the free market.That in itself is not very palatable to &quot; progressive &quot; opinion. But providedthere is confidence in our intention to hold both conditions continuance of firmplanning control and a limited price when land is bought for public purposes Iam sure that we can hold the position.At any rate the keen edge of argument is blunted.17. If a Minister has to make up an estimate each year of the amount ofmoney that he will need (at which he can only make the wildest guess, since it will depend entirely on the applications made for planning permission), and to defendthat estimate against a Chancellor naturally anxious to secure economies, theresult is likely to be a relaxation of planning control dictated solely by short-termfinancial considerations. Or if that is not the result and it is impossible to pledgefuture Chancellors all parties and informed critics will say that that will be theresult. We shall be accused of intending to weaken the protection of agricultural land and of the remaining amenities of our small island; and indeed I think myselfthat we shall have weakened it. But the immediate point is that our critics will see in this the cloven hoof.18. If the cost falls on the Consolidated Fund, Parliament will have regularopportunities to debate the trend of expenditure when the charge for the amortisa-tion payments comes up. Meanwhile Parliamentary control over expenditure would be protected by the fact that the upper limit of what can be paid will havebeen fixed by Parliament.The Bill will not, it is true, lay down a maximum sum; but it will lay down that the most that can be paid in any case will be the admitted claim plus an element of interest and it is known that the total of all admitted claims amounts to about
 350 millions. Not half of this probably not a third will in fact have to be paidby the Exchequer; but it is impossible to estimate what the total pay-out from central Government funds will amount to.19. I do not want to be taken as implying that I do not think that thefinancial implication should be taken into account in considering the right use ofland. All claims for compensation following planning refusal will be looked atto ensure that we are getting value for money. What I am anxious to avoid ishaving to allow wrong development because there is no more money available inthe particular financial year; and above all I am anxious to avoid the appearance of that.20. I much regret that the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not see his wayto accept this view.Apart from the practical difficulties of administration, I do feel that it wouldbe pedantic to press too far the theoretical argument against my proposal, even ifit were sound.It would be far more costly to the Exchequer in the long run, as well asdamaging to our political strength, now and in the future, if the whole controversywere to be revived and embittered on this really minor issue.Also it seems to me of some importance that to finance the compensation payments out of the Consolidated Fund, amortising them over a period, will greatlyreduce the demands on the Budget in 1954 and 1955. If all these payments arefinanced out of Votes there must be a charge of many   millions in these twoyears. If they are financed out of the Fund the charge can be spread over twenty years.21. Anyway, I feel that Ministers should know the whole position and thendecide.A decision is needed urgently in order that we may complete the drafting ofour Bill.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,9th December, 1953.45334
APPENDIXTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Amendment of Financial ProvisionsMethod of Financing the Compensation payments. The argument that the payments should be financed out of the Votes rests on the following grounds:  (1) All public expenditure on current administration ought to be subject to advance scrutiny by the Treasury and to advance approval by Parliament.(2) The original  300 millions represented a payment for a capital asset,development value; and this asset was to yield revenue by way of development charge. It was therefore reasonable to finance the transaction by borrowing; and indeed as  300 millions was to be paid out all at once it was not possible to financeit by any other method.   It is unsound to meet annual expenditure by borrowing.(3) There are two historic reasons for putting charges on the consolidate fund and neither applies to the compensation payments. One applies where thecharges involve such solemn obligations, e.g., the Sovereign^ Civil List and the judges Salaries, that it is undesirable that they should be subject to annual authori-sation by Parliament with the associated right to criticise the actions of the persons concerned. The other case for charge to the Fund is where it is desired to be ableto borrow for the expenditure if thought desirable.2. The contrary view that the payments could properly be financed out of the consolidated Fund and that it is most convenient to do so rests on the followingarguments:  (1) The total that can be incurred will be limited by Parliament in advance.The maximum that can be paid in any one case will be the admitted claim plus someelement of interest; and the total of the admitted claims will be fixed. parliament will therefore approve the upper limit in advance.(2) The payments to be made under the new Bill are of two kinds:  (i) payments in respect of action which has taken place in the six years betweenthe coming into operation of the 1947 Act and the passing of the newBill;(ii) payments in respects of action taken on applications for permission todevelop land after the new Bill is passed.In the first two years after the new Bill is passed payments under (i) will be heavy; much heavier than payments under (ii). They will include payments on allrefusals of permission to develop (where these refusals entail a claim to compen-sation) made over six years. They will also include payments of admitted claimswhere land has been bought at existing use value (certainly payments of a capitalnature) and payments of admitted claims where development charge has been paid.These latter payments incidentally have either already been recovered (more or less)by way of development charge; or where land was bought by a public authority andno charge was paid, will be recovered from the acquiring authority.All of the payments to be made under (i) are virtually settled by the actionalready taken; though it is impossible to estimate what may be due on refusalsof permission to develop. The proposal to finance all of them out of the Votesfor 1954 and 1955 seems unnecessary on any argument and also unsound. Onthe other hand, to finance payments under (i) by a different method from payments under (ii) would at once draw attention to what was being done, and inevitablyarouse suspicion of the Governments intentions.(3) It is true that the amounts to be paid out in respect of action taken afterthe Bill is passed will depend on the action of local planning authorities (in refusingconsent to particular development) and ultimately on the action of the PlanningDepartments (in deciding whether to uphold the decisions of the authorities).  But
it is inappropriate that decisions whether this or that development should beallowed should be governed by the amount of money available in the particularfinancial year.(4) It will be impossible to estimate how much money may be needed to finance compensation payments in any particular year. This will depend on the applications for permission to develop land which fall to be decided in the year.An estimate in these circumstances will&apos;be meaningless.(5) The argument that the original  300 millions represented payment for a capital asset, properly financed by borrowing, while the payments now to be madedo not, seems highly theoretical. It is true that no revenue will now be forthcoming.But there does not seem to be any essential or practical difference between thenature of the new payments and the nature of the old. The payments to be madeunder the 1947 Act were truly whatever was said about them compensation pay-ments; they were to compensate for the development value that existed in 1947which owners were not to be allowed to realise for themselves. The differencenow is that the cases in which owners will not be allowed to realise the develop-ment value will be fewer only those where development is not allowed; and so the compensation payments will be fewer and will be made only as occasion arises.But the nature of the payments to be made is still the same.(6) Some annual expenditure is in any event borne on the Consolidated Fundas explained in paragraph 1 (3) above. It is true that there is usually a specialreason; but this does show that there is no absolute rule against annual expenditurebeing financed by charge to the Consolidated Fund.(7) If it were accepted that the payments could be borne on the Fund, theproposal is that they should be amortised by annual charges on the Votes. Thiswould be done either by estimating the total liability, and amortising it by evencharges, subject to periodical review in order to correct the total in the light of experience. Or it could be done by amortising each year&apos;s payments over thefollowing twenty years. Either system would provide Parliament with an oppor-tunity to review the trend of expenditure, and if they thought fit to insist on reduc-tion. They would then know what the money was going on and debate could be effective; which it certainly could not be on an estimate of what might come up during the year.
