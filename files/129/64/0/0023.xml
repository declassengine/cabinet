C.(53) 32319TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINETANGLO-JORDAN treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsThe Cabinet on 17th November invited me to consider further thequestion of the despatch of British forces to Jordan and the statements which might be made to the Jordan and Israel Governments as regardsour obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of 1948 (C, C. (53) 67thConclusions, Minute 5).2.        The Cabinet has already decided in principle to send an armouredsquadron to Jordan for training.    I am in favour of doing this when theSecurity Council has pronounced on the Qibya incident.3.        I would give the Israel Government an assurance that no Britishtroops would ever be used for an aggressive purpose.    The Israel Govern-ment were told of the possibility that we might send troops to Jordan aslong ago as last April; they raised no objection.    In telling them again, weshould remind them of our Treaty obligation to assist Jordan.4.       As regards a statement to the Jordan Government there seem tobe two alternatives:-(i)  We could merely accept the Jordan Governments invitation to station the armoured squadron there for training purposes, and say nothing about our intention to use itor any other British forces to carry out our engagementunder the Treaty.    The Jordan Government have not infact asked us for any re-assurance about the Treaty(they received one shortly before Qibya) and have hithertoresisted for political reasons the despatch of any british forces to Jordan other than the armoured squadron.(ii) Alternatively, in sending the squadron to Jordan, we couldtell the Jordan Government that we were prepared todiscuss with them ways and means of fulfilling theTreaty if Jordan was attacked.    We should remind themthat the Anglo-Jordan Defence Board has for some time past recommended that if the United Kingdom is to beable to carry out its obligations under the Treaty, it isnecessary for an armoured brigade to be stationed in jordan in time of peace.    In this way we could seek the agreement of the Jordan Government in principle to the niationing of an armoured brigade, while making it clear that the timing of this move would require futher consideration owing to difficulties of accommoda-tion, etc. and would depend on the outcome of our negotiations with Egypt.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET
Stoic5.       As between these alternatives, the second has the advantage thatit would assist in the re-deployment of our forces from Egypt and would serve to show our continued interest in the Middle East.    There was,I think, a time when we were anxious to station a brigade in Jordan.On the other hand, it might be thought wiser not to offer to commitlarger forces at this stage.conclusion.        I recommend therefore that:-(i)  We should, as the Cabinet has already agreed in principle,send an armoured squadron to Jordan as soon as theSecurity Council has pronounced on the Qibya incident.(ii)  My colleagues should consider whether it would be preferable in this connexion to approach the jordan government on the lines of the first or second alternative in paragraph 4 above.(iii)  Whichever of these alternatives is adopted, we should approach the Israel Government as suggested inparagraph 3 above and should inform the jordan government that we have done so.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.18TH NOVEMBER, 1953.
