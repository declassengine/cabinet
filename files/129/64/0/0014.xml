Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1953SECRET Copy No.     5C. (53) 31411th November, 1953CABINETPROJECT FOR A TRANSATLANTIC TELEPHONE CABLEMemorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralAfter receiving Cabinet approval on 27th January (CC. (53) 5th Conclusions,Minute 8) the Post Office entered into negotiation with the Americans andCanadians about the provision of a transatlantic telephone cable. These negotia-tions are now concluded and the results are set out, in some detail, in Annex I.2. At present, telephone service between the United Kingdom and canada is provided by two radio-telephone circuits, and that to the United States by twelve.&apos;All these circuits are unreliable and subject to fading. In any case, there are not enough radio frequencies for additional circuits to carry growth of traffic after 1960.3. The new cable will give us not only a reliable telephone service to both countries, but also better telegraph service to Canada. There will be six telephonecircuits and six (possibly nine) telegraph circuits between the United Kingdomand Canada, and about twenty-nine telephone and possibly nine telegraph circuitsbetween the United Kingdom and the United States. The Anglo-Canadiantelephone and telegraph circuits will be available for transit traffic, for instance to Australia and New Zealand, which we are now having difficulty in servingsatisfactorily by radio; the latter circuits will also provide an alternative to our main telegraph cable route to the Far East, which passes through the mediterranean and Red Sea.4. A provisional estimate of the cost of the scheme is  1.1-5 million; but because of its pioneering nature it would be wise to assume a total of  12-5 million,which would make the United Kingdom contribution  6-25 million. The treasury have approved this figure.5. The United Kingdom contribution will be in kind (i.e., in cables andrepeaters and the use of our cable ships) and there will therefore be no dollar out-payment by the United Kingdom on capital account. It has also been agreed thatthe arrangements for maintenance will be such as to reduce to a minimum the dollar out-payments by the United Kingdom on this account.     \6. It will be remembered that there were certain conditions that I originallylaid down as being desirable (Annex to C (53) 27, paragraph 11). These have all been substantially met, with the exception of that about the second transatlantictelephone cable being routed direct to this country. This has not been agreed; buta formula dealing with this point (Annex II) will be inserted in the Agreement. Thisgoes as far as I believe it was reasonable to press, in view of the Americans&apos; strong feelings against commitment on this point.7. Some delay has been caused by Canadian fears that the draft Agreementdid not sufficiently provide for the security of Anglo-Canadian communications, orfor preventing American infiltration into Canadian domestic communications. Iwas, however, able to get the Americans and Canadians together and safeguardswere devised which have been approved by the Canadian Cabinet.
8. On the question of law to be applied in the Agreement, the AmericanCompany have made it clear that they would not accept English or Canadian law.After consultation with the Foreign Office I consider that on the whole our best interests would be served by omitting the question of law entirely from the Agree-ment rather than submitting ourselves to American law. The American company are agreeable to this proposal, for which there are precedents here. , &apos; &quot;V9. I hope that my colleagues will agree that we should push on with.thisscheme, and I accordingly ask authority to sign the Agreement. After signatureit will have to be presented to Parliament for approval; it has already been&quot;cleared,&quot; in draft, by the United States State Department, and awaits final approval by the Canadian Cabinet.10. The Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence and theCommonwealth Relations Office have agreed to these proposals at the official level.&apos; D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,9th November, 1953.
ANNEX r&apos; 1. Negotiations with the Americans and Canadians on the projected trans-atlantic telephone cable have been concluded on the understanding that each ofthe parties would report the position.reached in negotiations to their higher authori-ties in order to ascertain whether their participation in the scheme, on the basisdescribed below, could be approved.Nature of the scheme &apos;2,. The project considered by the Cabinet in January 1953 consisted of a submarine telephone cable between Scotland and Newfoundland with an extension to Nova Scotia. This has now been expanded by the addition of the land con-nection from Nova Scotia to the Canada/United States border; the actual routewill be Oban (Scotland)-Clarenville (Newfoundland)-Sydney Mines (Nova Scotia)-Canada/United States border. It has been agreed that the land sections fromthe Canada /United States border to New York and from Oban to London, whichare about equal in length, should be outside the project, as would also be the landconnection with the Canadian domestic communications network. A map of thescheme is appended.Design f&apos; 3. It has been agreed that the system of cables and submerged repeaters tobe used for the main transatlantic crossing should be of American design and that between Clarenville and Sydney Mines of British design. A recent survey on the spothas shoWn that, irrespective of the type of system used, the best route for the cablebetween Newfoundland and Nova Scotia is, both technically and economically, inwater of only moderate depths. Although these depths are considerably greaterthan those in which our present repeaters lie in home waters, use of the Britishsystem there will not offer the scope which we had originally contemplated fortesting pur own deep-sea techniques which are now being developed.4. For the land section from Sydney Mines to the Canada /United Statesborder, the parties have agreed that, in view of the difficult country to be traversed,the cheapest and most efficient link would be a micro-wave radio relay system ofthe type of which the American Company already have 15,000 miles in successful operation.Access to Canadian communications network and allotment of circuits5. It has been agreed that the cable system should give access to the Canadiancommunications network and that an assignment of six telephone circuits and sixtelegraph circuits (with a possibility of. a further three telegraph circuits if technicalconditions permit) should be made for communication between &quot;and via the UnitedKingdom and Canada. The remainder of the cable capacity (probably twenty-ninetelephone circuits, with six or possibly nine telegraph circuits) would be availablefor telephone communication between the United States and the United Kingdomand to provide, if required, inter-governmental leased telegraph channels between those two countries. For the reasons explained in paragraph 12 of the Annex toC. (53) 27, it has been agreed that use of the cable system for other telegraphpurposes between the United States and the United Kingdom should, for thepresent, remain an open question.6. If technical developments make it possible later to produce more thanthirty-six telephone circuits from the submarine cables, the additional circuits willbe allotted in the same proportions as in paragraph 5.7. Connection with the Canadian communications network will be made ata point on the micro-wave radio relay system, yet to-be decided, south of Sydney.Mines. &apos; - ...Capital contributions and provision in kind by the United Kingdom.8? In considering this question, it is convenient to regard the scheme as con-sisting of two parts: Part I.-The two sections of submarine cable.from Oban (Scotland) to SydneyMines (Nova Scotia) plus that part of the micro-wave radio relay system
from Sydney Mines down to the junction point where connection is madewith the Canadian domestic communications network.Part II. The remainder of the micro-wave radio relay system from thejunction point referred to in Part I down to the Canada-United Statesborder.Part I will be carrying the transatlantic communications of all three parties; and part II will be carrying only those of the United States and the United Kingdom.9. The division of user of each part, expressed in round figures as a percentageof the total capacity, will be as follows:  Part I-Submarine cable system plus micro-wave radio relay system down tojunction point with Canadian domestic communications networkUnited United- Kingdom Canada States0/ o/ .&apos;. o//o /o /oUnited Kingdom-Canada service    ......       9 9      .....United Kingdom-United States service      ...      41 ...        41Total        .........      ......      50 9 41Part II. Remainder of micro-wave radio relay systemUnited Kingdom-United States service     ...      50 ... 50Canada has intimated her desire to become a part-owner of Part I to the extentrepresented by her user, i.e., roughly 9 per cent.; but she is content that her con-tribution shall be in cash, and that the actual provision of the system should beleft to the United Kingdom and United States..10. Throughout the negotiations, we have stressed that there can be noquestion of the United Kingdom being involved in dollar out-payments eitherto the United States or to Canada for the provision of the scheme (includinglaying), because our user amounts to 50 per cent.; and that in order to avoid suchout-payments our 50 per cent, contribution must be made in kind, i.e., by manu-facture of components in this country, laying of cable, &amp;c. This means that mostof the submarine cable used for the system between Oban and Clarenville, for whichthe Americans have the primary responsibility for design, will have to be manu-factured&apos; in the United Kingdom they naturally would prefer this cable to be manufactured in the United States by the American firm which has already success-fully made cable to the particular specification. We have, however, refused tobudge from our demands, which in the end were accepted; and they have been incorporated in the draft Agreement. The Americans may, however, return to thecharge if, on the final allocation of manufacture (which can only be determinedwhen tenders are in), less than 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, of the whole amount ofcable is to be made in the United States.Ownership11. In view of the proportions of user and the corresponding contributions to be made by Canada and United Kingdom, we and the Canadians jointly pressed for a Commonwealth ownership of 59 per cent, in Part I. The American Company,however, look upon ownership as meaning control and vice versa; and, in their view, to pass control of any. part of the scheme to the Commonwealth would put them in a position impossible to defend either to their own public or to the state department, especially in view of the part played by their design and initiative inthe project. They emphasised that they were quite prepared to make a 50 percent, capital contribution; the fact that they were making a lesser one arose solelyfrom their acquiescence in Canadian participation in ownership and their desireto help the United Kingdom in avoiding dollar out-payments. If these factors wereto be pressed to reduce the extent of their ownership, the whole project might beimperilled. In the end we agreed to our 50 per cent, contribution, being regardedas 41 per cent, ownership and 9 per cent, commuted rental (over the life of the. cablesystem) for our halves of the United Kingdom-Canada circuits. This means that,with Canada.&apos;s 9 per cent, contribution, the Commonwealths ownership and controlof Part I equals that of the Company. .
12. As regards the remainder of the micro-wave radio relay system (Part II),any part-ownership by us might prove very embarrassing to the Canadians in viewof their declared intention to restrict its use by the American Company to theneeds of the present scheme. We have therefore abandoned any idea of ownershipin Part II and our 50 per cent, contribution in this case will be regarded ascommuted rental.13. The Americans accepted our stipulation as regards both Parts I and II,that the total contributions (whether in respect of ownership or in the form ofcommuted rental), which are based on user as set out in paragraph 9, shall determine the allocation of:  (i) any additional circuit capacity in the scheme which may become possiblelater as a result of technical advances;(ii) rentals received from leasing of circuits in any section of the scheme whichare surplus to those required to form &quot; through circuits &quot; for the Anglo-Canadian and Anglo-American services;(iii) expenses for maintenance of the scheme and payments or receipts inrespect of damage caused by or to the scheme;(iv) any proceeds of liquidation of the scheme.Maintenance14. Detailed arrangements for the maintenance of the scheme have not been worked out, but it has been accepted in principle that, so long as they do not impair the efficiency of the system or affect the promptness of repairs, they should be designed to minimise dollar out-payments by the United Kingdom Post Office.As already stated, all charges for maintenance (including out-payments by way of damages or compensation) will be shared between the parties in the proportions oftheir total pecuniary contributions to the provision of the scheme, and any receiptsby way of damages or compensation will be shared between the parties in thesame proportions.Extent to which conditions laid down by the Cabinet have been met15. At its meeting on 27th of January, 1953, the Cabinet agreed to ourentering into negotiations with the Canadian authorities and the AmericanCompany subject to seven conditions. The extent to which these conditions (whichare repeated for convenience) have been met as a result of our negotiations is described below:  (i) Use of the British system for the submarine cable between newfoundland and Nova Scotia.This has been agreed to, but (as explained in paragraph 3) the routeing. now decided on for this section of the submarine cable will not enable us to gain the full experience of our deep-sea techniques which we had originally contemplated.(ii) The cable should be so routed as to give access to the Canadiancommunications network.This has been agreed.(iii) Our provision in kind should be no less than our capital contribution,i.e., this provision should not involve us in expenditure of foreign currency.This has been accepted and incorporated in the draft Agreement, butthere is a possibility, mentioned in paragraph 10, that the American Companymay reopen the question in certain circumstances.(iv) The arrangements for maintenance and upkeep of the submarine cableshould not involve us in dollar expenditure.It has been agreed that United Kingdom dollar out-payments shall beminimised (paragraph 14), but the inclusion in the joint project of the landsection from Sydney Mines to the Canada/United States border will introduceadditional maintenance charges in dollars which will make, it difficult inpractice to ensure that we shall have no dollar out-payments. The total.     maintenance costs of the scheme are estimated as  171,000 a year, of which
we shall bear  85,000; but since we shall incur part of this in sterling ourannual dollar outgoings on this account should not on present expectations,exceed  45,000. &quot; * -(y) We should be entitled (on appropriate financial terms) to use the cable toany desired extent for telegraph as well as telephone purposes to placesother than United States.We have secured an initial assignment of six (possibly nine) telegraphcircuits (paragraph 5), which should meet our foreseeable requirements.(vi) The future use of the cable for telegraphs between United States and united Kingdom should remain an open question, except that its use for inter-governmental leased circuits should be permitted.This has been agreed (paragraph 5).(vii) An understanding should be reached that the second transatlantic tele-phone cable, when it is installed, will be to this country.The Americans found themselves unable to accept this condition as theycould see no way of justifying to their own people the consequent dependence of their European telephone communications upon us, and the necessity forgiving preference to a second United States-United Kingdom cable, before it was economically justified, even if a direct cable was justified earlier betweenthe United States and a continental country (e.g., France). They indicated,however, that their interest in providing for growth in United Kingdom-UnitedStates traffic was as great as our own, and they would willingly co-operate with us in providing for such growth and in a manner which did not involve routeingour circuits permanently through a foreign country. While it would obviously be to our advantage to provide the route for United States-European telephonetraffic for a considerable time, we are not in a position to hold out on this issue and our real interest is to safeguard the fruits of an effective partnership between the Americans and ourselves continuing beyond the pioneering stage.A formula designed to give expression to this interest has been worked.outwith them and is shown at Annex II. Although in terms it is not so bindingas we would wish, it represents the maximum length to which the Companyfeel they are able to go on paper if thev are not to expose themselves to chargesthat they have handed over to the United Kingdom control of the further development of United States transatlantic communications. The company have, however, agreed to its incorporation in the Agreement.Finances16. Initial Cost. The cost of the scheme so far as it can now be estimated is 11-5 million; the  1-5 million additional to the  10 million approved by theCabinet in January 1953 is mainly in respect of the micro-wave system, which wasnot included in the original project. A more precise estimate cannot be made atpresent because the American Company will not agree to their engineers and oursjointly preparing specifications for the component parts of the scheme until the UnitedKingdom Post Office and the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication corporation have signed an Agreement to participate. Having regard to the pioneering natureof the scheme, it is considered prudent to assume at this stage that the total cost will be  12-5 million; on this basis, the United Kingdom contribution will be 6-25 million instead of the  5 million already approved.Probable Results. Any attempt to forecast the income and expenditure of thesystem: when in operation must be speculative. But on a conservative estimate,taking no account of any possibility of later expansion of the capacity of the cablewhich the engineers on both sides consider to be technically possible, the calculationsshow that although it would be unwise to say that we expect any particular per-centage of profit on capital, the system should be capable, on the basis of presenttariffs, of yielding a useful profit over the years. The existing service is, however,running at a loss, and the cable will involve an even higher rate of loss in the early years before the full expected increases in traffic materialise.  .Law to Govern the Agreement17. The question what law should govern the contract has arisen. Initiallywith the support of the Canadian legal representative we pressed for the adoption
of English or Canadian law, but the Americans rejected this proposal because ofthe political difficulties which it would raise for thern.. They recognised that american law would for corresponding and other reasons be unacceptable to us.They were firmly opposed to provision being made for the settlement of disputesby any form of arbitration. They did not, however, press for the acceptance of american law and suggested that no law should be specified in the contract. in subsequent negotiations all measures short of a threat of non-signature were takento persuade the Americans to agree to English or Canadian law, but these were unsuccessful and the choice therefore lay between American law or no law. in either case, if we wanted to sue the American Telephone and Telegraph Company,it would have to be in American Courts. If no law were specified, we should beno worse off in such an action, except for the increased cost of preliminary litigationto settle what law should be applied: while if the American Telephone and Tele-graph Company sued us we should be better off as they would have to come toEnglish Courts.There are known precedents for a United Kingdom Government Departmententering into contracts with private companies abroad applying English law, theforeign law and no law at all. After consultation with the Foreign Office we havedecided that no law should be specified in this Agreement.We have been successful in ensuring Crown privilege by a specific clause inthe Agreement which we have reason to believe would be respected Tw theAmerican Courts.   .Consultation with the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board18. It is our intention that, like the existing transatlantic communicationfacilities, the new cable system should form part of the Commonwealth networkand therefore (so far as the United Kingdom and Canada are concerned) bebrought within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board.We have, from time to time, told the Board how the project was developing, andon. 15th October, 1953 the United Kingdom and Canadian members submitted a joint paper to the Board describing the scheme and indicating that an agreement for its provision would probably shortly be concluded with the American Company.The Board welcomed the cable in principle as being calculated to promote theefficiency of the Commonwealth telecommunications network, and indicated thatas soon as firmer figures of costs were available they would consider the questionof including the appropriate costs and revenue in the financial arrangements whichgovern the liability of the various Partner Governments for the maintenance, &amp;c,of the rest of the Commonwealth network.ANNEX IIFurther Development of Transatlantic Cable TelephonyThe Company, having entered into this Agreement for the provision of atransatlantic telephone cable between the United States, Canada and the UnitedKingdom as the first stage in the development of transatlantic cable telephony^between these countries, hereby declares it to be its intention that:  (a) It will co-operate fully with the Postmaster-General in planning for pro-vision of additional capacity for growth in telephone communications;between the United States and the United Kingdom as soon as it is. i        economically desirable.(b) If, prior to the establishment of a second cable between the United Statesand the United Kingdom, the Company proposes a cable between theUnited States and the Continent of Europe, it will, subject to this not. being contrary to the public interest of the United States of America,enter into discussions with the Postmaster-General in order to determine whether such a cable can be so planned, with any necessary branchesand extensions, as to include provision for capacity requirements between-the United States and the United Kingdom without their being routedthrough Continental Europe.
(c) Similarly, it will (subject as stated in sub-paragraph -(b)) enter into dis-cussions with the C.O.T.C. and the Postmaster-General to considerwhether provision should be made for capacity requirements between canada and the United Kingdom.(d) If such an arrangement proves feasible and desirable the Company willenter into negotiations with the party or parties desiring to participatetherein to formulate the plan in detail and to settle the arrangementtherefor.The parties jointly and severally recognise that in planning for additional capacity under the foregoing provisions, due consideration should be given to thepossibility of eliminating payments from one party to another for capital and annualcosts.
