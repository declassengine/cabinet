secret.(53) 31914TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE: SECURITY EXPORT controls memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsDepartments have been considering whether we should put forwardinternationally any proposals for changing the present system of security exportcontrols over trade with the Soviet bloc: and they have prepared the memo-randum at Annex A which focuses the issues for consideration,    I should likethe Cabinet to consider the points raised in this memorandum.    These concernonly trade with Soviet Russia and the Satellites,    The time has not yet corne fora reconsideration of our policy towards China since this must depend on further progress being made towards a political settlement in Korea,2.        The present state of international discussions on controls on trade withthe Soviet bloc is as follows.   At the suggestion of the United States Governmentsthere have recently been Anglo-American talks at which the United States Dele-gation described the results of an American domestic review of policy which hasbeen conducted over the past few months and has resulted in the adoption of anew approach.    This new approach consists of a readiness to apply the existing arrangements more sympathetically and flexibly, coupled with a tightening upofthe control machinery to prevent evasions,    A summary report of the Anglo-American discussions is at Annex B,    It is proposed that these discussions should be resumed on or soon after 19th November, by which date the UnitedStates will have explained its new approach to the&apos; French Government also.There will follow a tripartite meeting, as a preliminary to a meeting of the consultative Group in Paris on or about 10th December, in which all the paris group countries will participate and at which, I understand, Mr, Stassen, theDirector of the United States Foreign Operations Administration, is expected to lead the United States Delegation,    Decisions by the Cabinet on the questions raised in the memorandum at Annex A are needed before we enter any of theseinternational discussions,3,        The questions for decision are:-(a) The Departments concerned are agreed that it is desirable to substitute for the present lists a much shorter list of items to be embargoed.    Do my colleagues agree with this view?(b) If so, do they accept the concept put forward in paragraph 4(a)of Annex A or that put forward in paragraph 4(b) as the criterion for an effective control system?(c) If my colleagues accept either of the two concepts, do they agree that we should propose it to the Americans using the items set out in paragraph 8 of Annex A as illustrations ?(d) Do they consider that our case on transaction controls shouldbe presented as suggested in paragraph 15 of Annex A andthat we should agree, if necessary, to impose the controlswithout the acceptance of a short list?A.E,Foreign Office, S.W.1.14TH NOVEMBER, 1953,-1-
There are some grounds for thinking that the time has come to reconsider our policy on the control of trade with the Soviet bloc.    It islikely that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.C.) will adoptthe strategy of the &quot;long haul&quot;:  any system of export controls must there-fore be able to stand the strain of enforcement over a long period.    Thepresent system of controls is very difficult to enforce now and thedifficulty is likely to increase as trading countries compete increasinglyfor export markets.    Public opinion in this country and in the rest ofEurope is becoming restive over the present restrictions on trade.    the americans themselves are developing a new approach, though it consists of a change in emphasis towards greater flexibility rather than in anyrecasting of the control system.    (Their ideas were described to us inthe recent Anglo-United States discussions in London, of which a summaryreport is at Annex B, )2,        As Ministers were informed (paragraph 46 of the paper annexed to E. A, (53) 114), we are ourselves carrying out a detailed review of theexisting system of control to see how far it may be possible to eliminatesome of the items.    It is possible, in view of their new approach, thatthe Americans will be more ready to agree to some reduction in the listsbut the reduction is unlikely to be substantial,3,        We have therefore considered whether there is scope forproposing a radical change.    The present system of controls is based ona compromise between the American view that no trade should be done which might increase the economic strength of the Soviet bloc, and theUnited Kingdom and European view that, within limits, trade with the Eastis to the advantage of the West and a more selective control is required.All Departments are agreed that it is desirable that the present list of controlled items should be greatly reduced provided effective steps are taken to improve the machinery of control,4.        Two alternative concepts as a basis for a short list have beenput forward in official discussions:-(a) The Ministry of Defence consider that in addition towithholding arms and war equipment the controlsshould aim at retarding the build-up of Soviet war potential by imposing a limited range of strictlyenforced controls concentrated on essential keypoints where Soviet industry is known to besuffering from shortages or bottlenecks in production.(b) The Board of Trade and Treasury and other economicDepartments think that the criterion should bemaximum trade consistent with essential securityneeds.    They contend there is little evidence that existing controls aimed at retarding war potentialhave prevented the build-up of Soviet industry orthe Soviet defence effort, and they think it isuseless to do more than restrict the export of items which can be demonstrated to be ofimportance to Soviet military production.SUBMISSION ON STRATEGIC CONTROLS ON TRAPSWITH THE SOVIET BLOC
5.        The Ministry of Defence are mainly concerned to obtain inter-national agreement of a list which is short enough to make really effectiveenforcement possible.    They believe that a short list of items for completeembargo properly selected and strictly applied would provide a reasonablealternative to the present system from the strategic point of view.    they agree that the effectiveness of the present controls is problematical, andthat the controls are too cumbrous, provoke friction on minor points, andare subject increasingly to evasion.    They also agree that a control system must be devised which can stand the strain of enforcement overthe period of the &quot;long haul&quot;.6.        The Board of Trade and Treasury and other economic Departmentssupport the idea of a shorter list of controls, mainly because of their general approach, described in paragraph 4(b) above, and because of theimportance they attach to doing everything possible to increase trade withthe Soviet bloc.   The present controls enter almost all sectors of industryand act as a deterrent to exports of a wide range of other goods in thesesectors.    Many United Kingdom manufacturers are looking to eastern europe as a market for exports and are becoming increasingly critical of controls over items which they deny to be of primary strategic importance.    There is evidence that the Soviet bloc is at present preparedto expand its trade with the West and to broaden the range of its purchases.In order to pay for increased exports from Western Europe, the bloc willbe compelled to make available to our private traders at competitive pricesincreasing quantities of the foodstuffs and raw materials which we ourselvesneed to import.7.        The Foreign Office consider that there is no chance in the fore-seeable future of obtaining American acceptance of a short list whetherbased on the Ministryof Defence or Board of Trade and Treasury concept.The recent American statements about the new policy show a readiness onthe part of the United States Administration to adopt a more flexibleattitude towards marginal items on the lists.    At best, however, the gap between what the Americans will accept and the short list compiled on either basis will be very wide.    The United States Government would be forced to oppose the introduction of a short list, not only by the politicalclimate in the United States towards the Soviet bloc, but also by the battle Act which lays down that aid to an allied country must or may(according to the item) be withheld in the event of strategic commoditiesbeing sent by that country to the Soviet bloc.    The United States Administra-tion have administered the Act with great tact and so far have never been forced to withhold aid;  it is highly unHkeTy that it would be possible forthem to accommodate the operation of the Battle Act to the adoption of the short list.    On the other hand, there may well be a longer term advantage in pressing a short list upon the United States Government and deployingthe arguments in favour of it.    By doing so, we may be able to persuade the Americans to agree to shorten the existing lists by more than they areat present inclined to contemplate.    The Foreign Office consider that ifwe are to have any hope of doing this, we must not put forward a proposalbased on narrower criteria than that suggested by the Ministry of Defence.The Europeans are likely to be very sympathetic with our general approachbut are unlikely to stand up against American pressure unless we are able ourselves to give them a firm lead.    On the other hand there would beobvious objections to any attempt on our part to gang up with the Europeansagainst the Americans.Contents of short list8.        The Ministry of Defence have drawn up a provisional list of items which might be controlled on the basis of paragraph 4(a) above.    their proposal would be that all the items on the list should be embargoed: the
1^present system of subsidiary lists of items subject to quantitative controller exchange of information would be dropped,,    Some of the items in the list are accepted by all Departments;  others would be resisted by someDepartments,,    The items on which there is general agreement are:-(i)    Arms and war equipment,,(ii)    Atomic energy equipment.The items in these two categories would be the same asthe corresponding items in the existing control lists.    Theyare all subject at present to embargo.(iii) Items which would contribute significantly to the militaryproduction of the Soviet bloc where the items incorporateadvanced technology or unique know-how.It is intended that the goods under this heading would all be itemised; there would probably be between 20 and 30 items,mainly machine tools.    Subject to agreement on the items,all Departments accept the principle behind this heading,(iv)    Tankers (including whale factory ships), floating docks,large ice breakers and fast merchant ships,,(v)    Cobalt^ nickel, molybdenum, titanium, germanium andvanadium.(vi)    Industrial diamonds and selected manufacturesIncorporating them.It is agreed that the ease with which diamonds may besmuggled makes this control extremely difficult to enforce.Diamonds are, however, of considerable strategic importance and are already embargoed.The following items, included by the Ministry of Defence in theirlist, are not agreed by other Departments:-(vii)    Electric power equipment.The Ministry of Defence justify the inclusion of this category on the following grounds.    While the Soviet blocnow produce electric power equipment in quantity, in theevent of war it is likely for various reasons to prove a weaklink in the chain of industrial production.    Present evidence is that the bloc is already seriously deficient in this equip-ment and is finding it most difficult to become self-sufficient.The effect of a shortage of power in an expanding economy in peace time is accentuated in war.    Power is sofundamental that the possibilities of disrupting an economyby lack of it are greater than in any other field.    It istherefore included in the Ministry of Defence short listbecause it is believed that a reduction in Soviet productionin war can be achieved by an embargo on exports of equipment in peace comparable to that achieved by the
range of miscellaneous embargo and quota controls whichthe present system imposes.    The Board of Trade, treasury and Ministry of Supply oppose the inclusion of this and thetwo following categories as being inconsistent with, their general approach (paragraph 4(b)),    They further argue asfollows.    At present only a few items in this field are subject to control.    To impose a wholesale embargo wouldmean the imposition of new controls on a United kingdom industry with a most valuable expert trade.    It wouldeliminate the most important sector (approximately50 per cent) in exports of United Kingdom manufacturedgoods to the U.S0S.R,,;  in 1950 these exports were about 6 millions: they are running at the rats of about 1 million this year and are tending to rise.    Theimposition of these new controls would probably cause theRussians to lose confidence in the willingness of the UnitedKingdom to expand trade and to expect new controls in anyother field in which they might in future become interested,Soviet imports of electric generating equipment, thoughcomparatively large, are marginal to their own productionand requirements;,    It is doubtful if denial of imports wouldhave any appreciable effect upon their war potential.    MostWestern countries attach importance to exports in this field,and would be likely to oppose its inclusion in a short list.There would also be the difficult problem of considerable priorcommitments.(viii)    Electronic equipment.The Ministry of Supply do not consider that there is anystrategic justification for restricting the export of this equip-ment except under the heading &quot;Arms and War Equipment&quot;,They do not think the export of our own products would assistthe Soviet electronic industry.    The Ministry of Defencejustify the inclusion of this category as follows.    The field ofelectronics is included on the list because of all the fields atpresent largely embargoed under the present system it is theone in which the Soviet bloc are known to be behindhand inknow-how, capacity and trained manpower.    Although thereis no doubt that the Soviet bloc can achieve any development oroutput of particular items in this field, in view of the rapidly increasing application of electronics to military and industrial production, no help should be given to increase their output of equipment, over the whole field.    In addition the justification for a strict embargo in the two crucial fields of electric powerequipment and electronics is that only thus is it possible to claim that damage comparable to that inflicted by the presentcontrol system would be done to the Soviet war potential,(ix)    Copper and lead the Board of Trade and Treasury oppose these items.Copper is already embargoed but lead is not, so that here alsothe Ministry of Defence are proposing a new restriction.    Atpresent evasion of the copper controls is widespread.    any system of control of these types of commodity will be much less effective in conditions of easy world supply such as may shortly come about than controls of manufactures.    TheMinistry of Defence argue that as the bloc is not self-sufficient in these metals an embargo on exports from theWest will limit the bloc&apos;s ability to create a stockpile.
9.       It will be noted that rubber has been omitted from the list.    Thisis because it has been agreed by all Departments that, though it is astrategically important material, it is impossible to prevent the soviet bloc from obtaining all the supplies they need from sources outside thecontrol area - mainly Indonesia.10,      On a very rough estimate, if the Ministry of Defence list were adopted (items (iii) to (ix) above) the present control lists would be halvedin scope.    If only the items acceptable to the Board of Trade and Treasury(items (iii) to (jar) inclusive) the list would of course be further reduced.We cannot assess what effect the introduction of the Ministry of Defencelist might have on the level of our trade but it is clear that the Board ofTrade list would open the way for an expansion.Transaction controls11.       It is common ground to both concepts of a short list that anycontrol system should be effectively enforced.    The main loophole in thepresent system is the lack of trans-shipment controls, especially inAntwerp and Rotterdam.    We have been operating controls over trans-shipment in British ports since November, 1951,    Some Paris Groupcountries have refused to follow suit unless all other Paris Group countriesintroduce both trans-shipment control and some form of financial ortransaction control,,IE, The Cabinet agreed on 10th February (C,C,(53) 8th Conclusions,Minute 5) that the Paris Group should be told that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would consider the introduction of transaction controls provided allother countries in the Paris Group introduced:&quot;(i)   trans-shipment controls, and(ii)    controls over the trading activities of their own nationals equivalent to the transaction controls which we would be prepared to apply,13,     On 30th July the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C, (53) 216) reporting that officials were satisfiedthat a transit authorisation scheme which certain countries were proposing to operate instead of trans-shipment control would be likely to be suffiently effective to justify the introduction of transaction controlsin the United Kingdom,    The Cabinet decided, however, (C,C,(53) 47thConclusions, Minute 7) that our representatives in the Paris Group should seek to secure deferment of a final decision as they considered the time was not opportune,14.      Our Delegation in Paris has therefore temporised; but our positionis becoming increasingly difficult, not only because we appear to be themain obstacle to general agreement on the operation of trans-shipmentand transaction controls, but also because it is common knowledge that many of the trans-shipments which we are out to prevent are financed in sterling by British merchants.    In the recent talks the Americans madeurgent representations that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should make thedecision to introduce these controls without delay.15,      All Departments agree that the shorter the list of controlled items the better are the chances of successful enforcement.
BP,We could not crudely bargain the imposition of transaction controls bythe United Kingdom against the acceptance of a short list.    We could,however, argue that the imposition of new controls is politically difficultat this juncture when public opinion is moving in favour of freer trade withthe Soviet bloc.    This difficulty would be less if, when transaction controlsare introduced, we could say that a substantial reduction would be made inthe control lists.    The Foreign Office accept this presentation of our case as a possible line, but maintain that whether or not we get a shortlist accepted we shall have to impose transaction controls without anyfurther quid pro quo.16.      While there is general agreement that we are bound by the statements made last February by our representatives in Paris and should go forward on the basis of the last paragraph, it is by no means clear thatthe imposition of these new controls will make the present control systemreally enforceable0    Transaction controls, taken together with the newphysical controls to be introduced on the Continent, would reduce but could not prevent evasions.    As time passed more ways round the newcontrols would be found.    Moreover, if, as is possible, the main Europeancurrencies moved towards some measure of convertibility, those countrieswhich relied on financial controls would to that extent be less able to stopevasions, while the United Kingdom would be maintaining the full rigour of transaction controls and, as a result, might be losing trade to theContinent.Issues for decision17*       The questions requiring consideration by Ministers are:-(a) All Departments are agreed that it is desirable to substitute for the present lists a much shorter listof items to be embargoed.    Do Ministers agree withthis view?(b) If so, should such a short list be based on the conceptput forward by the Ministry of Defence (paragraph 4(a))or that put forward by the Board of Trade and Treasury(paragraph 4(b)) as the criterion for an effective control system ?(c) If Ministers endorse either of the two concepts, do they agree that we should propose it to the Americans at thenext round of the present discussions (using the itemsset out in paragraph 8 as illustrative)?(d) Do they agree that our case on transaction controlsshould be presented as suggested in paragraph 15, butthat we should agree if necessary to impose the controlswithout the acceptance of a short list?
1^ANGLO-UNITED STATES TALKS ON SECURITY EXPORTCONTROLS ON TRADE WITH THE SOVIET BLOC3rd - 6th November, 1953The American Delegation, led by Mr, Lincoln Gordon, expoundedthe new line in United States policy which had been approved by thePresident, and the United Kingdom Delegation on the v/hole confined them-selves to exploring what this new look was likely to amount to.    We took the opportunity of referring in general terms to the &quot;short list&quot; idea andalso brought up certain specific points affecting the controls,2,        The American new policy consists in a change of emphasis ratherthan in any recasting of the control system.    It takes account of the newappreciation of the strategic situation which is becoming generally accepted, i, e, no immediate danger but the prospect of a long period of tension;  of the development of a sellers1 market in most commodities;and of the political difficulties in the exercise by the Americans of thesame rigour as in the past in applying security controls in Europe,    Theresult is that the Americans now accept that there should be no substantialfurther extension of the lists of items controlled but rather that the criteria applies to items already listed should be more narrowly construedsthat there should be an easier policy on quotas for List II items and forexceptions but that there should be no massive down-grading.    The counter-part to the easier policy on the lists would be a general Ughtening-up ofthe machinery of control so as to make the whole system more effective.They made a pressing appeal that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should introduce transaction controls in order to enable the Transit AuthorisationCertificate Scheme to be put into effect on the Continent, and put forward a number of other suggestions designed to improve the ability of the paris group to stop diversions.    They made it clear that the United StatesGovernment wished to escape from its present position of internationalpoliceman and to substitute co-operative action through the Group, helped by a strengthened Secretariat.3.        When we referred to our &quot;short list&quot; idea, the Americans made no general comment because we were unable to tell them anything aboutthe composition or the length of the &quot;short list&quot;;  they said, however, thatthey did not see how it would be possible to produce a revised list except as a result of a detailed examination of each item and that this would bea lengthy process,4.        It was also apparent that there is a difference of emphasis betweenthe United States and the United Kingdom views on trade with the soviet bloc per se.    In their fear that some at least of the Western countries may become excessively dependent on Soviet supplies or markets, the americans would clearly like the easier supply position in the world tobe used by the Western countries to enable them to turn to other sourcesfor supplies previously obtained from the Soviet bloc.    This consideration will no doubt affect their views about the economic arguments in favourof exceptions and about Soviet trade tactics.    We made clear that, while we agreed that the situation should be watched, we saw little danger of excessive dependence on the bloc developing and that until it did bothimporters and exporters would normally treat Soviet supplies andmarkets like those of other areas.
5.        Our general conclusion is that it will take a considerable time totranslate the American new look into concrete cases and that, even then,there will be a wida ga.p between it and any list that is likely to result fromthe &quot;short list&quot; idea.    On the other hand, -the Americans are clearly readyto take properly into account the general considerations which came into our &quot;balance of advantage&quot; argument and to be less difficult in the futureabout exceptions, as well as other types of individual cases which in thepast have caused most trouble.    The importance which they justifiablyattach to improving the effectiveness of the control system, and particularly to the introduction of transaction controls by the United Kingdom as a means of securing the transit control on the Continent Scheme^ suggeststhat if we can co-operate in this field it may be possible to push the liberalaspects of the new United States attitude on the lists further than now appears likelya    There isK however, nothing to suggest that they can bepushed so far as to be ready to accept a short list of the kind that we havenow under consideration.
