(53) 30128th OCTOBER, 1953.CABINETTHE REGENCY bill memorandum by the Home secretary at the meeting of the Cabinet on 6th July I reported to mycolleagues The Queen&apos;s wish that the Regency Bill should provide that, inthe event of her incapacity and of there being no surviving child of herselfand the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke should nevertheless be Regent duringthe remainder of her incapacity.   My colleagues agreed that a decision onThe Queen&apos;s wish might be deferred until nearer the time of the Bill&apos;sintroduction.   (C.C.(53) 39th Conclusions, Minute 2),2. I have now taken The Queen&apos;s pleasure and discussed thematter with Her Majesty.   I informed Her Majesty that my colleagues were anxious to know that Her Majesty had considered the aspect of the next-in-linereceiving training and experience.   I drew Her Majesty&apos;s attention to thepossibility that the heir to the throne might be a grandchild of Herself andthe Duke of Edinburgh,   The Queen intimated that after full considerationof all aspects her wish was for the Duke of Edinburgh to be Regent in theevent of her incapacity in the absence of a child or grandchild qualified to bethe Regent.3. I now submit for the approval of my colleagues -(a) a draft Bill to amend the Regency Acts;(b) a draft Message from The Queen;(c) draft Motions for the Addresses from each House in replyto the Message.4. The Bill makes the following provision:(a) In the event of a child of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburghsucceeding to the throne while under 18 years of age, the duke of Edinburgh to be Regent during the minority of the sovereign (Clause 1(1)).(b) In the event of the total incapacity of The Queen, the duke of Edinburgh to be Regent in the absence of a child or grandchild of Her Majesty and His Royal Highnessqualified to be Regent (Clause 1(2)),(c) The Duke of Edinburgh as Regent to delegate the royalfunctions to Counsellors of State (Clause 1(4)),Without this provision the incapacitated Queen would be the
first Counsellor of State and the four next in successionwould be the four next in succession after the Duke of edinburgh,   It also has the effect of providing that if the duke of Edinburgh, being Regent for an infant Sovereign,marries again and delegates the royal functions, hissecond wife will not be a Counsellor of State,(d) The heir to the throne to become Regent at the age of 18in the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign  (Clause 2),The earlier draft of the Bill attached to C, (53) 183 limited theamendment of the Regency Act, 1937, to enable the heir tothe throne to become Regent at 18 (instead of 21) years ofage, to the children of Her Majesty and His Royal Highness.In view of the reason for this change of the law (namely,that the heir should be capable of becoming Regent at theage at which he is capable of becoming Sovereign) and also of the provision made relating to grandchildren in clause 1 (2)of the present Bill, I think the provision in clause 2 shouldbe as now drafted.   The Queen has agreed to this.(e) Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to be added to the listof persons to be Counsellors of State.   (Clause 3),(f)        The repeal in clause 4(2) is consequential upon clause 2becoming general,,5, I should like to submit the terms of the Royal Message to her majesty for approval forthwith, so that it may be communicated to the other commonwealth Governments without delay and be delivered to parliament as early as possible in the next Session,6, I therefore ask my colleagues to approve the draft Bill, thedraft Message and the draft Motions in reply, and to agree to the draft message being communicated to Commonwealth Governments after receiving the Royal approval,D.M.F,Home Office, 5.W.I.27th October, 1953.

The uncertainty of human, life leads me to put you in mind of the possibility that a child of Myself and My dear Husband may accede to the Throne whilst under the age of eighteen years and I would recommend to your consideration whether it be not expedient to provide that, in that event and also in the event of a Regency becoming necessary during Mylifetime while there is no child or grandchild of Ours who can be the K.egent,My Husband should be the Regent and be charged with the guardianshipof the person of the Sovereign.   I would also recommend that you should take into consideration the expediency of amending the law so that the heirapparent or heir presumptive to the Throne should be capable of being Regentif he or she has attained the age of eighteen years.Further it is My desire to put you in mind that it will not under existing law be competent, on occasion arising hereafter for a delegation of royal functions to Counsellors of State, for My Mother to be of theCounsellors.   Consideration of the affection and confidence which you and all my people have evinced for and in Her leads me to recommend that you should take into consideration also the expediency or securing to Her theopportunity of rendering as a Counsellor of State further service to you and tothem.I shall be prepared to concur with you in any provision for amendment of the Regency Acts, 1937 and 1943, or other measures which may appear to you necessary or expedient for securing the purposes to which Ihave alluded.DRAFT MOTIONS FOR ADDRESSES IN reply.
