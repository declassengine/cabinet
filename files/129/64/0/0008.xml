THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 7C (53) 3083rd November, 1953CABINETTRIESTENote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a record of a conversation between Sir Pierson Dixon, Deputy Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and the Yugoslav Ambassador on 30th October, 1953.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2nd November,1953.45101
TRIESTEOn the Secretary of State&apos;s instructions, I asked the Yugoslav Ambassador tocall this afternoon, explaining that we wished to keep in touch with him over theTrieste question.The interview was extremely friendly, and Dr. Velebit at the end of it expressedgreat appreciation and the hope that we would ask him to call again from time totime in order that he might be kept in touch.I told the Ambassador that, with the United States and French Governments,we were trying to find a basis, acceptable to all the parties, for a Five-Power Cbn-ference. This, as he would recognise, was no easy task. But we believed we had made some progress. It would still probably be some days before we were in aposition to make definite proposals. When we came to do so, there was no reasonfor the Yugoslav Government to anticipate that they would be faced by a &quot; diktat &quot;or publicity. We felt that a solution could be facilitated if the preliminaries wereconducted in secrecy between the Governments concerned and not under the glareof publicity. In this connexion we had been pleased to see the restrained tone ofpublic statements in Yugoslavia, and we hoped that this would continue. On theother hand, we felt that the somewhat heated tone of Belgrade Radio was not ahelpful contribution to the situation, and I hoped very much that it could bemoderated.I added that, although we could not speak for the French Government, I felt sure that M. Bidault was giving wise counsel to the Italian Prime Minister in Paris.Dr. Velebit did not ask me to foreshadow what line our proposals might take.He assured me that the Yugoslav Government were most anxious to play their partin making a conference possible and in reaching a compromise solution. He quiteaccepted my points about publicity and said that he would draw attention to what i had said about the Belgrade Radio. As regards public statements, we must notforget that Yugoslavia was now in an election period.We agreed that what precedes should be reported by the Ambassador to hisGovernment. The Ambassador added that we could be sure that the yugoslav government attached such importance to maintaining and developing politicaland economic relations with Great Britain that they would do their best to preventthe Trieste issue resulting in a cooling of them.Dr. Velebit proceeded to give me some personal reflections of his own. Hewas troubled by two points.In the first place, his guess was that we might be contemplating a final settle-ment on the basis of a partition of the territory with adjustments under which theSlovene communes in Zone A would go to Yugoslavia and the three Italian townsin Zone B would go to Italy. He did not think that his Government would be ableto accept a swap of this kind, because the only part of the Free Territory whichwas really worth anything was the City of Trieste, which moreover containedsomething like 40,000 Slovenes. I commented that the impossibility of reaching a fully ethnic solution was one of the factors which had led us to take the decisionof 8th October. .Secondly, Dr. Velebit felt sure that his Government would be disturbed by thediscussions which had been proceeding in London with officials of Allied military government (A.M.G.). I said that these were technical discussions and the par-ticipants were not authorised to discuss policy. Dr. Velebit replied that this mightbe so, but the mere holding of discussions, even if their scope was solely technical,indicated an intention to proceed with the transfer of Zone A to Italy. Since thisis a vital element in the proposals still under discussion with the French and the americans, I did not feel free to reveal that all we are contemplating at the moment is a further step in the Italianisation of the administration of Zone A with finalauthority for the present remaining with the Zone Commander.Dr. Velebit did not press either of these points with any heat. He added thecomment that the Secretary of State&apos;s statement in the House was extremely skilfuland would certainly have done nothing in Yugoslavia to make the situation moredifficult.I finally made the point to Dr. Velebit that our decision of 8th October was intended as a sincere contribution to a final settlement of a problem which we felt it essential to get out of the way in order that good relations could be established between Yugoslavia and Italy and an existing gap in our Western defences closed.It would quite wrong to suppose that we had acted as we did in the interests ofone of the parties to the dispute. Dr. Velebit made no comment, but it was clear to me that he for one understands that our motives were disinterested.
