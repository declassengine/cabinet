INLAND TELEGRAPH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandWhile I realise that the cheap night service recommended by theHome Affairs Committee will go a long way to meet the requirements ofthose who have no telephone and who may have to send &quot;life and death&quot;messages, I feel that to increase the minimum day-time charge for12 words from l/6d. to 3/- is too steep and will cause a lot of hostilecriticism.2. I therefore wish to put forward the following suggestions in theinterest of those who have no telephone of their own and, even if they could get one, would not feel able to afford one:-(l)   The cheap night service is a very good proposal andshould be agreed to.(2)   As regards the day-time service, the charge for thefirst 12 words should not exceed 2/6d. - or,preferably, 2/-,(3)   The charge for additional words above the first12 should be stepped up to compensate thePostmaster-General for the money he will loseby reducing the initial charge (i. e. first12 words) below the proposed 3/- minimum.This is an actuarial calculation which I do not attempt to work out.    Admittedly, it will throwa heavier charge than the Committee advocateon the longer messages but this does not mattermuch because it will be borne by the business community (e. g. fish trade) who will chargetheir telegrams to expenses anyway, and bythe betting people who must lump it.(4)   The Press should pay the full cost of their telegrams.They can afford it and should not be subsidised.(This will save an additional  20,000.)(5)   Greetings telegrams should be charged as recommended by the Committee,J.S.Scottish Office, S.
