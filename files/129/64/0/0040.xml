a.t.8-5TH DECE MBER, 1953CABINETINLAND TELEGRAMSMemorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe deficit on inland telegrams has risen alarmingly in thelast few years.    The deficit forecast for 1953/54 is  4, 8 millions.The service is in fact now quite put of balance j with the averagetelegram bringing in a little more than 2/- against an average costof 5/-,    I have been concerned about this situation for some time andthe Select Committee on Estimates, in their Eleventh Report  -Session 1952/53, severely crticised the continuance of losses on this s cale ,2, Every effort has been made to reduce the loss by reducingcosts but it is clear that an effective reduction in the deficit can only beachieved by increasing charges.    Any attempt to stimulate traffic by reducing charges would only result in a substantial increase in the deficit,3, Traffic has been, and still is, declining and this long-termtrend is bound to continue because of the competition of an efficientpostal service and the increasing use of telephones,    A complete census of traffic was taken in One week in 1951.    It showed that 47 per cent ofthe traffic was business, about 18 per cent contained greetings and lessthan 3 per cent was &quot;life and death&quot; messages and other bad news.On this basis, the expected traffic of 34 million telegrams in 1953/54would comprise about 16 million business telegrams and 18 millionsocial telegrams, of which 6 million would be Greetings telegrams and only 1 million &quot;life and death&quot; and other bad news.4, The Post Office surplus has now shrunk to about  5 millions and there is a danger that other Post Office charges may soon have to beincreased.    In my view, it would be most inadvisable to increase themto carry a mounting deficit on inland telegrams,5, After detailed discussion in the Home Affairs Committee(H.A,(53) 27th Meeting, Minute 2), I now put forward with their full support the following proposals(i)   The charge for ordinary telegrams should be increased from l/6d. for 12 words to 3/-.(ii)  An overnight telegram service, without the Greetingsfacility, should be introduced at a charge of 1/6d.for 12 words.SECRET CABINET  ocpipcc.(53) 340 RECORD COPY        copy nov y
at?(iii)  Increases should be made in the charges forPress telegrams.The proposals are set out in detail in the Appendix which also includesfigures illustrating the trend of inland telegram traffic and financesince the war.6, The proposals would reduce the forecast deficit for 1953/54to about  2 millions.    The Home Affairs Committee are satisfied thatan increase in the standard charge of l/6d, to 3/- is fully justified on financial grounds and that a lower increase would not be appreciablymore acceptable,    The analysis of telegraph traffic in the Appendixshows that the really urgent &quot;life and death&quot; messages which are bound to be sent by even the poorest members of the community are infact very few in number and that even social telegrams of all kindsaverage little more than one per family per year.    It remains true,nevertheless, that the telegraph service fulfils a real and continuingsocial need for people without telephones.    We have therefore soughta means of maintaining a cheap service to meet this need, at least.inpart, whilst still reducing the deficit to a reasonable level.    It is ourconsidered view that this object can be attained by offering an overnightservice at l/6d, for 12 words and l^d, a word thereafter (the presentcharge), under which an ordinary telegram (i, e,, not a Greetingstelegram) can be handed in at any time up to 10 p, m, , for deliveryfirst thing the following morning.    Such a facility would be ofparticular advantage to people without telephones in country districts where the last post goes early.    We recognise that an increase in thestandard charge for ordinary telegrams from l/6d, to 3/- will be unpopular but think that this is an honest way of dealing with a difficult situation, and that the concession of a l/6d, overnight service should go a long way to meet objections that the increase in theordinary telegraph charges to 3/- would hit the poor man too hard,7, Press telegrams have been handled at specially low ratessince the 1368 Telegraph Act, but the present degree of preferential treatment-is impossible to justify.    Our proposals will eliminate thepresent double concession of more words for a lower charge and will reduce the deficit on Press telegrams from  55,000 to about  20,000,Most Press messages go over private wires which the Press rent atthe same rates as other renters,8, The Home Affairs Committee decided against referring thematter to a committee including Opposition Members, as suggested byMr, Ness Edwards in the recent debate on the Post Office (&quot;Money) Bill,9, I accordingly invite the Cabinet to approve the proposals set out in paragraph 5 above and to agree that a statement should be madeas soon as possible after the Recess.    Legislation will be required.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1, ,4TH DECEMBER , 1953.
