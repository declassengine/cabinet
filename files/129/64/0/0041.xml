O rt jj .&apos; i   .- I    \j I&quot; r I v^C. r7TH DECEMBER., 1953,cabinet trade AND PAY^NTS POLICY WITH Japan Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerGeneralThe Sterling Payments Agreement with 3&quot;apan ends on31st December, and a Committee of Ministers under my chairmanshiphas been considering what policy we should pursue-in the negotiations with have just started.     There are two matters - the extent to whichwe should relax import restrictions on imports from Japan, and thequestion of credit - on which the views of the Cabinet are needed,2. It is generally agreed that we should try to keep trade betweenthe sterling area and Japan at a high level, and that a renewal of the sterling Payments Agreement would provide the best basis for thispurpose.    What would suit us best would, of course, be for the sterling area to earn a surplus with Japan, which she would finance by her ownmeans (e. g. by using hor substantial dollar reserves) and withoutfurther restricting her imports.    A renewal of the Sterling payments agreement is quite consistent with this aim, though it will be difficultto secure from the Japanese.3. It seems unlikely that Japan herself will object to the renewal of the Agreement;  the difficulty arises from the fact that her continuousdeficit with the Sterling Area in 1953 has more than exhausted hersterling reserves.    The expectation of an improvement in Japan&apos;ssterling receipts, on the basis of which we gave her extraordinaryfacilities last summer, has not materialised and Japan now faces thesematuring liabilities as well as her current deficit.     We now learn thatshe is proposing to meet her immediate difficulties by drawing sterlingfrom the International Monetary Fund (a procedure which has someadvantages for us).    But she wants to bring her trade with the sterling area into balance in 1954, by seeking further relaxations in the import restrictions of the United Kingdom and certain colonies, by restrictingher own sterling purchases and by adopting clearing arrangements with individual Commonwealth countries.    She has so far shown no sign ofwillingness to use her substantial dollar reserves,4. On the receipts side of the account, Japan has stated that shehopes to earn from the sterling area in 1954 some  205 millions(including invisibles) compared with, estimated total receipts for 1953of about  124 millions.     Our own estimate is that if no relaxationswere made in the United Kingdom, and the Colonies were kept to theirminimum requirements, Japan&apos;s receipts (including invisibles) might beSECRETC.(53) 341
about  186 millions   - or about  200 millions if Kong Kong provedable to take the maximum that has been suggested.    (Hong Kong has said that she might take between  25 and  45 millions of Japaneseimports in 1954;  officials think that a prudent figure would be 31 millions).    On the payments side of the account, Japan is proposing to spend  180 millions in 1954 ( 205 millions including invisibles)compared with about  220 millions in 1953 ( 24-2.5 millions includinginvisibles).     This compares with sterling area hopes and intentions of  193 -  217 millions ( 215 -  23 9 millions including invisibles).We do not yet know where the reductions would take place, but it isclear that such measures, as well as damaging Commonwealth primaryproducers, would restrict our earnings from oil, shipping and insurance,and would also of course lead to all the disadvantages of a dwindlinglevel of trade.Relaxation of Import Restrictions5. We must clearly urge Japan to finance her deficit with the sterling area by buying sterling out of her dollar reserves, and we musttry to persuade her to cease her present distinction, for exchange controlpurposes, between the sterling and dollar areas as sources of supply.But even so, we should be wise to make some relaxation in the existing restrictions on the import of Japanese goods where we can, that is inthe Colonies and the United Kingdom.    Relaxation will be largely at theexpense of United Kingdom producers and will inevitably arouse political criticism if carried too-far;  but we must also bear in mind the real demand in the Colonies for low-cost Japanses goods, and the difficulty ofjustifying the continuance of restrictions on their imports.    We mustindeed recognise that the maintenance of any restrictions of this sortcannot be justified on balance of payments grounds;  we afe in factusing quotas to protect United Kingdom manufacturers, and especially the textile industries.    Moreover unless we provide Japan with this trade we can hardly hope to induce her not to switch trade to the dollar area,Japanese Exports, to the; Colonies.6, It is generally agreed that the Colonies engaged in entrepot trade should import all the goods they want from Japan.    The minimum importsfrom Japan needed by the other Colonies would amount to  21 millions in1954, whereas the maximum of the quotas suggested by these Coloniesthemselves would total  33 millions.     The President of the Board of Tradeis unwilling to agree to quotas for these Colonies totalling  33 millions on the grounds that to do so would put an insuperable obstacle in the wayof United Kingdom textile exports to West Africa.    He is prepared toagree to allow all Colonies except Nigeria to import Japanese goods up tothe maximum value which they desire, but would restrict Nigeria to an import quota of  10 millions;  this would be a substantial increase overthe current level of imports by these Colonies from Japan, and the 10 millions quota for Nigeria would itself represent an increase of50 per cent over that Colony&apos;s imports frosm Japan in the current year.(In addition, the President of the Board of Trade would try to persuadeNigeria within its increased quota not to allow a disproportionate increasein their imports of Japanese textiles).     These proposals would providefor 3&quot;apanese imports into these Colonies in 1954 to a total of 28 millions.    The Colonial Secretary on the other hand thinks that,as we cannot justify asking these Colonies to continue restrictions on theimport of Japanese goods on balance of payments grounds, we must allow
xnthem quotas totalling  3 3 millions in 1954, although we should try toobtain an informal agreement in the case of Nigeria to restrict imports to a level considerably below the  15 millions quota which this proposal would allow them.    It will, of course, similarly be difficult to justifyto the Japanese the continuance of restrictions on their imports,particularly into the Colonies,Japanese Exports to the United kingdom. On present policy, Japanese exports to the United Kingdom in1954 would amount to about  10 millions,    The President of the Board ofTrade would agree to-increase this by granting a quota of  2 millions for grey cloth for re-export after processing together with small quotas for the principal kinds of manufactured goods of which Japan was atraditional pre-war supplier (piece-goods, apparel, paper, board, and paper manufactures, pottery, toys and buttons) totalling  1.3 millions.A higher quota than  2 millions for imports of grey cloth would haveadvantages from the point of view of processors and exporters, but might lead to a danger of unemployment&apos; in the cloth manufacturing industry.     To the extent that we feel unable to relax the restrictionson the import of Japanese goods into the Colonies up to the maximumsuggested by the Colonies, there is of course a strong case for makinga larger concession on imports into the United Kingdom;   and the balanceof advantage might be in favour of increasing the  2 millions quotasuggested by the President of the Board of Trade for grey cloth, even ifthis meant reducing the small concessions proposed for the othertraditional Japanese manufactures.8, If we limit our import concessions to those proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade, Japan&apos;s sterling receipts in 1954 mightbe some  196 millions - or  210 millions if the higher figure is taken forHong Kong (see paragraph 4),    Sterling area export earnings from hertherefore only reach the level we des4re ( 215 --  239 millions) if sheaccepts some trading deficit in 1954 - a deficit which might vary betweenas little as  5 millions (if Hong Kong took the maximum, while the sterling area as a whole only exported the lower figure) and as much as 43 millions (if Hong Kong took the figure suggested by officials , and the sterling area exported at the higher rate).    In any event, of course,Japan will start from a weak position, as she has no more sterling thana bare working balance.Credit9, Our present line is to seek to persuade the Japanese to financeany such deficit by the use of their own resources - e. g, their dollar reserves.     It may well be, however, that they v/ill argue that insteadwe should give them credit.    So far they have not asked for this, but have referred in vague terms to the possibility that they may need further temporary facilities.    It is generally agreed that there are no economic grounds for offering Japan credit.    It would not provide any solution to the problem of her trading deficit with which she will continueto be faced for some time, and is contrary to our general external financial policy.    It is especially unnecessary in view of the fact that japan still has substantial dollar reserves, which are available tocover sterling deficits.
R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I. ,7TB DECEMBER, 1953.10, In short, an offer of credit would only be justified if, on political grounds, we were unable to relax import restrictions in theColonies and the United Kingdom to the extent necessary to preventJapan from making substantial further cuts in her imports from the sterling area,    I feel that we cannot finally decide our attitude on credituntil the negotiations have gone further, and certainly not until we havediscovered how far the Japanese will be ready to use their own resources to finance sterling purchases.    The guidance of our colleagues is however now required on the extent to which we should relax the present restrictions on Japanese imports, both into the United Kingdom and theColonies,
