CONFIDENTIAL C A E..: : - - - c      N       ? 3-;- RECORD copy . (53) 36530th December, 1953CABINETPRIVILEGES  AND  IMMUNITIES  FOR  INTERNATIONALORGANISATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in July 1952 the Cabinet agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government shouldaccord to the International Organisations listed in Annex III to C. (52) 191, the privileges and immunities prescribed by the agreements concluded by the respectiveorganisations, and authorised the presentation to Parliament of the ten Orders inCouncil required for this purpose.  (C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 6.)2. Since then it has become unnecessary to make Orders in respect of theInternational Maritime Consultative Organisation and the International trade organisation, since neither of these bodies has come into existence. It is also possible to defer the making of the World Health Organisation (Amendment) Order.Further, the Order required in respect of the International Wheat Council has nowbeen made (authority to present this Order separately was obtained because of the expiry of the old International Wheat Agreement on 31st July, 1953, and theunlikelihood that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would participate in the new agreement contemplated).3. On the other hand two new draft Orders for presentation to Parliamenthave been prepared, namely:  (a) the Council of Europe (Amendment) Order;(b) the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Amendment) Order.The first of these is to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to ratify the Protocol tothe General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council, details of whichare in C. (52) 372. The second will correct a drafting error in the original Order.4. Thus eight Orders are required; details are set out in the appendix which includes a brief analysis of them.5. Mindful of Parliaments sensitive and critical attitude towards the further extension of privileges and immunities of any kind to officials of international organisations (confirmation of which was provided in the House of Lords whenthe International Wheat Council Order came under discussion), I thought carefullyabout the advisability of presenting all these Orders and I have considered whetherit might be tactically expedient to drop some of them (specifically, those concerningthe Universal Postal Union, the International Telecommunications Union and theWorld Meteorological Organisation in relation to which Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave not accepted any binding legal obligation to grant privileges and immunities)in order that the prospects of inducing Parliament to agree to the others might be improved.6. My conclusion is that no justification can be found for such a course forthe following reasons:  (a) The basic issue is whether any valid grounds can be adduced for assuming the obligation to grant privileges and immunities to certain Inter-national Organisations but not to others. As Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have accepted the principle that such privileges and immunities45408Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953
should be granted, (with suitable variations in individual cases), adiscriminatory policy cannot be justified when regarded from theinternational standpoint.(b) Further, a selective process of the kind which I have considered wouldinvolve discrimination against certain older organisations of establishedreputation in favour of others of more recent origin.(c) In elaboration of the arguments in C. (52) 191 I emphasise the desirabilityof providing an incentive to International Organisations to hold their meetings in the United Kingdom and even to establish their head-quarters here, which they would be most unlikely to do unless theywere assured that in the United Kingdom their officials would enjoyconditions which are not markedly inferior to those to which they areaccustomed in other countries. Considerations of national prestige andof the inflow of foreign currency are involved.(d) Only very few of the international officials concerned are of a seniorityentitling them to claim the full range of privileges and immunitiescontemplated in the enabling Statute, and most of them are notordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. But at the same time thereis permanently resident in London a Diplomatic Corps comprisingsome 1,200 members of full diplomatic rank and a further 1,800 persons of lower rank, all of whom enjoy the diplomatic privileges and immunities-ties appropriate to their status. There seems no logical ground for extending these privileges and immunities to the Diplomatic Corpswhilst withholding them from the international officials.7.   I therefore recommend (a) that I should be authorised to present to Parliament the Orders listed inthe appendix;(b) that Parliamentary time should be allowed to present these Orders duringthe present Session.A. E.Foreign Office, SWA,29th December, 1953.
APPENDIXAnalysis of Draft Orders in council. Customs Co-operation council the 1950 Convention establishing the Council has been ratified by her majesty&apos;s Government and is in force. It embodies certain obligations.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are now in breach of these obligations and will beuntil the Order is made.2. World Meteorological organisation the relevant agreement specified certain privileges, but says that they shailbe defined in a separate agreement between members to be prepared in consultationwith the United Nations. There is thus no direct legal obligation but the cabinet have accepted that our position under the General Convention for the immunities and Privileges of Specialised Agencies is extremely weak, particularly as her majesty&apos;s Government were one of the main originators of the policy represented by the Convention.3. Council of Europe (Amendment)This Order is required to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to ratify the protocol to the General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council,which extends the provisions of the General Agreement. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have ratified the General Agreement, and have signed the Protocol (as explained in C. (52) 372) but have not yet ratified it.4. North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationThis Order is required to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to ratify the 1951Agreement on the Status of the Organisation, which was signed by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment after full negotiation in which the United Kingdom representative took a leading part.5. European Payments UnionHer Majesty&apos;s Government have signed but not yet ratified the Agreement forthe establishment of a European Payments Union concluded at Paris on19th September, 1950. Article 24 of this Agreement makes provision for the grantof certain privileges and immunities to the Union and to its funds and assets. TheAgreement can come into force only on ratification by all the signatories, but bya Protocol of Provisional Application bearing the same date the signatories under -took to apply its provisions in advance of ratification. It is regarded as highly desirable that Her Majesty&apos;s Government, who occupy a prominent place in theUnion, should be enabled to ratify the Agreement, and to this end the Order inCouncil must be made.6 and 7. International Telecommunications Union Universal Postal UnionNo specific obligations are mentioned in these agreements, and there is, there-fore, no legal obligation to accept in respect of them the provisions of theInternational Convention on Privileges and Immunities for Specialised Agencies ofthe United Nations. The moral obligation to do so is, however, undisputed. TheConvention has been accepted by both organisations.8. International Civil Aviation Organisation (Amendment)An Order is necessary here because of what was presumably an error in the drafting of the original Order whereby only the Council of the Organisation wascatered for and not the Assembly or any other body. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave, therefore, been in breach of their obligations since 1949.
