Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1953SECRET Copy No.  7C. (53) 32723rd November, 1953CABINETUNITED STATES ECONOMIC AID TO EGYPTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet on 17th November (CC. (53) 67 Conclusions, Minute 4)of the lines on which I proposed to reply to the message which I had received fromthe United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, on the subject of United Stateseconomic aid to Egypt. I now circulate for the information of my colleagues the texts of Mr. Dulles&apos;s message and my reply.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th November, 1953.Message from Mr. Dulles dated 14th NovemberWe have reached a point in Israeli-Arab relations where it is of utmost importance to announce allotment of economic aid to Arabs to counter recentannouncement economic aid allotment to Israel. The only place where we wouldbe in shape promptly to make an economic allotment of substantial size is Egypt.We have been holding up all assistance to/Egypt in effort help settlement Suezmatter. However this settlement has dragged out to a point where we cannot continue much longer without very grave effect upon all our Arab relationships.If you felt that it was likely there would soon be new moves in Suez matter whichmight produce agreement, we could still hold up briefly, but our time is fast runningout.Before making final decision would appreciate your reactions.Message to Mr. Dulles dated 17th NovemberI must most urgently ask you to postpone a decision on proposed economic aid to Egypt at least until we have had a chance of discussing it at Bermuda.In my view an allotment to Egypt at this juncture could not fail to givepublicity to a major divergence of British and American policies, and thus to havea serious effect on Anglo-American relations. It would have the appearance of encouraging the Egyptians to stand out in their demands against us and it would remove an important inducement to them to reach an agreement with us.45225
