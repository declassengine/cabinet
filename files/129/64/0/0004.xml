ItCOPY NC. -2/cabinet coal imports memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power on 9th July the Cabinet authorised me to import, through the national coal Board, not more than 1 million tons of large coal from countriesincluded in the European Coal and Steel Community, but took note that I wouldnot in the first instance authorise the Board to buy more than half a million tons, and would use my discretion to buy only so much of the remaininghalf a million tons as proved necessary to supplement prospective home supplies (C.C.(53) 41st Conclusions, Minute 7).2.        Some 600,000 tons of coal have already been bought from Franceand Belgium.    400,000 tons of this have arrived, the remainder will havearrived before the end of the year, and I am now satisfied that it will benecessary to import the balance of the 1 million tons.    Owing largely tothe recent French coal strike, we cannot get all that we need from western europe but must buy some part of it from Poland.    Last August, with theagreement of the Lord President, I allowed the National Coal Board to haveexploratory discussions with the Poles, and I now wish to authorise them tonegotiate for the purchase from Poland of such part of the necessary400,000 tons as Western Europe is not able to supply.3.        I understand that the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade are in agreement withthis course, but I think the Cabinet should be informed of what I propose.G.L.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,2ND NOVEMBER, 1953.secret.(53) 3043RD NOVEMBER, 1953
