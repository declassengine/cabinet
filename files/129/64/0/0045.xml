RECORD OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS AND THE PRIME MINISTEROF CEYLON, SIR JOHN KOTALAWALA, ON 3rd DECEMBER, 1953I had a final talk with the Prime Minister this morning. I think Sir OliverGoonetilleke had reported pretty fully and accurately to him our conversation.1. The Prime Minister began by asking my advice on how to handle theIndian negotiations. I said I would advise him in a personal capacity on the lineof how I would conduct the negotiations if I were Prime Minister of Ceylon. I said that in the first place he should go into the negotiations with a definite plan of how far he was prepared to go and the terms on which he would settle. I thenspoke along the general line I had discussed with Sir Oliver. The Prime ministers aid he was in full agreement with this.The Prime Minister then asked me what his constitutional rights were inlegislating about Indians who were, as members of the Commonwealth, Britishsubjects although not United Kingdom citizens. I said that legally he was entitledto pass any immigration legislation he pleased. That was constantly done by other commonwealth countries. The Prime Minister said that he had in mind thefollowing plan:  (a) He was prepared to accept as residents in Ceylon all Indians who were nowhere. What he must stop was unlimited illicit immigration. he therefore proposed to introduce a registration card system which wouldbe non-discriminatory, and under which every inhabitant of Ceylon,whatever his race, would be registered and have an identity card. Itwould in fact be an exact counterpart of our identity card system inthe United Kingdom which had operated during the war until weabolished it a year or two ago.   I said I could see no objection to this.(b) He wished to have the right to deport any illicit immigrants. The PrimeMinister said that the practical difficulty about this was that Mr. Nehruwould be unwilling to receive these people back in India. The PrimeMinister asked if he could send them somewhere else, somewhere likeBorneo. I said certainly not. If they came from India they must go back to India. The Prime Minister thought Mr. Nehru would jib atthis. I said I did not think that Mr. Nehru could maintain that attitude in negotiation. Mr. Nehru had frequently said that he did not wishIndians to be in a country where they were not welcome.(c) There remained the practical issue that, whatever agreement Mr. Nehrumade, the smuggling of Indian immigrants would go on. I thought thepractical way of dealing with this was to catch the boats which broughtthem over. It would be quite reasonable to pass legislation making the carriage of illicit immigrants an offence, and that any boat foundcarrying illicit immigrants would be confiscated. This legislation shouldbe non-discriminatory and would apply whether the boat was an Indianor Ceylon boat. In fact of course most of the boats would be Indian.The Prime Minister told me that the boats were worth at least  100.I said that if the smugglers found their boats seized they would soonfind this an unprofitable enterprise.I told the Prime Minister I thought he would be wise to wait to put his variousplans into action until after he had concluded his negotiations with Mr. Nehru.2. The Prime Minister then got on to the commercial side. He said thatBritish co-operation was vital to Ceylon. I said we were anxious to help, but thatit rested with his Government to create and maintain conditions in whichco-operation would be forthcoming. I said to him, as I had said to Sir OliverGoonetilleke, that there was certainly a feeling in the United Kingdom that british firms were more welcome in India and Paikstan than they were here and thatthey had not the same pinpricks and handicaps over Ceylonisation. I was all forthe Ceylonese having the best possible chances in business; but you could not havea mathematical formula. The Prime Minister appeared to be shocked at the idea that India and Pakistan treated British firms better. I said there it was, and thatwas the state of mind. That was the impression in British industry and commerce.We must get rid of that.   It did not help either Ceylon or Britain.   The Prime
SWINTON.Minister assured me that he would do his best. He then volunteered a numberof criticisms of Mr. Senanayake, the Minister of Commerce, just as Sir Oliver had done, and said that he had already told Mr. Senanayake to stop making speeches and to begin doing sensible things and not f oolish ones, and that he would be kept in order.3. The Prime Minister then went on to discuss his own position and the stability of his Government. There was always a good deal of intrigue in Ceylon.(Though he did not say so, the Prime Minister has contributed a good deal tothis himself in the past.) But he thought the Cabinet would play together reason-ably well. They had a common interest in hanging together; and there was no difference of opinion on important questions of policy. The Prime Minister saidthat Dudley Senanayake would not make trouble. He had disliked being PrimeMinister. He was temperamentally unsufted to act as a political leader; and hewas glad to be out.4. The Prime Minister then went on to speak about defence. Here he echoedall that Sir Oliver Goonetilleke had said to me. Ceylon realised that their onlysafety lay in the protection of the United Kingdom within the Commonwealth.It was vital that our installations and establishments should always remain in ceylon; the more British warships could visit Ceylon the better it would be. they realised that it was not only the Russian menace; but that if anything happened toNehru, India, particularly the south of India, might easily go Communist; and ceylon did not want to share the fate of Hyderabad. I am sure in this thePrime Minister was entirely sincere.5. The Prime Minister then spoke of The Queen&apos;s visit. He said that he was absolutely happy from the point of view of security, that he was sure The Queenwould be greeted with tremendous enthusiasm everywhere, that he did not thinkanybody would dare to make a hostile demonstration, but that if anybody did showa black flag it would be torn down and beaten about his head by thousands of people in the crowd. I said I felt sure that The Queen would get a great reception.I said that he ought to make sure of one thing and that was that all the detailed arrangements, time-table schedule, routes and so forth were meticulously worked out; that a Royal Progress was the one thing you could not improvise but that ifthe details were all well worked out and rehearsed beforehand, then I was sure itwould all go like clockwork. The Prime Minister said he was fully alive to this;and in fact I understand that everything is being worked out in great detail.6. At the end the Prime Minister said he was tremendously pleased I hadpaid this visit here and he would like to think that he could write to me in a personal capacity from time to time and ask my advice, not as commonwealth secretary but as an Elder Statesman with a lot of experience in politics. He knew that Dudley Senanayake had written and talked to me like this and he would liketo feel able to do the same.   I said of course he was very welcome to do so.
