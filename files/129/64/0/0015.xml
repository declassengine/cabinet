SECRET Copy No.    73C. (53) 31513th November, 1953CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICES: REPORT OF THEDROGHEDA committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Commonwealth RelationsOur colleagues will recall that in July last year they approved the foreign secretary&apos;s proposal to appoint an independent committee to examine the overseas information services, including the British Council and the External Services ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation (C.C. (52) 74th Conclusions, Minute 10).With the agreement of the Ministers principally concerned, the Foreign Secretaryinvited Lord Drogheda to be Chairman of the Committee and the following to serve as members of it:  Mr. J. L. Heyworth (Director of Unilever).Mr. V. Feather (Assistant Secretary, Trades Union Congress).Mrs. Mary Stocks (ex-Principal of Westfield College).Mr. J. W. Platt (Director of the Shell Group).Mr. Donald McLachlan (Foreign Editor of the Economist).Mr. Gervas Huxley (Vice-Chairman, International Tea Market ExpansionBoard).Sir R. Bruce Lockhart (who withdrew on grounds of ill health at anearly stage).2.   The Committee&apos;s terms of reference were:  &quot; To assess the value, actual and potential, of the overseas information work of the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, Colonial Office,Board of Trade, Central Office of Information; the External Services of theB.B.C.; and the work of the British Council;&quot; To advise upon the relative importance of different methods and services in different areas and circumstances, and&quot; To make recommendations for future policy.&quot;3. We have circulated to our colleagues (C. (53) 305) the Report of the Com-mittee, together with a brief summary of the principal recommendations whichwas prepared for convenience of reference.4. Our colleagues will, we think, agree that the Committee&apos;s Report constitutes a thorough and workmanlike analysis of the problems of overseas information and that it provides a sound basis for Ministerial consideration of the policy issues involved. Many of the Committee&apos;s recommendations are of a detailed nature and do not in themselves require Cabinet consideration. Moreover, the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations is at present on a tour of certain Common-wealth countries, in the course of which he will look into the activities of the printed for the Cabinet.   November 1953
Information Services and the British Council and will wish to review, on his return,the proposals affecting his Department, Our object in this paper will be to singleout those propositions and recommendations on which, whether because of theirintrinsic importance or their contentious nature, Ministerial decisions are necessary,and to make our own recommendations. It is important that the Cabinet should,if possible, reach decisions on these matters before December so that these can be reflected in the Estimates for 1954-55.General5. We would first ask our colleagues to endorse, in principle, the conclusions to which the Committee were, as they say, forced by sheer weight of evidence.These conclusions, set out in paragraph 2 of the Report and amplified in para-graphs 14-29, are as follows:-(1) The Overseas Information Services play an important and indeed essentialrole in support of our Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonial policies.(2) This work should be done well, continuously and on an adequate scale.(3) If all these requirements are to be met, more money must be spent on the overseas Information Services.(4) Changes are required in the pattern of the work in order to bring it into line with our political, strategic and commercial needs.We recognise that the amount of money which can be made available for informa-tion work cannot be determined solely in relation to information needs, and werevert to this aspect of the problem in paragraph 11 below. At this stage, in askingour colleagues to approve the Committee&apos;s general conclusions, we are only con-cerned to establish the fact (as we believe it to be) that, even when allowance hasbeen made for the economies recommended by the Committee, the information services require strengthening if they are to make their full contribution to thesolution of our political and economic problems.6. We endorse, and ask the Cabinet to accept, the Committee&apos;s view(paragraph 21) that each of the main information agencies departmental informa-tion services, the External Services of the B.B.C., and the British Council has itsown task to perform. We agree with the Committee that the balance as between one service and another must be determined in relation to each country or area in terms of effectiveness i.e., ability to contribute to the desired long-term political or commercial result.7. We agree with the Committee&apos;s analysis (paragraphs 30-36) of the political,strategic and commercial requirements which the information services should serveand support. The question of a proper balance between these requirements is notdealt with in the Report, and perhaps could not be; for it is not a matter of dividingresources of men, material and money between three self-contained and mutuallyexclusive tasks, nor is this a question which appreciably affects the structure of theinformation services. The content of our propaganda can be varied widely accord-ing to the needs of the moment without altering the channels through which it isconveyed. Nevertheless, we think that the question, of balance is of real import-ance, and Ministers should be able to satisfy themselves at suitable intervals thatthe information services are maintaining a proper balance between political,strategic and commercial requirements. For this purpose, we think that an annualdirective, prepared by the Official Committee on Overseas Information Services,could usefully be submitted to the Cabinet for information.8. We agree with the Drogheda Committee&apos;s geographical analysis (para-graphs 38-48) of the tasks of the information services in different areas. We inviteparticular attention to the Committee&apos;s views on the importance of information work in Germany (Annex 4 to the Report). We propose to carry out their recommendations, which do not involve increased expenditure. We deal belowwith the conclusions which they draw as to the relative value of the differentagencies in particular countries or areas.Strengthening of Information Services9. The Committee express the firm view (paragraph 49) that the information services are &quot; to-day inadequate to fulfil the various requirements&quot; laid upon them, and they recommend a &quot; planned expansion .... carried out in stages
over a period of 3-5 years.&quot; The expansions which they recommend are set outin broad outline in paragraphs 49-73 of the Report, and in more detail in the annexes attached to it. In brief they amount to a strengthening of the existing services where they are under-staffed (especially in South-East Asia and theDominions); the re-establishment of information offices (especially in scandinavia and Latin America) which were closed owing to lack of funds; the opening ofinformation offices in Nigeria, the Gold Coast, East Africa and the West Indies;an improved flow of services and material from the Central Office of Information;and expansion of the work of the British Council in under-developed countries(especially in Asia and the British Colonies), together with an increase in the council&apos;s supply services; improvements in certain B.B.C. services (particularly tothe Far East), the restoration of the Latin American Service, and a substantialprogramme of capital development.10. On the other side of the account the Committee recommend the followingeconomies:  (a) that the B.B.C. services to France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and scandinavia should be abandoned; and(b) that there should be a &quot; fundamental re-orientation of the work of theBritish Council a change of emphasis from cultural to educationalwork and from the more developed to the less developed parts of theworld &quot;; that in fulfilment of this policy the British Council shouldclose down, over a period, those of its institutions in most european countries which cannot be made more or less self-supporting; and thatCultural Attaches should be appointed in those countries to maintaincultural and educational exchanges in fulfilment of our Cultural Con-ventions.We recommend acceptance of both these recommendations. Since, however,(a) is highly contentious, we deal with it in detail in paragraph 16.11. Despite these economies, the sums involved are admittedly substantial;at the present level of costs, additional expenditure (net) at the end of the periodof expansion would amount to nearly  2 millions, exclusive of any capital expendi-ture by the B.B.C. We believe that the expansion programme recommended bythe Committee is necessary in order to maintain and develop efficient information services overseas, and we ask our colleagues to approve it in principle; but wethink that it would be unrealistic for us to seek authority now to carry out thewhole programme in three years and for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to commit themselves publicly to this course. We accordingly recommend that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should:  (a) accept, in principle, the need for a planned expansion of the kind and onthe scale recommended by the Committee;(b) aim at carrying out the programme over a period of five years;(c) make financial provision in the Estimates for 1954-55 for the priorityrequirements listed in paragraph 12 below.12. The priority requirements which, on political and economic grounds, werecommend should be met in 1954-55 are, in summary, the following:  Asia and PacificStrengthening Information Offices in India, Australia and Ceylon;Building up the organisation of the British Council in India and Pakistan toextend the teaching of English;Strengthening the British Council in Malaya;Manning a second shift in the B.B.C. Relay Station at Tebrau in Malaya;Some strengthening of the staff of information offices in Indo-China, burma and Japan and of the Regional Information Office in Singapore;Some strengthening of the staff of the British Council centres in Rangoon,Djakarta and in Tokyo and the opening of a new centre in Kyoto in japan.
Africa and the Middle EastSetting up and operation of United Kingdom Information Offices in Nigeriaand the Gold Coast;Strengthening of British Council operations in Nigeria, the Gold Coast and tanganyka;Improvement and expansion of the B.B.C. Middle East Service, including atranscription service in Arabic;The opening of British Council centres in Kuwait in the Persian Gulf and inthe Sudan, together with the grant of financial assistance to the BritishSchool in Bagdad;A modest strengthening of the Regional Information Office in Beirut which supplies material in Arabic to the whole area.Western HemisphereExpansion of the Information organisation in Canada, particularly by theestablishment as a first step of one regional office in Montreal;The appointment of an Assistant Films Officer in the British information services, New York, to assist particularly in exploiting the growing outlet for our films provided by television;Setting up and operation of a United Kingdom Information Office in the west indies;Strengthening British Council operations in British Guiana;Partial restoration of the B.B.C. Latin American short-wave and transcriptionservices (which, until they were cut recently, had enjoyed a very highreputation in the area);Some strengthening of the information offices (which have been cut down farbelow the level of efficiency) in order to enable them to do more in theway of commercial publicity and to assist in promoting the B.B.C. services.The virtually self-supporting Anglophil societies and British Councilactivities in general would remain at their present level.Western europe the re-opening of information offices in Scandinavia and, depending on political circumstances, some development of  information  activitieselsewhere in Yugoslavia or Trieste or France.The British Council have made provision for some expansion in Yugoslavia.(These proposals are based on acceptance of the recommendation of theDrogheda Committee that, in Europe, the information offices provide themost effective means of publicity and that certain of the B.B.C. services to western Europe should be discontinued and that except in Yugoslavia the activities of the British Council in the same area should be reduced.)GeneralThe B.B.C. to improve the general coverage of their services, including thatof the General Overseas Services, and to allocate some additional funds for programme allowances, listener research and publicity;The British Council supply services to be restored to an adequate level;An increase in the allowances paid to British Council staff serving in theColonies, in order to bring them into line with those received by thoseserving in foreign countries;The up-grading of certain key posts in the Information Service of the Common-wealth Relations Office;Improved services and an increased flow of material from the Central Officeof Information for use by the Overseas Information Departments in theirrespective territories.
13. In order to carry out these requirements, it is estimated that anadditional net sum of  569,500 will be required in 1954-55, made up as follows:-additional sum ExistingRequired Provision   Foreign Office     .........        81,000 1,845,350Commonwealth Relations Office       30,000 299 200Colonial Office    .........        35,000 23J00Central Office of Information/her majesty&apos;s Stationery Office...       90,000 777,300Board of Trade   ...      ......         ... 76,200Total Departmental information services        ......      ... 236,000 3,021,750B.B.C............. 186,000 4,510,000British Council   ......... 147,500 2,445,000Total net increase in expenditure     569,500 9,976,750In the case of the British Council, the estimated gross increase is  213,500, but against this can be set a first instalment of the economies in British Council opera-tions in Europe, amounting to  66,000, making a net increase for the british council of  147,500. Should Her Majesty&apos;s Government decide to accept therecommendation of the Drogheda Committee to cut out certain of the EuropeanServices of the B.B.C. there would be an additional sum of  90,000 available tothe B.B.C. which we recommend should be used to accelerate the programme of expansion recommended in paragraph 12 above, in regard to the Latin American,Middle Eastern and General Overseas Services.14. To the net figure of  569,500 mentioned in the foregoing paragraph mustbe added a suitable provision to cover inescapable increases in the cost of essentialcurrent activities and a margin for contingencies. At a rough estimate an additional 366,200 is likely to be required for these purposes, made up as follows:   B.B.C......................        240,000British Council       .........      ......        103,700Central Office......      ............ 12,500Commonwealth Relations Office......... 10,000366,200The B.B.C. figure includes the sum of  200,000 to cover salary increases whichmay result from the claims put forward by the B.B.C. Staff Association.15. We believe that acceptance of the recommendations in the four preceding paragraphs would commend itself to Parliament and go as far towards acceptanceof the Committee&apos;s proposals as the financial situation permits us to contemplatein 1954-55.The British Broadcasting Corporation16. We refer in paragraph 13 above to the Committee&apos;s recommendation thata number of the B.B.C.&apos;s European Services should be abandoned. The acceptanceof this recommendation would result in a saving of  90,000 next year, risingsubsequently to  135,000. This estimate is based on the assumption that the frequencies concerned would be retained and used for other purposes. Should the frequencies be abandoned altogether the total saving would amount to  200,000.The grounds for this recommendation are set out in paragraphs 26-32 of Annex 3of the Committee&apos;s Report, and are cogently argued. The B.B.C. oppose therecommendation vehemently and, as the annexed memorandum from the Boardof Governors shows, with a number of good arguments and some which we findless convincing. We find it difficult to decide between the opposing arguments.On the whole, since the object of setting up the Drogheda Committee was preciselyto obtain independent advice on this sort of problem, we incline towards acceptance
of their recommendation. We think, however, that on strategic grounds the frequencies concerned should not be abandoned but should be used to reinforceother existing services. If the Cabinet shares this view, we must expect strong criticism from a small but vocal section of the House of Commons. We think,however, that we should be on strong ground in basing ourselves on the DroghedaReport.Capital Development17. We are impressed by the strongly-expressed view of the Committee(paragraphs 73 and Annex 3, paragraphs 80-83) that the B.B.C. requires a &quot; large-scale programme of capital development to put the External Services on a propertechnical footing.&quot; They make a firm recommendation that the long-deferredplan to instal two additional transmitters in Tebrau should now be put into effect,at a cost of  550,000; and they think that a number of other projects which in totomight cost over  4 millions over a period of ten years, should be given serious consideration.18. We regard the improvement of the Tebrau Relay Station as urgent and necessary in view of the political situation in Asia. We recommend that in .1954-55capital expenditure of  60,000 should be incurred in order to provide the necessaryhousing for a second shift at Tebrau. Capital expenditure on installing the two additional transmitters required would be spread over the two subsequent financial years, i.e., it would not begin until 1955-56. We think that the other projectsrequire further consideration and that the departments concerned, in consultationwith the B.B.C., should consider how the necessary examination can best be conducted.Organisation19. We invite particular attention to paragraphs 77-83 of the Report, which deal with the lack of any centralised direction in the field of overseas information.We have given much thought to this matter, and have considered whether, short of recreating a Ministry of Information, there is any way of remedying what looks,at first sight, like an organisational defect. There are two possibilities, the firstbeing to give one Minister a general responsibility for supervising the overseas information work of the three overseas departments, the British Council and theB.B.C.&apos;s External Services, and the other to set up a Ministerial Committee to whichthe existing Official Committee would report. Both methods were tried, in com-bination, by the previous Government; they did not work, and we cannot recom-mend that they should be reintroduced. The plain fact is, as the Committee say,that since propaganda is an instrument of policy, responsibility for it must rest with the Ministers who are responsible for the different aspects of policy. Wetherefore accept and endorse the Committee&apos;s conclusion that there should be nochange in the present division of responsibility. (The Secretary of State for Com-commonwealth Relations holds a different view about this and also in regard to thefirst sentence of paragraph 20 below. His views are set out in C. (53) 260.) Weare not impressed by their suggestion that co-ordination by the Official Committeeshould be reinforced by the establishment of a permanent Advisory Committee of independent persons, because no such committee could hope to follow the day-to-day work of the Information Services and Agencies in sufficient detail to be ableto offer useful advice to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. But we support the Com-mittee&apos;s alternative proposal, that some form of independent enquiry should beheld every five years so as to &quot; ensure that the information services are workingsmoothly and that whatever modifications are required to meet the ever-changingworld situation are in fact being made.&quot;20. We are doubtful about the Committee^ tentative suggestion that theCentral Office of Information should be put under a senior Minister without Port-folio, instead of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The Central Office ofInformation is an agency, providing services and material for a number of depart-ments, and the policies which its material is designed to serve are&apos; determined bythe Ministers in charge of those departments. A Minister in charge of the central office of Information would thus either have no responsibility for policy mattersor else be in the invidious position of claiming a share of the responsibility laid upon the departmental Ministers concerned. We think that the object which theCommittee had in mind could be more easily achieved by a clear understanding
that the Financial Secretary is responsible for the administration and finances of theCentral Office of Information, but that the Overseas Departments should beresponsible for the nature of the services and material which it is asked to provideto them, within the limits set by the Estimates.Conclusion21. There will be a considerable demand, both Parliamentary and public,for publication of the Drogheda Report. It is clearly unsuitable for publication.We therefore recommend that a White Paper should be prepared summarising the Committee&apos;s principal findings and recommendations together with theproposals of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for dealing with them. We think thatthe latter should be set out in the White Paper in the following terms:: (a) that they accept the need for continuity in information work &quot;and endorsein principle the case for a planned expansion of the kind and on thescale recommended by the Committee;(b) that they aim at carrying out the programme over a period of five years;(c) that they will make financial provision in the Estimates for 1954-55 forthe priority requirements listed in paragraph 12 above, as well as forinescapable increases in the cost of essential current activities and a margin for contingencies (paragraphs 13 and 14);(d) that they regard the improvement of the Tebrau Relay Station of theB.B.C. as urgent and necessary in view of the political situation in asia and will make provision in 1954-55 for capital expenditure of 60,000 (for housing) to enable a second shift to be manned; that thecapital expenditure required to install two additional transmitters atTebrau should be spread over the two following years (paragraphs 17and 18);(e) that the level of activity and the balance as between areas and services should again be subjected to scrutiny by an independent Committeein five years&apos; time (paragraph 19).A.

ANNEXBritish Broadcasting CorporationComments by the B.B.C. Board of Governors on theDrogheda Committee ReportIntroductoryThe Board of Governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation has noted with great gratification the tributes paid in the Report of the Drogheda Committeeto the effectiveness and value of many aspects of the Corporation^ ExternalServices. The Board of Governors also notes with satisfaction the recommenda-tions made by the Committee for (a) the restoration of a higher level of programme and /or technical activity in the General Overseas, Latin American and certainEuropean Services, (b) the extension of Middle Eastern and Far Eastern Services(including the further development of the Tebrau Station), (c) the authorisation of greater revenue expenditure on various ancillary activities, including the Tran-scription Service in English, (d) the provision of money for a capital maintenance and development programme over the next five to ten years.At the same time, the Governors are seriously disturbed by the proposal madeby the Committee that the existing (already curtailed) Services to West european countries should be abandoned. This recommendation seems to be incompatible with the restorations and extensions proposed in the other parts of the world, to involve danger to national prestige (at comparatively insignificant cost) and to bebased on invalid premises.The Governors also have misgivings about the suggestion that services to Indiaand Pakistan in languages other than English might without serious disadvantage be eliminated. No firm recommendation is made by the Committee on this questionwhich it refers to the Commonwealth Relations Office for consideration. Theexperience and views of the B.B.C. are fully known in the commonwealth relations Office, which has in the past advocated extension rather than restraint of vernacular services to the Indian Sub-Continent.The problem of the West European Services appears to the Board of Governorsto be sufficiently important for them to submit the following observations in supportof their contentions.1. The Application of principles the view is expressed in the opening passages of the Drogheda Committee&apos;sreport that the Overseas Information Services have been handicapped by &quot; the lackof a generally accepted body of principles to justify their existence at all or to definetheir potentialities and limitations.&quot; The Report therefore draws up for the first time a scheme of nine principles by which the value of Information Services shouldbe judged, and bases its findings on their firm application to the services underreview.It would of course be extremely difficult to frame principles closely relevant toall the types of information media concerned. If broadcasting alone had been thesubject of consideration, a fundamental principle would, presumably, have beenthat effort to any particular area must take account of the number of wireless setsin that area. A consideration as elementary as this in terms of broadcasting would,however, have had no validity for the work of the Central Office of Information orthe British Council, and the Report accordingly omits it. Other principles whichwould have been arrived at from a study of broadcasting include the big gain in national prestige which results over a long period of years from the maintenance of services in many languages irrespective of immediate tactical advantage. A furtherprinciple is that direct contact with the audience is of greater value than indirectcontact through intermediaries, who introduce a degree of distortion at everyremove from the original message.
While lessons of this kind derived from broadcasting are naturally excludedfrom the list of common principles by which the Report judges the value of infor-mation work, others are included in the list which apply to the work of information officers and the British Council, but are remote from all experience of broadcastingor even in flat contradiction of it. These irrelevant principles are unfortunatelymade to apply to broadcasting as if they were native to it. The result of thisomission of relevant principles&apos; on the one hand, and the inclusion of irrelevantprinciples on the other, is to write off some of the most important parts of theB.B.C.&apos;s external activity.2. &quot; The Influential Few &quot;The Report lays down as its Fifth Principle that &quot; Information Services shouldbe directed at the influential few and through them at the many.&quot; In consequencewarm approval is given to broadcasts to an area of sparsely distributed wireless setssuch as Saudi Arabia, where listeners &quot; are headed by King Ibn Saud.&quot; (Annex 2,paragraph 31.) No doubt this maxim is strictly relevant to the choice of studentsat a British Council course or to the activity of an Information Officer amongcontacts in a foreign capital, but it ignores the greatest development in the propa-ganda field in the past century. Wireless has given to Governments for the first time direct means of access to audiences overseas, which enables them to influenceforeign Governments by and through direct contact with the masses. It is notdesired to exaggerate the possibilities of this development, as Hitler and Leninmay have exaggerated them. The effectiveness Of a generalised influence is alwayshard to isolate and may be overestimated just as it may be dismissed by those usedto other methods of persuasion. In the work of promoting a sympathetic climateof opinion to a country&apos;s foreign policy, broadcasting has, however, a record of achievement which is very strong. The impact of the B.B.C. in this respect is con-sidered further in paragraph 6 below. In the past twelve years it has probably beenstrongest in occupied and post-war Europe, including Berlin, but there have been more strikingly successful predecessors in this area before the B.B.C. entered the short-wave field, notably Radio Moscow in the -twenties and the German Radio inthe thirties. Because of its widely diffused nature the influence has of coursealways been gained in the native language of the audience addressed. There are thus at the present time six listeners to the B.B.C.&apos;s French Service for every oneFrench listener to the B.B.C. in English, and there are seven listeners to the B.B.C.&apos;sItalian Service for every one Italian listener to the B.B.C. in English. But becausethe Fifth Principle of the Drogheda Report gives priority to &quot; the influential few &quot;and insists on the canalisation of propaganda through them to the masses, itrecommends that the native languages should be abandoned, but English beretained. &quot; It would still be possible,&quot; the Report comments, in paragraph 32 of annex 3, &quot; for the serious listener in these countries (say, a provincial editor whowants to know the British view oh the subject) to hear the British broadcasting corporation.&quot;A related fact which the Report overlooks is that the distribution of wirelesssets is twice as dense in Western Europe as in Eastern Europe, and that the densityis greater in Western Europe than in any other part of the world except north america. There are 20 million wireless sets capable of receiving the B.B.C. directlyin the West European countries to which the Committee recommends suspendingB.B.C. services, but only 4 million sets capable of receiving the B.B.C. directly inthe Latin American countries where the Committee recommends restoration of.B.C. services at a cost nearly equivalent to the savings proposed under thewithdrawal from Europe..Latin America and the Arabic-speaking countries are, of course, in a special position under the reports Fifth Principle. &quot; Although the British broadcasting corporation may have a daily audience of one million persons in France,&quot; it saysin paragraph 31 of Annex 3, &quot;and of between three and five million in ten western european countries, this audience only includes a small number of people in aposition to make policy or mould public opinion.&quot; Proportionately it is true that&quot; the influential few &quot; in Latin America, or in the Middle East, make up a relativelyhigher percentage of the audience, but this is clearly because the mass of thepopulation do not own sets. The Corporation suggests, however, that any information service which is in daily touch with five million people is itself in aposition &quot;to make policy or mould public opinion.&quot; The fact that it is a Britishinstitution with direct access to this extent is of unique importance.
3. Direct ContactThe Second Principle of the Drogheda Report is that private enterprise issuperior as a channel for overseas information to channels created by Govern-ments. &quot; It follows that Government information activities should work throughexisting private channels in preference to creating channels of their own.&quot; (Para-graph III, General Considerations, Second Principle.)This principle, too, overlooks the revolution produced in external informationby the invention of broadcasting, and ignores the historical success of Communistand Fascist propaganda campaigns conducted through channels created wholly by governments. The B.B.C. itself, although differing from them radically in inde-pendence and objectivity, owes its record of success in the external field to thesupport of successive British Governments. Private enterprise could not have sustained the B.B.C any more than it has been able to finance the Voice ofAmerica.The reports Fifth Principle, when combined with its Second Principlefavouring &quot; the influential few,&quot; is particularly damaging to a balanced evaluationof Western Europe. Here private channels of information are numerous and thereare few official barriers, so that there should be ample scope in foreign newspapers,news agencies, books, &amp;c, for the method of indirect approach which is preferredby the Committee. But although there are few official barriers to the spread offactual information in Western Europe, there are very high natural barriers to the spread of views which diverge from the immediate national interests of the country concerned. This European resistance to another country&apos;s point of view increases the importance of direct presentation of the case.It has been found over a long period of years that a broadcast heard at firsthand is incomparably more valuable than one which is passed on through an intermediary. The element of distortion, which blurs the original message, is greater among foreigners than in the British home public, because the foreignmentality adds an alien bias taken from its own surroundings and prejudices. Inthe same way European newspaper reports of British ministerial speeches and leading articles, even when sympathetically Intentioned, give a notoriouslymisleading picture of British policy and purposes.The problem in Western Europe is not so much one of spreading objectivenews, which is already available, as of obtaining a truly representative statementof British views. The B.B.C. is the only direct means in existence of presenting the British view to the West European public. It does this daily in commentarieswhich are added to the news bulletins and have big and appreciative audiences inall of these countries. In France, for instance, it is as if Britain possessed in itsown right a daily newspaper with a circulation comparable to that of The Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom. But because of the Committee&apos;s FifthPrinciple, which gives priority to &quot; the influential few,&quot; and because of the SecondPrinciple, which gives priority to indirect approach through privately ownedchannels, the unique practical asset which this country possesses is dismissed.4. A World-Wide InstitutionWhile it is not intended in this note to attempt to complete the drogheda committee&apos;s list of principles by adding all those which appear to emerge fromtwenty years of external broadcasting, attention must be drawn to one suchprinciple which is of exceptional importance.The B.B.C. has become a world-wide institution; its standing abroad is anational asset comparable with the country&apos;s reputation for parliamentary institu-tions, a free press and a stable system of justice. No doubt it is the developmentof Britain&apos;s special international situation which has led to this result, just as in earlier centuries it led to the growth of the British Navy and the mercantile marine.Involved at the same time, and almost equally, in the Commonwealth, in the atlantic Community and in Europe, Britain naturally exploits to the full the possi-bilities of world-wide communication. At the same time Britain&apos;s reputation restsin part on a corresponding world-wide recognition that we accept this role, andclamour invariably arises when we appear to be neglecting some part of our interests for the sake of another more favoured area.Apart from the post-war curtailment of certain services, the B.B.C. has onthe whole been able to direct its output in a correspondingly steady and long-termmanner in all appropriate directions. Unlike other foreign broadcasting systemswhich have followed the tactical needs of the moment and earned a corresponding
notoriety and lack of trust, the B.B.C. has reaped the benefits of its long-term policy by acquiring a reputation for stable responsibility which precisely responds to theneeds of Britain&apos;s international position.The principles of the Drogheda Report take no account of this immenselyimportant aspect of long-term gain, and its recommendations call for the totalsuspension, on tactical grounds held as valid at the time of writing, of the services to France, Italy, Demark, Holland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. The purelytactical nature of the recommendation is further emphasised by the next recom-mendation (paragraph 41, Annex 2) that &quot; special reasons &quot; exist why otherlanguage services should &quot; be retained at any rate for the time being.&quot; Theservices named include those to Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Finland, Spain,Turkey and Greece.It is clear that so far from accepting the value of the B.B.C. in this respectas an essentially long-term international asset, the Drogheda Report is preparedto switch off any service at any time when the balance of tactical advantage appearsto lie elsewhere. No doubt there is a further implication that services should be founded and re-formed with equal opportunism, but this would provide no compen-sation whatever for the frittering away of the good-will and prestige won by theB.B.C. in years of effort, for in the course of time the process of tactical switchingoff would extend to the majority of languages. That it should begin with French a language with which no international broadcasting station of importance hashitherto been able to dispense speaks clearly enough of the trend. Audiencesare quite clear as to the motives for treating them in this opportunist manner andthe B.B.C. would in the shortest period acquire a new reputation. It is no exaggera-tion to say that a national asset is placed in jeopardy by the proposal.5. Communism in Western europe in recommending the withdrawal of the British Council from Western europe in addition to the B.B.C., the, Drogheda Committee comments that &quot; Communismpresents something of a danger in certain countries (for instance in France andItaly), but we do not believe that anything that the British Council can do is likelyto diminish that danger to any substantial extent. . . . In our view much more direct political methods are needed to assist the European Governments in the fight against internal Communism.&quot;  (Annex 2, paragraph 43.)As has been pointed out above (in paragraph 3, &quot; Direct Contact&quot;) the B.B.C.&apos;sEuropean Services are the only existing means of direct access which Britain has,or is likely to have, to the West European public. Other countries, however, andmost notably the Soviet Union and the Cominform, are able to enjoy correspondingfacilities. Such importance is placed on them by Moscow that they have increased output to these countries four-fold in the past few years, from 69 hours per week in 1948 to 276 hours per week in 1953. In the same period the B.B.C. has hadto retract from 71 hours per week to 53.The Drogheda Committee&apos;s recommendation to withdraw B.B.C. Services from western Europe happens to coincide with a period of acute disturbance, underpressure from Senator McCarthy, of the Voice of America Services to the sameand other areas. While it is not suggested that the United Kingdom is under an obligation to make good any deficiencies in the operations of its major partnerin the battle for men&apos;s minds, the immediate situation does accentuate on the onehand the importance of the gaps which would be left in the broadcasting services from the Free World, and, on the other, the serious weaknesses inherent from anational standpoint in placing any dependence on parallel American activities which, in this as in so many other fields, have proved so notoriously uncertain andunstable. It is no exaggeration to say that the effect of the B.B.C.&apos;s withdrawalof Services to Western Europe will be to leave the short-wave field in these importantcountries almost exclusively in Moscow&apos;s control: a control which was sharedwith Nazi and Fascist Services in Western Europe before the foundation of theB.B.C.&apos;s European Services.In the twenties and thirties, when the Soviet Union was pursuing a policyof apparent international co-operation, it was precisely in this field of short-wavebroadcasts to the Western democracies that Moscow established a clear lead bygaining significant audiences, which proved to be seed-beds of Communist propa-ganda, many years before the democracies founded counterpart short-wave services.Soon after the entry into the field of the B.B.C. in 1938 the whole picture wastransformed by the war, which greatly extended the habit of short-wave listening in
occupied territories. Although, of course, the extent of short-wave listening con-tracted abruptly on liberation, it has remained permanently greater on the Europeanmainland than before the war. There are at present some five million inveterateshort-wave listeners in Western Europe, and, as their roving habit of mind suggests,they are apt to be &quot; neutralist &quot;in inclination. In the past three years there hasbeen a steady increase in listening to the Cominform and a slight decrease inlistening to the B.B.C., a change which has been roughly proportionate to the changed balance of output from Moscow and London. Nevertheless the B.B.C.still holds the clear lead it first established more than ten years ago. It is this important audience, now swollen, to many times its size in the twenties andthirties, and catered for on an incomparably more lavish scale by the Cominform,which will be restored to Moscow as its exclusive preserve if the friendly voicesof the West are withdrawn from the short-wave band.6. The Consequences in Western EuropeIncidental reference has been made above to the national advantage resultingfrom the B.B.C.&apos;s impact on Western Europe. In summary the main features ofthis impact are as follows:  (a) The B.B.C.&apos;s daily audience, although substantially smaller than in the war,has remained a mass audience numbering between three and fivemillions. This has been established by the only reliable means of assess-ing the size of a.radio audience, namely by polls. More than sixty ofthese polls have been made available to the Corporation in the past seven years. All have been conducted by independent research bodies, thevast majority at the instance of other organisations than the B.B.C.,usually of rivals. Within very narrow limits all have confirmed theposition held by the B.B.C.(b) On special occasions, such as the funeral of King George VI or the Coro-nation of Queen Elizabeth II, the audience is greatly increased by liverelays of the B.B.C. language transmissions on the Home Services ofthe countries concerned. Thus ten European countries relayed theB.B.C. language services on 2nd June, 1953, and at a conservative estimate the continental audience rose above ten millions.(c) The continental audience for broadcasts in English is negligible by com-parison with that for the European language services..(d) Outside the North American continent Western Europe has more setsrelative to population than any other part of the world. The rate of increase is very rapid, so that the total number is nearly double that existing at the foundation of the European Services. There are atpresent 20 million sets capable of receiving the B.B.C. in the countries from which the Drogheda Committee recommends withdrawal ofcoverage.(e) The effect of direct contact with the European audience, which no other british medium of publicity enjoys, is very powerful. Out of 250 Frenchlisteners who recently answered a questionnaire, 32 per cent, said thatthe B.B.C.&apos;s French Service had changed their views on Britain&apos;s relationswith Western Europe, Franco-German problems and the Common-wealth. In all the countries concerned the B.B.C. stands for the majorityas . the only British institution of which they have had first-handknowledge.Although no attempt can be made here to reduce the above generalisationsto their component details in each West European country, some detail must begiven with regard to France and Italy.In France the sale of newspapers is rather low. The B.B.C.&apos;s weekly journallei Londres, which is linked with the B.B.C.&apos;s French Service, sells between 9,000and 11,500 copies. By contrast the Communist daily UHumanite sells over220,000 copies. But a further contrast is provided by the regular daily audienceto the B.B.C.&apos;s French Service which is more than double the circulation ofUHumanite and includes more than 100,000 French workers. The B.B.C.&apos;s occa-sional audience amounts to six million French listeners. It Will be rememberedthat the French Communist Party is the largest of the parties in the French national assembly. -
Italy has the largest Communist Party outside the Russian orbit, but theB.B.C. in Italian enjoys a powerful position because of the rapid growth in thenumber of sets and a daily relay on the Italian Home Service. A poll held in italy in 1953 gave the B.B.C. six million occasional listeners. It should be pointedout, however, that Cominform broadcasts in Italian are so arranged that from05 - 30 until 23 - 00 hours each day one or other Cominform country is on the airalmost without interruption.7. general it can be seen that the country has much at stake in the influence exerted bythe B.B.C.&apos;s West European broadcasts. The Drogheda Report takes as the netfinancial saving from their elimination a basic rate of  135,000, after allowing forthe retention of frequencies which would otherwise be occupied by Moscow.The Governors of the Corporation feel bound to question in the strongest possible terms both the expediency and the wisdom of the retraction which hasbeen proposed.25th September, 1953.
