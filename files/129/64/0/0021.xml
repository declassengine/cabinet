SECRET Copy No. 69C. (S3) 32117th November, 1953CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICES: THE DROGHEBA report memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am sorry if I may seem to sound a gloomy note amid the proposals for expanding the overseas information services that are now before the Cabinet inC. (53) 315; but, on present showing, I do not see my way to recommend any increase in the financial provision for these services in the coming year. I outlined the general difficulties of our present financial and economic position in C. (53) 211and the Cabinet agreed on 28th July (C.C. (53) 46th Conclusions, Minute 4) that all ministers in charge of Departments should prepare their estimates for 1954-55 onthe basis of the most rigorous economy.2. Looking beyond the coming financial year, I find it hard to believe that thegeneral state of our finances warrants the gradual increase in expenditure on over-seas information work which is proposed. The present level of expenditure on this work is substantial  10 million a year. In proportion to total government expenditure, we are paying out as much as the United States and, as our taxation is higher, we are in fact spending a larger proportion of our national resources on.overseas information work than the United States. Moreover, the United StatesInformation Agency, which operates United States overseas information activities^announced in August that its appropriation for the year ended 30th June^ 1954,would be 28^- per cent. less than that for the year ended 30th June, 1953; that its staff would be reduced by 24 per cent.; and that &apos;! many desirable but less essentialactivities would have to be discontinued.&quot;3. In overseas information work, as in many other forms of Governmentactivity, we seem to have been trying to do too much with the limited resources a tour disposal. Instead of concentrating on doing really well a relatively limited amount of important work, we are as the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations points out in C. (53) 260 in danger of spreading our resources over toowide a field. This danger is brought out by the Drogheda Committee; but in my view they failed to have adequate regard to their diagnosis of the situation whenframing their specific proposals. I welcome the withdrawals from certain fieldswhich the Committee suggested, including the abandonment of the B.B.C. services to Western Europe, the withdrawal of the British Council from most european countries and (a proposal endorsed by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations after enquiries on the spot) the withdrawal of the British Council from australia and New Zealand. But these withdrawals are not likely to yield ussavings of more than  250,000 a year, while the Drogheda Committee suggestedvarious increases which have been very conservatively valued at  2,500,000 a year.( 2 million a year on recurrent expenditure, plus  500,000 a year in the next five or ten years on capital development by the B.B.C.) With overstretched information services, with costs tending to rise and the ever-present risk of urgent new commit-ments, it is unfortunate that the Committee did not indicate how really substantial reductions might be made in certain areas and media in order to concentrate our resources effectively on the fields that matter most.4. A greater concentration of effort by the official agencies and an acceptanceof the severe limits on Government expenditure would involve a greater readiness to use other agencies. The Drogheda Committee itself put forward the general45204Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1953
proposition that &quot; private enterprise is still the main source of the information and impressions by which foreigners judge this country and Government activity in information is a supplement to private effort and should be so regarded &quot;&apos;: andthen went on to suggest that Government information activities should work through existing private channels in preference to creating channels of their own.Then again we have friends and allies who are also engaged in defending the causeof democracy throughout the world and we might see whether there was not scope for greater co-ordination of effort.5. I agree with the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations that more attention must be given to the supervision of information policy and to the determination of the ends that we are trying to secure generally and in different areas. This should be done at a sufficiently high level to ensure that the inevitablereluctance of those operating in the less fruitful fields to bring their activities toan end can be overcome speedily and effectively.6. I suggest that the Cabinet should reach a general understanding about thelevel of expenditure that can be authorised in the coming year. For the prepara-tion of Estimates a decision on this should be reached before the end of the present month. Against the general budgetary position, I cannot see how we can contem-plate any increase in expenditure next year. I have already told the Ministers incharge of overseas Departments that, in so far as they feel able to put into immediate effect the recommendations made in the Drogheda Report for reductions in theexisting level of activity, I for my part would be ready to agree that the savingseffected could be used in the coming year for increased effort in other directions.In fact, rising costs will probably eat up a good deal of any savings. I should alsobe happy to discuss with the Ministers concerned administrative details, such asthe level of delegated authority for films and other activities.7. For the rest, I suggest that we postpone any general discussion of theDrogheda recommendations and remit the whole matter to a Cabinet Committee,which might usefully include one or two Ministers without departmental interestin this field. This would have the advantage of postponing consideration of long-term policy until after the return of the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations. The Cabinet Committee could consider the general issues of policy to which the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations referred in his paper c. (53) 260 and the more detailed proposals in C. (53) 315. If the Cabinet so desired, the Committee could also examine the arrangements for the supervision of overseas information activities and of the activities of the Central Office ofInformation to which the Overseas Ministers referred in paragraphs 19 and 20 ofC. (53) 315.R. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,16th November, 1953.
