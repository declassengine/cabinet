3^o. Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRETC. (53) 35415th December, 1953CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of education on 10th March the Cabinet considered our memorandum (C. (53) 55) on thesubject of legislation to amend the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Acts and, in particular,to raise the rate of contribution from 10 per cent, to .12 per cent, (equally divided between teacher and employer). The Cabinet decided against the introduction oflegislation during the then current Session and invited us to arrange for an enquiry to be instituted, on the lines desired by the education authorities, into the workingof the existing Acts governing the superannuation of teachers (C.C. (53)18th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Working Parties were set up, one for England and Wales and one forScotland, by agreement between the authorities and the teachers, and we have now received their reports. In considering these reports, we have borne in mind that proposals have recently been agreed by both the local authorities and the teacherson the Burnham Committee for an increase in teachers&apos; salaries from 1st April next.These proposals are estimated to increase the expenditure on teachers&apos; salaries inEngland and Wales in a full year by about  1.1 -6 million and to increase the grant-charge on the Exchequer in 1954-55 by about  6-3 million. Similar proposals under consideration in Scotland would increase expenditure on teachers&apos; salaries in a full year by about  1-6 million and the grant-charge on the Exchequer in1954-55 by about  900,000. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that,as and when these proposals are formally submitted to us, they should be accepted;but, in doing so, he has emphasised that their acceptance increases the importancein the present financial situation of getting some relief to the charge on theExchequer by raising the rate of contribution for teachers&apos; pensions. No doubtresentment would be expressed that an increase in the rate of contribution wouldsomewhat reduce the benefit of the salary increases for the teachers. Both partiesto the salary negotiations have, however, been aware that the question of an increasein the contribution rate was amongst the matters being considered by the working parties mentioned above.Rate of Contribution3. On the main issue of raising the rate of contribution from 10 per cent, to12 per cent, the local authorities&apos; side of the Working Parties agree that the proposals is reasonable. The teachers&apos; side, on the other hand, are firmly opposed to anyraising of the rate, which they consider should be fixed at 5 per cent, from the teachers and 5 per cent. from.the employers indefinitely, the Exchequer acceptingresponsibility for the whole of any consequential actuarial deficiency.4. We remain of the opinion, now supported by the local authorities, thatit would be reasonable and justifiable to raise the rate to 12 per cent, and that legislation to effect this increase from 1st April, 1954, should be introduced at theearliest possible moment after the Christmas Recess. The Teachers&apos; (Superannua-tion) Act of 1925 and the corresponding Scottish Acts envisaged self-supportingcontributory schemes. The schemes have become unbalanced actuarially becauseof successive increases in teachers&apos; salaries since the schemes were introduced. This45358Copy No.   g j

Taking accountof the effect of the impending increase in teachers&apos; salaries, we estimate that theactuarial deficiency at 31st March next will be such as to justify an additional contribution, over and above 10 per cent., of about 6 per cent, in England andWales and about 5-3 per cent, in Scotland. The proposed increase from 10 percent, to 12 per cent, would thus leave the Exchequer to bear an actuarial liabilityequivalent to a contribution of about 4 per cent, for England and Wales and about-3 per cent for Scotland. We propose that, on the raising of the rate to 12 percent., these actuarial deficiencies should be cleared by appropriate adjustments(which would constitute a liability on the Exchequer) in the credits shown in the superannuation accounts for 1953-54. In this way the schemes would from 1stApril next be free from any actuarial deficiencies on the basis of the new salaryscales then coming into force.5. We estimate that the net relief to the Exchequer in the financial year1954-55 through the increased rate of contribution would be about  2-3 million inEngland and Wales and about  310,000 in Scotland.Other proposed amendments of the Acts6. The Working Parties are in general agreement with the other proposalswhich we put to them for amending the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Acts. Theseproposals (see paragraph 7 of C. (53) 55) are mainly designed to encourage teachersto remain longer in service or to return to it, and would thus be in general conformitywith the recommendations of the recent Watkinson Report. They also coverproposals to improve the superannuation benefits for the teachers in certain respectsand to make certain minor adjustments which experience has shown to be called for and which would be generally to the advantage of the beneficiaries.7. The Working Parties have suggested certain other amendments of the Acts,which we are discussing with the Treasury, and which, in so far as they are agreedto be suitable, would be included in the Bill. We also propose to include provisionsalready agreed with the Foreign Office and designed to remove certain admini-strative difficulties to which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has drawnour attention as hampering the recruitment of staff for schools in foreign countriesin which it is desirable that British teachers should be employed.8. We have consulted our colleagues on the Home Affairs Committee on theproposals described in this Memorandum. They endorsed them at their meetingon 11th December and invited us to submit them for the approval of the Cabinet.9. The Bill would be controversial in so far as the proposal to raise the rateof contribution would be opposed on behalf of the teachers. But the localauthorities now regard that proposal as reasonable and, for the reasons stated inthis memorandum, we think that it would be justified on its merits. The other proposals mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 7 above would smooth its passage through parliament. Accordingly, and in view of the special need in the present financial situation to get the substantial relief which the Exchequer would gain from raising the contribution rate to 12 per cent., we ask the agreement of the Cabinet to thepreparation of a Bill and its reference to the Legislation Committee with a view toits introduction at the earliest possible moment after the Christmas Recess and its passage through Parliament, if possible, not later than the end of the present financial year.J.
