UGANDA PROTECTORATE:  THE province of BUGANDAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesBuganda is one of the four provinces of the Protectorate of Ugandaand economically as well as geographically it is the keystone of the whole country.   Its African inhabitants - the Baganda - numbering about one million,are the richest and most advanced tribe in the Protectorate and have long been intensely nationalist.   Their hereditary Ruler is called the Kabaka.He is assisted in his local government of the Province by a Council(the Lukiko) and three Ministers - the Prime Minister, Treasurer and chief Justice.2. The relations of Her Majesty&apos;s Government with the Kabaka aregoverned by an Agreement made in 1900.   The relevant articles of thisAgreement are:^(a) Article 3 which provides that Buganda &quot;shall rank as a province of equal rank with any other provinces into which the protectorate shall be divided&quot;.(b) Article 6 which reads in part as follows:-&quot;So long as the Kabaka.. . . shall co-operate loyally with her majesty&apos;s Government in the organisation and administration of the said Kingdom of Uganda, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment agrees to recognise the Kabaka of Uganda&quot; asRuler of the Province.(c) Article 20 which reads in part &quot;Should the Kabaka, Chief orpeople of Uganda pursue at any time a policy which isdistinctly disloyal to the British Protectorate, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will no longer consider themselves bound by theterms of this Agreement&quot;.3, Recently the Kabaka addressed a letter to me in which he madethree requests:a(i) An assurance that there would never be a Federation of east African territories.(ii) Transfer of Buganda affairs to the Foreign Office (they were handed over to the Colonial Office in 1902 after thepacification of the country).(iii) &quot;Independence&quot; for Buganda.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..&apos;:&quot;?!;;...C. (53) 324    .18th NOVEMBER) 1953.CABINET
2o&amp;On my authority he was given a reply by the Governor at an interview tothe following effect:-(i) A detailed assurance that no plan of East African federationis at present contemplated and that for the distant future allorgans of local opinion will be fully taken into account.(ii) A transfer of Buganda affairs to the Foreign Office would beconstitutionally inappropriate.(iii) The request for independence was refused on the grounds that itwould be neither in the interests of the Baganda themselvesnor of the inhabitants of the rest of the Protectorate,   the accepted policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is to promote the self-government of Uganda as a unitary state.   (This policy was endorsed by the Kabaka himself as recently as March thisyear when in connection with certain reforms which conferconsiderable local autonomy on the Provincial government insuch spheres as education, health and agriculture he publiclyaffirmed Article 3 of the Agreement on the future of Bugandaas a component part of the Protectorate.)4. The Kabaka has expressed himself satisfied with (i), agreed to drop (ii) for the time being but refused tp accept the reply on (iii).   Similarrequests have been put forward by the Lukiko and made public.   They havebeen and are still the subject of considerable Press comment in theterritory and public discussion in which the issue of independence forBuganda is much confused with that of self-government for Uganda,   the kabaka has expressed his intention, if the above reply is given to theLukiko on point (iii), of opposing this decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentpublicly in the Lukiko,   Despite the best efforts of the Governor and his advisers at long interviews he has. remained obdurate in this determination,5. In the Governor&apos;s view, if the Kabaka were permitted to voicethis public opposition to Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy it would almost certainly precipitate riots and bloodshed which might require sizeable forces to subdue.   In 1945 and in 1949 riots broke out among the Baganda moresuddenly than anyone expected or anticipated.   These were organised againstthe Kabaka&apos;s authority.   If he himself were to instigate the trouble theresults might be much more serious.6. The Attorney-General has advised that the declared intention ofthe Kabaka amounts to a clear breach of the 1900 Agreement.The Governor has recommended the following course of action.He would summon the Kabaka and inform him of my re-affirmation of rny reply on point (iii).   He would ask him whether he is prepared to accept it andloyally abide by it;  if the Kabaka says no he would inform him that thisrefusal must be referred back to me.  Not more than four days later he wouldsummon the Kabaka again and hand him a note with my authority withdrawingrecognition from him.   Immediately afterwards the Kabaka would be servedwith a notice of deportation from Uganda and escorted to an aeroplane,previous arrangements having been made for his journey to the United Kingdom.Thereafter the Lukiko, when the time was judged ripe, would be invited inaccordance with custom to elect a successor.   The Governor would expect that,when this coup d&apos;etat became known trouble would break out among the Bagandawhich might need limited military action in support of the Police but on nothinglike the scale on which it might be needed if the Kabaka were permitted to embark on an open trial of strength with Her Majesty&apos;s Government,
2o7. General Erskine has agreed to make available one battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles which is now moving into Uganda ostensibly as aroutine transfer.   He has also agreed to have a reserve battalion standing byat three days&apos; notice but if this or any further reinforcements were calledupon he might have to ask additional assistance from the United Kingdom,8, There are three reasons why firm and prompt action isdesirable:&quot;&quot;(i) The Kabaka is already suborning the other three minor Rulerswhose districts comprise the Western Province to follow hisexample of non-cooperation with the Protectorate Government.If the Kabaka is handled firmly it is expected they willpromptly back down,(ii) Elections to a new Lukiko take place at the end of this month.On the recommendation of the new Lukiko the Kabaka will choosenew Ministers.   The present ones are believed not to be infavour of his defiance of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in thismatter and it is hoped to retain their loyalty even in the face of his deportation,(iii) The longer confused public discussion of the issue is allowedto continue the greater the local tension which may develop,9. I do not consider, however, that this extreme action should betaken without a personal attempt by myself to bring the Kabaka to his senses.I therefore propose to summon the Kabaka to London early next week for discussions &quot;on grave matters affecting his treaty relationship with her Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;.   At the interview I shall require the Kabaka inaccordance with his treaty obligations to give certain assurances regardinghis acceptance of my decision and of his future co-operation with the protectorate Government,   If after a suitable interval for reflection herefuses to comply, he will be  notified of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentswithdrawal of recognition under the Treaty, informed that he will not be permitted to reside in Uganda and assured of an appropriate financial settlement to enable him to live elsewhere.10, If the Kabaka refuses to come to this country to see me, then Ipropose to authorise the Governor to put into operation the plan described inparagraph 6 above,11. A timetable of the pertinent dates and a map of Uganda are attached.12. I invite my colleagues:-(a) to endorse the action which I propose;(b) to note the possibility of the need for further reinforcements from Kenya which might lead to a request for their replacement,O.L.Colonial Office, 5.W.1,17th November, 1953,1
