Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1953Copy No.     ^ f)CABINETWHITE PAPER ON TELEVISION policy note by the Postmaster-general  attach a revise of paragraph 10 of the White Paper, which I have agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and an amendment to paragraph 11,suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C. 1,6th November, 1953.DRAFT WHITE PAPERBROADCASTING: MEMORANDUM ON TELEVISION POLICYParagraph 10 (Revised)&quot; 10. One of the criticisms levelled against the present system of broadcastingin this country is that it constitutes a monopoly in the very important realm ofideas. Although there may be varying views on this subject, the Government feels that, as commercial broadcasting under the new scheme would be controlled bya public corporation, it might be desirable, if Parliament so wills, to withdraw theban on politics and religion proposed in the Government^ previous White Paper.In that event, broadcasting on these topics might be permitted as part of the programmes (but not as advertisements) under similar arrangements to thosefollowed by the B.B.C. These arrangements are:  (a) for religion;  a Central Religious Advisory Committee, with regional commitees;(b) for politics; impartiality in the treatment of all controversial issues, andsubject to agreement (revised from time to time) between the parties and the B.B.C. on party political matters;(c) the Corporation is not allowed to broadcast its own views.&quot;Paragraph 11 (Amendment)Amend the first line to read:  &quot;11.   Steps   would   be   taken   to   safeguard   the   character   of   the programmes. ...&quot;secret. (53) 3116th November, 195345126
