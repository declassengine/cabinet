THE NSW RIFLE AND AMMUNITIONMemorandum by the Minister of SupplyMy technical advisers do not share the view of the Secretary ofState for War that the Belgian FN rifle is &quot;as good as our own EM2 rifleand has proved more reliable&quot;.    However, I am satisfied that the Belgianrifle is an excellent weapon and I support the Secretary of State*s proposal that it should be adopted for the British Army, since I consider that theadvantages of standardisation are so great that they outweigh any smalldifferences in performance.2. The assumption that the Belgian rifle will cost less than wouldour own EM2 rifle will be realised only if we can secure a manufacturinglicence from the Belgian company on reasonable terms.    If the company should get any intimation of our intention to adopt the Belgian rifle, itwill of course become more difficult for us to negotiate a satisfactory agreement.    I trust therefore that no statement of our intention to adopt this rifle will be made until these negotiations are concluded and thatfor the same reason we should meanwhile refrain from ordering riflesfor troop trials.D.S.COPY NO.
