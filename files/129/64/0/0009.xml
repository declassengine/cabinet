HiSECRETC.(53) 3094TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINETMOSCOW TRADE TALKS: ADVICE TO BRITISHBUSINESS MEN ON ATTENDANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of Trade.Invitations are now being issued by the British Council for the promotion of International Trade (B.C.P.I0T.) to business firms to attend TradeTalks opening in Moscow on 22nd November.   Both the Board of Trade and theForeign Office are being asked for guidance by firms who have received suchinvitations.2. B.C.P.I.T. is, without any doubt, a well-organised component ofthe network of Communist front organisations in the United Kingdom.   their aim is, by dangling the carrot of East/West trade, to propagate generalCommunist propaganda and, in particular, anti-American propaganda basedon attacks on the strategic controls.   There is also a strong suspicion thatthe commission charged on trade conducted through these channels is usedto finance Communist activities in the United Kingdom.3. Our colleagues will remember that at the time of the PekingEconomic Conference last February, the Cabinet agreed that we should tellfirms that we would prefer them not to accept the invitation to go to China,,(C.C.(53) 8th Conclusions, Minute 7).   Some firms declined to accept this advice and thus obtained a trade advantage over their more public-spiritedcompetitors.   We think it important to avoid a repetition of this embarrassingsituation; and in accordance with our established policy of taking the leadin exposing and frustrating wherever possible the ramifications of theSoviet-controlled international networks, of which the B.C.P.I.T. is one, weconsider it necessary to state quite unequivocally that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would deprecate and condemn any visits to Moscow sponsored by this body.  At the same time, we think it unwise to do this withoutappearing to offer an alternative manner in which traders can take advantageof any bona fide proposals from the Russian side to expand legitimate trade.This line, which is somewhat stronger than that adopted in February, has thefull support of the Federation of British Industries.4. We therefore recommend:(a)   That we should make known, by means of an Answer to a parliamentary Question, our objections to this organisation and that we shouldurge firms not to subscribe to its activities by accepting the invitation to Moscow; at the same time, we should make it clear that Her Majesty^Government are anxious that British firms should expand their trade throughlegitimate channels.COPY NO.      &quot; /
(b)   That a written Parliamentary answer on the lines of the attached draft be made as soon as possible.A.E.4th November, 1953.DRAFT.question to ask........whether he has any statement to make on the issuing by a body called the British Council for the Promotion of International Trade of invitations to attend Trade Talks in Moscow at the end of November.ANSWERHer Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to encourage an expansionof legitimate trade with Russia and welcome recent indications that theSoviet authorities share that desire.   There are already in existence normal channels through which trade is conducted and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand, I am sure, organised industry, would be very ready to considersuggestions for facilitating contacts between United Kingdom traders and soviet trading organisations.   In particular, we have always favoured a two-way traffic of business visits between the United Kingdom and theU.S.S.R.  I am, however, informed that the activities of the B,C,P.I,T. arenot solely or even primarily commercial, and that this body, which was founded after the last year&apos;s Moscow Economic Conference, is a Communistfront organisation and is mainly concerned with the dissemination of communist propaganda.   In the circumstances, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentare advising firms against contributing to such activities by visiting Moscowunder the aegis of the B.C.P.I.T.
