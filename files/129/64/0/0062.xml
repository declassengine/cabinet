Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRET CAG iNc i   O rhUL Copy No.   6 9&apos; RECORD copy . (53) 362 U30th December, 1953CABINETRAILWAY wages memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as the proposal of the British Transport Commission to increase freights aspart of the means of meeting the cost of an increase of wages is sure to come upin the near future when I shall be in Australia, I think it desirable to put my viewson record.2. I undertook to consider whether there were any means by which I couldassist the British Transport Commission to meet the claim for improved wages forthe lower grades of railwaymen (C.C. (53) 79th Conclusions, Minute 1). 1 havelooked into this question and am of the following opinion.3. The financial arrangements governing transport are that the commission are required to make ends meet taking one year with another. Among the expenseswhich they have to cover is the service of transport stock, which consists partly of the stock issued as compensation on nationalisation and partly of stock subse-quently issued on further capital developments after nationalisation. To alter this position whether by relieving transport of some of the interest charges or by givingthe Commission some other form of assistance is simply to pay a subsidy to transport. The introduction of a subsidy would, in my view, destroy the incentive to secure all possible efficiency of working which is provided by the present require-ment to make ends meet (and the benefit of which can be seen particularly at themoment in the Commission^ effort to meet part of the wage increase by economy).It would open the way to pressure for an increase of the Exchequer subsidy as themeans of escape from financial difficulties of whatever sort in the future.4. Moreover, this particular form of financial structure applies to other nationalised industries and a subsidy for transport would be a precedent for a subsidy for others. The consequences of admitting the possibility of subsidy wouldbe perhaps even more serious in the case of the coal industry than in the case ofthe railways.5. Let me remind my colleagues of the substantial saving in the size and nature of the payments which the Transport Commission have to meet comparedwith their liabilities in the five years before the War. Then the total payments to the stockholders of the main-line railways varied, but on the average were about 35 million a year. In 1946 these payments were something over  40 million. Thecorresponding figure for interest paid by the Transport Commission in respect ofthe main-line railways is now  28 million. We should further remember that,when opposing the Nationalisation Bill, we argued that the compensation was inadequate.6. I therefore consider that we should rely on the increase in freight charges and on savings and greater efficiency in order to meet the deficit, In followingthis line we would appear to be in agreement with the views of the Commission.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,28th December, 1953.45413
