3oi^CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer regret that the Minister of Housing has felt obliged to bring this matter tothe Cabinet (C (53) 346). Strictly speaking, it is normally a matter on which the discretion is left to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am the first to look for cabinet help and guidance but there are certain aspects of my responsibility whichare better settled according to traditional practice. However, under the circum-stances I can only put the arguments before my colleagues.2.   It is necessary to distinguish quite clearly between two questions:  (a) Whether the compensation payments for planning restrictions should be financed out of revenue or by borrowing.(b) How much compensation should be paid, i.e., how much planning thecountry can afford.The first, I must maintain, is not a political question. It is a question of soundfinance. The second, I readily accept, has important political aspects. If I, or any future Chancellor of the Exchequer, should feel obliged to ask the Minister of housing and Local Government to spend less by way of compensation for planningrestrictions i.e., to impose fewer planning restrictions than he thinks right and proper, I fully admit that this may necessitate a Government discussion and decision. But we are not at that stage yet. We are dealing with question (a), andit is my duty as Chancellor of the Exchequer to see that it is not befogged by any political vapours emanating from question (b).3. Under the Labour Governments 1947 Town and Country Planning Act,the  300 million provided for compensation was to be paid in stock, i.e., in realityout of borrowed money. It was reasonable to borrow for this, because it was a payment for a capital asset, development value in land, which had actually beentaken over by the State and which was going to yield revenue in the form ofdevelopment charges in perpetuity thereafter. The new compensation payments,however, will not lead to any yield of revenue, as development charges have been abolished. There is, therefore, no prospect of future income which would justifymeeting their cost by borrowing.4. Moreover, they will involve a great deal of discretionary administration.Each payment will follow from an exercise of judgment by the local planning authority and an exercise of judgment by the Minister. It is essential in my viewthat in any such case the administration of the service should be open to scrutinyby the House of Commons, through the normal supply procedure. A system of financing the payments by borrowing and placing amortisation payments on theannual Votes would not be satisfactory, because such Votes would be ex post facto.The normal principle is that the cost of current administration should be broughtto Parliaments notice annually in advance and not afterwards.45344Printed for the Cabinet.

3c STTreasury Chambers, S.W. 1,10th December, 1953.5. I quite recognise, of course, the difficulty of estimating the amountsrequired, at any rate in the first few years, but I think the Minister exaggerates this.Other Ministers have to face the same difficulty. Surely, the more the Ministerargues that he cannot estimate what his scheme will cost, the more ground theHouse will have for insisting on normal parliamentary control. If a close estimateif cannot be made at the beginning of the financial year, the proper procedure is topresent a Supplementary Estimate later. Naturally I am not anxious to increasethe number of Supplementary Estimates; and naturally I do not like the heavybudget charge which the initial compensation payments will involve in 1954 and1955. But I am quite clear that these disadvantages must be faced rather than thatwe should abandon sound Treasury practice. It must be remembered that even ifthe compensation is charged to the Consolidated Fund, it still has to be shownin the budget account below the line.6. Whether we meet the Opposition^ arguments or not, I suggest that weshould also bear in mind that there is a considerable body of opinion in our ownParty which attaches importance to the maintenance of proper financial principles,and which would not fail to note such a glaring departure from those principlesas the Minister proposes. The new Town and Country Planning Bill now beingdrafted will provide, as we decided last year, for compensation flowing from localauthority decisions to be borne entirely by the Exchequer. That in itself is badenough, and will almost certainly be criticised by some of our party when the Billis debated. Removal of payments from the ordinary control by Parliament throughthe Estimates would be a great deal worse, and is in my view impossible to defend.R. A. B.
