RECORD OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS AND THE CEYLONMINISTER FOR FINANCE, SIR OLIVER GOONETILLEKE, ON30th NOVEMBER, 1953I had an hour and a half s talk with Sir Oliver Goonetilleke this afternoon.1. We covered a good many of the matters raised in the financial discussions in London. Sir Oliver would be writing to the Chancellor, but he asked me to let the Chancellor have the following confidential information:  (a) Double TaxationSir Oliver will leave the agreement to work and will abandon trying to find some special way of taxing shipping profits. If he should find it necessary to raisemore money by income-tax next year he will do it by putting up the flat rate. Hewill not know till nearer next June whether this will be necessary; and in any casehe would not say anything which would anticipate his Budget statement. But he wanted the Chancellor to know what his intentions were.(b) DollarsAs from 1st January Sir Oliver will by administrative order stop accumulatingdollars. Sir Oliver will keep what he has got in the kitty up to that date, but asfrom that date the objectionable practice will stop. He assumes that, if he doesthat, he will be allowed to carry forward from year to year amounts of undrawnreleases from the Blocked Account. Sir Oliver is most anxious that, for political reasons here, this should not be put in the United Kingdom White Paper.(c) Sir Oliver is drafting the necessary legislation to make his borrowing inLondon a trustee security and is sending the draft to the Governor of the Bank.2. We had a great deal of frank talk about the position and freedom of theBritish firms. I said that rightly or wrongly there is a feeling in London that,whereas both India and Pakistan were now most anxious that British merchantingfirms should continue to hold and operate their business there, they felt a gooddeal more doubtful about Ceylonese intentions. It was reasonable to want Ceylonsubjects to get a chance of entering British houses and have an opportunity of rising to whatever position their competence justified. But it appeared to be inconsistent with this and the alleged desire that British firms should continue, ifagencies for German and Japanese firms were confined to Ceylonese firms. Therehave also been some discouraging speeches by the Minister of Commerce,Mr. Senanayake.Sir Oliver said that he regarded it as vital to the interests of Ceylon that british firms should continue here. This applied as much to the merchant houses as tothe plantation companies. The object of enacting that German and Japanesefirms who had not had British agents before should have to employ Ceyloneseagents was to prevent Germans and Japanese establishing their own subsidiaryhouses or agencies in Ceylon.  I think this is a lie, or at best a half-truth.I said another handicap British firms suffered was in bringing in necessaryEuropean staff. Ceylon could not expect firms to bring in new capital if theycould not have the staff to make the capital earn a profit; and only the firm couldjudge whether a European was needed. You could not apply a mathematicalformula. It was far easier to bring in Englishmen in India. Sir Oliver admittedthere had been refusals and delay by officials, but he said that in the end the PrimeMinister had nearly always exercised his powers to over-rule the officials. I repliedthat that showed how badly the system worked. If firms were unreasonablyobstructed and limited over staff, capital would not come in. This sort of thing didnot help Ceylon or Ceylonisation.As regards Mr. Senanayake&apos;s speeches the Prime Minister and Sir Oliver hadevery intention of keeping Senanayake in his place. He had made some verystupid speeches and they did not even do any good to his own party. He was afoolish man who thought that he could make good in the Ministry of Commerceby making silly speeches instead of getting sensible things done. The Governmenthad already over-ruled an Order of Senanayake&apos;s limiting the amount of high-gradetea to be sold on the London market.
miSir Oliver admitted that one of the effects of giving licences to Ceylonesefirms had been that they had merely acted as stooges for Indian firms and had passed the licences on to them. The last thing he wished to do was to substituteIndian merchanting for British.As regards the estates Sir Oliver said that they had reversed the policy ofsplitting up estates. They had found this thoroughly unsound and they were satisfied that the only way to run plantations successfully was to have them run byresponsible companies with adequate resources.I said that I hoped on all these trade matters he would talk frankly both toour Senior Trade Commissioner and to his assistant, Mr. Cruickshank (of bothSir Oliver spoke highly), and to the heads of the most progressive British firms.This would avoid a lot of misunderstanding. Sir Oliver said he would certainlydo this.3. I told Sir Oliver about my discussion with Ibrahim Didi about the Maldives.Sir Oliver said that I had stated the economic position correctly and that Ceyloncould take a practically unlimited amount of Maldive fish and give rice in return.The terms of the new agreement should be satisfactory to both sides. He also saidthat it was essential that the fishermen should rehabilitate their boats and that hewas very glad that I had arranged for Mr. Cruickshank to go there. Sir Oliveradded that the last thing in the world Ceylon wanted to see was any Indian influenceestablished in the Maldive Islands.4. Sir Oliver went on to talk about our defence installations here. he regarded it as vital&quot; that the Navy and the Air Force should remain here for ever.He had no illusions about Ceylon being able to defend herself or being able to keepout of trouble, if trouble came. It was not only Russia; there might some day be a communist Government in India, and he realised how vulnerable and temptingCeylon would be if that happened, and how vital it was for Ceylon to be in theCommonwealth and to have our armed forces here.He said he hoped very much that we should not reduce our visible strength atTrincomalee. The Ceylon Government had been very anxious when there was asuggestion that the oil installations at Trincomalee should be moved to singapore and the rumour that we might be pulling out had created a very bad impression in ceylon. I said that we certainly had no intention of pulling out. The strength ofour forces in any one place at any time must depend upon the global situation andthe general disposition. But we regarded Ceylon and both the naval and airinstallations as a vital link in the line of strategic communications. Sir Oliver said he appreciated this; but that it would be a help if, whenever possible, British ships should show up at Trincomalee.Sir Oliver said he would exchange letters making it clear that if we built thenew wireless station at Trincomalee we could retain the use of this as long as we wanted it. These letters had better not be published and neither of us wanted any new formal agreement, but he realised such an exchange of letters was reasonableevidence of common intention and good faith.He then returned to the kind of navy Ceylon ought to have, about whichhe had spoken to me before. He said the best thing they could have would belittle ships (incidentally these would be very useful in stopping illicit Indianimmigration). This was so entirely in line with the note the First Sea Lord had left for me to see in Karachi and what the Senior Naval Officer had said, that Iencouraged him in this way of thinking. We must not think that the Ceyloneseare going to make any substantial contribution to defence. Sir Oliver said naivelythat our magnificent defence effort, the 40 per cent, of our Budget of which I had spoken in my broadcast, was a great security for Ceylon and enabled them to spendonly 4 per cent, of their Budget on defence.5. Sir Oliver then went on to talk very frankly about the Indians and thecoming negotiations with Nehru. He had told the Prime Minister that he mustgo into these negotiations with a clear understanding of what he was prepared todo. Politically the Government could not afford to put the Indians on a common roll. If they did, not only would the Indians get seven or eight seats or more for indian candidates, but they would hold the balance of power in a number of otherconstituencies where they would vote against the anti-Government candidate, who might well be Communist, and the Government majority would be jeopardised.He thought Nehru was prepared to have a communal roll and six Indian seats.These would be additional seats, bringing the total membership of Parliament up
SWINTON.to 107. There had been a lot of argument as to how many Indians were to be registered. I said that if Nehru was prepared to accept six seats as a settlement for nine or ten years, then surely it was in the Ceylonese interest to put ail the indians on the register, because assuming there were 800,000 Indians and that number only entitled them to six seats, then it was a good thing to register the lot,because in any subsequent negotiation they would start with an accepted basis thatthey had to have 120,000 per seat. Sir Oliver said that was exactly the view he took. If Nehru is prepared to deal on this basis they will have got pretty wellout of their difficulties. But they are in a difficulty, not uncommon in wobblyadministrations, in that they have apparently been saying one thing to the Indiansand another thing to their own people.6. Sir Oliver told me a good deal I need not record in detail about how he-was trying to secure economy in administration and reduce the number of CivilServants. He was also anxious to limit the growth of expenditure on schools.They had been building too many palaces. He wanted decent education but value for his money. I told him how the Ministry of Education at home had beenbuilding efficient schools at much less cost, and I promised to send him any usefulmaterial on this.7. Sir Oliver has obviously returned from London in a much more sensibleframe of mind. I think he wants to do the right thing; and, what is perhaps moreimportant in a Ceylonese Minister, I think he is convinced that doing the rightthing will strengthen his own position. He appeared to talk throughout withfrankness and sincerity. But the Ceylon Cabinet is such a hot-bed of intrigueand Ceylonese Ministers are by nature so unstable, that I certainly would not guarantee results. I am, however, sure that the visit to London did nothing butgood, and I hope my visit here has confirmed this and strengthened feeble knees.
