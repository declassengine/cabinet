secret GABi        OFFICEct(53) 360 &apos;&apos; &quot; &apos;24TH DECEMBER, 1953CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, the record of a conversation on 8th December at Bermuda between sir Pier son Dixon, Deputy Under-Secretary of State in the ForeignOffice, and Mr. Henry Byroade, Under-Secretary of State for NearEastern Affairs in the United States State Department.A,E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.23RD DECEMBER, 1953.PERSIAMr. Henry Byroade, who has been cooling his heels in Bermudafor several days, came to see me to-day about Persia and Egypt.Mr. Byroade began by saying that he was pessimistic about thesituation in Persia.    His fear was that after the British representativegot to Tehran, oil negotiations would be long drawn out.    The effect ofthis would be mounting difficulties for the Persian Government and growingunpopularity for the British.    He hoped we realised how important it wasto get off to a good start, and in this connection take the Persian Govern-menfs hint about Mr. Hankey.I replied that, as regards our representation in Persia, we were inclined to agree that it might be better to send out personnel who had notserved in Persia before.    In the case of Mr. Hankey there was theadditional point that he had been rejected by Dr. Musaddiq:  it was in response to a direct suggestion from the Shah that Mr. Hankey1 s namehad been considered.On the general point I said that Mr. Byroade was undulypessimistic.    It was not our intention to drag out the oil negotiations.What we wanted to do was to receive a first-hand report from our Charged&apos;Affaires.    If, as we anticipated, this confirmed that it would not bepossible for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to return, we would startcopy NO. 6 /
IS ^9,working for a consortium.    The constitution of a consortium would initself be a long business, and I quite agreed that a dangerous intervalmight elapse before the oil got moving again.    This, however, was a problem which our two Governments and the Companies concerned wouldhave to face.    Personally I had always found a reluctance on the part ofthe oil companies to make generous gestures by way of advances ofmoney before concluding agreements, for the simple reason that to do soweakened their negotiating positio n.    The instinct thus was to withholdcredit in the hope of making the other side more anxious to conclude areasonable agreement.    That, however, was a fence which we couldjump when we came to it.So far as things stood at present, Mr. Hoover andSir William Fraser, the Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, had gone quite a long way in London in discussing the possibilities of a consortium, and Sir William Fraser had in fact approached the major oil companies having interests in Middle East oil.    Mr. Byroade said he was aware of this.Turning to the political aspect, Mr. Byroade said that manyPersians - even those friendly to the West - feared that Her Majesty,sGovernment might work for the overthrow of the present Government ifthey could not extract a satisfactory oil agreement from them.    Could itbe said that we fully supported the present Persian Government?    I repliedthat this could certainly be said.    I had heard no suggestion whatsoever ofthe kind he had mentioned.In conclusion I pointed the contrast between conditions in persia and Egypt.    In both cases many members of the American administration had shown pessimism about the possibilities of a settlement on the linesadvocated by Her Majesty^ Government.    In the case of Persia we hadreceived support from the United States, and the result had been that wehad got the resumption of diplomatic relations, which we had wanted.    Whycould the Americans not give us the same full support in the case of Egypt?Was there not a chance that we might be right there as we had been in thecase of Persia ?8TH DECEMBER, 1953.
