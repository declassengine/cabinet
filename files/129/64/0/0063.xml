CONFIDENTIAL CABIN El   OhFiCE-      RECORD COPY . -C.(53) 363 COPY NO.    6 329TH DECEMBER, 1953CABINETINDUSTRIAL DISPUTESMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the consequences of a railway stoppage would undoubtedly have been very grave.    It is no longer fruitful to enumerate them but Ithink I must inform my colleagues of the likely repercussions of therailway settlement.2, This settlement was -(1) a surrender to force;(2) a victory for the Communists; and(3) damaging to constitutional negotiating machinery and voluntary arbitration.3. The action of the National Union of Railwaymen meant thatfor the first time since before the war a trade union had called anational strike.    In view of the development of voluntary negotiating machinery for settling disputes and the responsible way in which tradeunions have been acting, there was a wide-spread view that the strikeweapon was becoming out-moded.    The success attending the NationalUnion of Railwaymen&apos;s threat will bring this weapon back into use.4. Following the rejection by the three railway unions of the4/- award of the Railway Staffs National Tribunal, the transport commission met the unions, confirmed to them their previous announce-ment that they had accepted the award and offered a comprehensive review of the wage and salary structure.    This was accepted by the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and theTransport Salaried Staffs Association.    Mr. Campbell, the general secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, was confident that his executive would also accept.    The left-wing elements on his Executive,however, won the day and strike notices were issued.    Subsequently,during the negotiations which I undertook the attitude of the NationalUnion of Railwaymen&apos;s Executive progressively hardened after I hadbeen able to overcome immediate difficulties.    This was due to pressure from the left-wingers who very nearly succeeded in preventing a settlement being reached at all.5. This triumph of the left-wing will greatly strengthen thecommunist element in all the unions, and industrial negotiations willin consequence be more difficult and stoppages more likely.    In theV(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)
engineering and shipbuilding industries the unions have decided to banovertime and stop piecework from January 18th.    These unions are nowin a militant mood and we may be faced with a serious situation.    Ifthey carry out their threat it will have much more serious consequences to the economy of the country than a railway strike.7. It is probable that, in the negotiations which are at presentgoing on or pending in a number of industries, the unions will not beprepared to accept less than 1 j- a week - the minimum amount theNational Union of Railwaymen indicated they were prepared to accept.For example, after very difficult negotiations and following an award bythe Industrial Court to the employees of the municipal bus companies of 4/- per week, the private bus companies offered their employees4/- per week; there was reason to believe that the union leaders wouldbe able to persuade their delegate meeting to accept this.    In themeantime, however, the events took place on the railways to which I have referred, and when the delegate meeting did take place on21st December the employees decided to reject the 4/- offer and statedthat they would not be content with less than 7/-.8, The damage done to constitutional negotiating machinery and voluntary arbitration as a result of the railway settlement is becomingevident.    The terms of settlement safeguarded in words the RailwayTribunal and the award, but everyone in industry knows that in fact the award has been overborne.    The Engineering and Shipbuildingunions have made it clear that they would not now accept arbitrationor would not even look with favour on my action if I appointed a Courtof Inquiry.9. These results of the railway settlement are serious and makeme very apprehensive about the near future.    I am particularlyapprehensive about what may happen in engineering and shipbuilding,in building and in coalmining.W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.1. ,28TH DECEMBER, 1953.
