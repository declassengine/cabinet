Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    gC (53) 32017th November, 1953CABINETASSOCIATION OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WITH THENORTH ATLANTIC TREATY organisation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs there is widespread desire that the Atlantic Alliance should be a lastingpartnership. Some people hope for an Atlantic Union; this may be a laudableaim, but political federation is not now a practical possibility. Other people hopeat least for the early creation of an Atlantic Assembly. The establishment of a parliamentary body as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)is, however, open to various objections. The N.A.T.O. is primarily an organisation for defence and the bulk of its work is unsuitable for public discussion. nor would it be wise to complicate its work by the addition of a parliamentary body to&apos; the existing structure. Such a body would be regarded as a rival to the consultative Assembly at Strasbourg. In time it may be desirable that the Councilof Europe should be supplanted by an Atlantic Assembly, but at this juncturein European affairs such a development would be premature and undesirable.2. At the same time the strength and vitality of the Atlantic Alliance dependin a measure on popular understanding of its aims and benefits. It is important to build up parliamentary interest and knowledge in every N.A.T.O. country,and meetings between Members of Parliament could help to promote mutual understanding and to develop the sense of an Atlantic Community. recent discussions in the North Atlantic Council show that the desirability of closer association of Members of Parliament with the N.A.T.O. is generally accepted.The problem is how to achieve it.3.  I suggest that the right answer is:  (a) to encourage Members of Parliament to interest themselves in Atlanticco-operation and to increase their contacts with the N.A.T.O., e.g., byvisits to N.A.T.O. military and civil headquarters;(b) to welcome the initiative taken by the unofficial Conferences at oxford and Copenhagen for the creation in each N.A.T.O. country of an atlantic Committee representative of many sides of national life,including Members of Parliament, and for the development of anInternational Atlantic Federation based on these national committees;(c) to encourage Members of Parliament of N.A.T.O. countries to meet together and to develop an informal association;(d) to leave the initiative for such meetings to the Members of Parliament,but to authorise N.A.T.O. to help and co-operate.4. If my colleagues agree, instructions in this sense will be sent to the UnitedKingdom Permanent Representative in Paris to guide him in future discussions on this subject.A.
