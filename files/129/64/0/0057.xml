I  ANNEXExtracts from Reports from Kenya, Tanganyika and Nyasalando^ffi 1950- Jl# TanganyikaBVfH (i) &quot; I...  In October 1950, Abdul Wahid Kleis Sykes, then Secretary ofthe African Association, Dar es Salaam, visited Nairobi, where he contactedPeter Mbiyu, Jomo Kenyatta, Jesse Karioki and ex-Senior Chief Koinange witha view to discussing the formation of an inter-territorial political organisation todeal with African political, economic and social problems. Sykes said he hadseen Pant, who fully supported the creation of the proposed body and advisedthat efforts should be made to include the Rhodesias and Nyasaland . . . .&quot;BVH Kenya(ii) &quot; .... When the Kabaka of Buganda visited Nairobi in Novemberhe stayed for part of the time with Mr. Pant at his house in Parklands, where hewas immediately visited by Peter Mbiyu, who was by this time rapidly becomingBVjH Mr. Pant&apos;s favourite link with African politicians.   On the following dayPeter Mbiyu and his father, ex-Senior Chief Koinange, were closeted with theKabaka and Mr. Pant in the latter&apos;s office.  At this and other secret discussionsBVjH which occurred about this time the two Koinanges and Jomo Kenyatta-represent-?vH ing the extremist element in the K.A.U.---the Kabaka and Mr. Pant discussed thecreation of an inter-territorial political organisation to deal with political, economic,and social problems and a constitution for an East African Republic was drafted(a copy of this document was sent to the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi).If approved by people in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, the Government ofIndia proposed to submit this constitution for the consideration of the U.N.O.Committee on non-self-governing territories . . . ..&quot;(iii) &quot; . . . . On 5th August, 1950, Mr. Pant sat with the Committee whichframed resolutions from the Kenya Indian Congress session to be held in Eldoretand was present when resolutions on racial, discrimination and South Africanracialism were drafted. The following day he was consulted by Chanan Singhand Mr. J. M. Nazareth, then President of the Congress, who took his advice onthe framing of a resolution on proportional representation. ...&quot;1952Nyasaland(iv) &quot;. . . . A letter from Mr. Pant addressed to the Secretary-General ofCongress in February 1952, and read to a meeting of the Congress CentralExecutive, Lilongwe, gave a clear indication of India&apos;s interest in the Federationissue, Pant stating: -HVjH &quot;We are pleased with your strong rejection of the Federation proposals.Such action is a sign of growth of the country. We are ready to help you inBwA the event of trouble arising from the question.&quot;Kenya(v) &quot; . . . . Perhaps the most glaring instance of Mr. Pant&apos;s ready interferenceHwjfl                   in matters outside his proper sphere of activity was afforded during March 1952,when the Domestic and Hotel Workers&apos; Union was requested by the Senior LabourOfficer to send a representative to see him about allegations that Asian employersprovided inadequate housing for their domestic servants and contravened theBwfl minimum wage order.   Instead of doing this they went to see Mr. Pant whopromised to call a meeting of leaders of the Indian community and of the EastAfrican Indian National Congress to discuss the matter with officials of the Union,and deputed his First Secretary to visit immediately certain areas of the city incompany with the Union&apos;s officers. ....&quot; i
If . r IKenya(vi) &quot; . . . . With the detention of F.W. Odede, W. W. W. Awori, whosucceeded him as President of the Kenya African Union, was left in some politicalisolation, and turned his attention increasingly to his new paper Habari za Dunia.This was originally printed by the Patwa Press, Nairobi, on 21st May, 1953, butin June, Awori arranged for the &quot; E.A. Printing Press &quot; to print it, the AssociatedPress 1E.A.) of which Awori was the proprietor, being the publishers. Accordingto Awori, this resulted in a loss on each issue, so he reopened negotiations, whichhad previously proved abortive, to buy a press from the proprietor of the defunctTribune, D. K. Sharda. Being already very much in debt, Awori was unable topay for it himself and was obliged to expand the Associated Press into a LimitedCompany to finance the venture. African financial support being inadequate, heapproached Mr. Pant who subscribed  750, about one-fifth of the capital of theCompany, in the flotation of which Mr. Pant took a leading part, some of themeetings of the Directors being held in his house. In proof of this, minutes of ameeting of shareholders of the company were subsequently recovered from thehouse of one of them, Waruru Kanja, in Kisumu. This disclosed that the  750from Mr. Pant was an unconditional gift to the Company. The shareholder fromwhose house this document was recovered has proved to be the Chairman of a MauMau Committee and now faces a capital charge, as he was found in unlawfulpossession of ammunition.....(vii) Extract from Sir Evelyn Baring&apos;s letter to me of 30th October, 1953 :-^^fl                        &quot; To my mind there is no doubt that Pant is again meddling in politics; andthis view is shared by Patel, though I hope you will not quote his views either in^^fl public or in any approach made to the Government of India.   What I am aboutto write should be read against the general background of an increasing tendencyto develop the weapon of passive resistance in Kenya.   There have been the^^fl successful boycott of buses by Africans in Nairobi, orders to Africans to refuse^^fl to smoke, and other efforts of this type.  There has also been evidence, mentionedto you in another letter, of an organisation named Group 4, which on the onehand stretches out towards the actual promoters of Mau Mau violence in Nairobi,and on the other hand keeps a connection with Indian lawyers and the IndianCommissioner&apos;s Olfice. In this organisation, that is in an organisation in directtouch with the Indian Commissioner&apos;s Office, there are certainly some memberswho are active promoters of Mau Mau and who either have been or will bedetained. It seems, therefore, that we may well be moving towards a period ofpassive resistance in various forms-in fact later the main Mau Mau effort might ^flbe switched from warfare and violence to passive resistance. But I am sure youwill appreciate that in the conditions of modern Kenya passive resistance can onlyremain passive for a very short time indeed.&quot; Our one hope of avoiding these developments is, as we all agree, to createmore trust and better feeling between the different communities. This we canattempt to do with at least some chance of success if we could bring Europeans andnon-Europeans to work together as a team in the executive branch of government.&quot; As you know I am actively engaged in private conversations attempting tobring about an agreement of this nature.   I find the two elected members, Patel. a Hindu and Ibrahim Nathoo a Muslim, co-operative and anxious to come toterms. But I am afraid that my whole plan and the whole structure of possibleagreement carefully built up over the last few weeks may be overthrown bypolitical intrigues now going on in the Hindu community. An eloquent andpersuasive lawyer named Mangat, a Sikh, who has shaved off his beard, is comingforward as a strong opponent of Patel and as a champion of the view that KenyaIndians should look for support and advice to India and should regard themselvesas an Indian bridgehead on the African Continent, and not as East Africans ofIndian origin. From sources of information available to the Government andfrom those of Patel, and indeed from common gossip, it appears that Mangat&apos;sbamoaign is being directly and actively promoted by Pant. In this Pant could doincalculable harm and this comparatively new development also introduces anelement of urgency in the recommendations I am about to make.&quot;(viii) Extract from a letter dated 19th November, 1953, from the Intelligence^^fl                 Adviser to the Government of Kenya: -&quot; During the past few days Pant has had meetings at his house with Hon.W. W. W. Awori, M.L.C., and with Tom Mboya, the leading figure in the Kenyab H
I r . I^^^H Federation of Registered Trade Unions:   It is known that Awori and Mboya are l^^l^^^H anxious to be chosen to represent Kenya at the Regional Pan-African Congress ^-M^LjmWM due to be held in Lusaka in December.   Awori is in serious financial difficulties, ^LjM^LjaWm both personal and in connection with the Associated Press.  Both Patwa and ^LjM^LjmWM Sharda, the original: owner of the Press, are demanding payment and Patwa is ^LjM^LjmWM attempting to take control of the finances of the Associated Press, leaving Awori ^-m^LjmWM to deal with the editorial business. Awori&apos;s visit to Pant was certainly in connection^-mU with finance for the Associated Press.   It will be recalled that Pant played a notablepart in financing the original venture with a&apos; gift&apos; of  750.^^^H &quot;The reasons for Tom Mboya&apos;s contact with Pant are not so clear, although ^LjM^L^-M he is also employed by the Associated Press.  I have dealt with Mboya&apos;s recentactivities in a report which has been sent to the Chief Secretary and the Member ^-M^LjmWm for Labour. This shows quite clearly that Mboya has been thinking and talking^L^-M in terms of a strike, and in discussions which he had with the African UnofficialMembers, Hon. E. W. Mathu, M.L.C., had to warn him in specific terms that a^^^fl stoppage of work at the present juncture could only worsen the situation, and that ^LjMWm^LW the African Unofficial Members would deprecate any such action.&quot; ^-M^^^H Tanganyika ^Lwm^L^-M                       (ix) .... Visiting Arusha in February, 1953, Pant is reported to have said^^^h                 that the situation in Kenya is bad and in his opinion will get worse unless theGovernment changes its policy in favour of the African.....^^^1 (x) . . . . Speaking at a meeting during this visit to Dar es Salaam, Pantdescribed the trouble in Kenya as black Mau Mau and Dr. Malan&apos;s policy in^^^B South Africa as white Mau Mau.  He said there cannot be real peace until the WWa^mjmWM idea of multi-racial democratic government is given serious thought.   Africans ^LjM^LjmWM                 must be given a proper place in the country&apos;s society and African children should^^^h                 be admitted to Indian schools. Referring to accusations against India to the effectthat they are interfering in the affairs of Kenya, he said that when one finds the^^^fl                  next house in burninglnc] the person runs to help his neighbours. He said thatIndia would never support any racial domination, whether it is black fanaticalnationalism as in Kenya or white Mau Mau as in South Africa. Mr. Pant, referringto land hunger, said that another cause of the trouble in Kenya is separate electoral^^^h                 roll, the Muslims, Hindus and Europeans. He said that the present system might ^LjMbe satisfactory from the point of mutual relations between various races ....but the Africans would believe that people who demand to be recognised as Asians, ^LjMW-WM                 Hindus, Muslims or Europeans could not be regarded as citizens of a country ^LjMm^-M they are living in.....(xi) .... Pant arrived in Iringa on 8th August.  He did not announce hisarrival to the District Commissioner. He saw the Liwali and fourteen Africans on ^LjM9th and spoke to them about higher education for Africans. At a public meetingin the local cinema he urged local Indians not to misunderstand recent statements ^LjMby Nehru as reported in the Press which implied that Indians are only guests inEast Africa.   His Government, he said, was satisfied about Asian progress inTanganyika but this could only continue if Asians helped to build up the countryin co-operation with other races. They were not only here to make money, they ^LjM^LwAWM should assist Africans in every way, bearing in mind what is happening in Kenya.Pant later saw Chief Adam Sapi and discussed African education in India with him. ^LjM^mWm The District Commissioner, Iringa, commented on the fact that Pant-^^^H (a) arrived in Iringa without official notice; mjMMm^- (b) made no attempt to contact the District Commissioner or any otherGovernment officer on arrival;(c) held a public address in the cinema without official notification; ^LjM(d) invited, through Asian contact, Chief Adam Sapi, the Liwali and severalleading Africans to a private discussion. ....^^^1 (xii) .... During his visit to Tanganyika in August, in a speech at Dar es ^LjMSalaam, Pant said that before the advent of the British the Africans were happy.They did sufficient work to provide the necessities. Even when the British cameand occupied large tracts of the countryside the African had nothing to grumbleabout. The British, however, wanted the African to work on the alienated landand when they refused, taxes were introduced, which meant it was necessary for theAfrican to work. The Asians living here were reproached by Pant for not havingdone anything to help uplift the African. . . .
II* d I?-?J Nyasaland i -I&apos;xJi ?Wjwj(xiii) .... Pant visited the Protectorate shortly after the formation of theCultural Society in April, 1953, and again in September, and made contact withW. M. Chirwa, Abdul Sattar Sacranie, and Pranlal Dayaram, whom he met onVJwJ numerous occasions.  A reliable report has it that Pant, shortly after his arrivalin May 1953, addressed a meeting at Dayaram&apos;s house which was attended byAbdul Sattar Sacranie, W. M. Chirwa, J. R. N. Chinyama, A. J. M. Banda, andGrant Mkandawire. Federation was discussed and Pant assured those presentthat the Indian Government would support the Nyasaland African Congress in its ?JwJfight against Federation and advised them that Gandhian tactics should be pursuedby Congress. He promised to send them literature on Gandhi&apos;s and Nehru&apos;s fightfor freedom in India and stated that India would take the matter of Federation to ByHthe United Nations.. . .(xiv) .... He further addressed a meeting at the Queen Victoria MemorialHall on 7th May, attended by members of the Cultural Society and Congress. KfHIn the course of his address Pant outlined the nature of the land problem whichexisted in India a few years ago when many people had no land at all, whilstVJwJ others had many thousands of acres. He went on to tell his audience how the landhad been redistributed as a consequence of which peace now reigned in those areas.He said it was hoped that similar problems would be dealt with elsewhere assoon as possible. . . .VJwJ (xv) .... Pant&apos;s reference to the redistribution of land was not lost sightof by Congress leaders, since shortly after his departure the matter was raised at BvHa meeting of the Blantyre Branch, in which W. M. Chirwa coined the &quot; theft ofland &quot; slogan which was widely used in the Southern Province by Congress inVAy| propagating its opposition to federation. . . .(xvi) .... Shortly after the Cholo disturbances and prior to Pant&apos;s visit inSeptember, copies of a telegram were found in the house of Lawrence Mapemba,Secretary of the Supreme Council, addressed to Abdul Sattar Sacranie, who wasVJwJ then in Bulawayo, asking him to inform the Indian High Commissioner of theCholo events and of the suppression of African liberties. Pant arrived in Nyasalandshortly after and advised Indians, both here and in Northern Rhodesia, that theymust co-operate with the Africans.....
