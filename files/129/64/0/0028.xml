(53) 328    .23rd November, 1953CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsGeneral Sir Brian Robertson has written the attached impressive memorandum giving his estimate of the situation reached in the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations atthe time of his departure from Cairo.2. With reference to paragraph 4 of this memorandum, if the United StatesGovernment were to persist in giving the Egyptians economic aid, as proposed inthe message to me from Mr. Dulles (C. (53) 327), the chances of agreement wouldbe small indeed.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th November, 1953.Anglo-Egyptian NegotiationsAppreciation by General Robertson, 18th November, 1953Object of this AppreciationThe purpose of this paper is to analyse the situation at the time of mydeparture from Cairo, and to make recommendations in regard to a renewal of thediscussions and the line which we should take on them.2. The Points at IssueThese are as follows:(a) Duration of the AgreementAlthough the Egyptians have accepted a seven-year agreement in principle,they have qualified this by a provision that we must dispose of the contents of the Base before the end of this period, unless agreement is reached by theend of the fifth year permitting us to retain the Base for a longer period..This would have the effect of curtailing the effective life of the agreement, since we should spend the last part of it clearing our stocks away. The Egyptianqualification is therefore not acceptable as it stands, but they are likely to insist on something showing that there will be no prolongation of the Agree-ment, save by mutual consent, beyond the end of the seventh year.45226
(b) Period of Withdrawal&apos; :;-;.-The Egyptians have accepted a fifteen-months&apos; period in principle but have qualified this by saying that it must run from the date of signature of theAgreement instead of from the day on which the Agreement comes into force.This is an irrelevancy. Whether the two dates should synchronise can be amatter for later discussion.(c) Number of TechniciansThe numbers which the Egyptians have proposed for the final period are less than what we require and we should insist upon larger numbers to enable us to retain control of as many installations as possible.(d) AvailabilityThe Egyptians are stubbornly resisting anything which would make the base automatically available to us save in the case of an attack on one of theArab countries. We need an assurance that we shall be able to put our Baseon a war footing immediately a major war breaks out. The Egyptians havebeen pressed hard to put forward their proposal to solve this problem, givingus the assurance which we need. They show no sign at present of willingness to put forward any proposal. If the Americans would really support us stronglyon this issue, the Egyptians would probably yield, or at least come some wayto meet us. Unless United States support is forthcoming, the Egyptians arelikely to be obdurate and the negotiations may then founder.(e) UniformThe Egyptians are refusing our contention that our men must have theright to wear their own uniform, even though they may not normally do so.There are indications that they may be prepared to give way on this point,though some alteration to the present wording of our proposal may benecessary.(/) Air MattersAlthough the Egyptians have given verbal agreement to our requirements and although an agreed draft which covers them has been prepared on thetechnical level, the Egyptian Delegation have neither accepted this draft norput forward their amendments to it. It is possible that they have had secondthoughts about the whole matter.  We shall get what we want if we hold out.(g) Organisation of the BaseThe Egyptians have put forward a number of amendments to our paper on this subject. Apart from the question of the title of the Senior british officer, their amendments may not cause much difficulty. Until we have gottheir final agreement we cannot be sure where we stand on this very importantpaper. We should make a further attempt to secure acceptance of the title.&quot; Assistant Base Commander.&quot; Our present instructions adequately cover allother points in the paper.(h) ConsultationOur proposal implies a commitment for the Egyptians to allow the Baseto remain even after the conclusion of the period of the duration of the Agree-ment. This they will never accept and we may as well recognise it. It wouldbe well worth our while to drop any Consultation clause if, in return, wecould persuade the Egyptians to drop their point about the finality of theAgreement. (See 2 (a) above.) My opinion is that they will hot be open topersuasion on this point.31 The Present Egyptian AttitudeFrom the Egyptian point of view the main issue is undoubtedly availability.They are haggling on the other points, partly no doubt, for sheer love of bargain-ing, but mainly, it seems to me, in the false hope of weakening thereby our standon availability.When the Egyptians declined to accept the proposition which we put beforethem on 21st October, they were at great pains to preserve a friendly atmosphere.
Since then they have shown no disposition to renew discussions.. Until quite,recently they have seemed to be deliberately avoiding contact with us, includinginformal contacts with our Oriental Counsellor. On the other hand they have maintained strict censorship of the Press. While they are abusing us in regard tothe Sudan elections, they are refraining from doing so in relation to the defencediscussions. They have not seized upon the announcement of my departure toaccuse us of losing interest in the negotiations. In the Canal Zone, although theyare permitting a certain increase in minor thuggery, they have not , launchedanything in the nature of guerilla, warfare.It is evident that they are stalling deliberately. Their objects in doing so are probably:  (a) to avoid reaching an agreement on defence until the Sudan elections are over. They probably feel that it would be difficult to- run an effectiveanti-British campaign in the Sudan while they are engaged in negotia-tions in Cairo to establish friendly Anglo-Egyptian relations. they also undoubtedly feel that, if they fail in the Sudan elections, they will-expose themselves to double criticism if they conclude a defence agree-ment with us. Therefore they want to know what the results of thoseelections will be before they commit themselves further here;(b) to weaken our opposition, particularly on the availability issue, by puttingus in the position of having to make the next move; by making usanxious about the delay and, they hope, by exerting pressure, on usthrough the Americans.4. The Effect of DelayA certain period of delay is convenient from our point of view. This is partly for domestic reasons concerning the composition of our Delegation. Moreover,the anxiety factor can work both ways. While the Egyptians pretend that time ison their side, this is not really so. Although the short-term outlook is rosier,they need military and economic aid very badly in the long-term, nor will theyencourage the investment of foreign capital or their tourist trade until an agreement made with us gives some assurance of stability in their country.On the other hand, indefinite delay is not desirable. There is always thedanger of trouble in the Canal Zone where increased Egyptian pinpricks are tryingvery sorely the restraint of our military Commanders-. Moreover, the politicalatmosphere generally is likely to deteriorate if delay is protracted too long andwe might then lose some of the advantages which we have already achieved inthe negotiations. Unless some move is made when the Sudan elections are overand our Ambassador has returned, it will become increasingly difficult thereafter to break the deadlock.5. ConclusionNothing is to be gained by attempting to re-open negotiations until the Sudanelections are over. The Egyptians are not prepared to negotiate seriously at this time and they would merely construe our initiative as weakness.On the other hand, maintenance of contact is desirable so as to avoid thecreation of a position in which neither side will approach the other for fear of losing face.My departure has of itself provided one opportunity for such a renewal of contact, and I have laid emphasis on the desirability of constant contacts in anticipation of the renewal of discussions. I have suggested that by this means the way might be paved for a successful re-opening of delegation meetings.The return of the Ambassador will provide a further opportunity for renewal of high-level contact, and should give a natural impetus to a resumption of negotiations.As to the prospects of reaching an agreement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,who always inclines to take the comfortable view, has said to me that we are really in agreement already, and that it is only a question of patience to find themeans for expressing this agreement in words. It is true that there is very little difference of substance now, but words can cause a lot of trouble, and it is notDr. Fawzi who will in the end decide upon their acceptability. Gamal AbdelNasser, the Deputy Prime Minister and thost influential member of the Govern-; ment, has tried to give me an opposite impression at our last talk together. He isI  a man of moods, and he is concerned at this time by the dissensions which certainly
exist among his colleagues, and by the criticisms which are being put out by thepolitical opponents of the regime. However, it is my belief that his expressedpessimism is largely done for effect. He is no fool, and he knows that his regimedepends for its continued existence on getting an agreement with us, and this for two simple reasons: first, without it the regime cannot fulfil its promises thatit will get rid of our troops; second, without it neither foreign capital nor touristswill come to Egypt, and the economy of the country, upon which the stability ofany Government ultimately depends, cannot be put on a sound basis.Balancing the opposing factors, I come to the firm conclusion that we shallget an agreement in the end. It may take a little time. If the Sudan electionsgo against Egypt, it may take rather a long time, but I believe that it will come in the end.As to the terms of this agreement, both Her Majesty&apos;s Government and theEgyptian Government, say and feel that they have gone as far, in the making of concessions, as they can politically afford to do. This is the main reason forEgyptian obduracy on the question of availability. Gamal Abdel Nasser has told me so. But the Minister for Foreign Affairs is right when he says that, on this and on all other important points, agreement in substance does in fact exist. There-fore, without further concessions of substance from either side, it should be possibleto secure terms not materially different from those which we offered on 21st October.On the question of availability, it is a matter of finding words which will be politically defensible in England and yet take account of Egypfs unwillingness,again for internal political reasons, to declare openly that she has accepted any new defence commitment. With the exercise of some further ingenuity on our part, it should be possible to find an acceptable formula, on the one definitecondition that the Americans will give us at last, really solid backing to overcome the final Egyptian reluctance to accept any wording which is not entirely in their favour.Once agreement has been reached on the principles which we have been discussing, its elaboration in a written Agreement will require some time and patience. I foresee only one real difficulty, namely, the as yet untouched subjectof the jurisdictional status of our technicians. I do not think that we shall getthe conditions in this respect for which we have been instructed to ask.If we do get an agreement, I &quot;believe that the present Egyptian Governmentwill do their best to honour it. No. alternative Government is likely to behave betterin this respect: on the contrary. Therefore it will be in our own interests to supportthe present regime, doing all we can to ensure that it shall retain power as longas possible.
