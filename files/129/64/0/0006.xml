Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1953SECRETC. (53) 3062nd November, 1953CABINETPROPOSED   INTERNATIONAL   TIN   AGREEMENT   and united   KINGDOM   TAXATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Ministerof Materials and the Secretary of State for the colonies the draft commodity Agreement for tin which is to be considered by theUnited Nations Conference beginning at Geneva on 16th November provides forthe restriction of tin production and the creation of an international buffer stockin order to stabilise the market price. It is proposed that the management of thebuffer stock and the International Tin Council by which the scheme will be administered shall be located in London.2. We are asking the Economic Policy Committee to approve the general lines of the instructions to the United Kingdom and Colonial and dependent territories delegations, but there are two points relating to United Kingdomtaxation which it is necessary to refer to the Cabinet.3. It is important that the Tin Council and the buffer stock management shallbe located in London, because London is the chief international market for tin.To locate them elsewhere would also seriously prejudice the international business and reputation of the London Metal Exchange. Other countries cannot, however,be expected to agree to London unless they can be assured that the buffer stocksfunds, which will initially be contributed by member Governments and will be shared among the contributing Governments on the liquidation of the buffer stock,will be exempt from United Kingdom income tax and profits tax. The InlandRevenue would regard the Councils activities as amounting to carrying on a tradeand have advised that on that basis profits and income arising in connection withthe trade would, so far as they were attributable to the Commonwealth Govern-ments concerned (Malaya and Nigeria) be liable to tax under Section 25 of theFinance Act, 1925; they would, however, be exempt under international law so faras they were attributable to foreign Governments. This anomaly could not be defended. Immunity could be given in respect of the contribution of all Govern-ments by an Order in Council under the International Organisations (Immunityand Privileges) Act, 1950, requiring the affirmative resolution of both Houses ofParliament, and we ask our colleagues to agree that, if the Agreement comes intooperation, the necessary Order in Council will be made, and that the United King-dom delegation may assure the Conference that if London is chosen as the location,steps will be taken to exempt the Tin Council from United Kingdom income tax and profits tax.4. The position of non-British employees of the Tin Council may also beraised. Non-British employees of the 1949-53 Wheat Council were concededexemption from United Kingdom income tax on their salaries and the Cabinetrecently agreed (C.C. (53) 45th Conclusions, Minute 10) that a similar concessionmight be offered in the case of non-British employees of the proposed SugarCouncil.   The non-Dutch staff of the International Tin Study Group enjoys a45088Copy No.   ()
similar immunity in Holland. On the other hand, there are objections to the grant-ing of exemption to people employed by an organisation engaged in trade or business (as the Inland Revenue consider would be the case of the employees ofthe Tin Council), and we are reluctant to be parties to any extension of the field of tax exemption for employees of international organisations.5. We propose to instruct the delegations to resist strongly any proposal thatthe staff shall be exempted from income tax, but it would not be sensible to pressresistance so far as to sacrifice the advantages of having the buffer stock manage-ment located in London. We, therefore, ask the Cabinet to agree that this pointmay be conceded in the last resort, if it is necessary in order to ensure that london is the seat of the Council and the buffer stock management. If the Agreementbecomes effective, it will then be necessary to frame the Order in Council underthe 1950 Act so as to cover the salaries of non-British employees as well as theprofits and income arising from the buffer stock management.W.O. L.31st October, 1953.
