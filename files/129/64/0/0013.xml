SECRETf (C.(53) 313 COPY NO.   ^ %^7th NOVEMBER, 1953.CABINETEAST/WEST, TRADE:SALE OF FISHING VESSELS TO THE SOVIET BLOC.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Tradeand the First Lord of the Admiralty.At their meeting on 6th October (C.C.(53) 55th Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet agreed that there should be consultation with the Paris Groupabout the supply of certain trawlers to the Soviet bloc.  A memorandum was accordingly submitted to the Paris Group setting out our proposals to permit thebuilding in United Kingdom yards of approximately 30 trawlers (of which about one third would be the larger stern-operating fish factory type) for sale toRussia, and the sale of 5 second-hand trawlers to Poland.2. The Paris Group consultation is now completed.  As was expected, the proposals were accepted by all the countries except the United States.The United States do not share our view of the changed strategic importance ofthe trawlers nor are they convinced by our arguments about the quid pro quoin the shape of essential supplies from the Soviet bloc.   This attitude is, however,of the kind which they have consistently adopted in the Paris Group in cases ofthis kind.   In connection with the Paris Group discussions, talks have also takenplace, at the request of the Americans, both in London and in Paris between united Kingdom and United States naval representatives.   The United kingdom representatives explained fully the views of the naval staff on the limited value to the Russians of fishing vessels for use in war and on the unlikelihood that theRussians, whose naval problems are very different from ours, would try toacquire such vessels with a view to conversion to naval purposes,3, The United States Government have now submitted (on 2ndNovember) through the United States Embassy in London, and on the following day through the chairman of the team of security experts which is at present inLondon, memoranda which show that the United States Government still take theview that the appropriate method of control of trawlers is embargo, and thatthey continue to doubt whether we have shown sufficient justification on theeconomic side.   They wish to discuss the general question of shipping control as a whole, and have asked that we should postpone a decision on the sale of thetrawlers now in question until those discussions have taken place.   Trawlerswould be discussed first.   They think it unreasonable that an ad hoc decision should be taken on trawlers in advance of general discussions about shippingcontrol.   Even if the embargo is to be abandoned there ought, they say, to be an understanding about the nature of the quantitative control.   They are in particularconcerned lest the acceptance of this order by the United Kingdom should leadto the placing of other Russian orders in Europe and thus, as they suggest, to theundermining of the present controls,4, The United States Embassy were told when they submitted their memorandum on 2nd November that we might be prepared to consider control of future exports by quota (as distinct from the present practice of reference to the
quid pro quo) - such control would have to be agreed in the Paris Group, butthat we do not consider that the acceptance of the particular orders now inquestion could prejudice the position.5.We must now decide whether we authorise without further delay the acceptance of the Russian and Polish orders.   It is important to bear in mind that the naval staff do not consider that these orders, if accepted, represent any threat to security.   The deliveries will be spread over a number of years and in total do not exceed the number required as annual replacements to the Soviettrawler fleet,6, It is unfortunately evident that the Americans have no very clearideas about any alternative form of control of ships and that the discussions about shipping controls will not be speedily concluded.   Moreover the federal german Government have submitted a proposal to the Paris Group to build for russia 10 fish factory ships (of similar design to the stern-operating trawlersreferred to in the United Kingdom proposal) and 30 small trawlers.   TheRussians are making enquiries in other countries as well and our informationsuggests that these other countries will make every effort to secure as large ashare of the orders as they can.7. We think that the Americans will try as long as possible to avoidreaching any conclusion and that it is unlikely that we will secure their agreement.On the other hand the danger of losing the orders is too great in our view tojustify our delaying much longer a decision on a matter which is publicly knownto have been before Ministers for many months.   There will almost certainly beincreased Parliamentary pressure if a decision cannot be announced in the very near future.   We think therefore that we should now tell the Americans that wecannot delay beyond a week after the beginning of the further discussions on trawl-ers and that thereafter we should go ahead.   The talks should begin next week and wetherefore ask discretion to proceed on this basis.   If, unexpectedly, any important new consideration should emerge from the talks with the Americans we shallwish to consult our colleagues afresh,8, There is one subsidiary point.   The majority of the 30 newtrawlers are in respect of orders for one firm, Brooke Marine Ltd. of Lowestoft,a comparative newcomer to shipbuilding.   Their negotiations with the russians are in an advanced stage.   The old-established trawler builders have let their negotiations flag, partly, no doubt, because they felt that they would not be able tobring them to a conclusion.   As the outlook for the smaller shipbuildingfirms as a whole is very uncertain, and as Brooke Marine Ltd, would not beable to carry out the Russian order without a very considerable increase incapacity, we consider that, if it can be done without risk of losing the orders, weshould arrange so far as possible to spread them,9, We therefore ask our colleagues to agree -(a)that the Americans should be told, when we discuss further withthem the question of trawlers, that we cannot delay action inrespect of these orders, if no important new considerationemerges, beyond 14th November;(b)that, subject to (a), the Admiralty should issue licences toshipbuilders to build for sale to Russia up to 30 fishing vessels (of which about one third will be the larger stern-operating type) and to enter into discussions with trawlerbuilders with a view to spreading the orders as far as possible;(c)the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation should notify theowners concerned of their consent to the sale of 5 second-handtrawlers to Poland. ^6th November, 1953,
