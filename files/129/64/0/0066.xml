Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRETRECORD copy copy No.     84C. (53) 36631st December, 1953CABINETPROPOSED SALE OF THE LIGHT FLEET CARRIER &quot; LEVIATHAN &quot;TO BRAZILOver eighteen months ago the Brazilian Naval Attache informed the Admiraltyof details of his country&apos;s new naval construction programme, and expressed hisGovernment^ hope that it would once again be possible to re-establish the politicaltradition of having Brazilian warships built in British shipyards, which would alsoconstitute another bond in the long-standing relations of cordial friendship betweenthe two countries.2,   The programme consisted of:  3 Light Cruisers,1 or 2 Escort Carriers,6 Destroyer Leaders,10 Minelayers,and preliminary information was sought regarding prices for surveying vessels,river gunboats and a hospital ship.3. It was learned subsequently that the Brazilians had communicated thedetails of their programme also to British shipbuilders and to foreign governments,and that they were attracted towards obtaining the destroyer leaders from France.Vickers-Armstrongs Limited informed the Admiralty of their interest in construct-ing a cruiser and a modern-type submarine (not included in the programme) andwere given permission to enter into negotiations with the Brazilian Government tothat end.4. The Admiralty have considered whether it would be possible to offerBrazil one of the light fleet carriers of the &quot; Majestic &quot; Class (1942 programme),which have been lying in an incomplete condition since 1946. There are four ships of this class Majestic (being completed for Australia), Powerful (being completedfor Canada), Hercules and Leviathan. The terms of a possible transfer of Herculesto Australia are at present under examination. This leaves Leviathan, for whichthere is no present or prospective requirement.5. I informed the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Defence and the Foreign Secretary of the position on 6th July last, and proposed that Leviathan should be considered as available for offer to Brazil, but pointed out that the Brazilians had not been informed of the proposal, about which no further positive steps could be taken until a satisfactory settlement of the brazilian commercial debts to creditors in the United Kingdom and Colonies hadbeen reached. The Prime Minister observed that, while he saw no objection inprinciple to this sale, it should be put to the Cabinet.6. Notes have now been exchanged between Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atRio de Janeiro and the Brazilian Government providing for a settlement of thesedebts, and the detailed procedure for carrying out the agreed arrangements willbe the subject of an early discussion between representatives of the twoGovernments.   In each year from 1st October, 1953, the Brazilian government memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty45426
will make available a minimum of  6 million for jthe liquidation of the debts, andI understand that this will enable her to utilise some of her current earnings forother purposes.7. An urgent request was received on 14th December from the Chief of the brazilian Naval Staff through the Naval Attache in Rio de Janeiro for information about the availability and terms of sale of a light fleet carrier and an indication hasbeen given to him, entirely without commitment, of the condition and possible priceof Leviathan.8. If Brazil agreed to purchase Leviathan, her completion in thiscountry would provide useful employment in the shipbuilding and ancillarytrades and, should an emergency arise prior to delivery, she could be taken up forour own purposes: capacity to complete her in a commercial yard could bearranged.9. Initially, the selling price of the ship, as lying, would be put at 2-9 million but this might be reduced in negotiation; any reduction would besubject to the concurrence of the Treasury. It would be expected that the agreedpurchase price would be paid in full on the conclusion of the negotiations. In theabsence of knowledge of Brazilian requirements the cost of completion cannot be precisely estimated, but it is hardly likely to be less than  7 million at present price levels, spread over a period of some three years.10. I ask the Cabinet to agree that H.M.S. Leviathan should be offered toBrazil on the basis set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 above.J. P. L. T.Admiralty, S.W. 1,30th December, 1953.
