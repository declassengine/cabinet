I have attachedfor convenience a very brief summary of its recommendations.2. I hope shortly to submit, probably in association with the Lord privy seal (acting for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations) and theSecretary of State for the Colonies, an analysis of the report and proposals fordealing with the more important of its recommendations.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,26th October, 1953.45083-is
SUMMARY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DROGHEDACOMMITTEEThe Report contains (in paragraphs 49 to 73) a general summary of theCommittee&apos;s views and recommendations on the proper level of activity of theInformation Services, the British Council and the British Broadcasting Corporation.The object of this paper is to reduce these to tabular form and to summarise other recommendations made in the course of the Report.A. Foreign Office Services (other than Germany)The Committee recommend:  (i) in South-East Asia and Japan, a strengthening of Foreign ServiceInformation posts;(ii) in the Middle East, a reinforcement of the Regional Office at Beirut, theupgrading of Information Officer posts at Beirut, Damascus and Ammanand the establishment of Information Offices at Bahrain and Jedda;(iii) in the United States, some strengthening of staff, particularly outsideWashington and New York, the restoration of the post of EducationAttache at Washington and the appointment of Films Officers atWashington, Chicago and Los Angeles;(iv) in Latin America, a strengthening of existing Information Offices and therestoration of films work;(v) in Europe, the reopening of Information Offices in the scandinavian countries and Portugal, some strengthening of the organisation inFrance, the reappointment of Films Officers to Rome and Madrid anda considerable expansion of Information work in Yugoslavia.The total cost of these improvements (overseas staff and operations, but not central office of Information Services) would be about  270,000 a year, to be reached atthe end of a three-year period.B. Commonwealth Relations Office Information services the Committee recommend:  (i) a strengthening (unspecified) in the headquarters staff;(ii) the appointment of United Kingdom-based Assistant Information officers to Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras;(iii) United Kingdom-based Assistant Information Officers for Lahore andDacca;(iv) an Assistant Information Officer at Colombo;(v) substantial increases in Canada, including the establishment of regional offices in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver;(vi) United Kingdom-based Assistant Information Officers for Canberra,Melbourne and Sydney and also for Wellington;(vii) the opening of an Information Office and Library in Cape Town;(viii) arrangements to be made without delay for the opening of an InformationOffice in Salisbury as soon as the Central African Federation comes into being;(ix) the restoration of arrangements for bringing Commonwealth journaliststo the United Kingdom.The cost of these improvements is estimated by the Commonwealth Relations office at approximately  100,000, but the Committee feel that this may be too low.C. Colonial office the Committee recommend:  (i) the establishment of United Kingdom Information Offices in Nigeria, theGold Coast, East Africa and the West Indies;(ii) the establishment of similar offices in other Colonies at the appropriatestage of their development towards self-government;(iii) a small addition to the headquarters staff in London.The Colonial Office estimate the total additional cost of these improvements at about  60,000 a year.
D.-Board of Trade(i) The Committee make no recommendation as between the proposal putforward by the Board of Trade for an ad hoc committee to enquire into trade publicity and the proposal put forward by the Federation ofBritish Industries (and also by the Central Office of Information) forsome kind of permanent advisory committee. Both proposals envisagethe association of representative industrial bodies with the Governmentdepartments concerned;(ii) the Committee do not endorse the view of. the Federation of BritishIndustries that too small a proportion of the total information effort is devoted to industry and trade. They conclude that the overseas information Services must be strong enough to deal adequately with industry and trade as well as with their other responsibilities.E. Central Office of information the Committee make a number of recommendations, of which the mostimportant are perhaps the following:  (i) improvement of the London Press Service, both technically and editorially;(ii) an improvement of the feature article service, in quality rather thanquantity;(iii) a substantial increase in film production, with increasing attention to theneeds of television;(iv) increase in the circulation of the Arabic magazine El Alam and in theColonial magazine To-day;(v) the reintroduction of the British book export-scheme, particularly forYugoslavia, Indonesia and Israel.The Committee have not examined in detail the estimates submitted by the central office of Information for the cost of these improvements, but have included around figure of  300,000 a year.F. British council the Committee consider that the present status of the British Council as anindependent grant-aided body is the right one. They consider that the council should give the highest priority to its work in the under-developed countries ofAsia and the British Colonies, and the lowest priority to countries which share with us a European heritage.   In the application of this principle, they recommend:  (i) substantial increases in staff in India, Pakistan and Ceylon;(ii) small increases in staff in Burma, Indonesia and Thailand;(iii) steps to encourage the teaching of English in Indo-China;(iv) the maintenance of the existing Council operations in the Middle East,the extension of the work to the Sudan, Libya and Kuwait, the openingof a new centre in Haifa, the restoration of the school subsidies in egypt and Iraq and sympathetic examination of the proposal to establish aBritish school in the Lebanon with financial assistance from her majesty&apos;s Government;(v) the strengthening of existing offices in a number of Colonies and theopening of new centres in Malaya, Tanganyika and Hong Kong;(vi) an increase in the number of scholarships and bursaries for Latin Americaand the maintenance of the assistance now given to Anglophile societiesthere, except in the case of Venezuela where the cost is considered tobe disproportionate to the results achieved;(vii) a withdrawal of the British Council over a period of three years, from norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Switzerland, andsubsequently from Italy, Greece, Austria, Portugal and France; the closing of all teaching institutes, libraries, centres, &amp;c, in these countrieswhich cannot be put on a semi-paying basis; the appointment ofCultural Attaches at the Embassies concerned to maintain cultural con-tacts, facilitate educational exchanges and stimulate such exhibitions andartistic tours as can take place on a self-supporting basis or with the help of a guarantee against possible loss;(viii) the replacement of Council centres in Australia and New Zealand byCultural Attaches and the appointment of a Cultural Attache to Ottawaas an alternative to the opening of a Council centre there;45083 b 2
(ix) the restoration of recent cuts in British Council services (books, films,display material, lecturers, exhibitions, &amp;c.) and an expansion of these services proportionate to the increases recommended for Asia and theBritish Colonies (see (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) above);(x) no increase, but no reduction, in the present allocation for the Arts; andin conjunction with this, the substitution of a system of underwritingpossible losses on tours and exhibitions for the existing system underwhich the Council budget normally has to provide for the gross costbut cannot take credit for receipts.The total cost of these improvements, allowing for savings in Europe, is estimatedat approximately  630,00(3, though the full additional cost would not be incurredfor several years.G. British Broadcasting corporation the Committee pay tribute to the Corporation^ high reputation as a source of reliable news; recognise that it is virtually the only form of propagandacapable of penetrating the Iron Curtain; accept the view that it is the maininformation weapon in the Middle East; attach great importance to the GeneralOverseas Service in English; and express the view that the Far Eastern and latin american Services are at present inadequate for their respective purposes. Theydo not consider, however, that the European Services (other than those to Russiaand the satellites) are in general worth their cost. The Committee&apos;s concreterecommendations may be listed as follows:  (i) restoration of the General Overseas Service to a 24-hour basis;(ii) termination of the French, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Portugueseand Swedish Services, while maintaining (at any rate provisionally) theGerman, Austrian, Yugoslav, Finnish, Spanish, Turkish and GreekServices;(iii) maintenance of the East European Services at their present level, includingthe anti-jamming barrage; but the possibility of sharing the burdenwith other countries to be explored in the North Atlantic treaty organisation;(iv) a slight extension of the Arabic Service and the institution of an Arabictranscription service;(v) some expansion of London Calling Asia, but consideration to be givento the cessation of broadcasting in native languages to the Indian sub-continent;(vi) completion of the Tebrau (Singapore) scheme by the installation of thetwo additional high-power transmitters originally planned, thus givingmore effective coverage throughout the area and permitting the GeneralOverseas Service in English to be re-broadcast simultaneouly with theforeign language services;(vii) restoration of the recent cuts in the Latin American Service and thetranscription services in Spanish and Portuguese; but the strengthenedForeign Office Information Services to act as the British broadcasting corporation^ agents in Latin America as an alternative to reopeningthe Corporation^ own offices;(viii) some increased expenditure on listener research;(ix) in addition to the proposed extensions at Tebrau, consideration to be givento other capital development in order to maintain technical efficiency.The Committee&apos;s proposals would involve an additional revenue expenditure(allowing for savings in Europe) of approximately  485,000 a year. They estimate the requirements of capital development (including Tebrau) at approximately 500,000 a year over a period of five or ten years.H. germany the Committee stresses the special position of Germany and recommends that information Services Division of the United Kingdom High Commission shouldbe maintained on its present basis. As regards Cultural Relations Division, theCommittee consider that their proposals for withdrawing the British Council from western Europe invalidate the Foreign Office proposal for a gradual transfer ofcultural and educational work in Germany to the British Council. They accord-ingly recommend that the work of Cultural Relations Division should be maintained
under a Cultural Attache, and that his office should take over the limited functionsnow performed in Germany by the British Council. They consider that an organisation for Information and Education work in Germany of exceptional size and of special character will have to be maintained until conditions return to normal; and that, even then, a substantial organisation for Information work will,as in the United States, still be required.I. GeneralThe Committee has made a number of other general recommendations, ofwhich perhaps the most important are the following:  (i) maximum stability is essential to efficiency and economy, and all overseas information work should be based on a long-term plan not subject toshort-term financial fluctuations. British Council work in particular isa long-term investment and the increases recommended should be embodied in a five-year programme of development with some guarantee that the necessary funds will be available to carry it out;(ii) no major change needs to be made in organisation, but the Official Com-mittee on Information Services should meet more regularly, and con-sideration should be given to the desirability of establishing in additiona permanent advisory committee of independent persons to keep theallocation of resources between the departments and agencies underreview. Failing this, the Information services should be reviewed by anindependent body at least every five years;(iii) some increased responsibility should be given to the Central Office ofInformation, e.g., by permitting direct communication with information officers in the field. There should be more frequent interchanges ofstaff with the Overseas Information Services and more frequent visits by central Office of Information officials to Information Offices abroad.The Central Office of Information should be housed in close proximity to the Whitehall departments, and consideration should be given to thetransfer of ministerial responsibility for the Central Office of Infor-mation to a senior Minister without portfolio;(iv) the existing Foreign Office practice of employing a proportion of non-career experts should be maintained, but Information specialists, as opposed to local experts, should where possible be seconded from theCentral Office of Information. Temporary Officers should be givenmore security by &quot; local establishment&quot; or the grant of contracts for aperiod of years. The Commonwealth Relations Office should consideradopting the same system as the Foreign Office, though perhaps with adifferent proportion of &quot; career &quot; posts to &quot; specialist &quot; posts. Thereshould be a training scheme for career officers before they are appointedto Information posts. This would involve some increase in establish-ments. Allowances paid to British Council staff in the Colonies shouldbe reviewed and the British Council pensions scheme should becompleted urgently;(v) the abolition of the &quot; information ceiling &quot; is endorsed, but there shouldbe an annual White Paper setting out total expenditure on overseas information.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTOTHE OVERSEAS INFORMATION services .-IntroductoryOur Committee was appointed in October 1952 with the following terms ofreference:  To assess the value, actual and potential, of the overseas information workof the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, Colonial Office, Boardof Trade and Central Office of Information; the External Services of the british broadcasting Corporation; and the work of the British Council; to adviseupon the relative importance of different methods and services in different areas and circumstances and to make recommendations for future policy.2. We have had sixty-seven meetings and have heard the evidence of fifty-ninewitnesses. We have also had before us a large number of written statementssubmitted both by Departments and by non-official persons and organisations. Inaddition, we have inspected the work in various countries in Asia, Africa, europe and America.   We have come to the following general conclusions:  First. The Overseas Information Services play an important and indeedessential role in support of our Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonialpolicies.Second. This work should be done well, continuously and on an adequate scale.Third. If all these requirements are to be met more money must be spent onthe Overseas Information Services.Fourth. Changes are required in the pattern of the work in order to bring it into line with our political, strategic and commercial needs.3. These conclusions have been forced upon us by sheer weight of evidence.At first we were inclined to be sceptical about the value of activities which arestill comparatively new and have been the subject of much criticism. Moreover,we could not but feel suspicious of this invasion by Government of a field which inthe not very distant past could be left to non-official agencies. Nevertheless, wehave found it impossible to avoid the conclusion that a modern Government hasto concern itself with public opinion abroad and be properly equipped to deal with it. This is not just our own view. It is the unanimous view of all the Heads of mission, Colonial Governors and Military Commanders with whom we spoke. Itis the view of the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the ColonialOffice and the Board of Trade. It is the view both of the Federation of BritishIndustries and of the Trades Union Congress. And the same view is held by theChiefs of Staff who regard the Overseas Information Services as a weapon no less essential than those employed by the fighting forces. Moreover, unlike all others,it is a weapon which does not become obsolescent and which will be needed how-ever and whenever the cold war ends.4. In the following sections of this report we have endeavoured to show howour conclusions have been reached by going over the ground step by step in much the same way that we ourselves had to do. First it was necessary to find out howand why these services had come into being; next we had to know of what theyconsisted and how they worked. Finally, we had to assess the need for information work in relation to the political, strategic and commercial requirements of thiscountry overseas and the best methods to apply in different parts of the world.II. The Historical Background5.   To provide information about this country so that its policies would be understood and accepted abroad has always been part of the function of our diplo-matic missions.  In this sense overseas information work is as old as diplomacyitself. But in the past it was enough for diplomats mainly to concern themselves45030 B 2
with the small official world with which they were in personal contact. What isnew is propaganda and counter-propaganda in the forms and on the scale whichwe how know. The necessity for this wider concept has come about with thedevelopment of mass methods of communication which can be used by Govern-ments as a means of influencing public opinion in other countries in support oftheir foreign policy. Propaganda was developed to a high degree by the totalitarianPowers in the inter-war period; and it was used on a vast scale by both sides in thetwo Great Wars. To-day virtually all countries, great or small, use this weapon inone way or another.6. The British Overseas Information Services were late to develop and have grown up haphazardly. They have always, moreover, been regarded as something of a Cinderella by a people who instinctively dislike the idea of self-advertisement.Their history reflects this attitude of mind. The powerful propaganda machine ofthe first world war was scrapped as soon as that struggle was over. In the 1920&apos;sthe Foreign Office appointed one or two Press Attaches to the more importantEmbassies and established the British Library of Information (the ancestor of thepresent-day British Information Services) in New York. But it was not until the1930&apos;s that any serious steps were taken to compete in a field in which Othercountries, notably Germany and Italy, were already active. In 1932 the EmpifeService of the British Broadcasting Corporation was established and became thecore around which the External Broadcasting Services were subsequently built. In1934 the British Council came into being, though with the most careful precautionsto avoid the stigma of propaganda. It was only when the second world war beganthat a fully-fledged propaganda machine, the Ministry of Information, was againcreated.7. The Ministry of Information built up a very large organisation for propa-ganda overseas which worked side by side with the External Services of the british broadcasting Corporation and the British Council. Our war-time propaganda hadone simple aim to assist in winning the war. Lord Radcliffe,. the Director-Generalof the Ministry of Information from 1941 to 1945, has described this task asfollows:  &quot; Overseas publicity during a fundamental war .... could not con-conceivably confine itself to war news and war information. If those had beenall the wares we had to offer we could never have offered those wares. Thequestions which our overseas publicity had to meet were not only &apos; how areyou going to win the war,&apos; but &apos; why did your people think it worth while tofight it?&apos; and &apos; what are you going to do with yourselves (and others) when you have won it?&apos; &apos; What sort of people do they think we are?&apos; the PrimeMinister asked on a famous occasion. That was the real question to which our foreign propaganda had ultimately to address itself.&quot;8. Once victory had been won it became necessary to decide what to do with this war-time propaganda machine. It was recognised by the Governmentthat national propaganda overseas would still be required in peace-time but that,instead of having the single aim of victory, it would now be needed for a numberof different, although related, purposes:  (i) to support our foreign policy;(ii) to preserve and strengthen the Commonwealth and Empire;(iii) to increase our trade and protect our investments overseas.It was decided, therefore, that while the Ministry of Information should disappear,the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the Colonial Office andthe Board of Trade should each assume responsibility for overseas information workin their respective spheres. As the result of this decision a somewhat complicatedorganisation for information work overseas came into being consisting of four&quot; policy&quot; Departments and three &quot; operational&quot; agencies, namely the british council, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Central Office of Information.9. In the post-war period the four policy Departments have increasingly found themselves faced with situations which called for the use of propaganda. Immedi-ately after the war the most urgent need in the field of foreign affairs was to re-openchannels of communication and renew contacts with. the liberated countries ofEurope. To-day this post-war need in Europe,has largely disappeared and been replaced by new demands for propaganda most of which arise from the cold war.
At the same time there have been important developments in the commonwealth and the Colonies. India, Pakistan and Ceylon have become independent nationswithin the Commonwealth; the Colonies have advanced rapidly towards self-government. Finally, overshadowing everything, this country has been faced withunprecedented economic difficulties. These various post-war developments andtheir effect on information needs are discussed in more detail in the fourth sectionof this report.10. But if the need for overseas propaganda has been increasing since the war,the means with which to conduct it have been steadily diminishing. Since the warthe Overseas Information Services have lived in the worst of all possible worlds.Reluctantly accepted as being necessary in the post-war era they have neverthelessbeen steadily whittled down. So far as we can judge this has not been done inaccordance with any plan which took into account the needs of the country for propaganda abroad, but by a series of annual cuts in which the total amount avail-able for all overseas information work was reduced by a more or less arbitraryfigure. The Departments were then left to fight out among themselves how the reduced total should be divided between them. In practice this has meant thatduring the last five years the pattern of expenditure between the Departments andagencies has tended to be perpetuated by the simple process of reducing the previous year&apos;s figures by a more or less level percentage cut all round. Meanwhile, duringthe same period, costs have steadily risen. Taking rising costs into consideration as well as the actual reduction in the sums made available for overseas information the Departments have estimated that over the whole field of overseas information work the effective effort deployed has been approximately halved since 1947.11. It was no doubt because of the realisation that this process of whittlingdown was not only inefficient but positively wasteful that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in 1952 decided that the time had come to carry out a general review of the overseas Information Services. As a first step a Committee of the officials actuallyconcerned with overseas information work was established to examine the problem.The purpose of this Committee was explained by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office and the Financial Secretary to the treasury in the course of the debate in the House of Commons on the 2nd of April, 1952.Mr. Nutting said in the course of his speech:  &quot;Each successive year the overseas information services have been sub-jected to the over-riding requirements of finance. &apos; What can we afford? &apos; hasbeen the standard by which they have been judged rather than &apos; How much is it politically essential we should do? &apos; It is high time, in my view, that an enquiry was made into the political aspects of this field. We have, therefore,already taken steps to invite the departments concerned, together with theBritish Broadcasting Corporation and the British Council, to consider thewhole range of our overseas information services from the political and strategic aspects.&quot;12. The Official Committee presented its report on the 14th of July, 1952. its conclusions were summed up as follows:  &quot; We believe we have established the necessity for, and the advantages of,efficient overseas information work, on both political and strategic and indeedon economic grounds. The crucial question which now arises and which we,as a body of officials and others directly concerned with information, approachWith some diffidence is whether, having regard to financial conditions, the 0 - 25per cent, of governmental expenditure now devoted to overseas information is excessive or inadequate. We are clearly not qualified to express any opinionon the proper distribution of the national resources; we must therefore confineourselves to saying that in our view the international situation, the Communistideological onslaught on the free world, the need to right the balance of pay-ments and the necessity of maintaining Commonwealth relationships, alldemand an intensification of overseas information work and a measure of con-discontinuity in its financing, in order to permit operations to be so planned as toproduce their full cumulative effect. The Chiefs of Staff, who have been repre-sented throughout our discussions, have authorised us to say that they regardoverseas information work as an essential element in the conduct of the &apos; cold
war,&apos; and that, in present circumstances, where economic conditions are forcingus to curtail the build-up of our military strength, they consider an intensifi-cation of information activities Overseas essential to the consolidation and improvement of our strategic situation.&quot;13. Oil the 30th July, 1952, Mr. Nutting, in answer to a question put byMr. Ernest Davies, stated in the House of Commons that, having considered thereport of the officials, Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to appoint anIndependent Committee drawn from people outside the Government Service to investigate the matter further and to furnish Ministers as soon as possible with theirviews. Meanwhile, pending the result of this enquiry, the present level of activity of the Overseas Information Services was to be maintained.III. General Considerations14. One of the main difficulties which have beset the Overseas information services since their beginning has been the lack of a generally accepted body of principles serving either to justify their existence at all or to define their potentialitiesaiid limitations. Nobody in this country seriously doubts the need for the RoyalAir Force because the principles of air power are well-known and generally accepted.But when there is public discussion about the need for Information Services the argument is likely to be between people who share no common ground between those who believe in information work and want to see it strengthened in Onedirection or another and those who can see little or no good in it. We suggestthat the following propositions hold true, generally speaking, for the information services as a whole:  First. The Information Services must to-day be regarded as part of thenormal apparatus of diplomacy of a Great Power. They extend the range of the Mission so as to include a cross-section of all the moreimportant people in the community who are, or in the future will be, ina position to mould public opinion and influence policy.Second. Private enterprise is still the main source of the information andimpressions by which foreigners judge this country. Government activity in information is a supplement to private effort and should be so regarded.It follows that Government information activities should work throughexisting private channels in preference to creating channels of their own.They are likely to be most needed in those countries where privatechannels of communication are weakest, whether because of lack ofdevelopment or because of official barriers or because of deep differences of culture.Third. However, even when private channels of communication are manyand good the United Kingdom Government will still require officialpropaganda in order to explain their policy abroad. Individuals and newspapers can give to the foreigner a British view but not the Britishofficial view. Moscow Radio broadcasts and circulates leading articlesfrom Pravda as policy statements; the United Kingdom Government hasno Pravda.Fourth. The aim of the Information Services must always be to achieve inthe long run some definite political or commercial result. Overseas propa-ganda which meets a demand without producing some ultimate political or commercial benefit for this country represents so much public moneywasted.Fifth. Information Services should be directed at the influential few and through them at the many.Sixth. Winning the cold war is but one of a number of the current aims ofour information work. The Information Services of the United kingdom have to deal with, firm friends, dangerous enemies, wavering allies and theparticular relationships of the Commonwealth and the Colonies-a variety of problems and relationships requiring separate treatment in each country.
Seventh. To exert influence, whether by radio or through the printed wordor by personal contact, Information Services must have threecharacteristics:  Quality to attract they must be good;Continuity to hold attention they must be regular;Reliability to inspire confidence they must be honest.Eighth. Propaganda is no substitute for policy; nor should it be regarded asa substitute for military strength, economic efficiency or financial stability.Propaganda may disguise weakness, but the assertion of strength willdeceive nobody unless the strength is there. If it is, propaganda canensure that its presence is known and emphasised.Ninth. It is as easy to underrate the potentialities of propaganda as it is tooverrate them. The effect of propaganda on the course of events is neverlikely to be more than marginal. But in certain circumstances it may be decisive in tipping the balance between diplomatic success and failure. AGreat Power with world wide commitments is therefore well advised topay the comparatively small premium represented by the cost of efficientOverseas Information Services.15. These propositions throw considerable light upon the main problem withwhich our Committee has been faced, namely, that of determining what the scale ofour information activities overseas should be. For instance they make it clear thatit is not true to say, as it is sometimes argued, that &quot; the sky&apos;s the limit &quot; for overseaspropaganda and that therefore the only practical way to keep it within bounds is toimpose upon it some quite arbitrary financial ceiling. If, as we believe, the Infor-mation Services should be limited to reaching the influential few, and through them the many, then it is quite possible to keep the scale of the work down to manageableproportions. In addition any undue tendency towards expansion will be curbed ifit is never forgotten that Government Information Services are intended to supple-ment private effort and should therefore work wherever possible through existingprivate channels in preference to creating channels of their own.16. There is however, a limit below which the work will be ineffective.Information Services must be sufficiently comprehensive to reach a cross-section ofthe most important people in the country to which they are directed. They musthave quality and continuity. Above all the staff engaged in information work must be of first class calibre; the premises in which the public is received must beattractive; and high standards must be maintained in every activity which is under-taken, whether this be the teaching of English, broadcasting or supplying a foreigneditor with material for his newspaper. It would be better not to do the work atall than to skimp it.17. In assessing propaganda needs there is always, of course, the difficulty that it is seldom possible to demonstrate that propaganda has produced a definitepolitical or commercial result, because there are so many other contributory factors.Nevertheless, we have been left with no doubt that propaganda can pay a sub-stantial dividend both in terms of better international relations and of increasedtrade. We believe that the only practical means of ensuring that it will produce the required results is, first; to define precisely what is the end to be gained by propa-ganda in any given country, then select the groups of persons in the country whom it is desired to influence and finally, after a careful study of local conditions, employthose methods which are most likely to be effective for the particular type ofaudience.18. The essence of all information work is to discover or create a demand forsome service. The short-wave listener must be made to want to listen; the editormust be given something which he needs; the British Council centre must attractand hold its members. But it is no good providing these services if they merelyduplicate something which is available through private channels or if the demanddoes not come from the right sort of people. Propaganda can be expected toproduce political or commercial dividends only when the demand gornes from thosewho, either directly or indirectly are able, or in the future may be able, to influencepublic opinion and hence the policy of their country in a manner favourable toBritish interests.
19. The thirst of the people behind the Iron Curtain for news of the outside world is an example of a demand which can be filled only by Government propa-ganda; without the broadcasting of the Western Powers the news would not get through at all. Moreover, the audience is politically important since so far as isknown it consists for the most part either of Communist officials or politically-minded people who are hostile to the regime and have taken the risk of listening.In the same way, the assistance of the British Council is usually necessary in orderto enable an Asian student or technician to learn English and visit this country. Ifthese things were not provided he would probably have to go without them.Furthermore, the student can be regarded as being at least potentially influentialsince the leaders of the Asia of to-morrow will be drawn mainly from the ranks ofthe students of to-day. Thus a visit to the United Kingdom by an Asian studentmay well make all the difference to the political outlook of a young man who,since educated men are in such short supply, will quite likely one day occupy aposition of importance in his own country.20. But the same arguments do not apply with anything like the same forcein the case of, say, a French listener to the wireless or a French student. For theformer there are all sorts of alternative ways other than the British broadcasting corporation, for obtaining reliable world news. The latter, if he wants tosufficiently, should have no serious difficulty either about learning English or visitingthis country without the British taxpayer having to assist him. Moreover, inneither case is there any particular reason to suppose that either the wirelesslistener or the student will be important from a political point of view. We do not mean to imply by this that there is no need at all for conducting propaganda in a friendly, civilised and neighbouring country like France. On the contrary we havesatisfied ourselves that there is scope for information activities in such countriesprovided that these are of a highly selective nature and designed to influence thethinking of the people who are in a position to mould public opinion. For example,to look after the needs of an important French or United States editor orcorrespondent, to enable him to talk to the right people and see the right things ifhe visits this country, or, if he remains at home, to supply him through the Informa-tion Office with background material and political guidance we have no doubtthat these things are worth doing.21. Thus the value of different types of information work varies greatly fromcountry to country in accordance with geographical, economic and political conditions. This does not mean, however, that the various services areinterchangeable in the sense that one can do the work of the other. Each has itsown task to perform. If English, is to be taught, that is the work of the british council. If political information is required, that is the task of the DepartmentalInformation Services. The question which has to be answered in each country is whether English-teaching and other types of British Council work, or politicalinformation work, or broadcasting, or a combination of all three activities is most likely to produce whatever long-term political or commercial result it is desired toobtain.22. In three separate annexes to this report we have analysed in some detailwhat we believe to be the potentialities and limitations of these three main branchesof the work. Our conclusions, which have an important bearing on therecommendations which follow, may be summarised as follows.The Departmental Information Services (Annex .1)23. An Information Office forms an integral part of any modern Embassy orHigh Commission. It is required for the purpose of political and commercialpropaganda conducted through the press, films and other available media and provides the principal means at the disposal of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for anti-Communist propaganda. It also serves a very useful purpose as a source ofpolitical intelligence obtained from circles outside the normal diplomatic orbit.We believe that information work has now become so much a normal part of diplomatic activity that there is justification for maintaining Information Offices, in countries of practically every type. The extent and scope of their work, however,will vary considerably, depending partly on the extent of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs political and commercial interests in the country concerned and partly upon local conditions, i.e., the character of the local press, the outlets for films, &amp;C.
24. An Information Office will be likely to have most scope in a country where there is a free press and public opinion is able to make its influence felt.However, except behind the Iron Curtain, it is still indispensable, if only for, defensive purposes, in a country where the Government is hostile and the presscontrolled (for example, Egypt); experience has shown moreover that in many countries British documentary films can be used to good advantage even thoughfor political reasons the press may be chary about using our material. In short, the technique of information work is almost infinitely variable. In a highly developedcountry, with a good press, results will depend very largely upon personal contactsand the high quality and selectivity of such services as are provided. The BritishInformation Services in the United States provide a model of what can be done ina country of this type. In an under-developed country the Information Office can take advantage of the paucity of local resources and press articles, photographs,films and visual material of all sorts are likely to find a good demand. The sameholds good for the Colonies although up till now the Colonial Office has notmaintained its own Information Offices overseas but has worked through theInformation Departments of the Colonial Governments.The British Council (Annex 2)25. In contrast with an Information Office which deals to a considerable extent with day-to-day political issues, the British Council represents a long-terminvestment. Although its aim is political and commercial, it uses non-politicalmethods and is confined to working in the educational and cultural fields. british council work, we believe, is especially valuable in under-developed countries.26. The widespread desire of the educated in under-developed countries-particularly in Asia to learn English coupled with the wish to profit from theexperience of the West in grappling with such problems as industrialisation, popularand technical education and the social and administrative tasks of a modern Stateprovides a unique opportunity for British Council work. Moreover in the colonies the British Council can play a very useful part in breaking down racial prejudices.27. We are much less convinced, however, about the advantages to be gained from the work of the British Council in highly developed countries and especially those which share with us a common European heritage. In these countries thereis a large educated class with a great many unofficial contacts with the UnitedKingdom. Thus the Council has relatively little to offer and its work is not likelyto have a significant impact. We believe that cultural activities in these countries should be confined to stimulating reciprocal exchanges or providing services bothof which in principle should be made to pay for themselves.The British Broadcasting Corporation (Annex 3)28. The External Services of the British Broadcasting Corporation differ fromthe other Information Services in that their most important feature is accurate andobjective news for which the Corporation has acquired a high reputationthroughout the world. Moreover, unlike the Information Services which for themost part work through the press and other local channels, broadcasting reachesits public direct. The fact that it can do so over the heads of the governments is particularly important in that third of the world which is under totalitarian rule.On the other hand it cannot select its target with the same precision as is possiblein the case of information or British Council work. We believe that the value ofthe Corporation^ External Services will tend to vary in accordance with thefollowing circumstances:  (i) the extent to which the people do not for one reason or another have access to reliable world news. In accordance with this principlebroadcasting to Russia and the Satellites is obviously of value; indeed it is the only means of reaching the people behind the Iron Curtain. Thesame applies to a lesser extent to countries with dictatorial regimes likeYugoslavia and Spain. The British Broadcasting Corporation is alsovaluable in an area like the Middle East where the local press and radiodevote most of their space and time to virulent national propaganda;(ii) the extent to which a country is exposed to danger and the people look tothe West for encouragement and guidance. The countries of South-east asia, which are overshadowed by Communist China, fall within this category as do also the more exposed countries of Europe such as germany and Austria;
(iii) the extent to which the local broadcasting system depends on british broadcasting Corporation programmes for relay purposes. In theCommonwealth and Colonies the British Broadcasting Corporationperforms an essential role as the centre of a broadcasting network whichbrings the voice of Britain to countries which naturally look to london for news and whose broadcasting systems, built up very largely on the model of the British Broadcasting Corporation, depend to a greater or lesser extent on relays of British Broadcasting Corporationprogrammes. There is also a considerable demand for british broadcasting Corporation relays and transcriptions in the United Statesof America and Latin America.29. This leaves Western Europe as being the area of lowest priority for broadcasting since in this region to-day, except for a limited demand for relaymaterial, none of the above conditions apply to the same extent as elsewhere. Atpresent there is plenty of reliable world news and no particular reason to have togo to the British Broadcasting Corporation for it.IV. Political, Strategic and Commercial Requirements30. The next step is to apply the foregoing considerations to the political,strategic and commercial requirements of the United Kingdom overseas. It is, ofcourse, for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to determine what these are. Our recom-mendations are based on the following assumptions:  The Cold War311 This is essentially a struggle for men&apos;s minds a war of propaganda whichis likely to continue for some time to come. As a leading member of the Westernalliance Great Britain has to play her part in it. Three things have to be done.First we have to encourage our friends and weaken our enemies behind the iron curtain; we cannot escape from this responsibility. Secondly, we must somehowkeep on our side and strengthen the morale of all those countries, particularly in asia, which are poor, weak, suspicious, highly nationalistic and inclined to beapathetic about the cold war. Thirdly, the United Kingdom forms part of a greatdefensive alliance of free nations with which we see eye to eye on broad principlesbut with which in our day-to-day relations there is plenty of room for misunder-standing. Of particular importance and delicacy are our relations with the UnitedStates of America.The United Nations32. The United Nations has created a new form of diplomacy in which propa-ganda plays an important part. To-day more than ever before nations have tojustify their policies before the bar of world opinion. In particular the UnitedKingdom, as a great Colonial Power, has been the target of much criticism, someof it ill-intentioned and almost all of it ill-informed.The Commonwealth33. India, Pakistan and Ceylon have become independent nations within theCommonwealth and for the first time in history a vast Asiatic population which had long been under Western rule has attained its independence. It has thus becomeof vital importance to build up a new kind of relationship between the UnitedKingdom and these former Dependencies to whose service so many generations ofour countrymen have devoted their lives that it is unthinkable that we should allow their work to perish. There is much eagerness on both sides to make a newstart. At the same time Indian views of Britain and British policy are still colouredby a great variety of phobias and prejudices. But to off-set these potential sources of friction there are many ties of language, culture and economic interest whichwe should do everything possible to strengthen by means of information, educational and cultural work.34. Nor can the old British Dominions any longer be taken for granted,Every day they become more independent in outlook and interests and it is be*Coming increasingly necessary to preserve the links between the United Kingdomand these countries.
The Colonies35. The Colonies too are advancing with challenging rapidity towards self-government. As political control from London is progressively being loosened byconstitutional advances it becomes more and more necessary to take steps tostrengthen the bonds of sentiment and enlightened self-interest between the UnitedKingdom and these Dependencies. In addition there is a growing need to counterCommunist machinations in the Colonies. This can best be done by emphasising the democratic alternative to Communism, but a certain amount of direct counter-propaganda is also necessary. Finally, as was noted above, world opinion is becoming increasingly concerned with Colonial affairs and our relations with theColonies are increasingly affected by world opinion.Trade36. Since the war the United Kingdom has had to cope with unprecedentedeconomic problems which are certainly not getting easier to solve as time goes on.It is essential to increase our exports, but it is becoming more and more difficulteven to maintain them at their present level in the face of growing competition which will be greatly intensified as Germany and Japan come into the marketagain. We need to build up our export trade and to protect our overseasinvestments, which are increasingly threatened by the extreme nationalism inmany parts of the world. In our opinion the Information Services can help in this regard by explaining our economic situation and commercial policies; by maintain-ing an atmosphere of goodwill towards this country; and by increasing the use of english as the common language in the East. We regard money spent on these objects as an indispensable long-term investment.V. Information Needs Overseas37. If what has been said above is accepted as a fair statement of the salientpolitical and economic factors affecting the relations of the United Kingdom withother countries, and if our conclusions about the relative utility of different types of propaganda, as outlined in paragraphs 22-29 above, are likewise accepted, thefollowing broad pattern of information needs emerges.Foreign CountriesIron Curtain Countries38. In order to play our part in the cold war we are under an obligation to collaborate with our Allies in overcoming Russian and Satellite jamming and thusmaking the voice of the West heard behind the Iron Curtain. Broadcasting pro-vides the only means of doing this.Asia39. This area must be given a high priority both from a political and com-mercial standpoint. All three instruments of propaganda are needed. Thewidespread desire to learn English and to acquire knowledge of the West provides a tremendous opportunity for the British Council. Political information work and broadcasting are also required for countries which are weak and inexperienced,highly nationalistic and threatened with Communism both from within and without.The United States of America40. Anglo-American relations are of paramount importance. The main need is for an efficient Information Service which can explain British attitudes and policy towards questions of common concern about which, owing to differences in national outlook, there is much room for misunderstanding. British Council work is unnecessary in the United States of America owing to the possession by the twonations of a common language and cultural heritage. The British broadcasting corporation North American Service which provides material for relay overAmerican stations plays an important though subsidiary role in support of theInformation Service.
Latin America41. Here the main need is for propaganda designed to maintain and build up our commercial position. The Foreign Office Information Service is best suitedfor this purpose. Nevertheless, the Anglophil Societies in Latin America, whichare supported by the British Council, are useful as a means of increasing the know-ledge of English and arousing an interest in things British in circles which wouldnot normally be covered by the Information Services. The British broadcasting corporation is also valuable in this area since the news bulletins and transcriptionshave acquired a high reputation and are in demand by the numerous independentradio stations which are glad to use these services.Free Europe (excluding Germany)42. There is a need for political and commercial wo^k in Free Europe whichin most of the countries can best be satisfied by having efficient Information Offices.The British Council can perform a useful but limited function in promoting educa-tional and cultural exchanges, but as far as possible these should be made to pay for themselves. We do not think that in present conditions foreign languagebroadcasting to the Western European countries is required, but the British Broad-casting Corporation European Services should still be maintained to certain&quot; border &quot; countries, namely, Yugoslavia, Finland, Turkey, Greece and also forthe time being to Spain.Germany43. Germany, with her warlike, well-educated, efficient and intensely hard-working population, presents problems of the greatest difficulty and importance.To strengthen the forces of democracy in Germany and teach them to resist totali-tarianism of whatever colour may seem an impossible task. Yet to have at leastWest Germany on the side of freedom and to build up a real resistance to the nextwould-be Fiihrer are prizes so tremendous that they are surely worth our utmostendeavour, for in them lies the only hope of any lasting peace in Europe.44. For this reason Her Majesty&apos;s Government maintain in Germany as partof the United Kingdom High Commission a special organisation consisting of anInformation Division to deal with the press, radio, films, &amp;c, and a CulturalRelations Division which, by means of educational work, helps the leaders ofGerman thought and action to administer their institutions in a democratic spirit.We think that this organisation, whose work would be even more essential in a united Germany, is working well in Berlin as well as in West Germany and werecommend that it should be continued.   (For our recommendations see Annex 4.)45. The British Broadcasting Corporation German Service, which is to be improved by using local relay facilities, also, we believe, performs a useful function.The CommonwealthAsia46. There is a tremendous need to do everything possible to maintain ourties with India, Pakistan and Ceylon. All three instruments of propaganda canplay their part in this. In particular, the British Council is given a unique oppor-tunity owing to the fact that English is still the common language of the educated.But the standard of English must be maintained, and the use of English extended.Political and commercial information work is also highly important. The british broadcasting Corporation can play a useful role by maintaining close contact withthe national broadcasting systems and by maintaining its short-wave services in english. We are doubtful about the value of the short-wave services in nativelanguages.The &quot; Old &quot; Dominions47. Here the main need is for political and commercial information work.Owing to existing educational and cultural ties there is no large field for british council work although it is useful to have a point of contact between educational and cultural bodies in the United Kingdom and those in the other countries of theCommonwealth. The British Broadcasting Corporation can perform a usefulservice by providing material for relay purposes and by keeping in touch with other commonwealth broadcasting systems.
The Colonies48. It is vitally important to maintain our ties with the Colonies at a timewhen they are advancing so rapidly towards self-government and. are becoming increasingly threatened by Communism. All three instruments are required:Information Services to explain the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government; theBritish Council to assist in adult education in the broadest sense; the british broadcasting Corporation to supply Colonial broadcasting systems (which theyhave helped to build up on the British Broadcasting Corporation pattern) with news and transcriptions.VI. Recommendations Concerning the Level of Activity49. Our examination of the Overseas Information Services has shown thatthey are to-day inadequate to fulfil the various requirements outlined above. Notonly has it not been possible to provide all the services needed in the key areas,but often such services as do exist have been reduced below the level of efficiency.This last situation cannot be allowed to continue. If British Council libraries areto be maintained at all they must be provided with sufficient books; if there are tobe Information Offices they must be sufficiently well staffed to enable the Informa-tion Officers to get about and see people; if short-wave broadcasting is to continuethe British Broadcasting Corporation must be equipped to put down a strong enough signal to enable the programme to be heard; and if the best is to be got outof the staff engaged on information work and good men retained in it they must bemade to feel that their job is secure and that their work is considered to be important. As the result of the successive cuts to which the Information services have been subjected none of these conditions exist to-day.50. As we see it, then, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have no option but to choose between a considerable strengthening and expansion of information activities inaccordance with a long-term plan and this is what we recommend or, if more money cannot be provided, a very drastic curtailment of some of the existing services so that what remains will at least be efficient. We cannot advise the latter course because we believe it would cause an amount of damage to our interests outof all proportion to the amount of money involved. As will be seen, we have found it possible to recommend some economies which we think can be obtained,without any lasting damage to British interests, by curtailing the work of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation and the British Council in certain european countries. Unfortunately these economies are small compared with the consider-able expansion which we believe is necessary to do effective work in the areas of high priority.51. Our recommendations concerning the additional requirements of each department and Agency are set forth in detail in the four annexes to this report.They are based on estimates which were submitted to us at our request by theDepartments concerned and can be summarised as follows:  The Foreign Office Information Service52. In paragraph 23 above we have expressed the view that information work has now become so much a normal part of diplomatic activity that a modernEmbassy (except behind the Iron Curtain) cannot be considered to be properlyequipped unless it has an Information Office. We have also said that if information work is to be done at all it must be done well, continuously and on an adequate scale. Applying these two propositions to the present-day position of the ForeignOffice Information Service we have found that although within the financial limitsimposed every effort has been made in the past few years to build up the Service in asia, as the area of highest priority, nevertheless it is still much too thinly spreadin most Asian countries. In the United States of America and Germany, two other key areas, we possess strong and efficient Information Services which onthe whole have been well maintained, although in the former country the regional organisation is somewhat weak. The needs of Germany are dealt with separately in Annex 4. But in Europe and Latin America, which were considered to be of lower priority, a series of slashing cuts have reduced the work in most countriesfar below the level of efficiency and indeed, in several European and Latin Americancapitals, the Information Offices have been closed down altogether.
53. In these circumstances we feel bound to recommend that the InformationService of the Foreign Office should be strengthened in all areas (except Germany).What is required is not a sudden spurt of new activity but an assured expansion ofthe work over the next three years and then stability for at least another two yearsand indeed until world conditions change and call for something different. Thearea of highest priority should be Asia, but this does not mean that the whole range of improvements in Asia should have an absolute preference over the rest.There is also an urgent need to strengthen the organisation in Europe and latin america and to re-establish Information Offices in the more important capitalswhere they were closed down.54. The expanded field organisation which we recommend must, of course be supported by adequate services from the Central Office of Information. Thefirst priority should be an efficient press service; but films too are of greatimportance and it is on those that most of the recent cuts have fallen. Accordingto estimates submitted by the Foreign Office based on present-day costs about 270,000 a year more would be required for overseas staff and operations when theprogramme of expansion outlined above had been completed. Approximately 200,000 more wotild be required on the budget of the Central Office ofInformation for additional services.The Information Service of the Commonwealth Relations Office55. We recommend that a new and vigorous impulse should be given to theInformation Service of the Commonwealth Relations Office which clearly needsbuilding up. In India and Pakistan there are, it is true, already fairly substantialInformation Offices in Delhi and Karachi but in these vast countries the regional organisation is much too weak and the existing one-man offices (that is to say theyeach have only one United Kingdom based officer) in cities such as Bombay,Madras, Calcutta, Dacca and Lahore require strengthening, while the headquarteroffices in the capitals themselves require to be reinforced in order both to supportwith adequate services the larger regional organisation which we recommend and todevelop the work in the regions of which these capitals form the centre. We feel strongly that provision should be made for bringing to the United Kingdom, parties of journalists from the Indian sub-continent.56. In the old Dominions too it is our impression that United KingdomInformation Services are very under-staffed. Here again they are particularly weakin the provinces. For instance, we were much struck by the inadequacy of theexisting organisation in Canada which consists solely of a small office in Ottawa.We believe that it is essential to have offices as well in Montreal (to deal with french-speaking Canada), in Toronto and in Vancouver.57. We assume that provision will be made for an Information Office in salisbury as soon as the Central African Federation comes into being; we attachconsiderable importance to this matter.58. Based on present costs we estimate that an additional  100,000 a year willbe required for staff and operations in the field when the Commonwealth relations office Information Service has been built up to the extent which we consider necessary. Approximately  70,000 more is required on the Central Office ofInformation budget for services.The Colonial Office Information Service59. The Colonial Office do not at the moment maintain an organisation for united Kingdom information work in the Colonies. Their Information Serviceconsists only of a small head office in London which, drawing its supplies from theCentral Office of Information, provides material for distribution by the InformationDepartments of the Colonial Governments. This system is no longer satisfactory in those Colonies which have advanced far along the path towards self-governmentand particularly in those cases where native-born Ministers are now responsiblefor the work of the Colonial Governments&apos; Information Departments. It is the function of these Departments to serve the interests of the Colonial Government,not of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and after a certain stage of development hasbeen reached it becomes difficult and even embarrassing for them to act also asthe main channel for information and publicity about the&quot;United Kingdom. Apartfrom this, the Colonies are increasingly becoming a target for communist propaganda and there is a need for counter-propaganda designed both to expose
the dangers of Communism and expound the virtues of the democratic way of lifeas an alternative to Communism. We therefore believe that in certain Colonies,United Kingdom Information Offices should be set up to ensure that there iseffective representation of the British point of view, effective distribution of Britishmaterial and effective anti-Communist propaganda.60. As a beginning, we recommend that four of these offices should beestablished in Nigeria, the Gold Coast, East Africa and the West Indies. As otherColonies get nearer to self-government such offices may well be required elsewhere;they should be regarded as being, as it were, the advance guard of the HighCommissions which will eventually be required when - these territories achieveindependence within the Commonwealth. The estimated annual cost of the fourUnited Kingdom offices proposed is approximately  60,000. Approximately 30,000 more is required on the Central Office of Information budget in order toprovide these new offices with material and also to supply suitable material toColonial Government Information Departments in the remaining territories.The Board of Trade61. The Board of Trade do not maintain an Information Service of their ownoverseas, but rely on the Information Offices of the Overseas Departments whowork in close collaboration with Commercial Diplomatic Officers in Her Majesty&apos;sMissions abroad and the Trade Commissioners in Commonwealth countries. TheBoard are, however, concerned to ensure that Information Offices are given asufficient flow of material to enable them to make known the industrial capacitiesand achievements of this country and they have expressed to us the view that more should be done by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in this field, working in closepartnership with private industry. This is also the view of the Federation ofBritish Industries. However, when invited by our Committee to elaborate in greater detail their suggestion for a closer partnership between industry and Govern-ment for the purpose of increasing the volume of commercial publicity overseas,the Board of Trade, to our great surprise, informed us that the problem was not sufficiently clearly defined to permit them to draw up a realistic plan. they proposed, therefore, that they should invite the chief bodies representing industryto nominate persons to sit on a special Committee which should survey the wholefield of British industrial publicity overseas, area by area, and make recommendations.62. We understand that the Federation of British Industries for their partdo not see the need for such an ad hoc Committee, but would prefer that a perm-anent Advisory Committee, on which industry would be represented, should beset up for the purpose of ensuring the closest possible co-operation between government and industry in presenting the picture of British industrialachievement overseas. Since this problem which we think is a real and urgentone is no doubt under consideration by Her Majesty&apos;s Government we make no recommendation.63. However, when making proposals for the expansion of the overseas information Services, we have been very conscious of the importance of havingadequate machinery overseas to cover the needs of commercial information. Itwas indeed largely for this reason that we have proposed that the information services in Latin America should be strengthened and likewise, in the Common-wealth and throughout Asia, we envisage that the expanded Information services which we have recommended should be equipped to do not only political informa-tion work but also commercial publicity. It is important, however, to remember that official propaganda, while useful as a means of building up general goodwilltowards British goods and services, can never be a substitute for industry&apos;s own efforts; and indeed the Overseas Information Services can do little by themselvesin this field unless industry provides them with a regular flow of material upon whichpublicity can be based.The Central Office of Information64. The additional requirements of the Central Office of Information arisenaturally from our recommendations concerning the scale of the field organisationof the various Overseas Information Departments. Information work overseas must obviously be supported by adequate services of material. The primary require-ments are to increase the efficiency of the overseas press service and to increase
the supply of films. These latter are required especially for use in under-developed countries; but it is also necessary to keep up the flow of more sophisticated docu-mentary films for use in the United States of America, the Commonwealth and europe for which there is a good market and from which a substantial revenue isearned from rentals and sales. More money is also required for publications,reference material, photographs and display material. We estimate that the budget of the Central Office of Information (including that of Her Majesty&apos;s stationery office) should be increased by  300,000. The problem of the organisation of theCentral Office of Information and its relationship with Overseas Departments is discussed in the next section of this report.The British Council65. For reasons which we have explained, we believe that the work of theBritish Council is of particular importance in under-developed countries. Werecommend, therefore, a very considerable expansion of the work of the british council in Asia and in the British Colonies where the existing scale of activity isquite inadequate for what has to be done.66. We believe that the time has come for a new approach to the work ofthe British Council in Europe. We recommend that existing institutes and Anglo-phil societies should, within the next three years, be made as nearly self-supportingas possible by means of fees and subscriptions and that those centres which show no signs of becoming self-supporting within that period should be closed down.Educational and cultural exchanges should be encouraged in accordance with thespirit of the Cultural Conventions which successive Governments have concluded with other countries. But as far as possible these exchanges should be made topay for themselves. Since, therefore, little in the way of organisation would be needed, we recommend that Cultural Attaches should be appointed in most of theEuropean capitals and the British Council offices closed down, with due precautionstaken, however, to prepare the ground for this change so as not to arouse politicalill-feeling (for further details of these proposals see &quot;Annex 2).67. In Latin America the support now being given by the British Councilto the Anglophil societies should be maintained, with the exception of the centrein Venezuela, which, for reasons explained in Annex 2, we think should be closed down. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, Cultural Attaches should beappointed with a view to promoting educational and cultural exchanges; but, asin the case of Europe, these exchanges should as far as possible be conducted by private bodies.68. The various supply services of the British Council, particularly those of books and films, should be built up to a size commensurate with the scale of theactivities which we have recommended should be undertaken overseas; and theamount of money available for looking after visitors to the United Kingdom andfor granting scholarships and bursaries, particularly to Asian, Commonwealth andLatin American students, should, we believe, be increased.69. We estimate that for all these purposes, as well as for improving theconditions of British Council staff, an additional sum of approximately  630,000a year should be provided. This, however, does not make any allowance for what may be an appreciable saving in Europe if our recommendations are adopted.70. We realise that we are recommending a fundamental reorientation ofthe work of the Council-a change of emphasis from cultural to educational workand from the more developed to the less developed parts of the world. But webelieve that this new orientation of the work is fully justified in the existing conditions of the world. As we see it, there is a tremendous task of a specialcharacter to be fulfilled by the Council in Asia and the Colonies to which we thinkit should devote the greater part of its efforts for at least the next ten years.The British Broadcasting Corporation71. Unlike other information activities, overseas broadcasting requires alarge investment in buildings and technical equipment which makes the cost ofthe overheads relatively high in comparison with what is spent on the actualprogrammes. This installation cannot be improvised at short notice to meet anemergency therefore, quite apart from any consideration of present-day needs,it is necessary to be prepared for what may be required in the event of anotherwar.  Since the last war the grants for overseas broadcasting, although they have
not suffered as much as those for other kinds of information work, have not keptpace with rising costs. Moreover a considerable proportion of the resources available have had to be diverted to building up the barrage against Soviet Russiaand the Satellites. The result has been that most other programmes have had tobe cut. down in length, content and transmitter power, and some of them are nowclose to the point of being ineffective. The cuts have been particularly unfortunatein Latin America where the British Broadcasting Corporation had enjoyed a highreputation. And again in the Far East, despite the investment made in the relaystation at Tebrau, it has never been possible to develop these services beyond a&quot; care and maintenance &quot; stage.72. On the other hand the cuts in the services have never been sufficientlysweeping to permit of any very large saving in overheads. In Western Europe,although the special political conditions of the war-time and immediate post-war period have now largely disappeared, a large range of foreign language services is still maintained on a reduced time schedule. Our views concerning the relativeutility of short-wave broadcasting in different circumstances were summarised inparagraph 28 above. In accordance with these views our recommendations forthe British Broadcasting Corporation may be summarised as follows:  (1) The General Overseas Service in English (which is of vital importance for the Commonwealth and Colonies and for British communities inforeign countries) should be restored as a &quot; round-the-clock &quot; service.(2) Existing broadcasts to the countries behind the Iron Curtain should bemaintained and the effort to overcome the Russian and Satellitejamming continued.(3) The Middle Eastern Service in Arabic should be somewhat extended anda transcription service in Arabic initiated.(4) The Far Eastern Services should be strengthened, for which purpose (as also in order to strengthen the signal of broadcasts to Australia andNew Zealand) two additional transmitters should be installed in Tebrau.(5) The Latin American Service and the transcription service in Spanish andPortuguese should be restored. We do not, however, recommend thatthe British Broadcasting Corporation offices in Latin America shouldbe reopened, but instead, in our proposals for strengthening theInformation Service in Latin America, we have made provision for additional staff to handle British Broadcasting Corporation transcrip-tions and relays.(6) The North American Service, the various special services for the colonies and the German, Austrian, Finnish, Spanish, Turkish, Yugoslav and greek Services should be maintained at their present level. The EnglishService to Europe should also be maintained.(7) For reasons explained in paragraph 29 above (and this matter is discussedmore fully in Annex 3) the following European foreign language services should be eliminated: French, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian,Portuguese and Swedish.73. We estimate that, making allowance for the probable saving in Europe,the revenue expenditure of the British Broadcasting Corporation should beincreased by approximately  485,000 if our recommendations are adopted. Moreimportant than this, however (for we believe firmly that if a choice had to be made between increasing the present-day level of broadcasting and capital development,preference should be given to the latter), it is necessary to provide funds for capitalexpenditure. The British Broadcasting Corporation must be adequately equipped with up-to-date relay and other technical facilities so as to be able to put down a strong signal wherever and whenever required. This, we are convinced, is much better than clinging on to wave-lengths and keeping up services of doubtful peace-time value in Europe to provide for possible war-time needs, the precise natureof which cannot be predicted. We have recommended that two additional trans-mitters should be installed at Tebrau in order to strengthen the Far EasternServices. It has been impossible for our Committee to examine in any detail the merits of the various other major capital projects in which the British broadcasting corporation is interested. But so far as we can estimate, at a very minimum 500,000 a year should be provided for capital development during the next five or ten years.
VII. Financial Requirements74. The above recommendations postulate a planned expansion of the workof the Information Services which should be carried out in stages over a period of3-5 years. Whether these recommendations are approved or not we are sure that it would be wise to establish from the beginning a five years&apos; programme of activities taking a long view of the financial position of the country; for anythingwould be better than the present state of uncertainty and last minute decisions.We estimate that if our recommendations are adopted in full they will, at presentcosts, have the effect of increasing revenue expenditure on the Overseas information services at the end of the planning period approximately as follows:  Departmental Information Services    Foreign Office   ...............      270,000Commonwealth Relations Office      .......100,000Colonial Office...............       60,000Central Office of Information.........      300,000-. 730,000British Council        ............... 630,000British Broadcasting Corporation......... 485,000Total additional annual revenue expenditure... 1,845,00075. This increased expenditure of  1,845,000 compares with approximately 10 million per year which is being spent to-day on the Overseas information services. To this figure, however, must be added at least another  500,000 a year,for the next five or ten years, to provide for long overdue capital development bythe British Broadcasting Corporation. The total percentage increase would there-fore be likely to be in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent. These figures are, ofcourse, intended to be no more than illustrative of the scale of the expansion whichwe believe is necessary. Departmental estimates would have to be examined in which more detail than we were able to do. Moreover, costs may go up or downduring the next 3-5 years so that the final level of expenditure (about  12,500,000)may be somewhat higher or lower than that which we have suggested.76. An expenditure of  12,500,000 per year compares with some  65,000,000spent in 1952 by the United States Government on overseas information work.*No figures are available to indicate the scale of expenditure of Soviet Russia on propaganda. But it must be vast, especially if the expenditure of local Communistparties is taken into account. The statistics for broadcasting give some indication of the manner in which Soviet propaganda has been increasing since the war and show that Soviet and Satellite broadcasting output rose from 425 programme hoursper week in 1947 (against the British Broadcasting Corporation^ 623) to 1,013hours per week in 1951 (against the British Broadcasting Corporation^ 565). Wequote these figures not in order to suggest that British expenditure on propagandashould necessarily try to keep pace with what either the Russians or the americans are doing but merely to show that other great Powers evidently think it worthwhile to spend large sums on this activity. If it is true to say, as we believe, thatof all the great Powers none is so dependent, for reasons of security and trade,on maintaining friendly relations with other countries as is the United Kingdom,then logically this country should spend more, in relation to population and resources, than other countries in order to maintain efficient Information services overseas.VIII. Recommendations Concerning Organisation77. For anybody who approaches the Information Services from outside thefirst impression is likely to be one of bewilderment at the complexity of the organisa-tion and its lack of any central direction. One seeks in vain for any individual or Department in a position to lay down an overall policy for our propagandaoverseas or able to decide in what manner the resources available for propaganda* Expenditure by the State Department on information work in the fiscal year 1952, amountedto United States dollars 162,832,387. This sum includes United States dollars 7,316,000 spent onFulbright Scholarships. In addition the Mutual Security Agency spent United States dollars21,772,600 of public money on Overseas Information Work.
can be deployed to best advantage. In fact, there is nothing which constitutes a&quot; High Command&quot; for overseas propaganda. With the existing pattern of ministerial responsibility in which a number of Ministers have some responsibilityfor different aspects of the work, no such overall control over policy and its execu-tion is possible, except ultimately at Cabinet level. The existing system ofdecentralised control is based on the principle, which we believe is sound, that sincepropaganda is an instrument of policy, responsibility for it must be separatelyvested in the Ministers responsible respectively for Foreign, Commonwealth and colonial affairs, with the President of the Board of Trade holding a watching briefto ensure that the commercial interests of the country are adequately taken care of in our propaganda all over the world.78. This principle does not, of course, in itself justify the further divisionof the work between the Departmental Information Services and the british council, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Central Office of Informa-tion. But we are satisfied that there are other very cogent reasons for the separateexistence of these agencies. The British Council, we are sure, can do better work as a chartered body standing somewhat apart from the Government machine.And the high reputation for objectivity which the British Broadcasting Corporationnews has acquired abroad provides a powerful argument for maintaining theexisting status of the Corporation^ External Services. The need for the central office of Information is explained in paragraph 82 below.79. Short, then, of recreating the Ministry of Information (which we do not recommend) we can see no way of avoiding the existing division of the work and responsibilities between four Departments and three agencies. Since a singleexecutive control is unobtainable every effort must be made to obtain the maximum amount of co-ordination between the Departments as regards information policy,and the best use of our available resources must be secured.80. At the moment Departmental co-ordination is the responsibility of anOfficial Committee under a Foreign Office Chairman, on which all the departments and agencies are represented, supplemented by a wide range of day-to-day contactsat all levels maintained between the officials who have interests in common. It hasbeen suggested to us that the Official Committee would be more effective if it wereto be provided with a permanent secretariat for planning and research consistingof officers seconded from the Departments and agencies who would be housedand work together as a group. We believe, however, that such a secretariat would only duplicate what can be done by the interdepartmental panels which, we under-stand, it has been agreed should be established to study propaganda needs, area byarea, and draw up plans for the best use of resources. We therefore recommendno change in the existing structure of the Committee. We do, however, recommendthat it should meet at regular intervals, say once a month, in order to ensure con-tinuous and close co-ordination at a high level.81. Unfortunately the Official Committee and this is inherent in an organi-sation based on separate Ministerial responsibility has no means of reconciling theviews of the Departments and agencies if and when they do not agree. Such dis-agreements can only be decided by Ministers who have all too little time to devoteto them. This is a serious dilemma and we have wondered, therefore, if it wouldnot assist Ministers to have, in addition to the Official Committee, a permanentAdvisory Committee of independent persons whose task it would be to keep ageneral eye on the progress of the work and, when required, make recommendationsconcerning the allocation of resources as between the Departments and agencies.One of the main duties of such a Committee would be to keep all services under constant review so as to ensure that when any particular bit of work was no longer required it should be brought to an end. We suggest that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment might consider this possibility. Failing such a permanent Advisory committee we believe that some form of independent enquiry should be held at least everyfive years so as to ensure that the Overseas Information Services are workingsmoothly, and that whatever modifications are required to meet the ever-changingworld situation are in fact being made.82. Another difficult problem arises in connexion with the supply of publicitymaterial for the Overseas Departments. Theoretically, perhaps, each overseas department could maintain its own production unit, but we are convinced that onthe ground of efficiency as well as of economy the decision to establish the central office of Information as &quot; a common service &quot; agency was right. However, unlike
the two other information agencies the Central Office has no charter and it hasnot been easy to fit it into the Whitehall constellation partly because in a sense ithas been nobody&apos;s child. It certainly has not found a hearty welcome in Whitehalland any direct contact between it and the Overseas Information Officers in thefield has been discouraged. The result has been that many good men must havebeen deterred from joining the Central Office, and its existing staff have becomeimbued with a certain sense of frustration and unhappiness.83. As the Central Office of Information is recognised as being an essential part of the overseas information machinery every effort must obviously be madeto make it function better and more happily, but this can only happen if the presentrelationship between it and the Government Departments concerned is improved.This is an administrative question which is perhaps hardly within the scope of out enquiry. We nevertheless make the following suggestions for the consideration ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government:(i) The Central Office of Information should be allowed to have closer contact with the field. The division of responsibility should be that the Over-seas Departments should lay down the general policy for each countryand decide how much money should be spent on the various services;after that the Central Office of Information should be allowed, as far aspossible, a free hand to go ahead with the work.(ii) The Departments have each built up an organisation which supervisesrather closely the activities of the Central Office of Information: andin the case of the Foreign Office the amount of work involved in thishas led to the creation of an &quot; Information Services Department.&quot; ThisDepartment encroaches to some extent on what can fairly be consideredthe sphere of work of the Central Office of Information and discouragesany direct contact between the latter and Information Officers in thefield. Whatever good reason may have led to this development, the resulting position is unsound and prejudicial to good organisation.(iii) Senior staff of the Central Office of Information should be enabled to visit the field from time to time, and as far as possible interchanges ofstaff between the Central Office of Information and the information services of the Overseas Departments should be encouraged.(iv) In order to facilitate closer and more regular contacts premises should befound for the Central Office of Information in close proximity to theDepartments in Whitehall.(v) At present the Minister in charge of the Central Office is the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury. This is the logical arrangement for an organisation producing material for four different Departments of State,but we wonder whether in the special circumstances of the central office it might not be better if it was under the charge of one of the senior Ministers without portfolio.IX. Recommendations concerning Staffi84. Since Information Officers are in constant touch with people of other races and nations the quality of the staff engaged on information work is particularly important. It is necessary, therefore, to create the conditions in the information services which will attract and keep good men.85. We believe that the existing policy of the Foreign Office of using careerForeign Service officers for information work in posts overseas is sound in principle for this should be the best way of breaking down any prejudice which there mightbe against information work and of making the Foreign Service as a whole&quot; information minded.&quot; Moreover, it means that there is a constant flow of new-blood into the Information Service and that young and alert minds are engaged on work which above all requires initiative and imagination. On the other hand,specialised qualifications cannot be dispensed with. In order to make the best useof both types we recommend that at least 30 per cent, of the information posts in foreign countries available for United Kingdom staff should be kept open forspecialists and that means should be found to offer good prospects of promotion to those who prove themselves capable of higher responsibility.86. The problem arises, however, of how to recruit these specialists. Theyfall into two categories:  (a) local experts with special language qualifications for
areas like the Middle East, and (b) specialists in some branch of information work, i.e., journalists, films officers, &amp;c, for the larger Information Offices where such skills are required. We recommend that wherever possible the &quot; local&quot;expert should be &quot; locally &quot; established in the Foreign Service, which would give himsecurity and a pension; or failing that, if the appointment has to be temporary,that at least he should be offered a firm contract for a period of years. As fornon-local specialists we recommend that as far as possible these should be recruitedby means of secondment from the Central Office of Information.87. We recommend that the Commonwealth Relations Office should considerthe possibility of adopting a similar policy for the staffing of their information postsabroad, although in this case it may be that the percentage of &quot;career&quot; as against&quot; specialist&quot; posts might have to be different. It is too early, since the service has not yet been created, to recommend a policy for recruiting Information officers for United Kingdom Information Offices in the Colonies. Here, too, we believethat an information staff which includes both persons with experience of colonial administration and information specialists will be needed.88. The use of career men with no specialised knowledge of publicity forinformation work carries with it the need for a training scheme whereby membersof the Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonial Services on first appointment overseasas Information Officers should, before leaving London, spend a period of not lessthan three months learning the ropes. Each Department should be responsiblefor organising its own training scheme which we recommend should include a period in the Central Office of Information in order to study the various media, togetherwith courses of study in the Information Department of the Overseas department concerned and with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Similarly, facilities should exist for Central Office of Information staff to do short periods of trainingabroad. We recognise that all this might require some increase in the establish-ment of the Departments concerned, but we have no hesitation about recommendingit in the interests of improved morale and efficiency.89. The staffing problems of the British Broadcasting Corporation and theBritish. Council must be considered separately since these are not GovernmentDepartments and their staffs do not form part of the Civil Service. The british staff of the British Broadcasting Corporation normally become eligible for establish-ment after two years&apos; service, which gives them the right to contribute to the pension scheme and preference in the event of redundancy. There is no bar tomovement from the External to the Home Services. The Corporation also employin the External Services a large number of foreign nationals and British subjects of overseas origin who under the Charter cannot be established and are usuallyengaged on a three-year contract, with the possibility of an extension to five years.The only complaint which has been put to our Committee concerning the staffingof the British Broadcasting Corporation is that the successive cuts leading to areduction in staff have resulted in a general lowering of morale. This cause of discontent would be removed if the long-term programme for broadcasting whichwe have recommended were to be adopted.90. The British Council still lack a permanent service and they complain thatthe allowances paid to British Council Staff are inadequate in the commonwealth and the Colonies. Our recommendations on these subjects are to be found in annex 2.X. Recommendations Concerning Financial Administration91. Although the organisation of the Overseas Information Services is basedon the principle of separate Ministerial responsibility it has been the practice since1948 to regard those Services as a single unit for the purposes of finance. A&quot; ceiling &quot; for overseas information work as a whole was established each year andthe four Departments and three agencies were then left to work out among them-selves how best to divide the money between them. This system was unsatisfactorybecause, although complementary in some respects, Departmental interests are alsoin many other respects divergent and even competitive. It is in any case difficult for one Department of State to judge objectively the relative importance of an activity conducted by another. And it is manifestly quite illogical to maintain that because, shall we say, it has become urgently necessary to establish a number ofnew United Kingdom Information Offices in the Colonies these can be sanctioned
only if some other Department is prepared to make an equivalent sacrifice to beobtained by, say, closing down Information Offices in Europe, Latin America or inthe Commonwealth. Clearly the need for increased information work in theColonies bears no relationship at all to what may be required by some otherDepartment elsewhere in the world. Each need is different and should be judgedon its own merits.92. We understand that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to abolishthis &quot; common ceiling &quot; for the Overseas Information Services. We are sure thatthis is sound policy, and we agree with the view expressed by the Official Com-mittee (referred to in paragraph 11 above) that each Department conducting,overseas information work should be allowed to prepare its estimates on the basis;of its own requirements, making its own assessment of the amount of funds to be devoted to information work within the total funds available to it. In other words,a Department^ estimates for information work should be scrutinised by theTreasury in precisely the same way as any other proposed part of its expenditure.There is, however, an obvious advantage in the existing practice of presenting eachyear, in the form of a White Paper, a picture of the expenditure of the overseas information Services as a whole so that it can easily be seen in what directions our propaganda overseas is being directed. But there is a fundamental differencebetween a distribution of expenditure which represents the sum of individualDepartmental needs and one which is derived by fixing an arbitrary financial ceilingand then leaving the Departments to divide among themselves as best they canwhatever money has been made available.93. It is also, we are sure, unsound in principle and we understand that this situation also is being remedied by Her Majesty&apos;s Government that departments or agencies should be expected to finance capital expenditure at the expense of current operational needs. In particular, we understand that the British Broad-casting Corporation, which must devote considerable sums to capital development in order to keep its equipment up-to-date, has suffered in the past from a system inwhich no distinction was made between capital and current expenditure. Theresult has been that major capital developments could be financed only by curtail-ing operations or, if a certain level of operations had to be maintained, then capital development had to go by the board. We are glad to learn that in future the Treasury have agreed that capital and revenue expenditure shall be budgetedand accounted for separately by the British Broadcasting Corporation.^ 94. It is not for us to enter into a discussion of the methods employed by theTreasury to control the expenditure of the Overseas Information Services since these are presumably the same as those applied to all Government departments and practically all bodies financed by grant-in-aid. We would mention only one point in connexion with films which a number of the Departments brought to our attention when giving evidence. They complained of the inconvenience and delaycaused by the need to obtain separate Treasury authorisation for each film pro-duced, although a total amount to cover the production of films during the yearhad already been authorised. The Treasury have explained to us that the need to seek separate authority for each film does not arise because films have been specially picked out by the Treasury as requiring closer supervision than any other information activity. It is simply the result of the fact that a documentary film,to-day invariably costs more than the total sum ( 3,000) which the Central Officeof Information have discretion to spend on a non-recurring item without obtainingTreasury sanction. To avoid the delays involved in having to submit each film forTreasury approval and we can see little object in doing so once the films budgethas been approved since the subject-matter of a film is surely a question of informa-tion policy we suggest that the Central Office of Information, having onceobtained Treasury approval for a total amount to be spent on films during the year,should be given discretion to spend up to, say,  6,000 on any individual film with-out the need for further Treasury sanction.95. Finally, while on this subject, we must repeat once more our conviction that the fundamental cure for the financial difficulties which the Overseas Informa-tion Services have experienced since the war resides in having a long-term plan and then sticking to it. The main trouble in the past has been that what is essentially a long-term operation and this applies in varying degrees to all types of information work has been financed by short-term methods. Havoc has been caused by the series of annual cuts imposed at short notice.  These have led to a
number of short-sighted economies and a great deal of money has been wasted bystarting new activities and then abandoning them before there was time to reap adividend.96. It is in no spirit of subscribing to a convention that we end our report byrecording our warm appreciation of the work of our Secretary, Mr. R. H. K. Marett.Throughout our long enquiry he has displayed great industry, initiative and ability,and we are most grateful to the Foreign Office for lending us his services.(Signed) DROGHEDA.J. L.

THE DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION SERVICES AND THE central office OF information. IntroductoryAlthough they each have separate responsibilities and work in different spheresit is convenient to consider in one paper the work of the Information departments of the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office,together with that of the Board of Trade and the Central Office of Information,since all these Departments are engaged in different aspects of what is essentially similar activity. Indeed, during the war, the work now being done by thesedifferent Departments was conducted by a single Ministry. Their separate existencedates only from 1946 when His Majesty&apos;s Government abolished the war-timeMinistry of Information. As a result of this decision the three Overseas Ministerseach assumed responsibility for and control over information work in foreigncountries, the Commonwealth and the Colonies respectively, with the President ofthe Board of Trade holding a watching brief to ensure that the commercial interestsof the country were adequately taken care of in our publicity all over the world.As a matter of administrative convenience and for the sake of economy the &quot; pro-duction &quot; divisions of the Ministry of Information, instead of being divided upamong the Departments, were transferred to a new &quot; common service &quot; agency, theCentral Office of Information, which became responsible for supplying each of the overseas Departments with the material and services which they required.2. In this paper, then, when we refer to &quot; information work&quot; or &quot; theInformation Services &quot; we employ these terms in the more narrow sense to describe the activities in this field of the Overseas Departments themselves and not in the broader sense so as to include the cultural and educational work of the british council and the External Services of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Theactivities of these latter agencies are dealt with separately in Annexes 2 and 3.II.-The Work of an Information Office Overseas3. The ultimate purpose of the Information Services of the three overseas departments is to assist in advancing the political and commercial interest of theUnited Kingdom overseas. They are needed because Her Majesty&apos;s representativesoverseas have had to concern themselves more and more with the state of publicopinion in the countries for which they are responsible. An Information Office,therefore, now forms an integral part of most of our Missions overseas.4. But if the aim of the Overseas Information Services is to assist her majesty&apos;s Government in the prosecution of Foreign, Commonwealth and colonial policy in the broadest sense they cannot merely confine their subject-matter to specific questions of policy. A large part of the daily task of an InformationOfficer overseas consists in conducting &quot; background &quot; publicity designed to buildup a feeling of respect for this country and understanding for its problems. only if this background has been provided will a favourable climate of opinion exist for publicity on particular themes. From this it follows that information work willbe most successful if it is conducted continuously over a period of time. To buildup the necessary background of respect and understanding for this country is essentially a cumulative process which should not be interrupted.5. The work of an Information Office overseas thus divides itself, broadly speaking, into two distinct types of activity: long-term publicity, the subject-matterof which covers virtually all aspects of the national life (except certain culturalsubjects which are reserved for the British Council) and day-to-day publicitydesigned to explain some particular policy or to advance some particular interestof Her Majesty&apos;s Government. These interests may be either political or com-mercial. On the political side it is necessary therefore for the Information officer to work in close contact with the Political Department of the Mission with a viewto arranging any publicity which may be necessary in order to explain policy andat the same time to keep the Mission informed of trends, of public opinion. Indeed,an Information Officer, by. virtue of the wide range of his contacts, is in a positionto be a very useful source of political intelligence. On the commercial side it isthe duty of the Information Officer to work in the closest co-operation with the
Commercial Secretariat not only for the purpose of explaining the economic policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government but also in order to assist in promoting british exports.6. Yet another task which has devolved on the Information Officer, as theresult of the Cold War, is that of conducting anti-Communist propaganda. this may be either positive or negative. Not only is it necessary to imoress uponcountries which sit on the fence in the Cold War or whose attitude is unreliablethe danger of their position by explaining to them the true nature of Communism;but it is also necessary and this is often the best way of fighting Communism to show them positively that there is something in the world better than Com-communism by publicising the virtues of democratic institutions and ways. The,negative type of anti-Communist propaganda requires to be conducted with theutmost discretion and its success will depend very largely upon the degree to whichthe Information Officer has gained the confidence of&quot; the leaders of opinion inthe country in which he works. Indeed, without well-established InformationOffices overseas it would not be possible to do this work at all.7. We were very much struck during our visits abroad by the way in whichall the Heads of Mission with whom we talked took their Information departments for granted. Indeed we got the impression that a modern Embassy or high commission which lacked such a Department would be badly handicapped since it needs to possess the means of extending its contacts beyond the narrow confinesof Governmental and diplomatic circles so as to include a cross-section of people in a position to mould public opinion. If this is accepted as being an essential part of modern diplomacy it follows that it has become almost academic to discusswhether an Embassy or High Commission should have an Information department or not just as it is never seriously questioned whether it should have a CommercialSecretariat. The problem is rather to find some yardstick for deciding on whatscale and by what methods the work of the Information Departments should be conducted.8. In the Colonies the position is somewhat different, but the same general considerations apply. A Colonial Government likewise requires an InformationDepartment to deal with public opinion in the territory for which it is responsible.But there is an important distinction between the work of a Colonial government information Department and that of an Embassy or High Commission. Theformer is a part of the machinery of administration and it has to have directaccess to the people. In the Federation of Malaya we were able to observe whatis involved if a serious attempt is made to conduct propaganda which will getdown to the level of the village community. We need mention as an example onlyone activity, namely, films. Not only does the Federation maintain its own filmunit for producing simple instructional films which will be understood by a ruralaudience; but it also maintains a fleet of nearly 100 film vans. Clearly propagandaon such a scale in a foreign or Commonwealth country would be tantamount to an invasion of sovereignty and would be strongly resented. It follows that muchmore modest and discreet methods of propaganda have to be employed in such countries.9. The work of Colonial Government Information Departments is not the concern of our Committee except in so far as they provide a channel for UnitedKingdom information material provided by the Colonial Office. This question,together with the need to establish United Kingdom Information Offices in someof the Colonies, is dealt with in a later section of this Annex. We have only quotedthe example of Malaya in order to underline the difference between propagandaaimed at the many and the type of propaganda which can appropriately be con-ducted by our Information Offices in foreign or Commonwealth countries. Inthese, since mass propaganda is out of the question, the approach must be to the few to journalists, broadcasters, film distributors, trades unionists, politicians,Government officials, leading business men, in short all who are in a position to influence policy or mould public opinion. In other words, propaganda, if it isto be effective, must be injected as discreetly as possible into the local bloodstream.For this reason there is a fairly definite upper limit to the size of the organisation which will be required for information work, depending on local circumstances and the nature of the channels which are available.  There is also, of course, a
minimum size below which the organisation cannot be cut if the available channelsfor propaganda are to be used to best advantage. This point can best be illustrated by examining what these channels are and how they can be put to best use.The Press10. In most countries the press provides the most effective means of reaching the educated public. A primary objective of the Information Services must betherefore to find ways and means of getting British material into the Foreign,Commonwealth and Colonial press or better still of ensuring that anyone overseaswriting in the press about Britain or about things in which Britain is importantlyconcerned should do so on a basis of fact and understanding.11. Foreign and Commonwealth newspapers obtain most of their materialabout this country either through the press agencies and commercial featureservices or through their own correspondents in London. It follows therefore that the first need is for the Information Departments in London to ensure that foreign correspondents are well looked after and provided with facilities for obtaining news and the background to the news. A further requisite is that thepolicy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be clearly stated by Ministers in a way which will appeal to the public not only in Britain but the whole world. In this connexion we would call attention to the following suggestion which was urgedupon us by the Chairman of the Foreign Press Association. He said that in hisopinion it would have very good results if, when some outstanding event affectingour position occurred, or when Her Majesty&apos;s Government decided to adopt anew policy in regard to some matter of world-wide importance (e.g., Mau-Mauterrorism), the Minister concerned were to give a press conference to explain theattitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. There were, he said, three points to beremembered in this connexion; first, if something of. the sort was not done adistorted version of the facts was probably cabled to the outside world; secondly,no spokesmen however able could replace the responsible Minister at such a press conference; and, thirdly, foreign countries were far more likely to believe in the truth of reports sent by the correspondents of their own press than the same storygiven out by the British Information Services.12. Another very good way to secure a good press for this country overseasis to invite parties of Foreign, Commonwealth or Colonial journalists to pay shortvisits to the United Kingdom. The Foreign Office and the Colonial Office (butnot at the moment the Commonwealth Relations Office) have provision within their budgets which enables them to pay for the passages of such visiting journalistsand other influential persons, including trades unionists, whose opinion about thiscountry is likely to carry weight in their own country. Suitable tours for theseparties are arranged by the Central Office of Information. These include visits to Parliament, Government Departments, industrial centres, defence installations and so on and are designed, depending upon the interests of the visitors, to giveas broad a picture as possible of the life of this country. The facilities and toursprovided by the Central Office of Information can also be made available at therequest of the Overseas Departments for individual foreign journalists who mayvisit this country on their own initiative and to the foreign correspondents resident in London.13. It would be a mistake, however, to think that what can be done in theUnited Kingdom to look after the needs of the Foreign, Commonwealth and colonial press is all that is needed. Many newspapers overseas and this appliesespecially to Colonial newspapers have no resident correspondent in London.By no means all foreign correspondents in this country are friendly and somemay write for newspapers which are unfriendly. Others are not competent toreport intelligently on the wide range of subjects, including highly technicaleconomic matters, which make up the news emanating from London. Moreover,in many cases, the foreign correspondent is only expected to report the facts;the interpretation of these facts is the daily task of innumerable editorial writers,columnists and commentators scattered all over the world. For these reasons ithas been found necessary to maintain Information Officers overseas who can keep in close personal touch with the leading figures in the press and radio and indeed with all persons of influence who may be interested in British affairs andare likely either to write or speak in public about them.
14. In order to perform this task, however, an Information Officer overseasmust be able to answer quickly and accurately the many questions which will inevitably be put to him on all manner of subjects relating to the United Kingdom.Hence a basic requirement of any Information Office overseas is a good referenceservice. In small, remote countries where there is not much spontaneous interestin British affairs the reference library can be kept to quite small dimensions. Ina busy centre like New York a very large library requires to be maintained,equipped to deal with all manner of enquiries which flow in at the rate of 4,000to 5,000 a month. In many countries it is convenient to house the referencelibrary in a reading room which is available not only for journalists but also for members of the general public.15. The answering of enquiries is, however, only the passive side of the work.To follow up and make use of his contacts with the press the Information officers should be able to provide a regular service of material which will both assist theMission in explaining its policies and the background to these policies and at thesame time be useful to the recipients in other words, the service must providethe press with something which is not readily obtainable from any other source.This is what the wireless transmissions of the London Press Service of the central office of Information set out to do. They do not attempt to duplicate the newsservice which is.obtainable from the agencies. But they do provide comment onthe news, i.e., selected editorials from British newspapers, a diplomatic commentarybased largely on the line which has been taken by the Foreign Office NewsDepartment in London and other material which evidently fills a real gap since these services are widely used by foreign and Commonwealth newspapers. In many countries there is a good demand also for illustrated feature articles. The precisenature of the services which should be provided in any country will depend, ofcourse, upon local conditions. In countries with a free and highly developed press the best results are usually obtained by maintaining personal contact with editors,and having a good reference service and a small, highly select flow of material.In countries where the press is poor there is often a large demand for a wide range of services consisting of ready-made commentaries and articles. It is, however,dangerous to generalise about this and in fact a surprising amount of finishedmaterial supplied by our Information Offices is used, by newspapers in quitesophisticated countries where one would have expected the commercial agenciesto provide all that was needed. In many countries too, the local technical pressis very glad to get British material. Such periodicals provide an excellentopportunity for publicity about British achievements in science and industry.16. The size and scope of the press section of an Information Office overseaswill vary very greatly in accordance with local circumstances. The basic require-ment is that there should be a sufficient number of senior Information officers to keep in touch with editors and other leaders of opinion all over the country.It is vitally important that Information Officers should not be chained to theirdesks; they must be able to get out and about. The second requirement is thatthere should be adequate services, which may have to be extensive or highlyselective as the case may be. The size of the staff required to maintain these services will depend to a considerable extent on the amount of sub-editing whichhas to be done locally and on the number of languages into which the materialhas to be translated. Thus in India it is necessary to maintain a relatively largepress section in the Head Office in Delhi because there are six languages to becatered for. In the Middle East where there is only one language, the InformationOffice in each country can be kept to much smaller dimensions by means of having a centre in Beirut with a staff of translators which supplies material in Arabic tothe whole region.The Radio17. What we have said above about the press applies, generally speaking,also to radio. The correspondents of Foreign and Commonwealth broadcastingsystems in London must be properly looked after and it is likewise necessary forthe Information Officer overseas to keep in touch with the programme managers of local radio stations, local radio commentators, &amp;c. In countries where theBritish Broadcasting Corporation do not maintain their own office it is also theduty of the Information Officer to act as an agent for the British broadcasting corporation and arrange for local radio stations to relay British broadcasting corporation programmes and use British Broadcasting Corporation transcriptions.
Booklets, mimeographed bulletins, &amp;c.18. Many Information Offices, besides feeding the press and radio withmaterial, maintain mailing lists of leading Government officials, trades union officials, business men and so on to whom suitable printed material or locally pro-duced mimeographed bulletins are distributed. Such material is only suppliedon request and the mailing lists are carefully pruned to include only importantpeople in whatever field it is desired to cover. The large-scale free distribution of popular pamphlets has been discontinued since the war as being too expensive.Illustrated magazines19. The production and distribution by Her Majesty&apos;s Government ofillustrated magazines in Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonial countries represents a departure from the principle that an Information Office should not attempt toreach the public by direct means. Normally the Information Office should work through the existing organs of the press and not have to create them. We aresatisfied, however, that there are special reasons which justify the production andcirculation by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of the illustrated Arabic magazine.El &apos;Alam in the Middle East and the two magazines which are distributed in theCommonwealth and the Colonies respectively. The former is needed becausewithout it the news stands in the Middle East would be monopolised by trashy,sensational, anti-British Egyptian magazines and it is therefore necessary to have our own organ which can compete in this field. Commonwealth To-day is designed for the special purpose of creating a feeling of solidarity among thecountries of the Commonwealth and contains material and covers ground which is outside the scope of any existing commercial magazine. And in the same wayTo-day in the Colonies provides something of value which would be unobtainablethrough commercial channels.Films20. Unlike the basic reference and press services which deal for the most part with current affairs and therefore constitute the minimum requirement of anyproperly equipped Information Office, documentary films are essentially a long-term medium of propaganda, being useful mainly either for general prestige pur-poses (for instance in publicising the Comet) or for depicting in a more graphicmanner than can be done by other means the more fundamental aspects of Britishlife (for instance the workings of the British Parliamentary system, the Law Courts,Trades Unions, &amp;c). The latter type of film is of particular value in an under-developed country. Films can be used overseas in various ways:  (i) in the theatres.  To obtain theatrical distribution it is necessary to per-persuade a commercial distributor to take over the films. This is not always easy in many parts of the world;(ii) for private showings to invited audiences.   This is an excellent way ofshowing films since it provides the opportunity to bring togetherselected groups of persons and provide them with something which willbe both entertaining and instructive;(iii) the loan or sale of prints to organisations and societies.  This is the best way of all of obtaining a wide distribution of documentary films andgetting them into the circles where they will have the most effect.What can be done in this field will depend, however, on the extent towhich projectors are available and the commercial distribution ofdocumentary films for non-theatrical use has been developed. In theUnited States of America this type of commercial distribution has beenvery highly developed and British Information Services are able to earn a considerable revenue by selling or loaning prints. Similar opportunities -ties exist in many European countries. But in under-developed countries it may be necessary to provide clubs, organisations and schools not only with the films, but also with a projector and a project-tionist. This can be done by having mobile film units which cover thecountry on regular circuits and provide programmes on request;(iv) village showings given by means of travelling film vans.  We are very doubtful about the desirability of this form of film distribution. Tosend a film out into the blue with a native projectionist and show it inthe open air to a large audience of illiterate peasants seems to us to besquandering the very limited resources available for information work
in an attempt at mass propaganda which cannot be effective unless. conducted on a much greater scale than we are likely to be able to affordand with a different type of film from what we can provide. It seemsmore appropriate to leave it to the Government of the country concerned to engage in this activity. However, we recognise that there may bespecial circumstances especially in the Colonies, when this method of distribution will be justified.Television21. In countries where it has been developed, television has provided a new and important outlet for our documentary films of which good use is being madeby British Information Services in the United States of America. The market isevidently one which will expand very rapidly and more and more in producing filmsfor the use of the Information Services the requirements of television will have tobe borne in mind.Visual Material22. Information Offices are provided with a certain amount of visual material in the form of picture sets, posters, wall charts, &amp;c, which are displayed in the offices and reading rooms and are distributed to schools, colleges, clubs, institutions, &amp;c.Visual material is particularly popular in the Commonwealth and in the Colonies.Speakers23. The Information Services sponsor the visits overseas of a limited numberof British speakers on political, social and economic subjects. Wherever possiblethe inviting organisations are made to contribute towards the cost. In some countries, for instance, the United States of America, substantial fees are earnedby speakers which go a long way towards covering their travelling expenses.in. Basic Requirements24. The above description of the work of an Information Office overseas has,we believe, brought to light certain basic requirements for efficient information work which we do not believe are being fulfilled at the present time as well as theyshould be.   The following are our conclusions on this subject:  (i) Overseas information work begins at home. The first requirement is thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy should be clearly stated by ministers at the time and in the form required to impress pub he opinion overseas.This means that the points of view of the Heads of Information Depart-ments in London should be taken into account at the time when policyis being formulated and thus ensure that the requirements of overseaspropaganda will not be overlooked. We are by no means satisfied thatthis always happens at present.(ii) Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonial correspondents in London shouldbe given all possible facilities to obtain news and the background thereto.An examination of the arrangements for looking after the corres-coorespondents in London did not fall within our terms of reference and wecan therefore do no more than point to the important bearing whichthese have on information work overseas.(iii) Visits to the United Kingdom by journalists and other leaders of opinionfrom abroad are of the greatest value. The Commonwealth relations office lacks a budget for this purpose. We have the impression alsothat more could usefully be done in the way of arranging tours forresident correspondents.(iv) An Information Office is required as an essential part of any british mission overseas unless the country is so unimportant that our political or commercial interests in it are negligible. During the recent cuts anumber of Information Offices were eliminated in Europe which webelieve shovfid be restored both for political and commercial reasons.(v) The primary task of an Information Officer is to get out and about andcultivate editors, columnists, radio commentators and other leadersof. opinion. We have found that too many Information Officers arenow chained to their desks for lack of sufficient junior staff to do
the administrative side of the work. Moreover, in many countries there are not enough senior Information Officers to cover the countryadequately.(vi) A good reference service is essential to an Information Office.   This webelieve is already provided by the Central Office of Information.(vii) The London Press Service, sent out from London by wireless and airmail,forms the essential basis of the day-to-day output of our InformationOffices overseas. We have come to the view, which we believe is shared by the Departments, that this stands in need of a thorough overhaul,both technical and editorial, to make it more efficient.(viii) There must be sufficient staff in the field for local editing and, where necessary, the translation of the London press service into a formsuitable for local consumption. The size of this staff will vary inaccordance with local needs. The aim should always be a service ofthe highest quality rather than mere volume of output. We have theimpression that at the moment too much rather second-rate material is coming out from London and there is insufficient staff in the field for local editing.(ix) It is possible to maintain an Information Office which does no more thandeal with the press. An. efficient press section represents therefore theminimum requirement of any Information Office. On the other hand,we attach the greatest importance to documentary films for the purposeof general prestige publicity and in order to illustrate the more funda-mental aspects of our institutions and way of life. We believe thatfilms of the last type are particularly important in under-developed countries. Films of the former type, together with those suitable forspecialist audiences, are in very good demand in the United States ofAmerica, the Commonwealth and in Europe and if they are steered intocommercial channels they can be given a very wide distribution and atthe same time bring in quite a substantial revenue. During the recentcuts films suffered more than any other activity and we believe that their position should be restored. To maintain an organisation for the distri-bution of films two conditions are necessary: first a regular flow of filmsof high quality; secondly, films officers in the principal Missions whoknow the films business and are able to take advantage of the com-mercial possibilities which exist both for theatrical and non-theatricaldistribution. We believe that documentary films will become of growing importance as television develops, and that now is the time toestablish a footing in this new field.25. With these general considerations in mind we are now in a position toconsider separately the requirements of each Department.IV.-The Foreign Office26. Our recommendations for the Foreign Office Information Service are based on estimates of requirements submitted to us by the Information Departmentof the Foreign Office at our request in May 1953. A summary of these proposal is to be found in Appendix A of this Annex. They envisage an assured expansionof the Information Service spread over a period of three years. These proposals will clearly require to be scrutinised in more detail than it has been possible forus to do.   But, in principle, we support them on the following grounds:  South-East Asia and Japan27. This is one of the crucial areas in the Cold War. It is also very importantcommercially. The first requirement is that the Regional Office in Singapore, whichprepares material in a form and in the languages familiar to the region, should be strong and efficient. We therefore support the proposals of the Foreign Office tostrengthen it and to improve the arrangements for receiving the London pressservice. The second requirement is that the Information Offices in each country should be adequately staffed and equipped to do the very important work which isrequired from them. We are satisfied that this is not the case at present. they need to be strengthened so as to allow the senior staff to get away from theirdesks and to provide for replacements when officers are away on leave or because
of sickness; also it is important that there should be a sufficient number of filmsofficers and the equipment required for the widest possible distribution of docu-mentary films which in these under-developed countries provide perhaps the most effective means of publicity or a long-term nature. For these reasons we have no hesitation in supporting the various proposals of the Foreign Office for strengthen-ing the Information Offices in this region as well as that for the establishment of anInformation Office in Mandalay.The Middle East28. Owing to the tense political situation this is now a very difficult area forinformation work. But it has to be done. Personal contacts are of the utmost importance in the Middle East and it is often possible to establish a quite cordialpersonal relationship even with the political enemy. Rather than maintain a largeorganisation in each country, what is required more than anything are information officers of the highest calibre who possess local knowledge and experience. Wetherefore support the proposal of the Foreign Office to raise the grading of theinformation posts in Beirut, Damascus and Amman.29. The whole of the Middle East is served by material in Arabic prepared in a regional office in Beirut. We were well impressed by the work being doneby this office in adapting the material received from London (including anti-Communist material) into a form suitable for local consumption. We feel sure that it is sound policy to strengthen this office in order to improve the quality and quantity of the output in Arabic and in this way avoid the necessity of maintainingconsiderable staffs of local editors and translators in each post.30. Finally, we agree with the view of the Foreign Office that it is important that steps should be taken to support British policy and prestige in the persian gulf since this has become a key oil-producing area. We therefore support theproposal of the Foreign Office to establish an Information Office in Bahrain. we also believe than an Information Officer in Jedda would be useful since SaudiArabia is an important oil producing area and literacy is increasing very rapidly in the towns.The United States of America31. We were very favourably impressed by the British Information services in the United States of America which are a model (although of course on a larger scale than is needed in most countries) of what can be done in the informationfield in a highly developed country. The Headquarters office in Washington andthe operational centre in New York struck us as being on the whole adequatelystaffed and equipped, but we agree with the Foreign Office that an additionalofficer in New York to handle television is needed since this is becoming suchan important outlet for our films. The only other requirement in the UnitedStates of America is to strengthen the organisation outside Washington and new york in order that there should be an adequate coverage in this vast country,32. The Foreign Office maintain that it is desirable to re-open the educational office in Washington, which was abolished for reasons of economy in1952, the cost having previously been shared with the Ministry of Education. Inview of the fact that the British Council does not operate in the United States ofAmerica, and because of the volume of educational enquiries which descend uponthe Embassy in any case and have to be dealt with, it seems to us that this requestis justified.Latin America33. This area is of great importance to the United Kingdom commercially.Yet in no part of the world have the Information Services been cut so drastically.The position is all the more serious because owing to special circumstances no british news agency can operate effectively in the area and the British broadcasting corporation Latin American Service, which enjoyed a high reputation, has been severely cut.34. The Foreign Office now maintains Information Offices in only sevenLatin American cities (Mexico City, Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, buenos aires, Montevideo and Santiago), two of which, namely Mexico City and Caracas,act as regional centres, the former for the Caribbean and Central America, the
latter for Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In most, of the. smaller countries thereare, however, small information sections consisting of one or two locally recruitedstaff working under the supervision of the Chancery. Given adequate services fromthe regional offices we believe that this arrangement is sufficient in countries wherethe press is small and of low standard. Those Information Offices which we visited(Mexico City, Caracas, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo) struck us as being seriouslyundermanned. It was the old story of the Information Officers being too tied totheir desks and unable to move about enough to maintain adequate contact withthe press, let alone the radio stations, throughout their areas, which are large. more frequent contact with the press would enable them to. give each newspaper moreindividual treatment thus getting away from the general &quot; hand-out.&quot; Filmshave been given up almost entirely by the Information Service and such work asis done in this field is now left to the British Council. We do not think that this isat all a satisfactory position. Films and radio are both.very effective media inthese countries-perhaps more effective than the press.35. We recommend therefore that there should be a considerablestrengthening of the Information Offices in Latin America along the lines proposedby the Foreign Office to enable them to:  &apos;(i) improve their coverage of the press;(ii) act as agents for the British Broadcasting Corporation for arranging relaysof British Broadcasting Corporation programmes and transcriptions;(We are also recommending that the British Broadcasting CorporationLatin American short-wave and transcription services should be restored);(iii) re-establish the distribution of British documentary films.. 36. Finally, we would stress the tremendous value in Latin America of specialactivities such as the visit of Royal Air Force Canberras and the visits of her majesty&apos;s ships to South American ports. Such events can be anticipated in timefor good advance publicity to be done by our Information Officers and are worthmuch more than reams of routine press bulletins as a means of maintaining purprestige in this part of the world.Europe37. We believe that the Foreign Office should maintain an efficientInformation Service in Europe for the following purposes:  (i) to explain the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government which are oftenmisunderstood or misinterpreted on the European Continent;(ii) to assist in maintaining close and friendly relations with our allies in thevarious European and other international organisations with which weare associated;(iii) to do discreet anti-Communist propaganda in countries where the localCommunist party is strong;(iv) to promote our trade.For all these purposes we believe that the Foreign Office Information Service islikely to be more effective than either the British. Broadcasting Corporation or theBritish Council.38. The organisation of the Foreign Office Information Service in Europe cameoff very badly in the recent cuts. In France the entire provincial organisation wasscrapped and only a small office left in Paris. The Information Offices in Oslo;Copenhagen, Stockholm and Lisbon were closed down altogether. The distribu-tion of films was greatly curtailed. We therefore support the proposals of theForeign Office which are designed mainly to restore the position to what it was, viz.:  (i) to re-open Information Offices in Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm andLisbon;(ii) to build up the organisation in France, both in Paris and the provinces;(iii) to renew the distribution of films, for which purpose Films Officers are needed in Rome and Madrid.39. Yugoslavia, as the result of her break with Russia and realignment withthe West, offers a tremendous opportunity for information work. During purvisit we were able to observe that the existing reading rooms were crammed with
eager citizens. We recommend therefore a considerable expansion of activities;inthis country along the lines proposed by the Foreign Office. Germany also is a country where a large-scale information effort is likely to be required for some timeto come.  This question is discussed in Annex 4.Requirements for additional services .....40. To support the expanded field organisation which we have recommended the Foreign Office require above all:  (i) an improvement in the London Press Service both as regards its content and its methods of transmission (reception is poor in many parts of theworld);(ii) a greatly increased supply of films (without this our films distribution willvirtually come to a stop in many countries, including the UnitedStates of America);(iii) some increase in the supply of reference material and photographs since these services have been cut below what is needed for optimuminformation work;.    (iv) provision to increase the circulation of the Arabic magazine El &apos;Alam from60,000 copies at present to 100,000 copies.41. The Foreign Office are also interested in making special arrangements to facilitate the export of British books to Yugoslavia, Indonesia and Israel,. AHthese needs are discussed in more detail later on in this Annex in the section devotedto the Central Office of Information.1 42. Although an examination of the Public Relations Departments of theServices Departments did not fall within our terms of reference we should say thatthe Foreign Office, when giving evidence, stressed the importance of there being an adequate flow of information material for overseas use on defence. Photo-graphs on defence topics are needed in particular. The Foreign Office say thatthe Public Relations staffs of the Service Departments are now inadequate to supplywhat is required for a proper treatment overseas of this important subject.V,-The Commonwealth Relations Office43. We attach, the greatest importance to there being an efficient - UnitedKingdom Information Service in the Commonwealth in order to help to strengthenall those links which now maintain the free association of the diverse nations ofthe Commonwealth. We are not satisfied that this problem has received enoughattention; and we recommend that a new and vigorous impulse should be given to building up the Information Service of the Commonwealth Relations Office toproper strength in order to fulfil what we consider to be a very urgent and important task.  Our recommendations are as follows:  The Head Office in London44. Compared with the headquarters of the Foreign Office InformationService which consists of four Departments under an Assistant Under-Secretaryof State, the Commonwealth Relations Office only maintain a small InformationDepartment consisting of 8 officials under an Assistant Secretary. This Depart-ment not only has.to look after the correspondents of Commonwealth newspapersin London and provide the British and foreign press with guidance concerningCommonwealth affairs (a task which in respect of Foreign policy is done by aseparate Department in the Foreign Office); but it is also responsible for super-vising the work of the Commonwealth Relations Office Information Service in thefield. We believe that this Department requires some strengthening in staff andall the support that can be given to it at a high level in the Commonwealth relations office in order to link it in closely with the higher direction of policy.India45.   We were on the whole very favourably impressed by the InformationOffice in Delhi which has come out fairly well from the recent cuts and seemed tobe working along the right lines,  But the organisation struck us as being much too weak in the rest of India. There are at present three regional offices in Bombay,45030 f 2
Calcutta and Madras each under a Senior Information Officer supported only bylocal and mainly native staff. We inspected the office in Calcutta and found it tobe completely unequipped to cover the vast region, covering a number of importanttowns, of which that city forms the centre, although the Information Office was doing very good work in Calcutta itself. We believe that these one-manInformation Offices are unsound in principle since it is impossible for one man to run an office and cover a huge region at the same time. Also there is no provisionfor absences due to leave or sickness this last an important consideration in atropical climate. We recommend therefore that at a very minimum one additionalUnited Kingdom based Information Officer should be appointed to each of thethree offices in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. The office in Delhi, which provides the local press with material in six languages for use throughout India and feedsthe regional offices, also needs an additional United Kingdom based officer to actas the regional officer for the large district of which it is the centre.Pakistan46. Exactly the same situation exists in Pakistan. We were well impressed with the Head Office in Karachi; but additional United Kingdom based Informa-tion Officers are required in Lahore and Dacca to strengthen the one-man offices in those cities.Ceylon47. The office in Colombo presents a similar picture. The Senior InformationOfficer there had evidently built up very friendly relations with the press; but hewas just going off on home leave at the time of our visit and the office was to beleft in charge of a lady librarian. Here again an additional United Kingdombased Information Officer is required.Canada48. The organisation in Canada struck us as being wholly inadequate. here is a vast country stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with a French- and english-speaking population and a press which gets most of its material from united States sources. Despite all this only a small Information Office (consistingof 2 United Kingdom based officers and about 20 local staff) is maintained in Ottawa (a purely political capital) and the senior staff only get about the country at infrequent intervals. From the point of view of information work Ottawa isa backwater except on the political side. Only two small circulation newspapers&apos;are published there. The newspapers with large circulations are in Montreal,Toronto, Winnipeg, other Prairie cities and Vancouver on the West Coast. Themagazine publishing centre is in Toronto. We were struck by the good work being done by the films section which has developed many outlets for ourdocumentary films and earns a considerable revenue therefrom. Good work isalso being done with the press in French-speaking Canada. But in the rest ofCanada we feel that the press service, which is based on London Press Servicereceived by air-mail, is far too slow and, since the staff have not had the opportunityto get about the country enough to study the individual needs of the newspapers, ofa too generalised nature to be effective.49. In order to remedy these deficiencies we recommend that in addition tothe office in Ottawa, regional offices should be established in Montreal (for thework in French-speaking Canada); Toronto (the great industrial area and publishing centre) and in Vancouver. A feature of these regional offices should bea reference library run on the same lines (although on a smaller scale) as that ofBritish Information Services in New York. These libraries should begin on a small scale and be built up gradually over the years.Australia and New Zealand50. At the moment the Information Service in Australia consists of threeoffices in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney each with only one United Kingdombased officer. We recommend that these offices should be strengthened by theaddition of a second United Kingdom based officer in each office. The sameapplies to the one-man Information Office in Wellington, New Zealand, whichshould likewise be strengthened by an additional United Kingdom based officer.
South Africa51. An Information Office is maintained in Johannesburg and is sufficientlywell staffed. We recommend the establishment of an Information Office and libraryin Cape Town.Central Africa52. We consider it to be of great importance that plans should be made now for the opening up of an Information Office in Salisbury, which would form partof the Office of the United Kingdom High Commissioner, and could go into action as soon as possible after the Central African Federation comes into being. A man of high calibre and great tact will be required to direct such an office and we thinkhe should be appointed right away in order to survey the field and examine thepossibilities for information work in this area. In setting up this office care wouldhave to be taken not to tread on the toes of the Information Departments of thethree Governments and it may well be that at the beginning the United KingdomInformation Office in Salisbury would find it convenient to work very largelythrough these Departments. However there will be a number of important matters in which the United Kingdom Information Officer will have to take theinitiative. It will be necessary to explain in a manner acceptable to both europeans and Africans Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy of partnership in multi-racialcommunities. In the initial stages there is likely to be much misunderstanding ofthe meaning and working of the Federal Constitution; and while the enlightenmentof public opinion on this matter will be primarily a matter for the Federal Govern-ment it will be important for the United Kingdom Information Officer to ensurethat there should be no misrepresentation of the intentions of the United Kingdom.Requirements for Additional Services53. To support the expanded field organisation which we have recommended,the Commonwealth Relations Office will require additional services from theCentral Office of Information. In particular there should be an increased supplyof films and a greater quantity of visual material for display purposes. As regardsthe press services an improvement in the quality rather than in the quantity of thematerial supplied is needed.54. We attach great importance to restoring the arrangements for bringingover Commonwealth journalists for official visits to the United Kingdom, particu-larly from India, Pakistan and Ceylon and recommend that provision should bemade for this.Financial Requirements55. At our request the Commonwealth Relations Office have preparedestimates of the additional money, based on present costs, which would be requiredto carry out the above programme. This is reproduced in summary form inAppendix B. The figures appear to us to be on the modest side and if it shouldturn out after a more detailed examination that rather more money is requiredin order to put the Information Service of the Commonwealth Relations office on to a proper footing we recommend that this should be granted.VI.-The Colonial Office56. We have already explained in the main report why it is that we believethat the time has come to establish United Kingdom Information Offices in thoseof the Colonies which have advanced far along the road towards self-governmentand in which there is a growing need to counter Communist propaganda. As a beginning we recommend that such offices should be established in Nigeria (where we are informed that Communist propaganda has assumed considerable propor-tions), Gold Coast, East Africa and the West Indies.57.   The task of these offices would be:(i) to ensure that there is effective representation of the British point of view;(ii) to ensure effective distribution and use of British material;(iii) to advise on the content and form of material produced in London;(iv) to counter Communist propaganda.
58. The Colonial Office estimate that the minimum staff required initiallyfor each office is one United Kingdom based officer, one journalist, one ConfidentialSecretary-typist (locally recruited European woman), and seven to eight locallyrecruited clerical staff. They say further that the setting up of these offices would create more work in the Colonial Office to perform which an additional officer,at the H.E.O. level, would be required. The additional cost in the Colonial Officeinformation budget would be approximately  60,000.59. These four offices may be regarded as the advance guard of the UnitedKingdom High Commissions which will eventually be required in all Colonies whichachieve independence within the Commonwealth. We believe therefore thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government must anticipate an increase in the number of suchUnited Kingdom Information Offices, as the Colonies develop towards self-government. It is important too that when the need for these offices becomesapparent in any Colony they should be established without delay.60. The various supporting services from the Central Office of information will, of course, have to be increased in order to fill the needs of these new officesif our recommendation is accepted, as also to keep up the flow of material for distribution by the Colonial Government Information Departments in othercountries. The Colonial Office estimate that their main needs will be as follows:  (i) to increase the circulation by 50,000 additional copies of the magazineTo-day;(ii) to increase the provision for the production and acquisition of new filmsand for the purchase of prints. The Colonial Office estimate that at aminimum one new film a month should be despatched to the Colonies,of which five or six films a year should be specially made for Colonialuse;(iii) to increase the distribution of suitable British newspapers and periodicalswhich would not otherwise circulate in the Colonies;(iv) to increase the supplies of photographs, posters and other visual material.61. Although this matter does not fall within our terms of reference wewould finally draw attention to the importance of the work done by the ColonialOffice to publicise the Colonies in the United Kingdom. The Colonial Office have said to us that they are seriously disturbed by the very heavy cuts made on this side of the work which they regard as being complementary to what is being donein the Colonies. Inasmuch as one of the main objects of our information workin the Colonies should be to build up political and racial understanding betweenthe United Kingdom and the Colonies we entirely agree that this should be a two-way process.VII.-The Board of Trade62. The Board of Trade maintains no organisation of its own overseas for commercial publicity, but works through the Information Services of the overseas departments. We have no specific recommendation to make concerning the Boardof Trade since the question of commercial publicity has been very largely taken outof our hands as a result of the proposal of the Board of Trade that a specialCommittee of industrialists should be set up to examine the needs and potentialities of commercial propaganda throughout the world. !63. As we see it there are two main problems in regard to commercialpublicity in so far as this should be conducted officially, rather than by the firms engaged in overseas trade:  (i) to ensure an adequate flow of publicity material for use by our InformationOffices overseas;(ii) to have sufficiently strong Information Offices in those parts of the worldwhere commercial publicity is most needed.64. In a paper on the subject of official publicity on commercial topics sub-mitted to our Committee, the Central Office of Information point out that even before the end of the war the need for industrial and economic publicity overseashad been recognised, and that since then an increasing proportion (which to-day
amounts to some 30 per cent.), of the total output of the Central Office of Informa-tion has consisted of material on industrial, economic and scientific subjects. Thispublicity falls into two main groups: first background publicity designed to buildup the industrial and commercial prestige of this country in a general way;secondly, publicity concerning particular industries or products. They complainthat no machinery exists for planning this publicity by regions or by industries andthat there is no provision for putting on a &quot; drive &quot; at the right moment. To remedythis situation they suggest that a Commercial Relations Group should be established,on which should be associated the Government Departments concerned witheconomic and industrial publicity and also the representative bodies of industry.The Federation of British Industries, quite independently, have put forward a very similar suggestion. Her Majesty&apos;s Government will no doubt decide whether these suggestions for some kind of a permanent Advisory Committee on commercialpublicity to assist the Overseas Information Services (and this seems to us to be agood suggestion) should be adopted forthwith or whether, as a first step, as theBoard of Trade suggest, an ad hoc Committee should conduct an enquiry into thewhole subject in order to determine what is needed.65. There is, however, one aspect of this matter concerning which the Boardof Trade specifically requested our Committee to express an opinion: that is therelative importance which should be attached to commercial and industrial publicity in the conduct of the Overseas Information Services as a whole. The Federationof British Industries have expressed to us the view that too little proportion of thetotal effort of the Overseas Information Services is devoted to industry and tradeand they recommended that we should consider whether part of the expenditure inEurope and countries bordering the U.S.S.R. could be diverted to the Common-wealth and Latin America. We do not believe, however, that this is the properway to look at the matter. It is impossible to say that political propaganda inconnexion with the Cold War is more or less important than commercial publicitydesigned to build up our trade. Both are equally needed. If we do not win the cold War we may not survive as a free nation; it is equally evident that we mustexport or die. In our opinion, it follows that the Overseas Information services should be sufficiently strong everywhere to fulfil both tasks.66. In the very long term we have no doubt that the work of the british council, especially in regard to the teaching of English in Asia, will be highlybeneficial to our overseas trade. But for immediate purposes we believe that it isthe Departmental Information Services which must carry the main burden of officialcommercial publicity. It is for the Board of Trade, rather than for our Committee,to say in which areas of the world commercial publicity is most urgently required.Certainly we agree with the Federation of British Industries that Latin Americaand the Commonwealth must be regarded as being of great importance from thispoint of view; and it is with this consideration, among others, in mind that we have recommended a very considerable expansion of the Departmental information services in these areas.VIII. Central Office of Information67. The requirements of the Central Office of Information arise naturallyfrom our recommendations regarding the Information Services of the three Over-seas Departments. It would clearly be no good to strengthen the field organisationof these Services without also ensuring that there shall be a sufficient supply of theright sort of material. Our recommendations for the Central Office of Informationare therefore as follows:  Press Services68. We attach the greatest importance to ensuring that the London PressService shall be efficient since it forms the essential basis for most of the press work done overseas. This service is transmitted by wireless all over the world. Reception,however, is bad in many regions. In some posts as we were able to observe theHellschreiber machines work badly and either need renewing or should be replaced by Morse transmissions requiring local operators. For the Far East the ForeignOffice claim that a relay station is needed either in Singapore or Ceylon and means should certainly be devised to ensure absolutely reliable reception all the
year round in New York. All this appears to require a thorough technicalinvestigation.69. We also formed the impression during our travels that the editorialcontent of the London Press Service stands in need of some revision along the linesof a greater degree of regionalisation to suit the individual needs of different countries.70. The Central Office of Information estimate that in order to make theLondon Press Service efficient, both technically and editorially, a capital expenditureof  15,000 on equipment and an increase in revenue expenditure of approximately 50,000 are required. It is not possible for us to comment on these figures; wecan only say that the importance of the Service to the work of the information services Overseas is so great that money should be found to bring it up to the highestpeak of efficiency.71. As regards feature articles, we believe that the main need is for higherquality articles, better known writers and a greater variety of subject matter and treatment rather than a greater quantity of material. The Central Office ofInformation estimate that an additional  15,000 per year approximately is requiredto provide this improved service.Films72. Films have suffered very badly in the recent cuts and in the last year or so the production programme has been very largely confined to producing films for south-East Asia. The rest of the world has had to suffer, and in Latin Americaand most of Europe the distribution of films has virtually come to a stop. Even inthe United States of America, where an important revenue-producing market hasbeen developed by British Information Services and where television is of growingimportance as an outlet for films the supply of films has been reduced to a trickle.73. Broadly speaking, we believe two types of documentary films are required those designed to illustrate the more fundamental aspects of our institutions andway of life for under-developed countries; and films of prestige value or thosedesigned for specialist audiences in the United States, the Commonwealth, latin america and Europe. More and more in producing these films the needs of television should be considered.74. To meet the requirements of the Overseas Departments the Central Officeof Information estimate that about  80,000 a year more will be required for filmsproduction (including staff) and an additional  33,000 to cover distribution costs.Publications75.   The main requirements under this heading are:  (i) to increase the circulation of the Arabic magazine El &apos;Alam (estimatedadditional cost about  17,000);(ii) to increase the circulation of the magazine To-day in the Colonies(estimated additional cost about  10,000).Book Export Scheme16. The Foreign Office have pointed out to us that in various countries theimportation of British books is impeded by exchange restrictions. Three countriesin which it is politically very important to overcome these difficulties are Yugoslavia,Indonesia and Israel. They suggest that in these cases a scheme &quot; the British BookExport Scheme &quot; which worked well in the years immediately following 1945should be adopted. Under this scheme the British Government paid the Britishexporter, while the foreign importer made payment in his own currency, either tothe British Diplomatic Mission or into a blocked account from which periodicreleases were made, or to both. The Central Office of Information, based on past experience, believe that the total outlay (estimated by the Foreign Office to be 130,000) would be fully recoverable over the whole period of operating the scheme.However, owing to the time-lag a net provision of  50,000 would have to be madein the first year of the scheme, which sum would be recovered subsequently. Therewould be additional staff expenditure in the Central Office of Information of about 4,000 in order to handle the scheme. In view of the undoubted importance of getting British books to Yugoslavia, Indonesia and Israel we recommend that this plan should be adopted.
Tours for Journalists11. We recommend that extra provision should be made in the Central Officeof Information vote for handling tours of Commonwealth journalists.Miscellaneous Services78. To fill the increased demand from overseas which will undoubtedlydevelop if our recommendations are adopted some increase of expenditure will undoubtedly be required to increase the output and improve the presentation ofthe reference service; to provide more visual material for display purposes,especially in the Commonwealth and the Colonies; for the photographic pressservice; and for increased supplies of newspapers and periodicals for posts overseas.Financial Requirements of the Central Office of Information19. We have not been able to examine in any detail the estimates submittedto us by the Central Office of Information; in fact they submitted to us two esti-mates, the first for an increased annual expenditure of  270,149 (to which shouldbe added  15,000 for capital expenditure on the London Press Service) which theyconsider to be the absolute minimum required to fulfil Departmental requirements;the second for an increased annual expenditure of  365,479 (again excluding the 15,000 needed for capital expenditure on the London Press Service) which theyconsider is required if a proper use is to be made overseas of all the availablemedia. In particular, the Central Office of Information believe that the Depart-ments are not sufficiently alive to the possibilities of using display material in under-developed territories. This is a matter of detail which must be thrashed out between the Departments concerned and on which we feel unable to make a recommendation.80. For the purpose of our general estimate of probable additional financialrequirements in paragraph 74 of the main report we have put in a round figureof  300,000 per year for the Central Office of Information.

THE BRITISH council I.--Historical background. The French were the first in the &quot; cultural &quot; field. During the latter halfof the 19th century the French Government, through the French Catholic teachingmissionaries, carried on extensive religious, educational and philanthropic works inthe Near and in the Far East. And the Germans were not far behind. even before 1900 the German Government provided for the support of German schoolsabroad and for activities designed to make the achievements of German scienceknown overseas.2. Great Britain entered the field much later. The British Council was estab-lished as an unofficial body in 1934 and its chief object then was to counter Germanand Italian propaganda in the Middle East. Until the beginning of the war the council&apos;s work was mainly concentrated on the countries (including the british colonies) in the Mediterranean basin.3. In October 1940 the Council was granted a Charter under which its taskwas defined as being &quot; to promote a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom andthe English language abroad, and to develop closer cultural relations between theUnited Kingdom and other countries for the purpose of benefiting the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.&quot;4. During the war the British Council continued to expand its work so. as toinclude Turkey, Persia, Ethiopia, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, China, various latin american Republics, the West Indies and West Africa. The Council also -built up its organisation at home in order to deal mainly with the personnel of the Common-wealth, United States and European allied forces, who were then stationed in theUnited Kingdom.5. At the end of the war it was decided to retain the Overseas information services which had been built up by the war-time Ministry of Information althoughthe Ministry disappeared. It therefore became necessary to define what should bethe relationship between the various Departmental Information Services and theBritish Council, and in June 1946 the Cabinet decided that the Council shouldcontinue to work under its Charter for another five years and that in order to avoidoverlapping between the Council and the Government^ Overseas information services, its scope should in future be restricted to educational and cultural work.When the five-year period elapsed, the situation would be reviewed.6. Immediately after the war the Council, at the request of the Foreign Office,established itself in the liberated countries of Europe with most of which the UnitedKingdom Government subsequently concluded Cultural Conventions, naming theCouncil as the principal agent of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for the purpose ofthese Conventions. By 1950 the British Council had withdrawn from Russia andbeen ejected from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria.. Behind the iron curtain it now remains only in Poland. In the rest of Europe its activities haverecently been cut very considerably as a measure of economy, but they are stillquite extensive in many European countries,7. While these developments were taking place in Europe, the work of theCouncil was extended to the majority of the Colonies and to the following countries of the Commonwealth: Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. Theintention was that the work in the Colonies and Asia should be gradually expanded,but as these developments coincided with a time of financial stringency the develop-ment of the Council in the Commonwealth and Colonies is still virtually in theembryo stage. In fact, as will be seen, the British Council is to-day badly over-extended with inadequate resources to meet all the commitments which it is expectedto undertake.II. Methods of Work8. Of all the &quot; information &quot; agencies the British Council is the most criticised.This we believe is usually because the nature of its work is not understood. Forexample, the Council is often accused of being &quot; arty-crafty.&quot; Most of the criticismtakes the form of singling out some activity such as an art exhibition or the tour of
a theatrical company and making it appear ridiculous by asking what possiblenational gain is to be expected from the official sponsorship of such a venture.This question certainly has to be asked; but it can only be answered fairly when thework of the Council is studied as a whole and each individual activity seen in its proper place as part of a cumulative process. When viewed in this light it will befound that art, music and drama, which receive the brunt of the criticism, form avery small part of the total activity and that what is done in this field is usually either the result of some international obligation of Her Majesty&apos;s Government or forms part of the day-to-day activities of a British Council centre overseas and can bejustified in much the same way as the British Broadcasting Corporation is justifiedin using entertainment in order to attract the foreign listener who as a result oftenlistens to news and political commentary which follow afterwards.9. The following are some of the typical activities of the British Council over-seas which it will be seen all fit together like the links in a chain.The Teaching of English10. The first and essential step is to increase the knowledge of the english language. This can be done either by teaching English in British Council institutes,or by appointing Professors of English in local universities, or by means of travelling&quot; Education&quot; officers on the CounciFs staff whose duty it is to stimulate and improve English teaching in the local schools and universities.British Council Institutes and Anglophil Societies11. A knowledge of English gives rise in its turn to a desire to read Englishbooks, talk to British people and learn about British life or some particular aspect of it. Indeed a knowledge of English is almost essential to-day for the study ofmany branches of science and technology as also, of course, for the study of Englishliterature, history and British institutions. Foreigners who have taken the troubleto learn English are therefore usually glad to belong to a British Institute or Anglo-phil Society which will provide them with a good library of English books and periodicals (which would in many countries otherwise be unobtainable). But to be successful the Institute or Anglophil Society requires also to develop the atmosphere of a club in the life of which lectures, films, musical recitals, play-readings and other&quot; cultural &quot; activities all play their part. If these things are done well a good crosssection of the educated classes of the country are likely to be attracted to the institute.Contacts with Universities, Learned Societies, &amp;c.12. The Institute also forms the headquarters from which the British Councilrepresentative and his assistants systematically set out to make contact with andcultivate the educational, scientific and cultural leaders in the universities, in Govern-ment, and in learned societies and other institutions throughout the country. Films,lecturers, books, periodicals, Sec, are sent out from the Institute to these bodies onrequest and in this way the range of influence of the Council is spread over a wide area. This idea of the British Council centre as a base for operations carried out over a wide area appears to be gaining ground over the older concept of the BritishInstitute whose work was mainly confined within the narrow circle of its membership.Scholarships, Bursaries and Visitors13. As the result of all these contacts both inside and outside the Institute theBritish Council representative will receive many requests from people some ofthem already eminent in their professions, others post-graduate students-who wishto visit the United Kingdom, usually in order to study some subject. From suchapplicants are chosen the distinguished visitors, including scientists, whom it isconsidered worth while to assist, as well as British Council scholars and bursars.Accordingly an organisation is maintained by the Council in the United kingdom to look after all those various categories of visitors, many of whom pay their ownexpenses and merely require facilities. In due course the visitors return to theirown country and experience has shown that, like the Rhodes Scholars, they are usually very well impressed by what they have seen of the United Kingdom.   The
friendship towards Great Britain which they have acquired can afterwards be main-tained probably for life by systematic cultivation by the British Council repre-sentatives and in many cases by continued membership in the Institute in which an&quot; old boy &quot; tradition soon develops.14. The above list of activities of the British Council is by no meansexhaustive; but it gives an idea of the manner in which, by means of providing services of different sorts, goodwill and understanding towards this country are built up both among the existing leaders in the educational and cultural world and a largenumber of post-graduate students from the universities who may one day reach aposition of influence in their country; indeed by the careful selection of scholarsand bursars it is possible to be reasonably confident that at least a fair proportionof them will do this. These lasting friendships formed with influential men indiverse walks of life may one day be of the greatest political value to this country.Similarly, the British trained foreign technician, now perhaps the manager of a factory or a senior Government official, may be instrumental in placing substantialorders for British goods.15. Thus, although the method all through is strictly non-political, at the endof the process a considerable political or commercial benefit is likely to be received.But this will only come after a period of years. It is for this reason that british council work must be regarded as essentially a long-term investment.III. Organisation16. The non-political character of the British Council is reflected in its organi-sation. Although supported mainly by official funds it is not a GovernmentDepartment and overseas its centres do not form part of the Mission. We feelcertain that, although the operations of the Council must be closely integrated withother information activities, there is a sound case both for the retention of theBritish Council as a separate organisation in the United Kingdom, and in most countries, though not in all, for keeping the Council&apos;s field organisation apart fromthe Mission as a separate and non-political entity.17. To deal with the last point first, several instances of the advantage to be gained by keeping the Council apart from the Embassy came to the notice ofmembers of the Committee when travelling abroad. Egypt was a good example ofthis. Here, because of the state of political tension, we found that the InformationOffice, which forms a part of the Embassy, was being virtually boycotted by the egyptians. But the British Council Institute was crammed full of students andthere was a long waiting list of Egyptian boys for entry into Victoria College, aBritish school in Cairo which is subsidised by the British Council. An official of theBritish Embassy explained the value of this educational work in the following way:he said that when dealing with Egyptian officials he often felt himself divided from them by a wall of mutual incomprehension. But if the official happened to be anold Victoria College boy then, although he might be just as critical of British policy as his colleagues, one could at least talk to him. He might even have forgotten hisEnglish, nevertheless, in a fundamental sense, he still spoke the same language. Orto give one other example: in Karachi we were told that in the days of anti-Britishriots the students would never make hostile demonstrations against the BritishInstitute, since they considered this to be not a part of the United Kingdom high commission but their own club. On the other hand, We believe that in certaincircumstances it may be desirable for the British Council representative to work inthe Embassy as a Cultural Attache. The Foreign Office themselves are anxious tomake this arrangement in Japan where they claim that independence from the embassy would have many disadvantages. As will be seen below, we believe thata similar arrangement (although for quite different reasons) should be made incertain countries of the Commonwealth and Europe.18. In some countries which we visited it had been found convenient to combine the British Council library with that of the Information Office and tocentralise the mechanical handling of the distribution of the films belonging to thetwo agencies. British Council and Information Office libraries and films, generallyspeaking, serve a different purpose and have a different clientele. Sometimes local circumstances are such that it is convenient to combine them; at other times theyare better kept apart. We do not think that it is desirable to lay down any general
rule about this although, of course, wherever integration is politically feasible and likely to lead to a substantial economy either of man-power or rent it should becarried out.19. As regards the organisation in London, we have no doubt that the existingstructure is much more suitable for the type of work which has to be done than would be a Government Department. The essence of the organisation of theBritish Council is that it includes both in its Executive Committee and in its variousAdvisory Panels a number of eminent non-official persons drawn from as wide a range of professions and occupations as that of the work of the Council itself Education, Medicine, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, the Arts, Book-publishing all are represented in the organisation of the Council. There is, ofcourse, a certain danger inherent in such an organisation. Each profession is naturally enthusiastic about that side of the work with which it is itself concerned and there may be a tendency to consider what is being done in each of thesespecialised fields to be a good thing in itself, without regard to its ultimate political or commercial consequences. It is the role of the official representatives of the overseas Departments on the Executive Committee of the Council and we con-sider it to be a most important duty to keep a vigilant eye on what is being donein all fields in order to ensure that as far as possible the work should be confined to activities which cannot properly be left to private agencies and which in thelong run can be expected to pay a political or commercial dividend.IV. Priorities for British Council Work20. In a paper submitted to the Committee the British Council argue that theyshould not properly be regarded as an &quot; information &quot; agency at all since their activities the teaching of English, the assistance of British schools, the welfare of overseas students, inter-university relations, art exhibitions and so on have little or nothing to do with &quot; publicity &quot; or &quot; information &quot; in any usually accepted useof these terms. Rather, they claim, the role of the British Council in international affairs is to take care of a recognisable branch of the country&apos;s external relations.21. We believe that this claim is only valid up to a certain point. It cannotbe denied that since the war &quot; cultural relations &quot;&apos; have become a normal partof the function of diplomacy. The theory is now generally accepted and has often been publicly stated that modern international relationships depend not only uponGovernments but upon the mutual understanding of peoples. It is on this theorythat UNESCO, an agency of the United Nations whose object it is to bringabout better understanding between peoples by the widest possible internationaldiifusion of education and culture, was founded. A similar belief in the need tobring the peoples of countries together underlies the various bilateral Cultural Con-ventions of which the United Kingdom is a signatory. Either these Conventionsmust be regarded as being pure humbug, or it must be accepted that the UnitedKingdom by virtue of signing them has assumed certain obligations, albeit of a somewhat undefined nature, to promote the cause of peace and internationalunderstanding by means of cultural and educational interchanges. Other quitespecific obligations, such as the care of Colombo Plan Fellows, have been placedon the Council as the result of international agreements. There is thus an irreducibleminimum of cultural relations work, the precise scale of which only Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is in a position to determine, which must be done as a matter of obliga-tion quite irrespective of any political or commercial advantages to be gainedtherefrom.22. Apart from these international obligations it has also come about in recenttimes that private educational and cultural bodies overseas increasingly seek theadvice of Her Majesty&apos;s Missions abroad on a wide variety of topics which oftenwould have to be dealt with by a special staff if the British Council was not thereto take over this burden. A case in point is Washington. The British Councilmaintains no organisation in the United States. But Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in washington consider it necessary to maintain an &quot; Educational Officer &quot; to dealwith the considerable volume of educational and cultural work which without anyartificial stimulation falls upon the Mission in spite of the fact that between theUnited Kingdom and the United States of America there are so many links betweennon-official, educational and cultural organisations in the two countries.23. But having conceded this much to the claim of the British Council thatits true role is to take care of a branch of the country&apos;s external relations we must
insist that the greater part of the work which it does is essentially &quot; propaganda &quot;in the sense that its aim is to influence the thinking of peoples overseas and inthis manner assist Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the prosecution of their Foreign,Commonwealth and Colonial policies. The method may be non-political, but the aim is exactly similar to that of the other Information Services. It follows, therefore,that the value of British Council work, apart from the irreducible minimum whichhas to be done in any case, must be subjected to the same sort of test as is appliedto any other kind of information work. Its value in any given country should, webelieve, be judged in relation to the following factors:  (1) the nature and extent of British political and commercial interests;(2) the attitude towards the United Kingdom of the educated classes (i.e., itmay be friendly or unfriendly or sharply divided;  generally wellinformed or ignorant);(3) the extent to which the educational and cultural leaders and universitygraduates are likely to have political influence;(4) the extent of the danger of Communism, especially in the universities and among intellectuals and the degree to which the work of the councils likely to lessen this danger;(5) the demand for cultural and educational contacts with the United Kingdom(including the desire to learn English); and the extent to which this demand can be filled by private enterprise or requires official assistance.24. Applying these various tests we have reached some general conclusionsabout the relative utility of British Council work in different parts of the world and these are summarised in paragraphs 25-27 of the main report. Briefly, webelieve that the highest priority should be given to the work of the British Councilin the under-developed countries of Asia and in the British Colonies and that, asa general rule, it should have a low priority in countries which share with us a european heritage. In Appendix A to this Annex we have summarised what, inaccordance with this general principle, we believe is needed in the way of additional staff and operational expenditure in each region. The following are some of the considerations which have led us to make these recommendations.Asia25. We believe that the British Council has a great task to do in India and pakistan and in the Far East and Middle East. The opportunity is provided becauseof the importance which English is assuming throughout Asia as a lingua francaand as the language of science, technology and sociology.26. For example, in the Indian sub-continent English is the language in whichthe Urdu-speaking leaders of Western Pakistan communicate with the Bengali-speaking leaders of East Pakistan. There can hardly be any common language inthe Parliament of India but English. If we are correctly informed the dream thatHindi might gradually replace English in Delhi has already faded away and it is recognised that whilst the Parliamentarians of the Punjab, Bengal, Madras andother provinces are willing to learn English as a second language, very few of the mare going to learn Hindi as well. Similarly, the nations of South-East Asia are finding that if they are to be understood at international conferences they musthave a common language and the most widely known language is English. Soeverywhere the cry is for more and more English teachers.27. This demand must be viewed against the general background in Asia.Obsessed with local problems the Asian is not thinking of any danger from Russiaor China. Everywhere he tends to sympathise with any country which can berepresented as struggling to free itself from Western Imperialism. And yet,throughout non-Communist Asia and particularly in the Indian sub-continent thereis a great feeling of respect and goodwill for this country.28. We feel convinced that the most effective way to increase this goodwillis for the British Council to help to supply the demand for English teaching and improve its standards. This can best and most economically be done, not by setting up English teaching institutes but by sending out travelling educationalofficers with experience of the latest methods of English-teaching to train localteachers, and by subsidising the appointment of English Professors at localuniversities. A certain amount is already being done along these lines but notanything like enough to satisfy the demand.
29. This question of making the English language the lingua franca of non-Communist Asia has impressed us with a terrific sense of urgency. The door iswide open now and if we so desire English can become the second language through-out Asia and the islands from Pakistan to Australia. The implications that followare obviously great. The opportunity if it is neglected will not recur. We do notbelieve that any other activity of the British Council can be of eaual importanceto this.30. This is not to suggest that English teaching is enough by itself. TheProfessor of English or the British Council educational officer will be in a positionto do a lot more than just teach or help to improve the methods of teachingEnglish. His real function is to be a sort of missionary who uses the english language as a key to open the door, so that the Asian student, if he wishes, canenter into the life of the West. In other words, English teaching provides theessential starting point for the other services which the British Council can provideboth from its centres in Asia and by the organisation of visits by Asians to theUnited Kingdom and the care of Asian students who may have gone there either with or without official assistance. All these activities form part of a single processdesigned to condition the thinking of a selected number of educated Asians insuch a way that a great deal of goodwill towards the United Kingdom will be created among the people who may be expected to play a leading part as politiciansor industrialists in the new Asia. But for such a programme to be effective it mustbe done on an adequate scale. We believe therefore that the activities of theBritish Council in Asia require to be expanded along the following lines.The Indian Sub-Continent31. British Council work in India, Pakistan and Ceylon had only just begunwhen its further development was prevented by the economy cuts. In India,particularly, the scale of the work being done is quite inadequate for such a vastcountry. We believe therefore that it is urgently necessary to build up the organisa-tion of the Council in these three new Commonwealth countries to the extentenvisaged in Appendix A in order to assist in maintaining the use and the standardof English. Furthermore, in India and Pakistan, it is necessary to increase the range of the Council so that it will be in touch with all the principal universitytowns. In India alone, we were told, there are scattered about the country no lessthan 700 university colleges with which the existing staff of the British Councilcannot possibly maintain regular contact.The Far East32. Our recommendations for this area envisage small increases in the existing staff of the British Council in Burma, Indonesia and Thailand in all of whichcountries there is a great and increasing demand to learn English. We have alsoendorsed the proposal of the Foreign Office to initiate English-teaching in Indo-China since we are informed that the inhabitants wish to learn this languagerather than French as a medium of communication with other countries in thearea and now tend to look to Britain rather than to France as a source of inspira-tion in their present difficulties. The largest demand for expansion in this area,however, comes from Japan where Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo hasstrongly recommended on political grounds that the British Council shall be strengthened. We feel somewhat doubtful about this proposal, especially sincethe cost of working in Japan is so high, but as time prevented us visiting Japanduring the course of this enquiry we do not feel able to take issue with the menon the spot in Tokyo. We suggest, however, that before embarking upon a pro-gramme of heavy expenditure in Japan itself Her Majesty&apos;s Government should examine the possibility of doing as much as possible at this end, where the costs are much lower, by offering scholarships and facilities to Japanese students in theUnited Kingdom.The Middle East33. Owing to the tense and fluid political situation the Middle East offersat the moment a somewhat less promising field for British Council work thandoes the rest of Asia. Nevertheless, as a long-term investment in the area (whichis of vital importance to the United Kingdom strategically and because of oil) webelieve that the work of the British Council should be maintained in existing centres and that it should be extended to certain new countries where it is not at present45030 h 2
represented, namely the Sudan, Libya and Kuwait. Owing to the growing impor-tance of Israel we also support the proposal of the Foreign Office to open a newcentre in Haifa. From what we saw in the Middle East we attach importance torestoring the school subsidies in Egypt and Iraq. We also recommend that her majesty&apos;s Government should examine sympathetically the proposal of her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Beirut that financial assistance should be given by her Majesty&apos;s Government for founding a British school in the Lebanon.The British Colonies34. The Colonies are another area in which we feel sure that the work of theBritish Council should be given high priority. The Council does not here haveto concern itself with English-teaching since this is the function of the colonial government and requires no outside assistance. The main task of the Councillies in the sphere of adult education in its broadest sense and in assisting generally in the development of the social and cultural life of the colony (which is oftenpractically non-existent) by encouraging the growth of societies for the study oflocal problems and working through these once they have been established. by bringing different racial elements together in activities which have nothing to do with politics, the Council can do a great deal to break down racial prejudiceswherever these exist. The work is thus indirectly of great political importance.It is of particular importance in Africa.35. The other main task of the British Council in relation to the Coloniesis to look after the welfare of Colonial students in London, an activity which is largely financed by the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. This too is obviously of the greatest importance since the student who has been well treated in the United Kingdom will probably return to his country well disposed towards us, whereas otherwise he may become a dangerous enemy.36. Members of the Committee who visited certain British Council centres in the Colonies found them to be inadequately housed and staffed. As a result the whole Council effort in these countries struck them as being rather second ratethough generally this was not the fault of the staff. We believe that it is urgently necessary to improve the existing standard of work in the Colonies; in particular,wherever necessary, more attractive premises should be provided and the staff should be given adequate allowances.37. In view of the importance of the work in the Colonies we have no hesitation in endorsing the proposals which have been put to us by the british council (see Appendix A) for a modest strengthening of existing offices in a numberof the Colonies and for opening new centres in Malaya, Tanganyika and HongKong. In making these recommendations we have been influenced by the thoughtthat since so many of the territories are rapidly developing towards self-governmentHer Majesty&apos;s Government cannot begin too soon in trying to establish a new typeof relationship based on understanding and friendship to the mutual advantage ofthe colonial territories concerned and of this country.Latin America38. This area is chiefly of interest to the United Kingdom from a commercialpoint of view and we feel that the main effort in Latin America should be concen-trated on publicity or cultural relations work designed to assist, in as direct a manner as possible, our commercial position and trade. The most effective way in whichthe British Council can assist in doing this is by granting scholarships and bursariesto technical and engineering students. We recommend therefore that the numberof such scholarships and bursaries should be increased. We also commend highlyanything that British firms with interests in Latin America can do in this sphere(e.g., the existing scheme of the Federation of British Industries for giving technical training to Latin American students).39. The work of the British Council in Latin America is mainly done throughAnglophil societies many of which are now long-established and flourishinginstitutions. The main activity of these societies is the teaching of English toadults; but they also maintain libraries and go in for the usual corporate activitiesof the British Council centre abroad film showings, lectures and so on. Most ofthe societies are virtually self-supporting because of the revenue received in fees for english teaching.   However, they could not function properly and would soon

The work is thus indirectly of great political importance.It is of particular importance in Africa.35. The other main task of the British Council in relation to the Coloniesis to look after the welfare of Colonial students in London, an activity which is Jlargely financed by the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. This too is obviously of the greatest importance since the student who has been well treated in the United Kingdom will probably return to his country well disposed towards us, whereas otherwise he may become a dangerous enemy.36.

The work of the British Council in Latin America is mainly done throughAnglophil societies many of which are now long-established and flourishinginstitutions. The main activity of these societies is the teaching of English toadults; but they also maintain libraries and go in for the usual corporate activitiesof the British Council centre abroad film showings, lectures and so on. Most ofthe societies are virtually self-supporting because of the revenue received in fees for english teaching.   However, they could not function properly and would soon
deteriorate into little more than Berlitz schools if the British Council did not sub-sidise them to the extent of sending out London based senior staff. Since, relatively,we get a lot for our money out of them we recommend that the existing level ofexpenditure should be maintained in order to keep in being the Anglophil societiesin Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.40. As regards Venezuela, one of our members who visited this countryfound the local Anglophil society in Caracas to be understaffed and badly housed.To put these things right would require a considerable increase in the subsidyprovided by the British Council owing to the exceptionally high cost of living inVenezuela. We doubt, however, whether this is worth attempting. There is anenrolment of 600 persons for the English classes, but attendance is only about 300.The library of 6,000 volumes is relatively little used, and in general, Venezuelansshow little interest in education or culture of any sort. On balance, then, we have come to the conclusion that the additional money required to put the society on itsfeet could be better spent on strengthening the Information Office in Caracas andwe recommend therefore that the British Council should withdraw altogether fromVenezuela.Europe41. We believe that the time has come for a new approach to the work of theBritish Council in Europe. The following factors should be taken into account when deciding in what spheres the British Council can be expected to do useful work in this region: -(i) The European countries share with us a common cultural heritage.(ii) They mostly have a high standard of education and literacy.(iii) Many of them are relatively well off economically.(iv) They are situated close to us geographically and are therefore within easyreach for the traveller.(v) In most European countries there is no difficulty about learning English ifit is desired to do so and British newspapers, magazines and books canfairly easily be obtained by anybody who has sufficient interest to buythem.42. Immediately after the war it was decided by the Foreign Office that theBritish Council should move into the liberated countries of Europe on a large scale. This was done on the ground that it was necessary to re-establish the educa-tional and cultural ties which had been broken during the years of the Nazioccupation. In principle this was evidently a sound policy; but in retrospect it isclear that the method employed to renew these European contacts was ill-chosen.Although the problem it had to solve was essentially a short-term one arisingout of the special conditions of the war, the Council adopted its traditional long-term method of establishing centres in the principal European cities, built aroundlibraries and with all the usual accompaniment of cultural activities conducted inthe atmosphere of a friendly club. But these centres were expensive to establish and maintain and no sooner had they begun to get on their feet than they were hit by the financial cuts and many of them had to be disbanded before they had had time to do very much good. A great deal of the investment made by the british council in Europe was therefore wasted. And now, except in a few countries,conditions in Europe on this side of the Iron Curtain have virtually returned to normal. The number of British visitors to Europe is increasing and plenty of europeans are now visiting the United Kingdom. Moreover, most of the european countries are now firmly committed to a policy of the closest co-operation political,economic and military with us in N.A.T.O.43. Communism presents something of a danger in certain countries (forinstance in France and in Italy), but we do not believe that anything that the british council can do is likely to diminish that danger to any substantial extent. Thesituation is quite different in Asia or in the Colonies. In under-developed countries the small educated class is faced with the tremendous problem of carrying out in asingle generation a political, social and economic revolution which it took hundreds of years to accomplish in Europe. The leaders in these countries need to drawupon our experience in order to transform their countries economically and toacquire the art of Government.   If we do not help them in these things, then they
may well be tempted to try the Communist experiment as a short cut out of their difficulties. Nothing like this situation exists in Europe. We do not believe thata knowledge of the English language, a taste for British books, admiration forBritish medical science or modern sculpture are likely to make the slightest differ-ence to the outlook of the average educated European on the subject of communism. They may make him like and admire the United Kingdom; but thatis something quite different. In our view much more direct political methods are needed in order to assist the European Governments and their people in the fight against internal Communism. The discreet dissemination in Europe of the excel-lent studies of different aspects of Communism prepared in the InformationResearch Department of the Foreign Office seem to us to be a much more effective way of dealing with the problem. The Labour Attaches can do a great deal of useful work by keeping in close touch with European trades union leaders and encouraging them to join and co-operate with the free and democratic trades union movement all over the world in the battle against Communism. In this task toothe Information Services can assist, and do assist, by bringing over to the UnitedKingdom parties of European trades unionists. We suggest that this scheme might usefully be extended to cover as well youth leaders. But all this is essentially workof a political or near-political nature which we believe can be handled much betterby the Foreign Office Information Service and the Labour Attaches than by theBritish Council.44. We do not mean to imply by this that there is no room at all in Europefor work of the kind now being done by the British Council. But we think that thisshould be confined in the main to the encouragement of reciprocal cultural and educational exchanges. We are in fact committed by Cultural Conventions with most of the European countries to promote such exchanges. The problem, as we see it, is to devise a means of stimulating these exchanges, which we have no doubthelp to build up friendly international relations, without burdening the British tax payer with their cost. It seems to us that most of the European countries canwell pay for anything which is done for them in these fields and that if we can pro-vide services which they really want they would willingly do so. We therefore recommend a new plan for cultural and educational work in Europe along thefollowing lines:  (i) Within the next three years all existing British Council teaching institutes,libraries, Anglophil societies, &amp;c, in Europe should be made as nearlyself-supporting as possible by means of fees or subscriptions. What hasbeen achieved by the Anglophil societies in Latin America and what happened to some of the teaching institutes in Italy (which were taken over under private management when the British Council withdrew their support) shows the sort of thing which can be done along these lines.At the very most, after the three-year period has elapsed, any subsidyby the British Council should be limited to paying the salary of theDirector (by so doing we should retain the right to appoint a man ofour own choosing) and the supply of books and other services. with one or two exceptions, which are mentioned below, we recommend thatBritish Council centres in Europe which show no signs of being able tobecome self-supporting to this extent within three years should be closed down forthwith.(ii) Travelling education officers, maintained at the expense of the british council, while fully justified in Asia, are not, we believe, justified inEurope. If assistance is needed in the teaching of English, BritishProfessors should be appointed to European universities, or Britishschoolmasters to European schools on the basis that their salaries shouldbe paid by the university or school in question. The British council should confine itself to seeking openings for such English Professorsand teachers and in assisting in the recruitment of the right men.(iii) Visits to the United Kingdom by European post-graduate students,scientists, educational&apos;and cultural leaders, &amp;c, should be encouraged;but wherever possible the assistance given should be limited to grantingfacilities. Except in exceptional circumstances the visitors should always be expected to pay their own way.(iv) Major exhibitions of British paintings and sculpture in Europe,, and Euro-pean tours by British theatrical companies and orchestras should be
encouraged, but as far as possible they should be made to pay for themselves. At the very most Her Majesty&apos;s Government should under-write such ventures against possible loss; and this should only be donein cases where the commercial prospects are considered favourable,(v) Over the next three years, British Council offices in Europe should be closed down, and instead Cultural Attaches (who would normally beseconded from the British Council) should be appointed and form partof the staff of the Embassy. The size of the offices of the CulturalAttaches should be kept down to the minimum required in order to perform the following duties:  (a) to advise and assist Her Majesty&apos;s representatives in european countries on all matters pertaining to the Cultural Conventions;(b) to widen the range of the contacts of the Mission so as to includethe leading figures in education, science, medicine and the arts;(c) to deal with enquiries on educational and cultural matters;(d) to stimulate and assist, although not as a rule financially, culturaland educational exchanges;(e) to maintain liaison with and assist any institutes or Anglophilsocieties which become self-supporting.45. In order to avoid any undesirable political consequences, these changes should be brought about gradually and inconspicuously over the next three years.As an immediate step we recommend that Cultural Attaches should be appointed in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Switzerland (where theorganisation of the British Council has already been reduced to small dimensions);as soon as possible Cultural Attaches should be appointed to do the work of theBritish Council in Portugal and France, in which latter country we believe somesaving in manpower might be achieved by reducing the size of the office in Paris.Both in Portugal and France we would expect the institutes to survive on a semi-paying basis. The change should take place more gradually and only after carefulpreparation of the ground in Italy, Greece and Austria owing to the more unstablepolitical conditions in those countries. In Spain, so long as the Franco regimeendures, it would no doubt be best to leave the status of the British Council repre-sentative unchanged. Turkey, we think (although, of course, the Turks should notbe allowed to suspect this), should be considered for the time being as belonging tothe &quot; under-developed &quot; category and no change should be made in the existingpattern of activity.46. Yugoslavia and Poland are clearly special cases. The former is a com-paratively new national entity; language, war, poverty and politics have isolated it from the West. We recommend therefore that the work of the British Council in yugoslavia should continue for the time being on the present lines and that, indeed,it should be somewhat expanded. The British Council centre in Warsaw is the oneremaining outpost of the British Council behind the Iron Curtain. We recommendthat it should be retained in its present form.47. The very special problem of educational and cultural work in germany is dealt with separately in Annex 4.48. We should not like it to be thought that the above recommendations imply any reflection upon the work of the British Council staff &quot;in Europe much of whichhas been wholly admirable. Our recommendations are made in the light of the urgent need for national economy and because in our view the different kind ofwork being done by the British Council in other parts of the world is relatively of much greater importance.The Old Dominions49. In Australia and New Zealand the main function of the British councils to provide a point of liaison between the universities, cultural bodies and learnedsocieties in those countries with similar bodies in the United Kingdom. The organ-isation consists at present only of small centres in Sydney and Wellington respec-tively. While not doubting the importance of doing everything possible to stimulateeducational and cultural ties with these countries we consider that it is desirablethat so far as possible the work should be done through Australian and NewZealand organisations.   Since the work is essentially that of liaison and requires
little in the way of an organisation, we recommend that, as in Europe, CulturalAttaches should be appointed to the United Kingdom High Commissioners&apos; offices in these two countries and that the British Council centres should be closed down.50. The Commonwealth Relations Office are anxious that the British council should start work in Canada. We do not doubt the political importance of main-taining all possible contacts with that country in order to counteract any tendency for it to drift away from the Commonwealth orbit. The United States of Americaprovides a strong counter-attraction, and there is already a marked difference inoutlook towards the United Kingdom between Canadians of the old and youngergenerations. Among many Canadians there is a real desire to strengthen culturaland educational ties with the United Kingdom a point which the Governor-General stressed to us when we visited Ottawa.51. But for the same reasons that we have recommended that CulturalAttaches should be appointed in Australia and New Zealand to take over the worknow being done by the British Council we do not advise that the British council should themselves begin work in what would be for them a new field. If they are allowed to establish an organisation in Canada a new commitment will have been created at the expense of the British taxpayer from which later on it would be verydifficult to withdraw. We feel strongly therefore that we should limit our commit-ments from the outset to the appointment of a Cultural Attache to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner^ Office in Ottawa who would work on the principlethat wherever possible private organisations should undertake at their own expensesuch work as needs to be done.52. We are satisfied that owing to the political situation in South Africa it iswise to keep the British Council out of this country for the time being.V. Services provided in or from the United Kingdom53. The work of British Council centres and institutes overseas depends on certain services provided from London books, periodicals and display material for the libraries and reading-rooms; films, lecturers, musical recordings and exhibition-tions both for use in the institutes and in universities, schools and in all the othermany and diverse organisations with which the Council maintains contact.54. These services have received the brunt of the recent economy cuts, mainly,we understand, because it was easier to say &quot; let there be fewer films and books,&quot;and thereby obtain an immediate economy, than to decide to close down an institute,a decision which might have unpleasant political repercussions and create all sortsof problems owing to the contractual arrangements with the staff or with thepersons who attend the institute.55. This is, however, a short-sighted policy and we were able to observeits ill-effects in many parts of the world, where libraries are slowly running down for lack of a sufficient supply of new books and British Council centres are becoming hard put to it to maintain their programme of film showings. Indeed,when giving evidence, the British Council informed the Committee that the time was rapidly approaching when either the number of centres abroad must bereduced which in effect would mean that some of the commitments of the british council could no longer be fulfilled or when essential services must be restored to an adequate level. Since, however, our recommendation is that the work ofthe British Council should be considerably expanded in Asia and the british colonies it follows that in our opinion these services not only require to be restored to a level commensurate with existing commitments but must be increased in proportion as the work is expanded.56. Having been requested to say what their requirements for services wouldbe, given the maximum expansion overseas which they themselves had recom-mended, an estimate was submitted by the British Council to the Committee whichis reproduced in Appendix B. We were not in a position to go into figures in anydetail and our estimate of requirements which we have put beside the british council figures in Appendix B represents no more than a very rough guess of whatis needed, based on the following assessment of the relative value of the different services.
Books and Periodicals57. The libraries of English books are the essential core of all British Councilcentres abroad. They must be properly stocked and kept up to date. A wide range of British periodicals (especially technical journals) are useful for the readingrooms, but care must be taken to avoid an overlavish distribution since requirementsvary greatly from post to post.Films58. The regular showing of documentary films is one of the main attractionsof a British Council centre. They can also be shown to very good effect in schools,universities, clubs and other institutions. We consider it essential therefore thatthe allocation for films should be increased to enable the British Council to purchaseenough prints of new films to sustain their films work abroad. We do not recom-mend that the Council should have a budget for producing their own films sinceexperience has shown that suitable films of a &quot; specialist&quot; nature can usually be acquired from private sources. However, since there are certain types of filmsof a more general character which are equally useful for both British Council and information purposes we would recommend that Overseas Departments should bear in mind the CounciFs requirements when commissioning new films from theCentral Office of Information and that a Councils representative should attend the meetings of the Overseas Films Committee in order to ensure that this is done.Educational Supplies59. Since the whole emphasis of the expanded activities of the British council which we have recommended is on education we have no hesitation in recom-mending an increase in the supply of study-boxes and other educational aids,which are of particular value in the under-developed countries.Photographic Exhibitions60. These add to the attractive appearance of British Council centres and areappreciated in universities and schools especially in under-developed countries.Lecturers61. The category &quot; lecturers &quot; covers a wide range of educational and propa-ganda effort. It may include an important piece of pioneering work directed tothe encouragement of a definite activity in an area in desperate need of information or stimulus. One may cite as an example the lectures given on nurse-training and status to medical personnel in Turkey by the Matron of the Manchester RoyalInfirmary at the moment when Turkish nursing showed signs of a readiness to emerge from the pre-Nightingale phase. Lectures on the latest developments of science, including medicine, are also of the highest importance. It may includealso lectures or short courses on British novelists, poets or musicians given tocultural audiences in areas with notable cultures of their own. Of such courses,that depicted in the film of The Third Man is an irreverent but not whollyunjustified parody. As against this, as we have pointed out elsewhere, a certainamount of this sort of &quot; high-brow &quot; lecturing is necessary to attract the rightsort of people to the institutes and centres and retain their interest. Our general conclusion is therefore that what is needed is not so much a greater number oflecturers, but a more careful selection both as regards the quality of the lecturerand the suitability of his or her subject.The Arts62. We are unable to make any recommendation for an increase in theallocation for the arts; on the other hand we do not think that it can be reduced.We found that gramophone recitals of English music were a popular feature inthe programmes of British Council centres abroad; but they cannot be considered to be an essential part pf the programme of activities in the same way as books andfilms. As regards that part of the budget which is devoted to sending majorexhibitions of paintings abroad and sponsoring overseas tours by British theatricalcompanies and orchestras we recommend that as far as possible these venturesshould be financed by private capital, particularly in Western Europe, which is comparatively easy of access. On the other hand, we recognise that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment has undertaken certain obligations in connexion with major artistic
VI.-Staff64. The key to successful work by the British Council overseas, as indeed ofall the Information Services, lies in the quality of the staff. One cannot expect to keep good men if there is no security in their employment if they feel that atany moment their jobs may disappear and all their work be wasted. With oneor two exceptions we were well impressed by the standard of the staff in thoseBritish Council centres which we visited. Indeed we think that a high tribute shouldbe paid to these men and women, many of whom were obviously inspired with a real missionary zeal, who have carried on with their work so tenaciously in spiteof all the uncertainties with which they are surrounded.65. The best way of ensuring that there should be a staff of high quality is undoubtedly to establish a long-term programme for British Council work over-seas and then stick to it. This would increase the morale of the staff tremendouslyand remove the atmosphere of frustration and uncertainty in which to-day it works.66. We understand that negotiations are in progress between the treasury and the British Council to establish a permanent service for the British Council on more or less the lines of the Foreign Service. We certainly recommend that thisshould be brought about, with the reservation, however, that a certain number of posts should be reserved for non-established personnel in order to enable theCouncil, wherever desirable, to employ outside specialists on contract, such asschool-masters for teaching work or people of academic eminence whom in certaincapitals it might be desirable to employ either as Cultural Attaches or British Councilrepresentatives. .&apos; &apos;67. In particular, if good men are to be attracted, there must be a satisfactorypension scheme for permanent staff. The British Council estimate that this would cost ah additional  86,800 per year.interchanges in Europe under the Cultural Conventions which we are morallybound to fulfil.. Apart from this, we believe that it is desirable that theatricalcompanies like the Old Vic should be enabled to make occasional visits to Common-wealth countries, but we feel that what is wanted here is hot so much an increaseiii the budget of the British Council as some means of guaranteeing these companies1against possible loss. We suggest that Her Majesty&apos;s Government might explore the possibility of finding some other means of underwriting these ventures andthus avoiding the existing unrealistic method of finance whereby the Council has, to make provision within its annual budget for the gross expenditure involved bythe company without being able to take credit for any receipts which may bereceived. - - &apos; &apos;t-Students and Visitors63. We have little but praise for the excellent organisation maintained bythe British Council for looking after visitors and students from foreign countries,the Commonwealth and the Colonies and attach the highest importance to this work. Our only criticism is that at the moment there seems to be too high a proportion of visitors and students coming from Europe as compared with otherparts of the world of higher priority. However, we are assured that most of theEuropean visitors come on short courses and pay their own way and that quite anumber of European scholarships are the result of reciprocal undertakings withthe European countries. Germany, for special political reasons, accounts for alarge proportion of the European visitors. The proper remedy, therefore, appearsto be to increase the number of scholarships and bursaries for the under-developed countries of Asia and the Commonwealth and for the more distant parts of theworld such as Latin America. We have no hesitation about recommending this,The number of scholarships granted by the British Council is very small whencompared with those given by other countries. For instance, the United Statesgives about 4,000 scholarships compared with .1,200 scholarships given by theFrench and 243 scholarships and 163 short-term bursaries given by the british council. At the moment the British Council can only offer 7 scholarships eachyear for a vast country like India, 4 for Pakistan and one each for Indo-China andthe Sudan.  We believe that these are wholly inadequate.
68. The British Council complain that their staff receive allowances in theCommonwealth and the Colonies which compare unfavourably with those receivedby their staff when serving in foreign countries. They estimate that an additional 2,700 a year is required to adjust the level of allowances in the commonwealth and an additional  25,000 a year to adjust the allowances in the Colonies. Weare,, of course, not in a position to comment on these figures. We do, however,feel strongly that it will be impossible to get good men to go to the Colonies if they receive allowances which are notably inferior to those received by British Councilstaff serving elsewhere in the world. We recommend that, just as in foreigncountries the allowances of British Council staff are equated with those received bymembers of the Foreign Service, so in each Colony the allowances should be basedon those received by members of the Administrative Branch of the Colonial service in that Colony. &apos;   &apos;   -v69. Finally, we recommend that the Establishment of the British council should be expanded so as to make due provision for leave, sickness and training.The British Council estimate that 11 additional posts are required for this purposeat an additional cost of  18,200 per annum. , -     \ *VII. Financial Requirements70. The financial history of the British Council is one of steadily increasinggrants from 1934 (when the first annual grant only amounted to  5,303) to a peak of  3,500,000 in 1947-48. Since that time the general trend has been one of declineas the following figures show:  Percentage	Total	Increase or	Grants r	Decrease1947-48	  3,500,000	1948-49     ......	......      3,161,500	-9 11949-50     ......	......      3,232,000	+ 2-21950-51     ......	......      3,052,450	- 5-6 \1951-52     ......	......      2,670,000	-12-51952-53     ..;	......      2,429,000	- 9-971. Of these reductions the Foreign Office grant has borne the brunt (42 - 3 percent.), the Colonial Office grant being reduced by 16-4 per cent. As regards theCommonwealth, the British Council only commenced work in this area on anyscale in 1947-48 with an initial grant of  87,000, which had been increased to 376,450 by 1950-51 and has subsequently been reduced by 12-6 per cent, to 329,000 in 1952-53.72. At a very rough estimate we believe that our recommendations, if accepted in toto (including the various provisions for pensions, staff allowances, &amp;c), wouldhave the effect of increasing the total annual grants to the British Council by about 630,000 (see Appendix C), thus restoring the position roughly to what it was in1948-49. This figure, however, which is based on costs as they are to-day, servesno more than to give a very general indication of the scale of the total expansioncontemplated, which should not, of course, be done all at once, but should be spreadover a number of years. Indeed, what we believe is wanted for the British Councilmore than anything else is a five-year programme of development with someguarantee that the necessary funds will be provided to carry it out.73. We.discussed this problem with the Treasury, who said that they were willing to explore the possibility that at least a substantial portion of the income of the British Council should be guaranteed over a period of years. Any plan ofthis sort would, of course, have to take into account possible fluctuations in costduring the period, but we feel that above all the plan must not be too rigid, for there must be flexibility so that adjustments can be made to meet changing world conditions. A guaranteed scale of activity rather than of expenditure is what is needed, and we earnestly hope that Her Majesty&apos;s Government-will be able toprovide the necessary funds for this long-term investment.

THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATIONI. IntroductoryIn December 1932 the Empire Service of the British Broadcasting Corporationwas established with a programme output of ten hours a day. This constitutedthe first regularly scheduled short-wave service in the world. Between the endof 1932 and the end of 1937 additional high-power transmitters were brought into service and the programme output was extended-still exclusively in English to more than seventeen hours daily.2. During this same period other countries, notably Russia, France andGermany were busy experimenting with external broadcasting in foreign languages.In 1935 Japan and Italy entered this field. In the Abyssinian War and the SpanishCivil War broadcasting was used for the first time as a weapon of political warfare.Hitler also used it in the campaign against Czechoslovakia. It should be notedthat it was the totalitarian Powers which first used broadcasting as a politicalweapon and indeed it was largely because of the need to counter Axis propagandathat the British Broadcasting Corporation were asked to extend their activitiesinto the foreign field.3. Short-wave broadcasting in foreign languages was initiated by the british broadcasting Corporation at the request of the Government at the end of 1937with services in Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese. The foreign-language services to Europe began in 1938, at the time of Munich, with transmissions in French,German and Italian. Thereafter other languages were added and at the beginningof the war the British Broadcasting Corporation were operating an Empire Serviceand nine foreign language services to Europe and elsewhere besides a service in english.  Thirteen transmitters were in use of which ten were high power.4. The war brought about a tremendous expansion in the volume of inter-national broadcasting. No less than twenty-five different nations were soonengaged upon this activity. When the greater part of Europe was overrun by the nazis, the Germans took over many transmitters in the occupied countries and did their best to fill the air with their propaganda. But they did not succeed inmonopolising it. We also were well prepared for this battle in the ether, For atime the British Broadcasting Corporation became virtually the only voice of thefree world, a voice which was eagerly listened to all over the world and especiallyin occupied Europe. Additional high-power transmitters were built. The peak of the war-time operations of the Corporation was reached in 1944 when the output in nearly 50 languages amounted in aggregate to about .130 programme hoursdaily over a total of 43 short-wave transmitters.5. The British Broadcasting Corporation emerged after the war with a uniquereputation for the quality and objectivity of its programmes and with all the immense prestige derived from having been during the darkest days the voice of freedom and the prophet of victory. It was also by far the greatest national broad-casting system in the world, the output of the Corporation^ External Services inprogramme hours being more than that of any other two nations in the worldadded together.6. This favourable situation could not last. Even if Britain had not beenweakened and impoverished by her effort it is doubtful whether she would have wished to maintain a volume of broadcasting appropriate to the year of victoryand liberation. In fact, however, the British Broadcasting Corporation did not receive the first impact of budgetary stringency until the year 1947-48 when therewas a strenuous whittling down of staff and activities which led to reduced expendi-ture without actual curtailment of the services. When further. economies were called for in 1951-52 and 1952-53, and as the cost of operations steadily increased,there was no alternative but to curtail the services. During the five years between1947 and 1952 the daily programme hours of output in the External Services were reduced from about 100 to 77. Similarly, but more drastically, the short-wavetransmitter operations (excluding those diverted to building up the barrage to counter Soviet and Satellite jamming which began to make.itself felt in 1949)were reduced from about 500 transmitter hours daily to about 320.   The effect
of this has been that the amount of power behind each programme became weaker,making reception of British Broadcasting Corporation programmes far moredifficult throughout the world.7. In the same period United States and Russian external broadcasting and indeed that of most other countries steadily increased. Comparative figures ofthe programme hours broadcast weekly during the years 1945-52 by the major powers are to be found in Appendices A and B. They illustrate three tendencies:first as was almost inevitable the sharp decline in the volume of broadcastingby the British Broadcasting Corporation from its wartime peak; secondly the con-tinued predominance of the countries of the free world in the total volume ofinternational broadcasting despite the strenuous efforts of the Russians and theirSatellites; thirdly the enormous increase in the total volume of broadcasting fromcountry to country.8. The present situation in the field of international broadcasting can be summed up as follows. A great war is now being fought in the air between theWestern countries, who seek to penetrate the Iron Curtain, and the Russians andtheir Satellites who are doing everything possible by means of jamming to preventthese broadcasts from getting through. In the free world there is tremendous corn-petition between the Powers, great and small, friendly and hostile, to make theirvoices heard on the limited number of available frequencies. For the man whosits at home it is becoming more and more difficult to pick up a short-waveprogramme from another country without it being spoiled by interference. On theother hand the number of short-wave listeners is rapidly increasing, especially inthe more undeveloped countries of the world. There the air is not yet anything likeso congested as it is in Europe and a great deal even of domestic listening is doneon short-wave because of the great distances involved. This disparity between thepossibilities of effective broadcasting in Europe and those in the under-developed countries is the outstanding point of difference between the situation which existedwhen post-war broadcasting policy was formulated and that which we are now considering.II. Broadcasting as a Weapon of Propaganda9. The great reputation which the British Broadcasting Corporation earnedduring the war, and the intense struggle for wavelengths between nations great and small during the post-war years have together tended to give undue predominancein the public mind to the place of broadcasting in overseas propaganda. We haveeven found that this has led to the assumption that anything else which the Depart-ments or agencies have done in this field is of secondary importance, which is ofcourse far from being the case. Therefore while our broad conclusion is that britain as a great Power cannot do without the weapon of external broadcasting,and that this must be strong and efficient in order both to meet, present-day needs and be prepared for any future emergency, we have felt a special need for a criticalanalysis of its strength and weakness.10. In assessing the value of the External Services of the British broadcasting corporation as a weapon of national propaganda we have applied the same testwhich we have applied to all other forms of propaganda. That is to say we have examined the extent to which it is likely to advance the political or commercial interests in this country either now or in the future.11. We experienced indeed there must always be in peace-time consider -able difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of external broadcasting. Listener polls(when available) can give a fair idea in statistical terms of the size and composition of the audience; but it is extremely hard to go on from that and say whether the broadcasts have been effective in the sense of producing any political or commercialresults. The same difficulty is experienced in assessing the effectiveness of any ofthe Information Services, but not in anything like such an acute form. An Informa-tion Officer or a British Council representative confines his efforts for the most part to reaching the influential few; he has a definite target to aim at and it is possiblefor the outside observer to tell whether in fact he is hitting it. It is sometimes evenpossible to attribute a change in the editorial policy of a foreign newspaper to thework of an Information Officer and to judge whether this has been of political importance. The broadcaster has none of these advantages. His programme goesout on the air and may be picked up by anybody who wishes to listen. The listener
may be important of unimportant; he may listen to the news or the political com-mentary or he may be only interested in entertainment. We have gained theimpression that broadcasting, as a means of propaganda, is always in danger of falling between the two stools of the mass audience and the influential minority.12. The following analysis of the relative utility of external broadcasting indifferent circumstances is based on two assumptions; first that the average listenerwill, other things being equal, prefer to tune in to his own local station rather thantry to get a foreign station; secondly that the amount of listening that there willbe to foreign broadcasts will depend very largely upon the extent to which the localbroadcasting system fails to satisfy the demand of the listener for reliable worldnews. Other factors, of course, sometimes intervene, for instance, overseaslisteners may have a taste for the kind of entertainment which is provided by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation or they may be attracted by some particularprogramme. In particular, in the Commonwealth and the Colonies, with theirmany close associations with the United Kingdom there will be a tendency formany persons to appreciate not only the news but all sorts of other features inthe British Broadcasting Corporation programmes. But in most countries webelieve that it is broadly true to say that the main attraction of the british broadcasting Corporation External Services is the news and that the amount oflistening overseas will depend very largely upon the extent to which the peoplefind it necessary to go outside their own country in order to obtain reliable news.13. The desire to go to a foreign source for news may spring from variouscauses. In some countries the press and local broadcasting system are of poor quality and the news which they give is mainly confined to local affairs. In othercountries there is Government control of the news. An extreme example of this latter situation is to be found in the countries behind the Iron Curtain where peoplego to considerable risk in order to satisfy their longing for news from the outside world.14. Countries which feel themselves in danger and whose fate hangs uponthe actions of the great powers will also obviously have a strong motive forlistening in to foreign broadcasts, particularly in times of international tension.Indeed, we believe that it is true to say that the amount of listening to the british broadcasting Corporation overseas will vary greatly in accordance with the stateof international affairs. In quiet times foreign listening will tend to fall off; in atime of crisis it will tend to revive.15. The conclusion is that the popularity of the British broadcasting corporation External Services depends above all on its high reputation forobjective and honest news reporting. We believe this to be a priceless asset whichsets the British Broadcasting Corporation apart from other national broadcastingsystems. This high reputation for objectivity must be maintained at all costs andwe would deplore any attempt to use the British Broadcasting Corporation for anything in the way of direct propaganda of the more obvious kind. This is notto suggest that the British Broadcasting Corporation External Services are not infact a weapon of propaganda. The best and most effective propaganda to many countries consists of a factual presentation of the news and of British views con-cerning the news.16. Another important test of the value of the British broadcasting corporation External Services is the extent to which they are used for relaypurposes by the broadcasting systems of other countries. This can be done either bythe local station picking up direct a short-wave programme of the British Broad-casting Corporation and relaying it locally, or by means of transcriptions(recordings) of British Broadcasting Corporation programmes which can be used at any time. The former method must, of course, be employed for the relay of news or anything of a topical nature; the latter is more appropriate for talks ormusic. In both cases the British Broadcasting Corporation enjoys the great advantage that the difficulties of reception are overcome and the programme isbroadcast on the wavelength and by the station to which the domestic listener isaccustomed to listen. Thus a much wider audience is obtained than can normally be reached.17. The extent to which it is possible to persuade broadcasting systems inother countries to relay British Broadcasting Corporation programmes will depend
on a variety of factors. A close liaison is maintained by the British broadcasting corporation with Commonwealth and Colonial broadcasting systems which, for reasons explained later in this report, are usually glad to get British programmematerial for relay purposes. In other parts of the world, where local radio stations are poorly provided with news and other types of programmes, they are often glad to use British Broadcasting Corporation material. There is, however, a limit to thepossibilities of obtaining time for relays of British Broadcasting Corporation materialon most foreign stations. Many national systems feel bound to insist, for reasons of prestige, that if they use foreign programmes reciprocal facilities shall be grantedto them. But the British Broadcasting Corporation Home Service is chary of usingvery much foreign material since this may not suit British taste.18. In our view the value of external broadcasting will tend to vary fromcountry to country in accordance with the following circumstances:  (i) the extent to which the people whom one hopes to influence do not forone reason or another have access to reliable world news;(ii) the extent to which a country is exposed to danger (for instance, tothe danger of Communism), and the people look to the West forencouragement and guidance;(iii) the extent to which the local broadcasting system depends on british broadcasting Corporation programmes for relay purposes.19. It must not be overlooked that developments in television may greatlyaffect sound broadcasting. The Committee have not been able to assess what changes may occur in this matter, but recommend that it be kept under continuous review.III. Conclusions and Recommendations20. With these general considerations in mind we are now in a position toexamine one by one the External Services of the British Broadcasting corporation in order to see what is the nature of the audience in each case and how far thataudience is likely to be so responsive as to enable broadcasting to produce appreci-able political or commercial results. Our conclusions and recommendations are asfollows.The General Overseas Service in English21. The original &quot; Empire &quot; Service, now expanded into the General overseas service in English, was created in order to satisfy the desire of British communitiesoverseas to listen in to London; in essence it was an extension of the Home Serviceof the British Broadcasting Corporation to the entire British family overseas in theCommonwealth, the Colonies and in foreign countries all over the globe. It is our belief that the need for such a service has increased rather than decreased sincethe war. Commonwealth and Colonial broadcasting systems have been built upvery largely on the British Broadcasting Corporation model; indeed most of theColonial broadcasting systems were built by British Broadcasting Corporationengineers, with money provided from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund,and the programmes are run by a staff which was trained in British broadcasting corporation methods. Thus it has come about that the Colonial broadcastingsystems are modelled closely on the parent body and they depend to a very con-siderable extent on the British Broadcasting Corporation news and other featuresin order to complete their programmes.22. In the Commonwealth too, although the national broadcasting systemshave become less dependent than they were in the past, they still like to maintainclose contact with the British Broadcasting Corporation and most of them use a good deal of material for relay purposes. People, both in the commonwealth and the Colonies, have so many associations with the United Kingdom that there is:a natural desire to listen to British programmes. London is regarded not only as:the centre of the Commonwealth, but also by many as the voice of the western world as a whole. His whole education and upbringing, together with his knowledgeof English, will predispose the educated Indian or Pakistani to listen in to Londonrather than to Moscow, Paris or New York for news of the world outside his own country.
23. For these reasons we have no doubt about the importance of maintaining a world-wide, round-the-clock, broadcasting service in English as one of the essentiallinks between the United Kingdom and listeners of whatever colour, race or creedin the Commonwealth and the Colonies, together with British communities inforeign countries. This service should not really be regarded as a weapon of propaganda; rather it is a family affair a sort of world-wide Home Service. Noother great Power is faced with a similar need; and the General Overseas service would still, we believe, be needed if all other external broadcasting, whether tofriend or foe, were to become a thing of the past.24. As the result of economy and of the need to concentrate all possibleresources upon broadcasting to Russia and the Satellites the General overseas service has been cut both in time and in the range of its programme. Its twenty-four-hour continuity has been broken and there are now three hours in the day whenit is silent. The resultant need to concentrate hours of transmission into the peakhours of local listening has reduced the availability of the service and eliminatedaltogether such important transmissions as those directed to the North Africanhemisphere in the morning and the evening. The transmissions to Africa and theMiddle East have also been affected. As for the content of the service the cutshave had the effect of eliminating large-scale documentary features and a good dealof the orchestral music which in the past added to its popularity.25. The British Broadcasting Corporation estimate that to restore the GeneralOverseas Service as a twenty-four-hour service and to provide it with the sort of programmes it needs would cost an additional  60,000 a year. In view of theimportance of this service we recommend that this should be done.The European Services (excluding those to Russia and the Satellites)26. The European Services came into being at the time of Munich when war was imminent; and during the war, by providing a means of communication withthe people of the occupied countries which only broadcasting could do theyperformed an important political and military function. Between 1939 and 1945we have no doubt that the course of military and political events justified up to thehilt the policy of building up a powerful organisation for broadcasting to theEuropean countries in their own languages. By telling the truth soberly and fear-lessly when Hitler was winning victories the British Broadcasting Corporation gota reputation for reliability which was invaluable when Hitler was losing. Men andwomen were prepared to act on what the British Broadcasting Corporation told them and on no other instructions. But two things must not be forgotten. First,that exiled Governments were in London and used it as the capital of their countries;from London came the voices of de Gaulle, King Haakon, Benes, &amp;c. Secondly,that the British Broadcasting Corporation was giving the facts about a campaign of liberation.   Those advantages no longer exist.27. Why, then, retain the European Services when the original justification for them has long since disappeared? A paper submitted to our Committee, sum-marising the views of Heads of Missions on the relative utility of different forms of propaganda in their countries, said about the British Broadcasting CorporationServices in those European countries where conditions of life are now comparativelynormal (e.g., Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France, Switzerland, Italy and portugal):  &quot; All Heads of Missions agree that there are few listeners to the british broadcasting Corporation and that these few are probably evenly divided between the local language broadcasts and the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion Home Services. The reason seems to be that while the British Broad-casting Corporation enjoys the highest reputation and would be listened to inthe event of war, there is at present no particular urge to listen to the british broadcasting Corporation as national broadcasting stations meet all the needsof listeners.&quot;28. The British Broadcasting Corporation commented on this report asfollows:  &quot;There is only one reliable way of making such an estimate. It is themethod of &apos; sampling surveys,&apos; or polls which obtain the information from arepresentative quota of the population .... British Broadcasting Corpora-tion experience at home and abroad has shown that of all the methods of
attempting to measure such an audience, that of &apos; personal contact&apos; is the mostmisleading; it is a wholly casual method of little or no use. One relevantexample is, perhaps, worth giving. Polls have established that the Frenchaudience for the British Broadcasting Corporation^ French Service is up to1,000,000 (daily), but this might well mean that an individual, who attemptedunscientifically to estimate the size of that French audience, would meet 30-50French adults before he found among them one listener. In the experienceof an individual, one listener among 30-50 who did not listen is likely, psycho-logically, to seem a discouraging rarity, though a national figure of up to1,000,000 (the result of a scientifically conducted survey) is far fromdiscouraging.&quot;29.   The British Broadcasting Corporation went on to say &quot; In the last six years the results of some 60 radio polls from ten european countries have been made available to the British Broadcasting Corporation.These, of which the vast majority were not undertaken expressly for the british broadcasting Corporation, have indicated that the British broadcasting corporation^ daily audience (for language broadcasts, to West Europe) is between three and five million and that the occasional audience over a monthis between fifteen and twenty-five million.&quot;30. Here is an interesting difference of opinion between the diplomats andthe &quot; pollsters &quot; which goes to the root of our problem. The fact that Her Majesty&apos;s embassy in Paris with all its varied contacts reports little listening to the british broadcasting Corporation seems to indicate quite clearly that the British Broad-casting Corporation French Service is not listened to by the influential few inFrance who should be the primary target of our propaganda. And it is significant that it is only from Western Europe that these discouraging reports about the british broadcasting Corporation have been received from Her Majesty&apos;s Missions. Forinstance, in the same paper, the Foreign Office has this to say about listening in theMiddle East:  &quot; In practically every country the British Broadcasting Corporation trans-missions, whether in Arabic or in English, have a very considerable impact.The Arabic transmissions enjoy a high reputation and their listeners are headed by King Ibn Saud .... of the three main media the British broadcasting corporation is considered to have the greatest impact.&quot;This seems to show that when the influential few do listen Her Majesty&apos;s Missionsbecome aware of the fact and of its importance.31. We do not think, therefore, that the views of Her Majesty&apos;s representa-tives should be ignored. They indicate that, although the British broadcasting corporation may have a daily audience of one million persons in France and of between three and five million in ten Western European countries, this audienceprobably only includes a small number of people in a position to make policy ormould public opinion. We do not believe, therefore, that the British broadcasting corporation Services are, or can be, a political force in these countries in anything like the same way as they were during the war. Because of the high standards of broadcasting which are expected in Europe and the variety of languages required,they are expensive to maintain. We think that the money could be better spent on building up the Foreign Office Information Service, which we regard as the most effective means of reaching the influential few. We are, therefore of the opinionthat the peace-time value of the services in Danish, French, Italian, Dutch,Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish is not sufficient to justify their continuance.32. It would still be possible for the serious listener in these countries (say a provincial editor who wants to know the British view on some subject) to hear the British Broadcasting Corporation. In many of these countries English is thefirst foreign language in the schools and we envisage that the European Service in english should be continued. Moreover, in neighbouring European countries itis possible also to listen to the British Broadcasting Corporation Home Service.Indeed, in Norway and Holland, according to the polls, there is already a substantialaudience for the British Home Service (in Holland this is larger than the audiencefor the British Broadcasting Service in Dutch). Even in France, it is estimated bythe British Broadcasting Corporation that 1 per cent, of the French radio audiencelisten to programmes in English.
33. If this conclusion is accepted as being right in the existing political con-ditions in Europe, it is still necessary to consider whether these European services should be maintained in case of war. The British Broadcasting Corporation putforward thr.ee arguments in support of this view:  (i) that it is necessary to hold on to the frequencies; otherwise they will besnapped up by competitors and we will never get them back;(ii) that it takes a long time to build up a foreign-language service and thatthe staff should therefore be retained;(iii) that we cannot afford to lose the audience since it would be difficult toget it back if the habit of listening to the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion were to be lost.34. The question of frequencies is a highly technical one, but we hope thatthe following summary of the position is correct. Although an attempt has beenmade to allocate short-wave frequencies among the Powers by international agreement, in practice the continued possession by a country of a frequency for any given period of time is nine points of the law. If one country gives up a frequencyit will at once be appropriated by another. Therefore, the British broadcasting corporation argue, frequencies should be retained at all costs. When, however,we tried to picture what would be the situation if most of Europe were to beoverrun by an enemy we found it a little hard to follow this argument. As we see it, the enemy would try his best to extend his jamming to the entire area underoccupation. This would, however, take considerable time and the jamming wouldprobably never be complete. It seems to follow that the ability to get our broad-casts through to Europe would not depend so much on the posession of frequenciesas upon the ability to bring superior and flexible transmitter-power to bear and thusovercome the jamming.35. If in spite of these considerations Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be convinced that these frequencies must be retained for use in case of war, it doesnot follow that they can be used only for their present purpose. We therefore asked the British Broadcasting Corporation to work out a plan for the re-allocation to other services of the frequencies now in use for the French, Italian, Danish,Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish services on the assumptionthat these services were to be discontinued. The result of this study* was an esti-mate that of the 20^ short-wave transmitter hours daily involved in these services15 could be redeployed for use on other existing services and the remaining 5ishort-wave transmitter hours could be retained in use (if this was considered essential) by mounting new programmes. This redeployment would be usedmainly for strengthening the English Service to Europe and adding (although notvery effectively) to the barrage against Soviet Russia and the Satellites. Taking 200,000 as the approximate gross direct savings which would arise from the suppression of these services, the. net saving, the Corporation estimate, would be approximately  135,000 after taking into account the cost of transmitter operations in order to keep the frequencies in use ( 40,000) and the cost of the extra pro-grammes required for the same purposes ( 25,000).36. Thus it seems to us that the &quot; frequency &quot; argument for retaining these services falls to the ground. As we see it, it is for Her Majesty&apos;s Government todecide whether these frequencies would be of sufficient war-time value to make it worth while giving up for an indefinite period an additional saving in Europe ofsome  65,000. In any case, even if the frequencies are retained, a saving of 135,000 a year could still be obtained and perhaps considerably more if some means can be found of reducing the overheads.37. The other arguments put forward by the British Broadcasting corporation for retaining these services leave us unconvinced. It is no doubt true, as theBritish Broadcasting Corporation say, that to work up a good foreign-languageprogramme team takes as long as it does to work up the crew of a ship. Butsurely it is a counsel of perfection to argue from this that services should be kept in being indefinitely just in case they might be needed suddenly at some future date.They had to be improvised at short notice during the last war and we do not seewhy this cannot be done again. As for the need to retain the audience in europe in order to keep alive the habit of listening, this also seems to us to be an* The British Broadcasting Corporation explain that at other seasons and stages of the solarcycle the picture would vary to some extent.
unnecessary precaution. If Europe were to be overrun by an enemy or if there wereto be some major international crisis we do not think that there would be the slightest difficulty about building up an audience provided that our broadcastscould get through.38. While we feel that it is important not to assume that any new war will follow the course of events of 1940, we suggest that in order to be prepared shouldpart of Europe again be overrun the following precautions should be taken:  (i) an agreement among the N.A.T.O. Powers that any country which isoverrun by the enemy would take steps to destroy all transmitters andother radio equipment before they were seized;(ii) an agreed plan in N.A.T.O. whereby picked teams of broadcasting pro-gramme experts from the various European countries would be flownout if an invasion took place so that they could join and assist theallied broadcasting stations in unoccupied territories to organise pro-grammes in the languages of the occupied countries;(iii) an agreement in N.A.T.O. for the equitable sharing of frequencies amongthe allies in war-time in order to obtain the best possible use from them&quot;;(iv) the possession by the allies (especially in countries somewhat removed from the danger zone) of a sufficient number of high-power transmittersto overcome jamming in any occupied areas. This, we believe, is themost important requisite of all. In the last resort it is transmitterpower which will prevail in a radio war and the best possible war-timeprecaution is to spend money on capital development so that the british broadcasting Corporation will be in a position to put down a strongsignal whenever and wherever it may be required. Europe, after all,is not the only potential war zone.39. The evidence we heard gave us the impression that broadcasting to europe in the case of war is being regarded too much as a British responsibility.The European theatre for military purposes is under an international command and should be so regarded for the purposes of war-time broadcasting in this area.40. We recommend therefore that, since they have outlived the purpose forwhich they were originally created, the French, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian,Portuguese and Swedish Services should be discontinued. The English Service to europe should, however, be retained.41. We recommend that, for the special reasons given below, the followingforeign-language services to Europe should be retained at any rate for the timebeing:  (i) The German Service. We believe that the German Service is important in view of the great need to do everything possible to strengthen theforces of democracy in Germany, which naturally look to the Westfor encouragement and guidance in their struggle against totalitarianismof whatever colour. It should be noted and this provides perhaps themain justification for the German programme that there is probablyjust as much listening to it in Eastern Germany as there is in western germany, and that in Eastern Germany the British broadcasting corporation programme is not so far being jammed. The GermanService seems likely to play an important part in the cold war whetherGermany is unified or not.(ii) The Austrian Service. For similar reasons we think the Austrian service should be retained. It is broadcast on a different network from theGerman Service and is relayed by two of the four Austrian networks.The programmes are not heard to any large extent in Germany (exceptin Southern Bavaria) but they are widely heard, via the Vienna trans-mitters of the two Austrian networks, in the Eastern zone of austria and also in neighbouring parts of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.To this extent they also perform the important function of penetratingbehind the Iron Curtain on frequencies which are not jammed,(iii) The Yugoslav Service. The Yugoslav press and radio are still kept underthe strict control of a Communist Government. There is therefore a widespread desire to listen to foreign stations for news of the outside world and this is no longer being actively discouraged by the Yugoslav
Government. Since her split with Russia there is an intense interestin Yugoslavia in everything that goes on in the West. In these circum-stances we believe that the retention of the Yugoslav Service is fully justified.(iv) The Finnish Service. Finland is an outpost of democracy lying close tothe heart of the Soviet world. In her dangerously exposed position there is a natural desire to seek encouragement from the West. Forthis reason we think the Finnish Service should be retained.(v) The Spanish Service. So long as the Franco regime endures, with itscensorship of the Spanish press and radio, and its occasional outburstsof anti-British feeling, we think that it is useful to retain the means ofspeaking over the head of the Spanish Government to the Spanishpeople.(vi) The Turkish Service. We think that for purposes of propaganda Turkeyshould be considered to belong to the Middle East rather than Europe,and in this area, as will be seen, we attach considerable importance tobroadcasting. Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Ankara have reported that,while it is difficult to gauge the size of the audience in Turkey, theirimpression (which is shared by the authorities of the Ankara radio) isthat it is large. They say that it is certainly more popular than anyother foreign broadcasting service and that the Turkish press rely on british Broadcasting Corporation news bulletins, especially for stoppress news.(vii) The Greek Service. This is a border-line case.   When asking the british broadcasting Corporation to estimate possible savings and make a plan for the redeployment of frequencies (see paragraph 35 above) we hadincluded the Greek Service among those which should, be abandoned.On balance, however, we think that there is a a case for retaining this service for the time being. Greece is in an exposed position. her majesty&apos;s Embassy reports that the British Broadcasting corporation have retained a substantial measure of their war-time popularity withGreek listeners, and in particular that the news bulletins are acceptedby Greek listeners as being reliable and that they are much used by theprovincial press. The &quot; English by Radio&quot; programme is very successful in Greece, where there is a great demand to learn English.The Eastern European Services (to Soviet Russia and the Satellites)42. The services to Russia and to the Satellites Czechoslovakia, Hungary,Poland, Albania, Bulgaria and Roumania are of much the same nature and have much the same purpose as had the services to Germany and the occupied countriesduring the last war. Since broadcasting provides the only means of reaching thepeople in these countries they are, unlike those to Western Europe, required for thepurposes of political warfare.43. In the Satellite countries the majority of the audience can be assumed tobe friendly. The problem is how to keep hope alive without making unfoundedpromises. We are informed by the British Broadcasting Corporation that all recentarrivals from the countries concerned agree that most people who have a set capableof receiving the broadcasts from London listen to the Corporation^ programmes and pass on what they hear. The results of refugee interrogations have shown that more than three-quarters of all radio listeners from Hungary, Poland and Czecho-slovakia passing through reception centres have listened to the British broadcasting corporation.44. We are told that the Russian audience is of a different character. It isnot mainly a friendly audience but consists of members of the privileged minority technicians, officers in the Armed Forces, intellectuals, executives, high officials,&amp;c. who have a vested interest in the regime but wish nevertheless to know whatis going on in the outside world. Evidence of listening in the Soviet Union itself ishard to obtain, but a number of people, who have recently left the country, havegiven encouraging reports. It is estimated that there are some 7,000,000 to,000,000 short-wave sets in Russia. Perhaps the best indication of the extent ofRussian listening to the British Broadcasting Corporation is the fact that it isregularly attacked in the Soviet press, and on the Moscow radio, and great trouble is taken to jam the transmissions.
45. Jamming is the imposition of one broadcast on another, a hostile trans-mission which goes out at the same time and on the same wave-length as the jammedtransmissions. Russia started jamming broadcasts from the West in .1946. TheBritish Broadcasting Corporation^ Russian Service was first jammed from december 1949, the Polish Service from December 1951, the Finnish Service from january 1952, the Czech Service from February 1952, the Hungarian Service from march 1952, the Bulgarian and Roumanian Services from April 1952 and theAlbanian Service since May 1952. Thus jamming has now been extended to ailthe countries behind the Iron Curtain.46. Jamming can be overcome, or at least partially circumvented, by whatis called the &quot; barrage &quot; technique, which means that a large number of transmittersbroadcasting on different frequencies are concentrated on one target at a given time. The advantage lies with the broadcasters since jamming is only effectivewithin a small radius of the transmitter which is doing the jamming and many moretransmitters are required to blot out a programme than to broadcast it. Over a wide geographical area jamming is never likely to be anything like complete;moreover the jammers can be baffled by varying times and wave-lengths.47. In order to mount a sufficient barrage to overcome the jamming theBritish Broadcasting Corporation have had to discontinue or reduce transmissionsto other parts of the world, thus releasing the necessary transmitters andfrequencies. This has had adverse effects on their programmes to the Middle East,America, Europe and Africa.  Anti-jamming measures now cost  125,000 a year.48. We see no alternative but for the British Broadcasting Corporation tocontinue to make every effort to play their part in this propaganda battle. Butonce again we must point out that to win it is an Allied interest and not exclusivelya British concern. We understand that there is already close co-operation betweenthe British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America in this particularfield. We would like to see the area of co-operation extended to include all theN.A.T.O. Powers. As a Great Power we must certainly make our contribution;but this should be in proportion to our resources on the principle that the burdenof what is essentially an Allied operation of political warfare should be sharedequitably between the N.A.T.O. Powers.The Middle Eastern Service49. This service in Arabic was begun in 1937 in order to counter Germanand Italian propaganda in the Middle East. The original justification for it hasdisappeared; but owing to the growth of intense nationalism the Middle Eastcontinues to be a storm centre in which propaganda is needed in order to preserveBritish political and strategic interests and to protect the immense British invest 7ment in oil.50. We have already, in paragraph 30 above, quoted the collective view ofHer Majesty&apos;s representatives in the region that, of all forms of propaganda,broadcasting is probably the most effective. During our visit to the Middle EastWe received ample confirmation of this view. For instance, the Head of the middle east Office, who can judge the needs of the area as a whole, after our talk withhim, wrote to us as follows:  &quot; If I were to be asked what part of (the information) services I considerof greatest value I should unhesitatingly reply broadcasting. I do not suggestthat this is in itself sufficient, but its potentialities in the Middle East mark it out as of first priority. Even in remote sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf radiosets are now sold in their thousands. I mentioned to you a report Ihad received to the effect that in Bahrain a consignment of 75 to .100 Murphy. i battery sets is sold within two or three days of arrival, whilst Pye sets are.-. - selling at the rate of five to six thousand a year. Moreover, many sets arebeing exported to the Trucial Coast whence a large number are smuggled intoSaudi Arabia.&quot; Throughout the Middle East, and in remote places where newspapers. hardly penetrate and where there is a considerable degree of illiteracy, broad-casts are listened to with avidity, particularly Arabic transmissions that comethrough clearly.  Thus, powerful stations like Cairo, Damascus and Bagdad,
as well as certain Russian stations, gather large audiences and play a large part in moulding public opinion. In Bahrain I noticed recently that each cafehad its radio and there was considerable competition amongst them as to who should have the most strident loudspeaker.&quot; The British Broadcasting Corporation, I am glad to say, still has itsfaithful listeners. The Arabic broadcast comes through well but the service,I understand for financial reasons, is inadequate to compete with the otherstations I have mentioned. It must be improved if it is to fulfil the role we wish, and steps should be taken to have reliable local correspondents who can keep London in touch with the most up-to-date movement of opinion amongstits listeners.&quot;51. The British Broadcasting Corporation themselves, who maintain a regional representative in Cairo, have received considerable evidence of thepopularity of this service. Over the last three years an average of 132 letters aweek have been received from the Arab world. Apart from individual listeningnearly all newspapers in the area monitor the British Broadcasting Corporationnews in English or Arabic and use the service as though it were a news agency.52. The Corporation^ Middle East Service has suffered some curtailment asthe result of the need to redeploy transmitters and frequencies for use againstthe countries behind the Iron Curtain. We recommend that the position shouldbe restored by extending the service to cover the present gap from 1900 to1930 G.M.T. and thus giving a continuous run from 1700 to 2030 G.M.T. we also recommend that an Arabic transcription service should be started while theyoung broadcasting organisations which are appearing in the Middle East aresearching for material and can still develop the habit of using British broadcasting corporation transcriptions.The Services to India, Pakistan and Ceylon53. We have no doubt about the importance of the British broadcasting corporation maintaining the closest possible liaison with the national broadcastingsystems of these three Commonwealth countries. This is being done by the british broadcasting Corporation representative in the area (with headquarters in Delhi)and a satisfactory amount of British Broadcasting Corporation material is relayedlocally.54. Neither have we any doubt about the importance of the short-waveservices in English to this area. Most of the educated class speak English and thosewho do so mostly like to listen direct to London. We believe that it is important tomaintain this habit and taste both as a means of preserving Commonwealth ties andin order to keep alive the knowledge and standard of English in the Indian subrcontinent.55. Particularly popular is the English programme &quot;London Calling Asia.&quot;But the British Broadcasting Corporation inform us that the existing one editioncannot reach the entire target area at a good listening time it is too early forPakistan and too late for Japan and the Far East. We therefore support the property -posal of the British Broadcasting Corporation that it should be expanded from oneedition of 45 minutes to two editions of an hour each. This expansion is, however,contingent on the expansion of the relay station at Tebrau which is discussed in thenext section. . /&apos; 56. We are doubtful about the value of the short-wave broadcasts of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation in native languages to the Indian sub-continent.This is not because they are not listened to. A recent survey of listening in theDelhi area showed that 36 per cent, of the regular British Broadcasting Corporationlisteners listen to the service in Hindi. We doubt, however, since the pick of theeducated listeners speak English and prefer to listen to the English programme,whether it is worth extending the service so as to include this wider section of thepopulation. Is this not an attempt at mass propaganda which in fact reaches onlya less important minority?..... 57. Bearing in mind that the Indians are extremely sensitive on the subjectof language we suggest that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should consider whether these native language services should still be continued.
Far Eastern Services58. Very little listener research has been done in the Far East. such evidence as there is indicates, according to the British Broadcasting Corporation,that their audience in this area consists in the main of politicians, officials, intel-lectuals of various kinds and business and professional men in short, the sort of people whom we wish to reach. As in all under-developed areas the number of wireless sets is increasing rapidly and no doubt, as in the Middle East, the possessionof a set is regarded as a mark of social status and prosperity. For the educatedEasterner there is a strong motive to listen to Western broadcasts. Local sources of news are poor, the press is weak and the whole area is overshadowed by the threat of Communist China.59. As a result of a recent conference of British Information Officers in theFar East held in Singapore under the auspices of the Commissioner-General for south-East Asia, it was recommended to Her Majesty*s Government that thevolume of broadcasting by the British Broadcasting Corporation to this area shouldbe at least doubled, especially with a view to reaching Communist China and chinese communities in the free countries which are threatened by China.60. The effectiveness of broadcasting from London to the Far East dependsvery largely upon the ability to ensure that the transmissions reach the area reliablyand consistently. This problem cannot be solved simply by increasing the power ofthe transmitters in the United Kingdom, since the difficulty is not one of distancealone, but is largely caused by changing conditions throughout the transmissionpath between London and the Far East. In some reception areas the transmissionstend to suffer from extreme fading and distortion and may be unintelligible forlong periods.61. The British Government decided as long ago as 1939 to install a high-power short-wave transmitting station in Malaya to serve the Far East, but this project was brought to a halt by the fall of Singapore. It was, however, revivedafter the war and in 1947 the Government decided to build a station consisting oftwo 100 kw. transmitters with the idea that later two additional transmitters wouldbe installed. The site finally selected for this station was at Tebrau in Malaya.62. The first two high-power transmitters were installed, but owing to thefinancial situation the two additional high-power transmitters which had beenprojected have not been built. Meanwhile, as a measure of economy, it has been necessary to restrict the operation of the station to one shift of eight hours only.The result has been that the British Broadcasting Corporation^ Far Eastern services have never been able to develop much beyond a &quot; care and maintenance &quot; basis and their signal, even though relayed from Tebrau, is much too weak to be heardwell.63. In view of all these considerations we recommend that two additionaltransmitters should be installed forthwith in accordance with the original plan andthat a second shift should be manned at Tebrau in order (i) to give more effective coverage of the Chinese-speaking areas in the far east and South-East Asia;(ii) to rebroadcast the British Broadcasting Corporation^ Indonesian, Burmese,Thai and French Services on high-power transmitters;(iii) to give a more effective coverage in India, Pakistan and Ceylon, especially of &quot; London Calling Asia &quot; in English;(iv) to rebroadcast the British Broadcasting Corporation^ General overseas service in English simultaneously with the foreign-language services.In view of the widespread use of English by the educated in this regionwe suggest that a good and audible service in English may be at least as important as foreign-language services;(v) to rebroadcast news bulletins in the General Overseas Service to Australiaand New Zealand and thus obtain a stronger signal in these countries.64. We recommend that in this area every effort should be made to get local stations to rebroadcast British Broadcasting Corporation programmes. This should become easier if the signal strength from Tebrau is increased. We understand thata certain amount of rebroadcasting is already being done in Indo-China, indonesia and Japan and in the colonial territories.
The Latin-American Service65. This service was started in 1937, and both during and since the war itacquired a very high reputation in the Latin-American Republics. This is not hard to explain. The British commercial connexion with Latin America is of longstanding, and the people in this region value any links with Europe as a means of counter-balancing United States influence which, although inevitable, has never been popular. If it were not for the British Broadcasting Corporation very littleBritish news would reach Latin America since Reuters are not at all active there.66. The British Broadcasting Corporation has also been greatly helped bythe fact that Latin-American radio is almost completely commercial and is generallyregional in character. Thus each country has a large number of stations. Thereare over 400 Brazilian stations, Colombia has over 100 and Argentina more than50. The resources of even the bigger stations are normally limited and they aretherefore glad to make use of foreign programmes. The total number of receiversin the twenty Republics is about 10 million and is rapidly increasing.67. Over the years the British Broadcasting Corporation have managed toobtain many outlets both for the relay of &quot; live &quot; broadcasts and for the transcrip-tion service of material in Spanish and Portuguese. In 1950 over 180 local stationsrebroadcast more than .15,000 hours of &quot; live &quot; programme material. More thannine-tenths of these programmes consisted of news bulletins and commentaries on political and current affairs. In the same year over 300 Latin-American radio stations received more than 50,000 programme hours of British broadcasting corporation transcriptions and made extensive use of them.68. The cuts of 1951-52 and 1952-53, of which Latin America received the brunt, have played havoc with this service. The London staff has been reduced from 101 to 39, the programme allowance from some  1,050 to  180 weekly. Thesetwo reductions have, in their turn, caused a reduction of transmission time. the brazilian Service is now reduced from 3^ to 1J hours daily, and the Spanish from5f to With the closure also of the four British Broadcasting Corporation offices in Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and Montevideo there has been a sharp falling off in the amount of rebroadcasting of British Broadcasting Corpora-tion programmes and the transcription service, which had proved to be sosuccessful, has disappeared altogether.69. We believe these cuts to have been a grave mistake from a commercialpoint of view. To Latin Americans prestige is all-important; yet from their view-point here was the spectacle of a great trading nation which after continuing theservice for fifteen years could not afford to go on with it. Latin Americans arevery money-conscious and regard economies of this sort as a sign of weakness.70. It is not. however, too late to restore the position and we believe thatthis should be done as soon as possible both as a matter of prestige and as along-term means of helping to build up our trade which in Latin America dependsto a considerable extent upon prestige. Moreover the British broadcasting corporation, apart from &quot; projecting &quot; Britain in a general way, can again assistto some extent in direct commercial publicity by broadcasting bulletins ofcommercial, industrial and scientific news.71.   We recommend therefore (i) that the short-wave services should be restored to their original length(in this way it will be possible to arrange for the rebroadcasting ofthe news at good listening hours);(ii) that the transcription service in Spanish and Portuguese should be restored;(iii) as a measure of economy we recommend that the British broadcasting corporation offices should not be reopened, but that the strengthenedForeign Office Information Offices should act as agents for the british broadcasting Corporation for the purpose of arranging rebroadcastsof programmes and transcriptions. This system is experimental andshould be kept under review.The North American Service72 This is not a regular service; but the British Broadcasting Corporation^offices in the United States of America and Canada keep in close touch with the
North American broadcasting systems and arrange for exchanges of programmes which may be of interest on either side of the Atlantic. We have no doubt thatthese arrangements, which are not expensive, should be continued.Listener Research73. We believe that more listener research is required, especially in Asia.We recommend that a little more money should be spent on this activity.Requirements for Increased Revenue Expenditure74. In order to carry out our recommendations and to provide efficientservices the British Broadcasting Corporation estimate that additional revenue expenditure would be required as follows:  Additional revenueexpenditureper annum The General Overseas Service       .........       60,000Middle Eastern and Far Eastern Services......       20,000Additional revenue expenditure in Tebrau (when the project has been completed)       ............      140,000Latin American Service (including transcriptionservice but excluding the restoration of British Broad-casting Corporation offices) .........      ...      100,000Improvement of transmitter coverage and leasing ofrelay facilities in Europe  ...............      200,000Increase in programme allowances, travel, &amp;c     ...       50,000Listener Research      ...      .........      ... 5,000Publicity ..................       10,000Transcription Service (in English)   .........        35,000620,000Less minimum proposed saving in Europe ...      ...      135,000Net additional revenue expenditure       ...      485,00075. We are not, of course, in a position to vouch for these figures whichwill require much closer examination by Her Majesty&apos;s Government than it waspossible for us to undertake. In particular, once a long-term plan has been agreed for the British Broadcasting Corporation, whether along the lines of our recom-mendations or not, we suggest that it would be desirable for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to examine the question of adjusting the overhead expenditure (whichin broadcasting forms a high, proportion of the total) to whatever level is needed to maintain in an efficient manner the services which it is agreed will be required.The British Broadcasting Corporation tell us that very little saving in overheadcosts would be likely to result from the elimination of the services in europe which we have recommended should be discontinued. This may well be so, butif our recommendation is accepted we consider that this question of a possiblesaving in overheads requires further examination.The need for capital development76. It is clearly no use attempting to broadcast services unless sufficienttransmitter power is available to ensure that the programmes will be heard. TheBritish Broadcasting Corporation describe the present position in regard to thetechnical effectiveness of their external services in the following terms:  &quot; Though the British Broadcasting Corporation^ transmitters in the UnitedKingdom are still among the most efficient and powerful in the world andthe associated equipment such as aerial arrays, &amp;c, have, until now, beentechnically equal or superior to those used by comparable organisations, theycan no longer be considered fully effective when they are the only means of reaching the audience. The reason for this is the ever increasing congestion and chaotic conditions in the short wave bands, which have now made itdifficult, if not impossible, to provide by direct transmission a worth-whilesignal in many parts of the world.  By 1938 short wave broadcasting was in
its infancy; very few countries employed this means for external broadcasting and almost no country employed it for its domestic services. At that time theBritish Broadcasting Corporation was one of the largest users of short wavesand was able to find a reasonable number of clear channels (or wavelengths)on which to carry its services. Since that time, however, the output of inter-national short wave broadcasts had increased by more than ten times.&quot; Another development which has led to the overloading of the short wavebands has been the use of short waves for the internal or domestic servicesof many countries. In the view of the British Broadcasting Corporation thevarious international wavelength conferences held under the auspices of theInternational Telecommunications Union failed to allocate adequate wave-lengths for long-distance short wave broadcasting, and hence the british broadcasting Corporation^ external broadcasting services have suffered severely. Moreover, compliance with the last agreement signed at the extraordinary Administrative Radio Conference in Geneva in December 1951is placing the British Broadcasting Corporation^ External Services at a con-siderable disadvantage to those of non-signatory countries such as the U.S.S.R.and her satellites.&quot; Because the bands allocated to short wave broadcasting are inadequate,each wavelength is shared by several countries, often without regard to the resulting mutual interference. In order to maintain its essential services theBritish Broadcasting Corporation, in common with the U.S.S.R. and many other countries, is therefore compelled to make use of wavelengths outside thenormal broadcasting bands. The Geneva Agreement requires the british broadcasting Corporation to move these &quot; outside band &quot; transmissions intothe normal broadcasting bands, but as the U.S.S.R. did not sign this agreementthey can continue to operate in the relatively uncongested parts of the spectrumoutside the normal broadcasting bands. The British Broadcasting Corporationregards this as extremely serious, as a large proportion of its existing &quot; inband &quot; transmissions already suffer from severe interference quite apart fromdeliberate jamming. This interference is likely to become more severe as the short wave services of the backward countries are developed and the servicesof those countries which closed down as a result of the last war are brought back into service.&quot;77. As a means of overcoming the congestion in the short-wave band the major broadcasting agencies, notably the Voice of America and Moscow radio,have established a large number of medium- and short-wave stations in or neartheir target areas. Voice of America programmes are now being relayed froma number of sites in Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States zone in Germany, Tangier, Austria, Tripoli, Trieste, Manila, Salonika, Ceylon, Formosaand Honolulu. Indeed, the Americans have even built a transmitter ship whichcan move into position in order to strengthen the signal of Voice of America broad-casts wherever this may be required.78. The U.S.S.R. have taken advantage of their vast territory in Asia andtheir control of Eastern European countries to set up medium wave stations close to the borders of the free world. For example, listeners in Western Germany are reached by medium wave from three Soviet stations in Eastern Germany. Finland,Norway, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Greece,Yugoslavia and the Middle East are all served by the U.S.S.R. with medium waverebroadcasts of transmissions in local languages. The Far East is served in english and Japanese by medium wave through a chain of powerful transmitters in Siberia.In this way the Russians take full advantage of their geographical position. Forinstance, by rebroadcasting from Tashkent they can produce a signal in Delhistronger than that provided at present by any other country.79. The British Broadcasting Corporation have been left a long way behindin this new development. The only major step taken so far to provide permanentrelay facilities overseas has been the construction of the Far Eastern station atTebrau. But, as we have seen, even this station, owing to financial stringency, is limited to about one-third of its capacity in transmitter hours and to two high-powertransmitters instead of the four originally planned. In Europe relay facilities havebeen leased in Germany and Austria; and that is all.80. Assuming, then, that it is considered to be in the national interest for the external Services of the British Broadcasting Corporation to be maintained in most
parts of the world and we are unable to escape from the conclusion that this isrequired it seems to us clear that the first priority for broadcasting must be a large-scale programme of capital development designed to put the External Services ona proper technical footing. This, as we have already observed, is by far the bestmanner of ensuring that any future possible war-time need for broadcasting, in whatever part of the world may become a war zone, can be met.81. We have already discussed the British Broadcasting Corporation^proposal to install two additional transmitters in Tebrau and recommend that thisshould be carried out. The capital expenditure involved would amount to 550,000. We have not been in a position to examine closely or judge the relativemerits of the other major projects for capital development in which the british broadcasting Corporation is interested, namely (i) to install four high-power transmitters at Georgetown, British Guianaserving North and South America and the Pacific Dominions and other territories.  Estimated capital cost,  1,750,000;(ii) to install a relay station in West Africa to provide effective coverage of east Africa and locally on domestic wavelength in West Africa.Estimated capital cost,  1,000,000;(iii) to install a relay station in the Pacific to cover island and mainlandcountries of Eastern Asia generally. Estimated capital cost,  1,000,000;(iv) to install a medium wave relay station in the Middle East to providecoverage for the Arabic-speaking countries and for Israel, Turkey and greece.  Estimated capital cost,  350,000.82. If it were to be found necessary to carry out all these projects the total capital expenditure would be  4,650,000. Assuming that the cost of these projectscould be spread out over, say, ten years, about  500,000 a year, or somewhat less,would have to be provided for capital expenditure. There would also be a con-siderable increase in revenue expenditure as and- when the new relay stations came into operation.83. Beyond making the definite recommendation that the Tebrau project should be completed as soon as possible, we can do no more than suggest that these various proposals should be examined from the point of view that it is of prime importance to keep the technical installation of the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion up to modern standards of efficiency. We find it difficult to escape from theconclusion that nothing much less than a capital expenditure at the average rate of 500,000 over the next five or ten years will suffice for this purpose.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANYI. Present organisation the information organisation in Germany consists of two Departments, theInformation Services Division and the Cultural Relations Division which form partof the Office of the United Kingdom High Commissioner for Germany.2. The Information Services Division, which grew out of the Public relations and Information Services Branch of the British Control Commission, to-day per-forms the same functions as that of any Embassy Information Office although its work is on a considerably larger scale than in most other countries.3. The Cultural Relations Division of the United Kingdom High Commissiongrew out of the Education Branch of the Control Commission for Germany. It was established in 1949 when the German Federal Government was formed, and itwas decided by the Occupation authorities to abandon, all; control over Germaneducation and to remove the charge of education and cultural work from theOccupation costs budget. It is an organisation which does not exist in any other of Her Majesty&apos;s Missions abroad.4. The aim of the Cultural Relations Division is to strengthen Germancontacts with the West in the face of intense and continuing pressure from the Eastand to help the Germans to build up democratic institutions. It keeps in touch with land Ministries of Education and other educational authorities and it plans andorganises in co-operation with them visits between the United Kingdom andGermany.   It is also responsible for running 24 British Centres in Germany.5. In the United Kingdom the organisation consists of the German Informa-tion Department in the Foreign Office which lays down general policy for, and supplies the two above-mentioned Departments in Germany with services andmaterial. The Foreign Office also maintain the residential educational institutionat Steyning, Sussex, known as Wilton Park. About 360 Germans representativeof German public life each year attend the monthly and fortnightly sessions at thiscentre.6. Finally the British Council has also lately become concerned with Germanyand maintains an organisation there consisting of three small offices in Berlin,dusseldorf and Munich. The scope of its activities is limited. Its main task atpresent is to work in Germany in the fields of drama, music and fine arts; to grantscholarships and bursaries to Germans and thus enable them to study in the UnitedKingdom; and to appoint English lectors to German universities.II. The Foreign Office Plan for Germany7. The Foreign Office envisage that, whatever may be the political future ofGermany, information and educational work will be needed on an exceptionallylarge scale for some time to come. It is likely that in the near future germany will regain her status as a sovereign nation, either divided or united. The existingUnited Kingdom flight Commission will then become an Embassy and will face the following question; how is the same work to be conducted on its present scale and be made to appear similar to the activities which are normally carried out by her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in any other European country?8. The Information Services Division presents no problem. This will become the Information Department of the Embassy in exactly the same way as the BritishInformation Services in the United States form part of and are controlled by the embassy in Washington.9. The Cultural Relations Division, on the other hand, has no counterpartin any other of Her Majesty&apos;s Missions abroad. Although therefore they recognisethat the work which this Division does is quite different from that normally con-ducted by the British Council, the Foreign Office propose a gradual transfer ofthis work from the Cultural Relations Division to the British Council with the aimthat eventually, as in other European countries, the British Council would assume responsibility for all educational and cultural work conducted by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Germany.   During the transition period the Cultural Relations
Division would still remain in being as a part of the Embassy, but as time went on more and more of its activities would be transferred to the British Council and eventually it would disappear.10.   The immediate plan of the Foreign Office is as follows:  (i) six of the existing twenty-four British Centres in Germany would be closed down;(ii) the three large Centres in Hamburg, Hanover and Frankfurt would be handed over forthwith to the British Council;(iii) the Centre in Berlin (which originally it was contemplated would be trans-ferred to the British Council) would remain for the time being under the cultural Relations Division owing to the difficult political situation;(iv) fourteen of the existing British Centres should become Anglo-Germancentres and would be supported very largely by German funds.11. The approximate annual expenditure on the Foreign Office vote inGermany is  660,000 of which  205,000 is spent on information work and  455,000on the Cultural Relations Division. The British Council at the moment have agrant of  55,000 for work in Germany. The effect of the Foreign Office proposals would be to decrease the expenditure on the Cultural Relations Division by  53,000with an equivalent increase in the grant to the British Council. In other words thetotal expenditure in Germany would remain the same. Eventually, when conditionsin Germany had become more normal and the Cultural Relations Division haddisappeared it is envisaged by the Foreign Office that the British Council mighthave a grant for Germany of about  200,000 a year.III. Conclusions and Recommendations12. We have no hesitation about supporting the view of the Foreign office that for some time to come exceptional measures will have to be taken by her majesty&apos;s Government, by means of educational and information work, tostrengthen the forces of democracy in Germany and teach them to resist totali-tarianism of whatever colour. As we see it, the only hope of any lasting peace inEurope lies in ensuring that West Germany at least will be on the side of freedom.This is a prize so tremendous that it is surely worth our utmost endeavour.13. Where we differ from the Foreign Office is in regard to the method whichthey propose to adopt in order to make the work in Germany appear to be similarto that conducted in other European countries. For reasons which are explainedbelow we think that the existing organisation for information and educational work should be maintained in substantially its present form and that no part of this work should be taken over by the British Council.14. There are four main reasons why British information and educationalactivities in the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin need a special organisationand a separate policy:  (a) Germany is the main arena of the cold war, and it is there that the clashof ideas and systems between East and West is sharpest.(b) The future of Western Germany, of which the British Zone is only a part,is still unpredictable. It may become part of a united Germany; it.may remain divided from the Soviet Zone and become part of a european or Atlantic defence and economic system; it may remain fora time under some kind of outside control restricting its independence.(c) For eight years Western Germany has been under an occupation regime, amain purpose of which has been to establish and consolidate democraticways in its press, its broadcasting, its education and its administration.That work cannot suddenly be broken off short.(d) Large numbers of British troops and air squadrons are likely to be stationed in Western Germany for an indefinite period. So long as they are there,German relations with Britain will have special importance and character.&apos; 15.   Berlin is a special case within a special case.   British information activities&apos;in that city are carried on in the heart of Soviet Germany and are accessible to45030 m
Germans living under Communist rule. They have to be organised on a specialbasis and with a special relationship to the British Commandant.16. Whatever the political future of the Federal Republic or, indeed, ofGermany as a whole the struggle between democratic and totalitarian ideas will go on. More particularly if Germany should become unified the people of theWest would be exposed to the propaganda and political tactics of Communist and near-Communist parties, both in parliament and outside. The struggle of ideaswould be complicated and intensified by the inclusion of fellow travellers and Com-munists. It must be recognised too that nationalist, if not National-Socialistideas, will again become powerful.17. It is the British interest that in such confusion nuclei of liberal-minded,friendly Germans should be sustained by the presence of British people whom they trust and respect. Men and women of special qualities and experience are needed.They must know the language well, must be adequate exponents of British ideas and policy and must have special knowledge of those State and private activities inwhich Germnas wish to follow British models. Germany is in transition fromdependence and occupation to independence and partnership in European defence.Germans in public life have therefore a complex attitude towards the British: they wish to go on receiving the help and advice given in the last eight years, but ontheir own terms and with freedom to reject what is offered. In such a situationinformation and cultural work presents unique difficulties.18. During the occupation regime a good team was built up in the CulturalRelations and Information Services Divisions and we consider it most important that this should be kept together. But to retain the right people in this work it isnecessary to offer terms of service that are stable and attractive. At present anumber of officials performing useful duties in these Departments are working onmonthly contracts. We recommend that it should be made possible for contracts to be entered into with the staff for not less than three, and preferably five years;otherwise the key men and women upon whom the organisation depends willprobably be lost.19. On the assumption that means will be found to fulfil this essential condi-tion our recommendations concerning the future organisation of the BritishInformation and Cultural Services in Germany are as follows.Cultural Relations Division20. We recommend that this Division, with its existing staff should be taken over by the Embassy, when it comes into being, and placed under a CulturalAttache. In deciding that this work ought not to be taken over by the british council we have been influenced by the following considerations:  (i) For the reasons given in Annex 2 we are recommending that british council offices in Europe generally should be closed down over the next three years and the work taken over by Cultural Attaches. If thisrecommendation is accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government then theprincipal argument of the Foreign Office for the British Council taking over this work in Germany, namely, that by this means it would be madeto look normal, will no longer be valid. If there are to be CulturalAttaches all over Europe then clearly it would be more &quot; normal&quot; tohave one in Germany also. We understand that the authorities inGermany are quite happy about the existing organisation and that sofar there has been no pressure of any sort from the German side to makea change;(ii) we are not in any case very happy about the idea of the British Counciltaking over work which is so very different from what they do in otherparts of the world. Educational work in Germany is essentially politicalin aim, i.e., it is education concerning the nature of democracy designedto show how those who champion democracy must stand firm againstthe various forms of totalitarianism. While we do not doubt their ability to tackle this special type of work if given the necessary charter and if the existing staff in Germany were retained it would nevertheless be outside the normal sphere of the British Council since their workelsewhere in the world is educational in the usual sense of the word, and cultural;
(iii) in Europe generally we hope to see existing British institutes or Anglo-phil societies put upon a self-supporting basis financially. We are sure that this is the right policy for Germany also and we therefore welcome the proposal of the Foreign Office that fourteen of the existing Britishcentres should become Anglo-German centres, which will be supportedvery largely by German funds. We recommend that every effort shouldbe made to encourage Germans to take over or share the cost of suc-cessful joint enterprises both in Germany and in the United Kingdom;(iv) just as the Foreign Office envisage that, as conditions return to normal,there would be a gradual contraction of the British Council work, inGermany so too, if our recommendations were adopted, the organisa-tion maintained under the Cultural Attache would gradually be reduced.However, as we see the situation, it is probably safer to assume thatabnormal conditions are likely to prevail in Germany for perhaps tenyears and that a substantial organisation for educational work will berequired during this period.The British Council21. It follows that the work in the fields of music, art and drama, which isnow being done by the British Council should also be taken over by the CulturalAttache and the three small British Council offices in Germany closed down. Thiswould make for a much tidier organisation and might result in some economy.The British Council in the United Kingdom would, of course, continue to grantscholarships and bursaries to Germans and handle their usual type of visitor.The Information Services Division22. This Department presents no problem from the point of view of organisation since upon the change-over from the High Commission to the Embassyit would automatically become the Information Office of the Embassy. the regional Information Offices would likewise automatically become the InformationOffices of the Consuls-General who will replace the Land Commissioners.23. The Information Services Division in Germany is, of course, a muchbigger organisation than any other of our Information Offices in Europe; only inthe United States of America do we maintain an organisation (the British Informa-tion Services) of comparable size. We believe that the work of making known tothe German press British views and information will always be essential and,although its scale will doubtless diminish as our relations with Germany become more normal, it seems likely that quite a substantial organisation will still berequired. Western Germany, which has no national newspaper or broadcastingsystem, is a country where opinion is influenced from many centres. The organisa-tion of our Information Services must, therefore, conform to some degree to thefederal structure of the Republic. This means that Information Officers will haveto be retained in the Land capitals where, when the change-over takes place, theywill become part of the staff of the Consulate.24. We were generally favourably impressed by the work of the information services Division and would only make the following comments:  (i) material in German, received from the Foreign Office or specially prepared in the High Commissioners headquarters, is distributed by teleprinterto the regional offices. The teleprinter service itself has obvious admini-strative advantages, but the content of this service might be morerigorously condensed and selected;(ii) feature articles are prepared and distributed from the High Commissioner^headquarters. These seem to be good and an efficient job is being done.But in principle it is preferable that countries well able to do so should pay for the contents of their newspapers. We suggest that consideration should be given to ways of putting this activity on a commercial basis,perhaps with some subsidy from public funds. The test of good material is whether people will buy it;(iii) the staff available at the High Commissioner^ headquarters for briefingthe German journalists in Bonn should be maintained at adequatestrength. When an Embassy takes over the functions of Wahnerheideit is important that the German press should not suddenly find its access
to British informants curtailed. It is specially important that informa-tion about British and Commonwealth economic policy should beavailable since it is on matters of British business and trade that theGerman press is most often inaccurate,(iv) German journalists both in Bonn and elsewhere and some british officials appear dissatisfied with the facilities for obtaining informa-tion and explanation about the activities of British troops. We suggestthat this complaint should be examined.25. In concluding this Annex we must emphasise once again the importance which we attach to doing everything possible to strengthen the forces of democracyin Germany. Therefore, whether our recommendations are adopted or not, we feel sure that Her Majesty&apos;s Government must be prepared to maintain an organisation for information and educational work in Germany of exceptional size and of aspecial character until such time as conditions have returned to normal. Even then the maintenance of good Anglo-German relations will be of paramount importance and, as in the United States, a substantial organisation for information work will,we believe, still be required.
