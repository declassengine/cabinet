3/printed for the Cabinet.   December 1953SECRETCopy No.70C. (53) 35114th December, 1953CABINETLONG-TERM AGRICULTURAL policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture and FisheriesReview of Agricultural Production policy the present agricultural programme launched at the 1952 Annual Reviewaimed at increasing the net output of agriculture by about .12 per cent, above thelevel then achieved. This would bring it to 60 per cent, above pre-war. Thegreater part of the additional output was expected to take the form of meat pro-duced from more efficient use of grass and from the produce of an additional1 million acres of tillage.2. The appendices show how this expansion programme is proceeding. Ithas started well. In the past two years production has risen from 43 per cent, to51 per cent, above pre-war, but it now seems probable that it will not reach morethan about 57 per cent, above pre-war by 1955-56. The short-fall will be mainly incereals and in beef. In other commodities there is good prospect of reaching the objectives.3. We must now review the position of the agricultural industry in our national economy and decide what level of production should be aimed at after1956. Such a review should now be made in any event, but the downward trend in world food prices apparent in recent months makes it more urgent and increasesits significance.Financial Prospects4. The estimated gross annual value of output for 1952-53 was  1,120] million and the estimated net income to farmers was  318^ million. This income on whichtaxation is the first charge has to provide for remuneration of the farmer and his wife for their work and a return on the farmer&apos;s capital investment in his farm(as well as any reinvestment of&apos;profits for development of the farm business) but does not include income derived directly from the ownership of land.5. We have had calculations made to show what might be the burden on the taxpayer in 1955-56 and in 1959-60 of the present production policy. These havehad to be based on a number of assumptions.  These are:(a) The general level of agricultural costs per unit wages, machinery,fertilisers, &amp;c. remains as at September 1953.(b) The general level of grain prices on world markets remains as atSeptember 1953.(c) General agricultural efficiency continues to increase as in the past fewyears, at a rate of about  15-20 million a year, and in particular special attention is paid to bringing down the cost of pig production.45348b
(d) Prices realised for home agricultural products on a. free market after theend of rationing are maintained at the present level, or, in one or two cases, e.g., beef, slightly increased.(e) The retail price of ordinary liquid milk is increased sufficiently to eliminate the consumer subsidy.(/) The present rates and form of production grants would, broadly, continue.6. These assumptions are necessarily arbitrary. But the resulting calculationsbased on them give an indication of the possible size of the burden. They cannotbe a forecast of what the cost will be in practice; this will depend on many factors,including the level of world prices, which cannot be estimated.7. The result of the calculations is about  140 million in 1955-56, on an output about 57 per cent, above pre-war, falling to about  100 million in 1959-60on an output about 60 per cent, above pre-war; this assumes a net reduction ofabout  10 million a year on account of increasing efficiency. These figures includeproduction grants at a rate of about  50 million a year, which is also about thepresent level of such grants. It is not possible to give a comparable total figure for the present time because of the complication of consumer subsidies, particularly on milk, which cannot be entirely separated from the rest, but this probably liessomewhere between  150 and  200 million.8. A major factor in these calculations is the steady improvement in the productivity of the industry, which is estimated at about  15-20 million a year.It is assumed that, for those commodities where assistance is likely to be required,most of this will accrue to the benefit of the taxpayer, though it will be necessaryto allow some part to remain with the producers so as to encourage further efficiency and to maintain a net income for the industry commensurate with the output and effort for which it is being asked.9. Costs of production for some commodities will still be unfavourablecompared with those in some other parts of the world. But in making suchcomparison it must be remembered that for about two generations prior to 1939,with the exception of a short interval in the 1914-18 war, our agriculture has beenin the doldrums. During this long period profits were insufficient to financere-equipment and the prospects were not attractive to the brighter members ofthe community. Agriculture was deprived of a sufficient supply of the vitalresources of brains and capital. Although much has been made good since 1939,there is still a long way to go before the industry can compete effectively with countries like Denmark.10. This progress towards a fully efficient industry can only be continued inthe conditions of economic stability which are a main feature of the present policy.Alternative Choices11. For future, policy there is a choice between three alternatives. Theproduction objective for the country as a whole might be (i) raised, in order to increase home production still more, and further reducethe need for imported food;(ii) lowered, on the grounds that the cost to the Exchequer is too high andthat it would be better value to cut home production and increaseimports;(iii) continued on present lines with the aim of reaching 60 per cent, over pre-war level as soon as may be, and then at least maintained.Major Considerations , .12. In deciding the right course to follow there are six main factors to betaken into account.(A) The short-term effect on. our balance of payments.On the one hand, the greater the volume: of home production the less thevolume of imported food; on the other, the higher the.cost of home productioneither to the consumer or to the Treasury, the greater the impact, on the costof living and the burden of taxation, with the consequent weakening of our competitive strength in world markets where we must earn,the foreign exchangeto buy the imported food.
(B) The long-term availability of world food supplies and the long-term trend of world prices.Although there is at present a surplus of food on offer in North America,world population continues to grow at the rate of about 25 million a year. Itseems probable that the under-nourished nations of the world will eventuallyfind some means of increasing their purchasing power so that they can increase their demands on the relatively small quantities of food which are offered forsale on world markets. To this extent the long-term trend may be one oftightening supplies and rising prices. We must also take account of the probability that an increase in our demand for any particular commodity will raise the price on world markets.41&apos;. .(C) The effects on the general economy of our farms.Some commodities like milk and potatoes cannot be imported. Most ofour farms have a general economy producing several commodities. If the farmers concerned are to continue to make a fair living, a drastic reductionin profit margins on those commodities which can be imported would increasethe cost to the community of those commodities which can only be produced at home.(D) The general political obligations of the Government to maintain the guarantees of Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947.These require the maintenance of a stable and efficient agricultural industry producing food at minimum prices consistently with proper remunera-tion and living conditions for farmers and workers and an adequate return on capital invested in the industry.(E) The resources required.The most important are labour and adequate ability to ensure themaintenance and development of fixed and working capital.(F) Strategic requirements.A sound and balanced agriculture needs to be maintained as a fourth lineof defence capable of sustaining special effort in an emergency.Discussion of alternative policiesAlternative I13. A still higher production objective.--An increase of the present produc-tion objective would seem to be consistent with long-term food supply and agricultural considerations, but would increase significantly the cost to either theconsumer or the Exchequer, or both. A further increase in production could onlybe obtained by intensified production on existing cultivated areas, and by bringing into cultivation marginal land at present unproductive. These would require morelabour or more capital equipment and finance. The higher objective would inevitably involve a significant increase in prices. With the Exchequer^ supportalready running at a high level it is unlikely that this could be a benefit to thenational economy.Alternative II14. A lower production objective. We could not accept any significant reduction of the present objective because of the serious consequences this wouldhave. A change from an expanding production policy would affect our balanceof payments; would rob us of power to expand quickly in an emergency; would cause a general political reaction; and would be interpreted by the farming com-munity as a breach of the 1947 Agriculture Act. There would be insistence on maintaining the net income of the industry in accordance with the Agriculture Actobligations by increases in the guarantees for commodities not directly affectedby the change. It would be difficult to resist this but unless it were resisted thenet saving would be much reduced and there would be over-production of these commodities. Many producers, especially smallholders relying substantially onpigs and poultry, would be put out of business altogether. The whole pattern ofagricultural production would be disrupted. I think my colleagues will certainlyagree that these consequences would be totally unacceptable.45348 52
15. Continuation of present objective. We therefore conclude that we should,broadly, maintain the present objective. The fundamental reasons for this policy are as strong as ever they were. It will assure an expanding and efficient agriculture.It will enable us to maintain the stability in the industry which is essential to anycontinuing increase in efficiency. It will secure from agriculture the greatestpracticable contribution to our balance of payments and strategic problems. Itwill fulfil our political obligations. It will give us a very necessary insurance against the risks to the world&apos;s food supply, e.g., a severe drought in North america would seriously affect the prospects.16. Taking one year with another since 1945 our agricultural production atthe levels achieved has probably been an asset rather than a liability to theExchequer, in addition to making an increasing contribution to the balance ofpayments and providing essential food which could not be assured from any othersource. Over the next few years the trend of world food prices is at least as likelyto be up as down, but even if it remains stationary, home production at the present level and cost to the Exchequer would continue to be good value to the national economy provided that the annual cost was being steadily reduced by the increasing efficiency of the industry. There is a sound prospect that this will be so.17. The continuation of our broad policy will mean that we should keep tothe general objective that we have set before the country- a level of net output60 per cent, above pre-war. The way in which this can be achieved is indicatedin Appendix I. It will include as large an increase as possible in the area of tillageand the use of every possible means for expanding production of beef. But weshould not look for achievement of the 60 per cent, level by 1955-56; and while we should maintain the objective of a further increase in net output when the levelof 60 per cent, above pre-war has been achieved, we should stress that this mustbe accompanied by continued improvement in quality and efficiency.Publicity18. We do not propose any public pronouncement at present. The appro-priate time for that will be after the Annual Review next spring. It will then benecessary to restate our production policy.Recommendation19.   We seek the agreement of our colleagues that-(i) the preparations for the Annual Review should be based on the policy recommended in paragraph 17 above;(ii) future Ministerial statements should not repeat the implication in previousformulations of our policy that we expect the level of 60 per cent, above pre-war-war to be at least achieved by 1955-56.J...S.T. L. D.12th December, 1953.
APPENDIX IProgress and Prospects1. Appendix II shows in a table how this programme is proceeding for thedifferent commodities. In the following paragraphs we state in respect of each ofthe principal commodities:  (a) the progress so far made;(b) the objective which we suggest for the future.All the figures relate to the United Kingdom.Tillage crops particularly cereals2. We have checked a decline in tillage acreage and we have got an increaseof 200,000 acres. But we shall certainly fall well short of the 1 million acres forwhich we hoped. On the other hand, yields will be greater than forecast. The net result may be some 500,000 tons of grain less and some 500,000 acres of grassmore than our objective. We ought to be able to adjust our farm management andtechniques for the use of grass so as to go some way to offset the shortfall in tillage.But at the same time we must continue the measures we have adopted to get allthe grain we can. Any relaxation would mean an actual fall in tillage, a furtherstrain on our balance of payments because of the need for additional importedcereal feeding-stuffs for livestock, and a fall in net agricultural output because we should not be able to make good use of the further addition to our grassland.Beef3. Output is increasing more slowly than we had hoped. But we believewe are rearing all the suitable calves available. We are having to pay more attentionto quality and this means smaller and better bred animals. We shall use every means we can think of to expand beef production and we expect to be able to get the desired expansion two or three years later than was the original hope. We shouldalso be able to continue expansion of beef production after that.Mutton and Lamb4. Production is going well and we should get a little more than the objective by 1955-56. But there will still be grass to use; and we should tellproducers that we are anxious to see some further expansion provided that it is accompanied by reduced costs.Pigmeat5. The increase in pigs has been even faster than we expected and we arelikely to obtain in 1954-55 the volume of pigmeat originally forecast for1955-56. Production will probably then level out, but in any case we should seek to avoid further expansion of pig production until quality has been improved and our costs have been much reduced.Milk6. Milk yields and milk supplies are still increasing. To avoid substantialExchequer cost, the Milk Marketing Boards will have to keep liquid milk con-sumption as near to the present level as possible, despite any increase in price thatwould have to follow withdrawal of the present consumer subsidy, and to find themost remunerative outlets for milk for manufacture. We shall have to review theposition if they are not successful in this.Eggs7. The number of poultry is not at present increasing and on current trendswe shall not get the increased production of eggs previously forecast. This canchange quickly if prospects appear to the producers to be favourable. The markethas been less buoyant than was expected and producers fear the prospects ofunlimited imports in the future. We should say that we seek an expansion of output if this does not involve greater cost to the Exchequer or the consumer thanat present.
Potatoes8. The average is declining but output in average years should be aboutsufficient to meet demand at current price levels. Owing to variations in yield andinelasticity of demand this means that in a year of high yields there will be a surplus and in years of low yields prices will rise.Sugar Beet9.   As much sugar beet will be produced as the factories can handle.Animal Feedingstuffs10. The importance of securing better and greater use of grass and grassproducts will be even greater than originally expected. This will be particularly important for the dairy herd, so as to release cereals for sale off farms for feedingto pigs and poultry and so avoiding increased imports. It will include greaterconservation of grass for winter feeding. There is also room for less wasteful and better balanced feeding of cereals which would reduce total requirements and help towards more economical production of milk, pigs and poultry.Total Production11. On present trends we can expect to reach a net output about 57 per cent,above pre-war by 1955-56. We shall, however, be rather more dependent on theuse of grass and rather less on that of grain than originally forecast.12. We should maintain 60 per cent, above pre-war as our objective, whileadmitting that it does not now look as though we shall achieve it as soon as wehad hoped. We should obtain most of the increase above the .1955-56 level throughadditional beef production and improved crop yields. But we shall probably also need some further increase in eggs or sheep or a combination of the two.13. We think this can be done by 1959-60, but it will require a sustained effort and continued support for the agricultural industry.14. We shall then be supplying from home sources just over one-half of our total requirements, measured by value, as compared with just under one-thirdbefore the war.15. We should also maintain the objective of a further increase in net output in subsequent years, but stressing that this must depend on improvement of quality and efficiency.
