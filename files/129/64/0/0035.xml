2S9RECORD OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS AND THE PRIMEMINISTER OF INDIA, Mr. NEHRU, ON 16th NOVEMBER, 1953Here is a rough record of a two hours&apos; talk I had with Mr. Nehru this morning.He began by asking very kindly, indeed affectionately, after the Prime Minister.He then talked at length about Korea. The whole tenor of his conversationwas much more objective than usual and, I thought, very sensible. On prisoners,he said it was ridiculous to suppose that long harangues and speeches by Communistquestioners were going to make men change their mind. Most of the prisonersknew what they wanted. Only a small percentage wanted to go back. These mensaid so before any questions were put to them. The only thing these men wanted to be assured of was that, if they went back, they would not be discriminatedagainst in any way. The vast majority were determined not to go back and certainly would not be persuaded by lectures on Communism. The bulk of these would be content to be released in Korea or to go to Formosa. There would bean embarrassing small residue that did not want any of these alternatives, but would like to have a new chance in a new country. Mr. Nehru did not want toencourage this; he did not want them in India and he did not suppose anybodyelse wanted them much; and we could not have a lot a stateless people huntingafter Nansen passports.Mr. Nehru then put to me a new idea which he said had been evolved tenta-tively by General Thimayya. It would take a very long time to produce all the prisoners for the Communists to harangue and would certainly serve no useful purpose. What was wanted was an independent interview at which a prisonercould say, without fear, what he really wanted. General Thimayya had suggestedthat the remaining prisoners might be interviewed by the Commission itself, whichwould satisfy itself into what category a prisoner fell. I asked Mr. Nehru whether he had put this idea to the United Kingdom Government. He said &quot; No &quot;: that ithad only just been evolved and was rather tentative. AfterwardsT said to Pillaithat I thought it was most desirable that this idea should be put to the UnitedKingdom Government in good time before the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretaryleft for Bermuda. In any case it was very desirable to get our reactions to it.For my part, though I was out of daily touch with the problem and might not seesnags which perhaps existed, this idea seemed to me to have a lot of good sense.It would bring matters as regards the prisoners&apos; choice to a conclusion. Theconclusion would be the finding of an impartial body which was doing good workand which could be trusted to find out the prisoners&apos; real wishes. Moreover, as itwas anticipated that the vast majority would say to the Commission that nothing would induce them to go back to North Korea and China, the Americans mightwell accept it as a satisfactory solution.Mr. Nehru referred to the controversy about 90 days. He said that it seemedunreasonable, whatever the strict legal interpretation of the document, that the 90days should not start from the time when they had got down to the interrogations.He accepted fully that you could not exclude from the 90 days the time duringwhich the Communists refused to play. Unless one did that the Communists couldprolong the 90 days indefinitely. Reverting to his earlier point, I said that GeneralThimayya&apos;s suggestion seemed to me a good way out. If the Thimayya plan would bring the whole prisoner interrogation quickly to an end, no-one could reasonablyobject to its taking a fortnight or three weeks longer than the 90 days.Mr. Nehru said that he thought the Chinese certainly did not want to startfighting again. Fighting had served the purpose of helping to unify China behindMao Tse Tung. Now the Chinese wanted to concentrate on internal development.Mr. Nehru, therefore, thought that the Chinese would probably want the two committees which were just starting work to reach a solution, and that when thePolitical Conference got going, though there would be a lot of haggling and obstruc-tion, in the end the Chinese would agree to some sort of modus vivendi whichwould work.Mr. Nehru said that the United States were now much less critical of India attitude, partly because General Thimayya had done a good job, and partly becausethe Chinese had been abusing the Indians a good deal.
Although Mr. Nehru said that the role of an umpire was a thankless one, hewas always kicked and cursed by players on both sides; India would, of course,serve on the Political Conference if the other countries wanted her to. (In fact, Iam sure India wants very much to do so and would be greatly disappointed if she were not invited.)Mr. Nehru then ranged philosophically and at large over the world. This wasvery much in common form and there was nothing new. He then came back toreality and started on Pakistan.He displayed great anxiety about what was really happening over Americandefence aid for Pakistan. I said I only knew what I had read in the press reporting the dementi by the State Department to the effect that no negotiations had takenplace. Mr. Nehru said that he did not believe a word of that, that the New YorkTimes was more likely to be more well informed, and that they had written aboutthe equipment of a gallant Pakistan Army of a million men to fight communism.I said it would take an awful lot of aid to equip a million men. I would have beendisinclined anyhow to pursue this subject, and particularly in view of the fact thatI shall be in Pakistan in a few days time.Mr. Nehru then went on to talk about the Pakistan-Constitution. He is, Ithink, genuinely anxious about the adoption of the title &quot; An Islamic Republic &quot;and what it implies. He said that the Constitution and the laws made thereunderwere to be consonant with the principles of the Koran. This could only mean everynon-Muslim was put from the start in an inferior position and that minorities (andthere were 10 million Hindus) were an inferior race, and there on sufferance. I saidthat I thought there had been considerable reaction against the Mullahs, and thatthe Constitution had been redrafted in order to avoid dominance of the religiousover the secular arm. Mr. Nehru would not have this; he said that it was merely a compromise that the Mullahs would accept. I do not know where the truth lies,but I am convinced that his anxiety is not just one of his intellectual exercises, butthat he is genuinely worried about the future.We then went on to Indus waters. Mr. Nehru said that the pakistan government were very unreasonable about this. The whole of the water schemesstemmed from the work we had done in the Punjab, which was always intendedto serve both East and West Punjab; we had started with the West and a greatdeal of the Western work had been completed before the Indian Governmentstarted on the Eastern part of this project. There was ample water for everybody.The World Bank was doing a good job, and Indian engineers and Pakistan engineerswere now working with the World Bank in New York. I said it seemed to mevery important that allegations of abstraction of water should be checked at once.Mr. Nehru said that that was being done, that he had appointed an engineer to check all the levels, that the Pakistan engineers were welcome to come in and didcome in regularly, to check the levels. He gave me an example of the way inwhich the Pakistan Government misrepresented the position. In one of the reports,against certain water projects was marked the letters &quot; N.R. &quot; which meant &quot; reportnot received.&quot; Without any enquiry the Pakistan Government had construedthis into &quot;no water received.&quot; I am sure Mr. Nehru is genuinely anxious tosettle the water business.I then asked him what about Kashmir. Here he became an oyster. He saidthat progress was very slow. Mohammed Ali did not answer his letters. He had written about a number of things seven or eight weeks ago and had only just gotan answer. I asked him how he got on with Mohammed Ali; and he said: &quot; I get on with him quite well, I like him. In fact I think I get on with him a great dealbetter than he gets on with his Cabinet.&quot; I think Mr. Nehru is very :doubtfulwhether Mohammed Ali will last or, at any rate, whether he can control his cabinet.   Mr. Nehru is equally obviously playing for time.Then Mr. Nehru started on South Africa and Dr. Malan. I said that, whereasI naturally held no brief for Dr. Malan&apos;s policy, I could not interfere with hisdomestic concerns. Mr. Nehru then passed on to the Central African Federation.He said it was shocking that the Malan policy should be followed in Central Africa.I really let myself go. I asked him if he knew anything about the Federation.From what he said obviously he did not: He had said that the Africans&apos; wouldhave no part and would be down-trodden. I then told him what the federal constitution was; that Africans for the first time were getting direct representation in considerable numbers, that in addition to this thev held, through the AfricanAffairs Board, a special position and the right to have discriminatory legislationreserved   But much more than this I had found in Southern Rhodesia, from
talking to representative Africans of all kinds, that they welcome Federation, andwere determined to play their part as full members of Parliament and not just as watch-dogs.I then asked Mr. Nehru if he knew who had succeeded Sir Godfrey Huggins as prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia.. In fact he did not know that there had beena change of Prime Minister. When I told him that the Party Caucus had electedas their leader and Prime Minister a Missionary, he was obviously astounded. then said that the Party he had been talking about who followed the Malan policyin Southern Rhodesia, were the men in fighting whom&apos; Sir Godfrey Huggins andMr. Garfield Todd were staking their political life, and that the great hope notonly for Central Africa, but far beyond its border, was this new State in whichEuropeans and Africans would live together in partnership. I gave him a good many more details. I wound up by saying that men like Lord Salisbury and myselfhad a pretty good record of African administration, and we resented it deeply whensomeone like Mr. Nehru travestied what we believe to be one of the best bits ofwork we had ever done.Mr. Nehru heard me in silence throughout, and I spoke at almost as great lengthas he had spoken to me. I thought in the end he would go into one of his sulks;but we ended on the most friendly terms, and he said how greatly he was looking forward to having me to dinner to-night.P.S. Dinner was most cordial and agreeable, though dry in liquor, and thePrime Minister has sent me an inscribed copy of his book.(Signed) SWINTON.16th November, 1953.
