r &quot;7(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 317 COPY NO.  h^f13TH NOVEMBER, 1953CABINETOFF-THE-COURSE BETTINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh affairs on 6th November the Home Affairs Committee considered theconclusions of a Sub &quot;-Committee of Ministers which has examined theReport of the Royal Commission on Bettings Lotteries and Gaming(Command 8190).     The Royal Commission^ maiii recommendations were:-(i)    that cash betting off the course should be madelegal and the establishment of licensed bettingoffices permitted;(2)    that the conduct of football pools should besubmitted to licensing control and thepromotors required to publish their accounts and certain other information about theconduct of their pools;(3)   that the opportunities for betting on dog-tracksshould be further restricted and the amounts which might be retained by the operator of atotalisator at a dog-track should, in certaincircumstances, be reduced;(4)    that the whole of the existing law about gamingshould be repealed and replaced by legislationmore in accordance with modern conditions.The Sub-Committee recommended, and the Home Affairs Committee agreed,that the Commission^ recommendations under headings (2), (3) and (4)above should be accepted, with the exception of some minor recommenda-tions on football pools and the proposals for the restriction of opportunities for betting on dog-racing.2.       As regards the Commission^ proposals for dealing with theproblem of cash betting off the course, the Home Affairs Committee were generally agreed that the arguments against the continuance of the presentsituation were unanswerable, and that the proper solution is the establish-ment of licensed betting offices.    This is a highly controversial proposal which will need to be handled very carefully, and the Committee agreedthat the best course would be for the Government to discuss the difficultiesfrankly with the Opposition as a prelude to a general debate in Parliament
IS5on the Commission^ recommendations.    There would be no need for theGovernment to commit themselves on most of the recommendations.    But,if there was to be any realism in the debate, the Government spokesmanwould have to intervene to say that the present law on off-the-coursebetting was admitted to be unenforceable, a danger to the honesty of thepolice, and in need of amendment; that the only solution was the provisionof legal facilities for cash betting, subject to a strict system of control which should include registration of bookmakers engaged in this form ofbusiness; but that the Government were not committed to the RoyalCommission^ detailed recommendations on control.    This debate shouldprecede the preparation of legislation and would enable the Government to judge how far the Commission^ recommendations were likely to gain thenecessary public support to make it worth while persevering with legisla-tion.    There may be difficulty in providing Government time for a debate in the House of Commons, but it may be possible to arrange for somePrivate Member to table a Motion on one of the days for Private Members&apos;Motions, or alternatively to arrange for a debate in the House of Lords.3.        The Home Affairs Committee invited me to submit theseproposals to the Cabinet, and I accordingly seek my colleagues&apos; authorityto proceed in the manner suggested in the previous paragraph.D.M.F.Home Office, S. W.1,12TH NOVEMBER, 1953.
