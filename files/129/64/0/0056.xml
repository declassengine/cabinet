December 1953 IH                                                                      unDUNC. I   Ui riot I^MM                SECRET                                                                           Copy No. gjj IC. (53) I^-M                 17th December, 1953 ICABINET IINDIAN COMMISSIONER IN EAST AND CENTRAL AFRICA IMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and Ithe Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs IRepresentations have been received from Sir Evelyn Baring, the Governor Iof Kenya, and, in support, from Governors of other territories, that the prolonged Iand increasingly serious interference of Mr. Pant, the Indian Commissioner in IEast and Central Africa, in local politics has become a real danger to security Iand that steps should be taken for his removal as a matter of urgency. I2.   Under arrangements negotiated with the Government of India in 1948, IMr. Pant&apos;s functions are defined in Instructions issued to him, as to other Indian ICommissioners in the Colonies, and are strictly limited.   The text of the IInstructions is set out in Annex II, and we invite attention particularly to Iparagraph 5. IM^LM                        3.   The facts briefly are that over a period of years Mr. Pant has consistently Iand improperly interfered in local politics.   In December, 1952 when he passed Mthrough London he was given a friendly warning by the Minister of State for IColonial Affairs.  Earlier this year it became necessary to ask informally for the IIndian Government to arrange for the transfer of his subordinate, Mr. Rahman, Ifor particularly flagrant improper activities.   Notwithstanding this warning and Mthe removal of his subordinate, Mr. Pant has continued his activities in an Iaggravated form.  The latest and most disturbing information suggests a direct I^MMM                 link between him and the recent development of African passive resistance in BNairobi. Information also goes to show that he is actively engaged in undermining Hm^M                 the position of well-disposed leaders of the Indian community, and prompting the ?campaign against them of opponents who look for support and advice to India. HMMM                 The first of these developments, if it is allowed to continue, may lead to a campaign Hof African noh-co-operation which will prolong the end of Mau-Mau or cause an MM^-M\                 even more difficult aftermath.  The second might jeopardise the success of the Hnegotiations in which the Governor of Kenya is engaged, with some hope of success, Hfor bringing about a political settlement in Kenya acceptable to local Asian leaders. H^-M\                 It is this which introduces an element of urgency into the Governor&apos;s Hrecommendation. MMM^LM                       4.  We are satisfied from the evidence at our disposal (details of which are Hgiven by the Colonial Secretary in C. (53) 357) that Mr. Pant&apos;s continued presence H^-M                  in Kenya is a grave security danger and that he must be removed at the earliest H^-M\                  possible moment.  As to the procedure for securing his removal, the Governor of MMMMM                  Kenya has represented that it would strengthen his hand if the removal were public. MMMMM                  But there are general policy arguments in favour of effecting his removal by the MMMMM                  same means as that successfully employed to secure the removal of his subordinate ^M^MM\                  Mr. Rahman, viz., an informal suggestion that he should be transferred elsewhere. ^MMMWi:                In this connection it is relevant to mention that last February Sir R. Pillai, the ^MMMM                  Secretary-General of the Indian Department of External Affairs, told our High MM^Mm                          45379 H
I      -W&apos; f  i2 &quot;f  1 !.Commissioner, in strict confidence, that he was greatly exercised over Mr. Pant&apos;s^^^H improper activities; that Mr. Pant had been severely reprimanded: and that thereshould be no question in future of his exceeding his proper functions. It is thereforepossible that the Indian Government may accept this proposal.5. We must, however, face the possibility that Mr. Nehru may insist on ourH^HV          ?&apos;iiiL   making a formal request for Mr. Pant&apos;s removal as persona non grata and make the\- # case an occasion for one of his attacks on British colonial policy all over the world,^^^1 In anyi case, the true facts of Mr. Pant&apos;s departure are likely to be deduced by thePress and others, as they soon were in the previous case of Mr. Rahman, the DeputyCommissioner. But we really are at a parting of the ways and if wt do not fakeaction nowit will be very much more difficult to do so hereafter. Moreover, thisis the critical time from the point of view of the Colonial Office in making theirpolicy effective in Kenya and elsewhere and getting the co-operation of Indians andAfricans. While, however, we are ready to give the Government of India a chanceto transfer him quietly, it is important that he should leave without delay in orderto avoid further obstruction to the Governor&apos;s negotiations for a political settlement.In Mr. Rahman&apos;s case, the Indian Government requested a delay amounting to10 weeks, which they succeeded in extending by another 5 weeks owing to a&quot; blunder in the Ministry of External Affairs.&quot; We therefore propose that a timelimit of 14 days should be placed on Mr. Pant&apos;s departure and that we should makeit plain that, if there is any delay or difficulty, we shall declare him persona nongrata, notwithstanding the consequent publicity, and formally request his removal.6. We have considered the risks of Indian reprisals. So far as trade isconcerned we do not think these are very great. They buy where it suits them inany event, and their interest in maintaining British firms in India has been soemphatically stated that we do not think they would cut their own throats bytaking it out of British firms. There is the chance that Mr. Nehru may try to breakthe Gurkha agreement, but this would be very strong action as an agreement hasonly just been made. Recruiting is now taking place entirely inside Nepal and theonly facility in India is the transit in plain clothes. The Gurkha agreement is asource of revenue to Nepal and a breach of the agreement would not be popularthere. In these circumstances we do not think the risk very great but in any case,unless we are to accept any amount of blackmail, we must take it. There is alsoa possible risk about air ferrying arrangements, under which it is convenient foraircraft to refuel, if necessary, in Indian territory. On the other side, there is thefact that the present moment is not an unfavourable one for a demarche of thiskind, since India needs our support and is receiving it over her difficulties in Korea.7. We accordingly recommend that the instructions in Annex I should be sentto the United Kingdom High Commissioner in India. These instructions providethat he should make an informal request to the Indian Government that Mr. Pantbe transferred within 14 days and contemplate that, should the response of theIndian Government be unsatisfactory, a formal request for his immediate removalshould be made on the basis of the aide-memoire contained in them.8. The Foreign Office, who have been consulted, are in general agreementwith these proposals.SWINTON.16th December, 1953.
I IJf^&apos;   ANNEX I&apos;-^U&apos;-&apos; ?Draft Telegram to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in India IRequest of Governor of Kenya (supported by Governors of other territories) Hfor Pant&apos;s removal has now been carefully considered and United Kingdom HGovernment have decided that his continued presence at Nairobi is so grave a Hhandicap to all we are trying to accomplish in East and Central Africa that we must H^^fl                    request his immediate withdrawal.  We are anxious, however, that this should be Isecured informally with minimum publicity provided that Indian authorities, whose Iconsciences can hardly be wholly easy about Pant&apos;s activities (see your telegram I^^fl                    No. 178 of 17th February), are willing to co-operate to that end as they were in Icase of Rahman.   We are, however, prepared to face possibility that Mr. Nehru Hmay insist on public controversy and that we may be forced to make a formal Irequest.  In any case, we must insist that Pant should leave in immediate future Iand we cannot agree to his departure being delayed for several months as happened Hin case of Rahman. H2. Please, therefore, speak to Indian authorities on following lines at earliest Hconvenient opportunity. ?3. The United Kingdom Government have already had occasion to complain Hof the way in which Pant and his former assistant, Rahman, have intervened in Hlocal political affairs not only in contravention of his instructions but in a manner Hinappropriate to any diplomatic or consular representative. In the light of a Inumber of instances the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs gave Pant a friendly Hwarning in London in December 1952. Rahman&apos;s activities were so serious that Hthe Government of India had to be informed of our desire for his replacement at Hthe earliest possible moment. We had hoped that Pant would be warned by these Hevents. Our hopes have, however, been disappointed and we are satisfied that Hhe has continued flagrantly to transgress his Instructions and to intervene in local Hpolitical. activities. We have now so far lost confidence in him, and the atmosphere Hwhich he has created locally is such, that his continued presence in East and Central HAfrica can only be a source of mutual embarrassment and we must therefore ask Hfor the Government of India to arrange for his very early transfer. We trust that Hthe Government of India will be able to act at once on this informal suggestion ?and that his transfer can be arranged without pubUcity. You should, however, Hleave the Indian authorities in no doubt that if they do not swiftly respond to this Hsuggestion we shall feel obliged to make a formal request for his removal for acts Hcommitted by him contrary to the proper exercise of his functions. We expect Hmatters to be so arranged that he leaves within a period of 14 days. ?4. If, repeat if, you are asked for an example of Pant&apos;s conduct, you should Hgive the following instance as typical of a number of incidents, the cumulative Heffect of which seems to us overwhelming. Pant has organised, and in June contri- Hbuted one fifth ( 750) of the capital of, a company formed to control an African Hpolitical newspaper in Kenya. (The documentary information supporting this Hcharge was found in the house of another shareholder who has since proved to be HChairman of a Mau Mau committee and is now facing a capital charge.) You Hshould, however, avoid making any written communication at this stage. H, 5.   You should make it clear that this request, which has been under considera- Htion for some weeks, has no connection with the Government of India&apos;s Haide-memoire transmitted with your despatch No. 297 of 11th December, which His being considered separately. Hmmmn                    tji g;- piease report reactions. My immediately following telegram contains Htext of aide-memoire [appended] which, if it is necessary to instruct you to make Ha formal request, will form basis of such an approach. H
B 11I # &apos; IDraft Aide-memoire&lt;H The functions of Indian Commissioners in Colonial territories are clearly II laid down and circumscribed in instructions which were agreed between the Indian II and United Kingdom Governments in 1948.  Paragraph 5 of these instructionsreads:- &gt;&gt;{.-   ^fmy-*;;\ Si^t J^L,, 1^1I &quot;You will be guided by the principle that all the inhabitants of British I HI East Africa owe their first duty to the duly constituted Colonial Governments II which in turn are responsible to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United II Kingdom. You will not, therefore, intervene in local political matters. These II fall to be dealt with under the normal constitutional machinery of the ColonialGovernment.&quot;2. The United Kingdom Government have already had to complain of theway in which the Indian Commissioner in East Africa, Mr. Pant, and his assistant,Mr. Rahman, have transgressed these instructions. The Minister of State forColonial Affairs gave a friendly warning-to Mr. Pant in London in December, 1952,on his way back to Kenya from the United Nations, that he had left himself opento criticism in some of his actions and made it clear to him that the United KingdomGovernment hoped that he would in future observe more closely the terms of hisinstructions. Mr. Rahman&apos;s improper activities were even more serious. It wasmade clear to the Indian Government earlier this year that the United KingdomGovernment could no longer regard him as persona grata and hoped that the IndianGovernment would arrange for his replacement at the earliest possible moment.The Indian Government agreed that in the circumstances he would have to beremoved and undertook to arrange for his transfer to another post at an earlydate, thus obviating the necessity for a formal request on the part of the UnitedKingdom for his withdrawal. In the event, Mr. Rahman left Kenya oh transferfifteen weeks later, in the first week of July.3. Mr. Pant was, of course, responsible for his subordinate, as well as forhis own activities. It was however hoped that the warning which had beenadministered to him by the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs would serve toensure that in future he did not exceed his proper functions. Unfprtunately thishope has not been fulfilled and since then Mr. Pant has continued&quot; his interventionin local political matters. The following are examples of such actions on hispart:- ???&apos;r.&apos;ffCl*(a) He has organised, and contributed  750 (representing one-fifth of thecapital) to the financing of, a Company formed to control an Africanpolitical newspaper in Kenya. The documentary information support-ing this charge was found in the house of another shareholder who hassince proved to be the Chairman of a Mau-Mau committee and is nowfacing a capital charge.? (b) He has addressed Indian residents in Nyasaland, advising them, to oppose II and resist Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy of Federation, and II promising that India would take the question of,,Federation to the.United Nations.I (c) He has addressed a further meeting of Indian residents in Nyasalandadvocating the re-distribution of land.H (c/) He has made political speeches at public gatherings in Tanganyika whichopenly avowed the intention of the Government of India to interfere inI African politics and criticised the Tanganyika Government.4. Any one of these incidents would in itself be sufficient to justify theUnited Kingdom Government in requiring Mr. Pant&apos;s withdrawal from his postof Indian Commissioner at Nairobi. Their cumulative effect, taken in conjunction,with the previous activities of Mr. Pant and his subordinate, and of the warningalready given to Mr. Pant himself, is overwhelming.  In these circumstances theI United Kingdom Government have no alternative but to declare Mr. Pant personanon grata and to request his immediate removal.
I . IANNEX II^-W Instructions for the Commissioner for the Government of India in -mm^-W British East Africa*^-M You will be the representative of the Government of India in the territories^^Hf of British East Africa. Your title will be a Commissioner for the Government of^-^L\ India in British East Africa.^-M 2.  Your functions will be:-^-M (a) to discharge on behalf of the Government of India duties analogous to^-W those of a consular representative in a foreign country, e.g., assistance1 in commercial matters and the issue and renewal of passports to^-M individual Indians of the categories referred to in paragraph 3 and the^-M granting of visas for the purpose of travelling to India;(6) to promote friendly relations between India and the Governments of the^-W British East African territories and, to that end, to explain to those^-U Governments whenever necessary the point of view of Indians in the^-M categories referred to in paragraph 3 in matters within the scope of m^M^-^L\ your functions; ^-M^-W (c) to look after the commercial interests of India in the territories of British^^fl East Africa^-^k (d) to keep the Government of India promptly and regularly informed of the ^-m^-W policies and actions of the Governments of those territories.^-^L\ 3.  The Indians for whom you will act under paragraph 2 (a) and (b) above^-^L\ will be those who are in British East Africa otherwise than for the purpose of^-^k permanent residence; you will not be the spokesman of Indians permanentlyresident in British East Africa.^-^L\ 4.  You should take the greatest care to see that no tendencies are fostered^-^L\ among Indians resident in British East Africa separating them from those5.  You will be guided by the principle that all the inhabitants of BritishEast Africa owe their first duty to the duly constituted Colonial Government,which in turn are responsible to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.You will not therefore intervene in local political matters. These fall to be dealt^-^L\ with under the normal constitutional machinery of the Colonial Government.^-^L\ 6.  There will be no direct negotiations between the Governments of theseterritories and the Government of India on any major questions of policy nor willany representation be ordinarily made by the Government of India direct to theGovernments of these territories. It will be in order, however, for you to discuss^-^L\ routine administrative problems, in matters within the scope of your functions,^-^L\ with the authorities concerned, provided that where such matters involve questions^-^L\ of policy, you will not make any representation to the Governments of these^-^L\ territories unless you have first referred them to the Government of India for^-^k instructions.^-^L\ 7.  On all important matters involving questions of policy the Government ofIndia will continue to communicate direct with His Majesty&apos;s Government, butwhen in matters not involving policy the Government of India find it necessary toaddress the Governments of East Africa, you will ordinarily be the channel ofcommunications between the Government of India and the Governments of EastAfrica.* Identical instructions apply as regards the Commissioner&apos;s position in the Central Africanterritories.
