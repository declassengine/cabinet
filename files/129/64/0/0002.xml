secret.(53) 30229TH OCTOBER, 1953CABINETDECONTROL OF MEAT AND BACON ANDFUTURE MARKETING ARRANGEMENTSDraft Mem orandumAt their meeting on 27th October the Cabinet agreed that policy-proposals for the future marketing of meat and bacon should be worked out on the general lines of the plan recommended by the Minister of food in C. (53) 298;  and invited Ministers to consider what additions and adjust-ments could be made to that plan to make it more acceptable to the farmers, and how such proposals could best be presented to the farmers&apos;representatives and to Government supporters (C.C. (53) 6lst Conclusions,Minute 4).2.        The essence of the plan is that we abandon central purchase offatstock by the Ministry in favour of a free market, and that we replace the present system of guaranteed prices payable to individual producerswith a deficiency payments scheme supplemented by a &quot;buttress&quot; pricearrangement.    Such a plan could successfully be presented to producers(and Government supporters), and the confidence of the industry could beretained, only if it could be shown that the plan would meet the reasonableneeds of producers, both as a whole and as individuals, and if it were accompanied by some demonstration of Government support for farmers in connection with other commodities.Meat3.        We start from the premise that, in accordance with its generalpolicy, the Government must give up State trading in meat next summer,because there will then be adequate supplies and becauss there is a firmpublic expectation that rationing and allocation will then end.    Some other arrangements for marketing and for implementing the price guaranteesmust therefore be established by next summer,4.       So far as marketing is concerned the only practicable coursewithin the time available is to restore private trading in livestock and meat.    This must in any case be done if we are to fulfil the pledges given to the meat trades.    Producers waald then sell their livestockeither at auctions or through other channels of trade (on a live or dead&quot;weight basis) for what it would fetch.5.       As to price guarantees, in the absence of a system of centralpurchase, the assurances to farmers contained in the 1947 agriculture act could best be implemented by a system of deficiency payments,supplemented by a &quot;buttress&quot; price arrangement.    This would work inthe following way.    The guarantee to farmers would be expressed ina dual form, whereby a standard price and a buttress price would be
fixed at the Annual Review.    All sales by producers in the free market would be certified, and from these an average price could be worked out.The difference between the average and the standard price would then become the unit deficiency payment, which would be payable (at the same rate) to all producers according to the amount which each had sold.    but where, through any mischance or mal practice in the market, a producerhad sold below the buttress price, he would in addition to receiving a deficiency payment, also receive such an amount as would bring his return from that sale up to the level of the buttress price,6,        Individual producers  would therefore not all receive the samereturn for their produce.    The system would provide extra rewards for efficient production and good marketing, but at the same time it would ensure a minimum return to each producer on every transaction,7,        There is general agreement that a deficiency payments system would by itself fulfil the legal obligations in the Agriculture Act to providea guaranteed return to farmers, and undoubtedly: such.a system wouldprovide a guaranteed return to fatstock producers as a whole.    Althoughthe additional assurance of the buttress price is not legally governed bythe minimum price which is fixed (in. the Annual Review every alternateyear) for two years ahead, it would no doubt be necessary in the first twoyears of the scheme to fix the buttress prices no lower than the minimum prices which have already been laid down for the next two years and whichwere determined in a fixed price system.Presentation of the Governmenfs decisions8.        Decisions on future marketing and price arrangements for meaton the basis mentioned above could best be presented to the farmers, andto Government supporters, as part of the wider proposals which the Govern-ment can now put to farmers1 representatives in accordance with arrange-ments already in operation or developments which have already been offered or can now be given.    The desires of the farmers&apos; representatives in connection with the marketing of bacon-pigs, wool, potatoes and milk and milk products can now be met to a very substantial extent.    the presentation of the Governments case should therefore be as set out inthe following paragraphs.9. The Governments intention to give up State trading in meat shouldbe presented as a firm decision, necessitating the introduction of some new arrangements for marketing and for implementing the price guarantees.10.       The Government are in any case pledged to the meat trades toallow a return to private trade as soon as possible,&apos;11,       Both in fulfilment of that pledge, and because there is no practicable alternative in the time available, private trading in livestockand meat must be restored,12.       With private trading, the price guarantees to farmers can best be implemented by a system of deficiency payments, combined with abuttress price arrangement.    This would, of course, mean that althoughthe free market in livestock and meat was being restored, there wouldbe a large measure of protection for producers, both collectively andindividually.13.       It should be made clear that these marketing arrangements, andthe deficiency payments and buttress price system, were temporary and open to modification in the light of experience.    Long-term marketing
arrangements, not only for meat but also for other commodities, are opento further consideration by all the interests concerned, but meanwhileprivate trading and the deficiency payments and buttress price systemmust replace State trading in meat,14.       We should then say that the Government recognise that the pre-warfatstock auction system was unsatisjEactory in many ways.    It Would there-fore be very desirable for representatives of the producers (and possiblyother interested parties) to co-operate with the Government Departmentsconcerned in finding means of improving the marketing system, and to begin consultations to this end immediately.    The Government would themselves have certain suggestions to make,15,       Farmers1 representatives should also be assured that theGovernment continued to support the establishment of producer marketing boards in appropriate cases.    The question of the scope of the functionsof such Boards would clearly raise difficulties in the case of some commodities.    In particular, it would be essential to show that a board with compulsory powers of monopoly trading could be reconciled with thefree exercise of consumer choice.    There would also, in some cases, bedifficult problems of finance, including the provision of adequateincentives to safeguard public funds,16.       Nevertheless, the farmers&apos; representatives could be told thatin the case of meat the Government would be prepared to give every facility for the early establishment of a Board which would:-(a) develop the voluntary marketing of fatstock either ona live-weight or on a grade and dead-weightbasis; and(b) operate as a compulsory marketing board in thecase of pigs sold for bacon-curing, negotiatingterms of contract with the bacon-curers.It should be made clear to producers that it will be open to them to putforward proposals for a Marketing Board or Boards with wider functions in this field, which would have to be considered in the light of any difficulties of the sort mentioned in the preceding paragraph which theproposals might raise,17,       The marketing of wool is at present carried out by a producers&apos;&quot;Marketing Board with financial and trading powers, and this will continue.The financial arrangements will in the ordinary course come up   for review in 1955,18,       We can agree to the re-establishment of a Potato Marketing board with certain trading and regulating functions and in particular responsibilityfor the disposal of potatoes bought at the support price.    The government proposals in this connection have already been put to the National Farmers&apos;Unions.19.      One of the main aims of the farmers&apos; representatives is therestoration of the full trading powers of the Milk Marketing Boards overliquid milk and milk products.    The difficulty here is the consumer subsidy;as long as the Government is paying out large sums in order, to keep down
the retaij, price of liquid milk it must also control that price to ensure thatthe benefit is passed to the consumer.    &quot;With decontrol that difficultywill not arise in the case of milk products.20.      We can however now agree that subject to the following safeguards,the Milk Marketing Boards can begin to operate over the whole field,including liquid milk, in 1954.    So long as an element of consumer subsidyremains, the level of retail prices will have to be subject to Ministerialapproval, together, for the time being, with internal distributive margins.It may also be necessary to consider the effectiveness of the arrangements under the Marketing Acts for the settlement of disputes between thevarious interests.    The Boards can be entrusted with the operation ofthe Welfare Milk Scheme.    The clean milk policy will be maintained.Time-table21,       The question of   agricultural policy will occupy a prominent placein the Debate on the Address and it is highly desirable to make the Govern-ment&apos;s intentions clear before then.    The fatstock proposals should bethe subject of a White Paper,    As soon as possible, we should explainour decisions to Government supporters.    The farmers1 representatives and the trade interests concerned will have to be told of the governments proposals immediately before publication of the White Paper.29TH OCTOBER, 1953
