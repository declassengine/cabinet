confidential.(53) 32218TH NOVEMBER,   1953CABINET&quot;SMOG&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local GovernmentToday everybody expects the Government to solve everyproblem.    It is a symptom of the Welfare State.2. Governments are judged by their apparent ability to takethe initiative in matters like &quot;smog&quot;.3, For some reason or another^ &quot;smog&quot; has captured the imaginationof the press and the people.    All yesterday my Public Relations Officer wasrung up with this question, &quot;What is the Government going to do aboutthe &quot;smog&quot; ?4. Ridiculous as it appears at first sight, I would suggest that weform a Committee.    Committees are the oriflamme of democracy,5, Since he commands universal confidence, I suggest theHome Secretary should be the Chairman of a Ministerial Committee,and that there should also be a Committee of officials.    I am told there isalready a &quot;Working Party&quot;,    Working Parties appear to bear the samerelation to Committees as Warrant Officers to Officers.    So theWorking Party should be promoted.6, There are some short-term things which we have done, and can do.    We can gain popularity by doing them well - the masks, the warningsignals, etc,7, There are some longer-term solutions, which we might study and to some extent apply - the better stoves, the smokeless coal and,possibly, some smokeless zones.S, I suggest that the Minister of Health and the Minister of Fuel and power should in addition to myself be members of the Committee, togetherwith a Scottish representative.    Since money is bound to come into it,could be have the Financial Secretary?    The Air Ministry (meteorological office) and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research should berepresented on the official Committee.9, We cannot do very much, but we can seem to be very busy - andthat is half the battle nowadays.10, The Beaver report will be published next week.    So we mustAct at once,H.M.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.1,1STK NOVEMBER? 1953,COPY NO.    0
