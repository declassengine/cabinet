DISORDER IN RURAL AREAS

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department

INTRODUCTION

The recent disorders//fn)nural areas have to be seen against the general

profile of crime in Vjr ^c^)untry.   Recorded crime figures per 100,000

population in the metr^fraYj^an forces are about double those for

non-metropolitan forces^^weyer, the figures for the first quarter of

1988 and those for 1987 d^tt^Mi that the trend in metropolitan areas is

slightly downward (down 1 peV^e*t}t year on year).    The figures for non-

metropolitan areas continue ^errp&amp;e (3 per cent up year on year). The

national rise is substantialr^fciwwjhr than in most recent years. So

broadly speaking crime in the a^C*es&gt;is much higher than elsewhere, but

falling:    in the Shires lower, 0^t/$ ta.ll rising.    Within these totals

crime against property in the metrogp^Ktan areas, in particular

burglaries, has fallen, but has coaHnu a. to rise elsewhere. Violent

offences (5 per cent of the total) c&lt;5*t&apos;ijpue to rise everywhere. Offences

of violence in county and rural force a^^a^totalled 83,000 last year,

half as much again as in 1980.   There wS^C/^similar increase in

metropolitan areas.    Care must be taken MJA* ?ng these figures because

they are liable to fluctuate and cover onJ^recorded crime; but they give

a sketch. ^

POLICE

2.      Our first line of defence against crime and\aisdt4er is the police.

We made it a priority in 1979 to increase their strjyfgtSn from the low

levels we had inherited.    The result is a police ses^i^^f 124,182 - some

12,600 stronger.    They have also grown more efficient&lt;pwAptro&amp;ucing value

for money concepts and new technology, and streamlining/w^JJ&amp;dures. Extra

civilian posts have released many more officers for oper^fc&apos;&amp;rcal duties -

3,300 over the last 5 years.    It is no longer easy to recruv x he

civilians needed in London and the South East.    They cost fra-traa much as

police officers.


INNER CITIES

&gt;

23.      Much of the extra police resources has gone to the seven metropolitan

/Mrces.     Their strength has increased by 7,781 since 1979, with 2,687 new

_-j^?&quot;ts approved.    The riots of 1981 and 1985 were vivid proof that this was

&gt;^KtCrA the manpower was needed most.    This is where the greatest problems

^ror^tfte police - and the most serious for society - remain.    High levels

ov-syc^e^t crime - particularly drug-related - against a background of high

ten^on\hean that another Tottenham-style riot would surprise no one. I

have a^uved colleagues separately on this.

MARKET T-grflfij^AND RURAL AREAS

4.      The mkafa have turned their attention to the Shires.    There is

nothing newVin market town disorders.    Drunken mob violence goes back

centuries; teddy boys in the &apos;50s, mods and rockers in the &apos;60s, punks and

skinheads in the &apos;70s inherited a long tradition.    But I am concerned that

the problem is geJ^Sftz worse.    The violence over New Year 1987 and Spring

Bank Holiday 1987uwasvan indication of a trend of disorder spreading to

the suburbs and SnTr^r~vas I pointed out in my note of July 1987 to the

Prime Minister and lumbers of the Ministerial Steering Committee on

Economic Strategy Sub=J^aMittee on Urban Policy about public order in the

inner cities.   As a resyTK^i set up a working group of officials and the

Association of Chief Por^je^H^ficers (ACPO) to examine how best the police

could tackle the problem.   Y^frtach at Annex A a summary of the main

points of the ACPO report &lt;fjm&amp;x\kd by the Chief Constable of Surrey. The

police certainly regard the w^oVVem as an increasing burden on them.    I am

commissioning urgent research^Jfpdvthe matter.   This will involve a field

study of four towns (to be deckfl^o^rh consultation with ACPO), their

demographic background, the reley *Cfc^aJ.cohol and licensing statistics and

a survey of young males between 18/a6ravSO.   We shall have the results by

the end of the year.

WHO ARE THE TROUBLE MAKERS?    WHY DO Trf&amp;dBfr IT?

5.      I see similarities between the rurai&gt;^*oter and the football

hooligan.    Many of the 16-25 year olds involved in these disturbances have

a latent capacity for violence.    Toughness is a proof of manhood. Drink

removes their inhibitions and pushes them over the edge.    There are few

internal disciplines or external restraints to raijr^them back. Their

parents are at home in front of the TV and theii//upb\)inging and education

have failed to give them self-discipline, a sensfe^if^Sbcial responsibility

or much in the way of interest except having a gocniftJ^M:.    They are well

paid for their age and have no financial commitmentVr--^JUYey spend their

wages in clubs and pubs increasingly designed for t\ie&amp;/p&amp;ly affluent age

group.    They have the means to drink too much and ther&amp;^rer^few older

people around to tell them when they have had enough.    Tliejp&amp;ght amongst

each other.    When the police arrive, both sides gang up an^J/J^WR on them.

In the inner cities, police win by quick intervention with^arBe numbers.

But in rural forces the police are dispersed and cannot conce  r*^e

quickly and effectively.    Police arriving in ones and twos be Mi&gt;&amp;jpa

attractive target.


.LINES OF REMEDY

^ff^nalties and Deterrents

vThe penalties are already tough.    The range of public order and other

&lt;rei^v4nt offences (set out in Annex B) is comprehensive.    We have created

tfe/a&amp;w offence of disorderly conduct to deal with hooliganism.    But quick

prosyfeejvt&amp;ons and, where necessary, exemplary sentences, would act as a

deteVrej  \ The police at Lincoln feel they have; 58 convictions and a

total&lt; rJ&lt; 8 years imprisonment followed the Lincoln disorder.    There is a

case fo&lt;x berpolice and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to concert in

quick prosSZitions for those arrested.   We shall be following this up.

But such vq^irnce is in any case a calculated defiance of the rule of law.

The prospec\\of getting caught is the real deterrent.    We expect the

strength of CTie non-metropolitan forces to reach 66,990 by 1988/89 (at a

cost of  1,622.4 million) and under the present programme with the same

share of extra post&gt; as this year, to reach 67,347 by the end of 1989/90

(at a cost of  1, T/yoTjjroillion).    In the last round of manpower increases,

the police outside^feop4on asked for 2,239 extra posts.    We were able to

give them 500.    We had tra turn down 967 new posts for non-metropolitan

forces. There is strott^^K^satisfaction among rural chief officers, shared

by our own supporters, C^^p^e could not give them more.    The ACPO report

reflects this.    I have p^jj^o&amp;pre colleagues proposals for future

expansion, still substant^ai^ypJess than those claimed by the police.

7.     Police manpower is cosCT^T)It cost  2-2,500 a week to station one

police officer permanently invtfli^jHace.    It would be wrong to pour

additional resources indiscrimimfrelV into rural forces.    But a

combination of police operationa^j/jiflctical and managerial improvements

bolstered by some additional manpow^^Sould make a difference. The

working group referred to in paragi( ptiA^has identified specific ways in

which police handling of rural disor^ftijyld be made more effective:

1. better information and intelKg^&amp;e gathering and dissemination

arrangements on individuals involved^//^

2. training in tactics of first resovt before reinforcements

arrive;

3. sharpening up and testing of mobilisatyfe-^ijhd contingency plans;

and ^3/^\

4. better follow-up procedures including eviAane^ftathering on

those not arrested at scene. &lt;s/lL/&gt;

I regard this last point as particularly important.    The^ ^^t football

hooligan trials failed through inconsistencies in evidence./v^have

discussed this with the Commissioner and he has called for M^/rfngent

report.    He is all the more determined to act decisively agaN^tts^^fee

hooligans, press on with infiltration of their gangs, gather gcr^O^jality

evidence and construct watertight cases.    The group will also c\bmms-jrtl a


number of measures designed to prevent and pre-empt disorder.    Some of

v*. their recommendations require a better use of existing resources; others

&apos;spall for more manpower.

X^P^ployment of Police

^flCv^Jkral chief officers have to balance a number of competing and

cofo^Sjflicting demands on their available manpower.    The public press for

raore/  f&lt;tcers on the beat.    To provide a visible police presence across

the ror&gt;e^^operational strength must be spread thinly over a wide area.

At the^Tajngptime, the public expect a rapid response to outbreaks of

disorde &lt;^Jlfr.s requires a quick concentration of manpower.    Planning for

a quick r$&amp;gonpe at known trouble spots cuts back cover in other areas;

Taunton mai&amp;J/ffo with fewer police so that any disorder in St Paul&apos;s,

Bristol canNbe checked rapidly.    Tilting the balance of priorities even

further towards a quicker, stronger response to disorder would mean in

effect reducing capacity to prevent and detect crime.    Overtime can fill

holes in ground cover-swhen it is operationally essential.    But budgets are

tight and changes hm conditions of service over the years have reduced

chief officers&apos; flsScibiXisty in using overtime.    One more officer on duty

at night usually means oii less on patrol during the day.

9.     Where disorder is ^m&amp;yH&amp;table, chief officers can get any additional

help they need through myjrfykr\id  , nine forces were involved in this

year&apos;s Stonehenge operation/^fciWtual aid works smoothly and well. Better

information gathering (parag *w ?) can help the police to anticipate

disorder.    But spontaneous dj^rordUr has always presented problems of

response in rural forces.    Onry-^x ^aordinary increases in manpower would

enable county and rural forces ^N^ajpkle outbreaks of disorder as

effectively as the inner city for^M/with their greater operational

strength and smaller territorial areft^^A &quot;rural riot squad&quot; is not the

answer.   They would spend their time*^h ^ig from one end of the county to

another and, with incidents peaking qvfck^&gt;, would arrive too late to be

effective.   The sharpening and better by forces of their

contingency plans (including arrangemenfsN^oT auick mutual aid) which the

working group will recommend is a positiv^A^ep, particularly if we are

able to back it up with modest manpower increases.    But securing a better

police response is only part of the answer.vWider social issues are

involved.

Alcohol

10.    Alcohol featured in 90 per cent of the incidents^:dwered by the

recent ACPO survey on rural disorder; contributed a Vte ^ra^83 per cent;

and 70 per cent of those arrested had been drinking.    CnsVa^are formidable

figures.    Drink is now much more affordable.    The price ^1/feeAr, cider and

spirits has not kept pace with the growth in disposable mtfo^e^ The

advertising of drink is pitched aggressively at the young ma^5^&amp;th a

strong emphasis on its macho image.    While this year&apos;s budge^xlfiade a

start, the tax structure does not provide much incentive to oS^Jm^Ndw-

alcohol beers rather than strong, or give the brewers enough inw^tiwe to

manufacture and push them.    Many of the aspects which John Waken^m^/

Ministerial Group on Alcohol Misuse is looking at - advertising coaV/^^f


practice;  reviews of the way alcohol is portrayed on TV; and health

L education - are important contributions.    So is encouraging local inter-

?^agency co-operation on alcohol misuse.    We have legislated to make it

&quot;Jjksier for the police to prosecute publicans who sell to under-age

11 C/lJuVsmore is needed.    Chief officers confirm that removal of a licence

from^rar*prderly pub has an immediate effect on all pubs in the area.

They f^V^that licensing justices do not take police objections about bad

pubs arf3^2nd lords sufficiently into account.    We shall emphasise this in

new guidai&gt; e/to go out shortly.   The police need to adopt a more

consisten^and aggressive national policy on objecting to licences on

these grourms.    We have this in hand as well.    This will provide the

incentive needed to get the brewers, managers and tenants alongside to

co-operate with theoolice in the &quot;Pubwatch&quot; and other schemes which have

already shown somp^syccess in sorting out the difficult pubs and banning

troublemakers. V-v3^ N

CONCLUSION

12.    This paper concenwTH  \on the way in which the criminal justice

system reaches the probl&lt; nr^vJiich of what we are doing at present, eg the

Criminal Justice Bill, is re^Jjrant.    The following are specific measures

which I intend:

1. tough new guidance frfv^^Tiyensing justices and the police on

licensing of pubs and club^w axagraph 11);

2. discussion with justice^fl^rks and the CPS on quick

prosecutions following inc iden^^oK^lisorder (paragraph 6);

3. encouraging chief officers o^xTrtV into effect the working

group&apos;s recommendations on tacklingV/u^Sl disorder (paragraph 7);

4. urgent research (paragraph 4). v

13.    These concentrate on more effective ways of tackling the symptoms.

But the criminal justice system cannot tackle th^-T^ot causes.    At the

heart of the problem is an absence of self-cont^ql and social

responsibility on the part of the youths involvecrryVrayvkling this is a

long and slow process.    But we have made cons ideraW^^j/pcgress in the last

few years in policies which encourage people to takexJaAtnpl of their own

lives, be responsible for their own actions and have r/|&gt; a\for the

consequences.    It is vital that this philosophy contino  \X^underpin our

policies on housing, education and all the other aspects whipp touch on

the lives and activities of those who are involved in crimj ^mtf\ disorder.

We must ensure through specific groups such as the Minister\^aJ X&gt;Aoup on

Crime Prevention (which will consider &quot;Violence&quot; at its July ar^kf^g) and

in other ways that those policies are properly concerted and efrrep^d

towards tackling the problem. ^iL/y

J&gt; PUBLIC DISORDER OUTSIDE METROPOLITAN AREAS - ACPO

v^Studv (The &quot;Haves Report&quot;)

 l  

I^v^pvember 1987 a committee of the Central Conference of Chief

Congfc&amp;fc^es chaired by the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office

and cdmpo^ed of Chief Constables, representatives of the

Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and Home Office

official&amp;^^^reed that ACPO should conduct a survey of incidents

of seriousvrcisorder in small towns and rural areas, where the

police ofterr had difficulty in mobilising a response.    The survey

was conducted by Mr Brian Hayes, the Chief Constable of Surrey.

A questionnaire wak^s^nt to each Chief Constable in England and

Wales requesting det^d^ of all incidents in 1987 outside main

Metropolitan areas inyewing group offences of public disorder or

of assault or of crimifrefl^ltamages where 10 or more reinforcements

in addition to normal sub^jfiWsional patrol strength were needed

and where experience showeu^ft^t it would be difficult to

mobilise that -number of rein&amp;oxe^ments in sufficient time. (The

questionnaire had been drawn uy/^mconsultation with the joint

Home Office/ACPO working group s^r^to to examine ways of

improving police response to disof^Je^rin areas where there were

mobilisation difficulties).    The re^uo^s of the survey were

presented to the Central Conference Committee and circulated

within ACPO in early June.    They have not been published,

although details have been released to the^jSw^s media.

Mr Haye&apos;s report outlines the scale of the p^^^m, the essential

characteristics of the incidents surveyed, the&lt;^dx f&gt;iculties posed

for police forces and their arrangements for dea^ng^with the

problem^-~It also makes &quot;certain recommendations. &lt;^^^^)

total of 251 incidents as defined in the questionnaire^were

reported r(ie an average of 5 incidents per-week) .    The nkap&amp;st

- _ -       - /number _ ~ &lt;^^&quot;)


W number of incidents were reported in the South of England,

y^pllowed by the Midlands.    Coastal resorts were particularly

//^fvEjlicted.    Most incidents took place on Friday and Saturday

\feve1&amp;ngs between 10.00pm and 1.00am and most involved young

pi^onle^ who had been drinking (alcohol featured in over 90% of all

incode^s recorded) .    The numbers originally- involved in an

inciderfraid not determine the eventual scale of the disorder.

The inoMian&amp;s varied widely in location, duration and numbers

involved. ^/^^&gt;

The report recommends a common system for reporting incidents, a

study of the relationship between disorder and licensing policy

in particular ac^s^and tentatively suggests research into the

sociological and demographic factors involved.    Police training

should be reviewed t^iiake account of the experience of disorder

outside Metropolitan a^afs^and forces should reappraise their

contingency plans.    Mode]/%rrtelligence gathering procedures

should be devised and dis ^mA/nated.    Forces should consider

whether greater attention stfo^xl be given to licensing matters.

The report also suggest that^OTmjanity groups may have a greater

role to play both in controlliRCM^tensed premises and in

providing alternative meeting placed for young people.

%

The report states the author&apos;s viewvthat the police cannot tackle

this problem effectively without additional resources.
