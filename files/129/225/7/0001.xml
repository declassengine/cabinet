W^/the QUEEN&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT

VvMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council

I attach a draft of Th  Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of the 1988/89

Session of Par 1 iam yitj\i the form in-which it has been agreed by The

Queen&apos;s Speeches aK^Fjfcure Legislation Committee (QL).    It takes account

of helpful comments bK/cdB leagues on earlier versions.

2.      The draft is based&lt;*fm/ppthe programme provisionally approved by the

Cabinet on 10 March (CC(8@5/* s) to which the following changes have been

made since that time:

i. The Home Secretary       Withdrawn his bid for a

Broadcasting Bill and insNtS*JK^roposes to bid for a

Bill for the 1989/90 SessidCa^pVimplement the proposals

in the Broadcasting White Papery/

ii. The Secretary of State fop^Sc^Aand has withdrawn

his bid for a Housing (Scot land )^ ilP&gt;in the forthcoming

session. &lt;/^- \

iii. When the Prime Minister and oth&lt; /- &lt;n. leagues saw the

football authorities on 6 July it wasS^de clear that the

Government would introduce legislation to impose a national

membership scheme unless the football authorities came forward

with an acceptable scheme of their own.    In th -&gt;absence of

such a voluntary scheme, a Bill to deal withAriieVjadmission of

supporters to football grounds has been addea^^o^he programme.

iv. The Lord Privy Seal and I were invited by tsflE^sfrinet on

10 March to consider whether the Elected Authorit{ 97 jJor thern

Ireland) Bill could be extended to make provision f^/&lt;6w\didates

at local elections in Northern Ireland to make a decNra^r&gt;pn

against terrorism.    We have agreed that it would be map^gSratole

for the Bill to be expanded in this way. \S ))

v. QL have agreed that a short and uncontroversial Euroe^tfTlyrM.

Bill, to enable Eurocontrol to collect navigation service cwateas

in European Currency Units rather than in United States doll5raK/&lt;\

should be added to the programme. //v


 

vi.    The Home Secretary accepts QL&apos;s view that a final

kdecision on whether the Representation of the People Bill * 

can be accommodated in the 1988/89 Session should be deferred

until the New Year.    Accordingly, no reference has been made

v&gt;/!\to the Bill in The Queen&apos;s Speech.

3v/^yvn addition to the customary references to foreign affairs, defence,

the  e &lt;Mmiy and law and order, paragraphs have been included in this

yearns Speech on the environment, education and the National Health

Servicethough there is no legislation specifically on these topics

in nextt^^kepkon&apos; s programme.    I believe that the inclusion of these

referencVsVwouid serve to emphasise the importance which the Government

attaches O&amp;Oprese matters.

4.      I invite the Cabinet to approve the attached draft Speech, subject to

any revisions which might be required in the light of developments before

it is delivered._____^
