Following discussion in E(EP) on 27 October, I now seek the authority of

Cabinet to publish a White Paper &quot;Top-up Loans for Students&quot; in the course

of the week beginning 7 November.    The latest draft is attached. Some

minor drafting points^Nre still being discussed by officials.

2. The essence of m&gt;r&gt; ?0posals, as approved by E(EP) on 27 October, is

that from October 199^Mvl&gt; ull-time home students in higher education,

other than postgraduate^ ufijw 1 be eligible for top-up loans under the

scheme described in the yhyte^Paper; at the same time they will be

disentitled to claim sociaL^e&apos;Wn:ity benefits.

3. All other students now ent^^W to claim benefit will also be

disentitled from that date.    fl^ra^&amp;ccess funds will be established to

provide students with assistance((on^ discretionary basis.    These Funds

are described in paragraphs 3.21^^3^51 of the draft White Paper.

4. E(EP) regarded it as of great imp^rea^ce that the scheme should be

administered by the financial instituoia)* \   With the agreement of the

Governor of the Bank of England and the^hayrman of the Committee of

London and Scottish Banks and of the Bur**fng Societies Association, a

working group including representatives of the financial institutions, the

Treasury and the Bank of England has been set up to examine and report on

the mechanics of the scheme.   A number of difficulties have been raised

and, if Cabinet approves the publication of the White Paper, I propose to

see the Governor and the Chairmen again in order to secure their assurance

that the financial institutions will not criticise^fM^scheme when it is

published.    In return I propose to assure them thar^W^wull listen

CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION

1.1 To support its higher education policy, the Government has

decided to introduce new arrangements for helping students to

meet their living costs.    The purposes of the new arrangements

are:

* to share the cost of student maintenance more equitably

between students themselves, their parents and the

taxpayer

* to increase the resources available to students

* to reduce, over time, the contribution to students&apos;

maintenance which is expected from parents

* to reduce, over time, direct public expenditure on

grants

* to implement the Government&apos;s decision to reduce

students&apos; dependency by removing them from the welfare

benefits system

* to increase economic awareness among students, and

their self-reliance.

1.2 To achieve these aims, the Government intends to top up

students&apos; resources with a loan facility.    The loan will be

available to all full-time home students gaining a place in

higher education, except post-graduates.    It will be over and

above the present means-tested maintenance grant and the parental

contribution.    Over time, the proportion of students&apos; resources

to be financed by loan will increase.

RESTRICTED

1.3 In brief, the arrangements that the Government proposes ai

as follows:

* from academic year 1990-91 a loan facility at nil re;

interest of  420 (average) in a full year and  310 ii

student&apos;s final year

* the parental contribution and grant to be held steady

in cash terms from academic year 1990-91

* the loan facility to be increased each year, to take I

account of this reduction in real terms in the parent

contribution and the grant

* the loan facility to continue to be increased until i

is equal to the value of the grant and parental

contribution taken together

* recoupment of the loan will be deferred when a

graduate&apos;s income is low.

1.4 In addition:

* full-time students in further and higher education

will, from academic year 1990-91, no longer be eliqibB

for income support or unemployment benefit in the lonfl

vacation, or for housing benefit during the period of I

their course, in line with the Government&apos;s policy

announced in the 1985 White Paper on Social Security

reform

* disabled students and students who are single parents!

will remain eligible for benefits, and support for

students&apos; dependents will also continue


RESTRICTED

*       the Government will establish three Access Funds, each

of  5 million a year, to provide discretionary support,

in individual cases of financial need, for students

losing their entitlement to benefits:

i for undergraduates within the scope of the

new loans regime

ii for post-graduates

iii for students in further education.

1.5     The Government will introduce legislation to bring about

these changes in the 1989-90 Session of Parliament.

CHAPTER II:  THE CASE FOR CHANGE

2.1 The present system of support for students&apos; living costs was

introduced in 1962. It had its origin in the work of a committee

chaired by Sir Colin Anderson, which reported in 19601.

2.2 Under this system, students&apos; living costs are supported from

two principal sources: grants from public funds; and contri-

butions from students&apos; parents or spouse, or from students&apos; own

income.    Contributions account for about 39% of the total, while

taxpayers and ratepayers fund about 61% of the living costs of

students receiving mandatory awards2.    The present system of

student support is outlined in Annex A.

Growth and development

2.3 The Anderson Committee envisaged an eventual expansion of

the higher education system to perhaps 175,000 students. In

practice, the expansion has been far greater: in the 1987-88

academic year some 400,000 students were receiving mandatory

awards.    Chart 1 shows this growth.

Chart 1

2 Statistics of student numbers and costs relate throughout

to England and Wales unless some other coverage is specified.


AWARD HOLDERS, GRANT AND CONTRIBUTIONS


RESTRICTED

Chart 1 also shows the increasing cost of this system. Total

expenditure on student maintenance, including contributions from

students&apos; parents or spouses or their own income, has grown from

 253m in 1962-63 to  829m in 1937-88, in constant prices. The

expected contribution from these sources has similarly increased

from  468 on average in 1962-3 to  827 in 1987-88.

Dependence on parents and the state

2.5   The main burden of the contribution falls on students&apos;

parents.    Students&apos; assessed contributions to the grant from

their own income amounted to about  2.7m in England and Wales in

1986-87, or about  7 for each mandatory award holder3. Spouses&apos;

assessed contributions amounted to about  3m.    Parents meanwhile

were expected to contribute some  319m.    The parental

contribution begins to bear on families where incomes are little

more than the national average, as Chart 2 shows.

income from earnings during the period of their course is

RESTRICTED

About 12% of mandatory award holders are independent of their

parents for this purpose, most because they have reached the age

of 25.    Of those who are regarded as dependent students, about

30% receive the maintenance grant in full, as the chart shows.

The others have their grant abated for a parental contribution,

about a quarter receiving no grant in consequence.    Students are

partly or wholly dependent on their parents in the great majority

of cases; only the least prosperous families are expected to make

no contribution.

2.7 A majority of the Anderson Committee recommended that there

should be no parental contribution.    A minority held that if

families did not contribute towards their student members1 living

costs where means permitted, the spirit of family solidarity and

individual self-reliance would be undermined; this view was

accepted.    Since 1962, as Chart 4 below shows, successive

Governments have maintained and indeed increased the expectation

that families should be involved in financing students&apos; living

costs.    Parents have never found this expectation easy to meet.

A survey carried out for the Department of Education and Science

in 1986-87 found that some 35% of students reported that they did

not receive the expected contribution in full.

2.8 Since 1962, the expenditure of public funds on student

grants has grown very substantially.    It has not however kept

pace with the increase in student numbers.    The result has been a

fall of the real value of the grant to the individual student.

This is shown in Chart 4, which also shows the increase in the

parental contribution.

Chart 4



RESTRICTED

2.9 Successive administrations of different political colour

have judged that the contribution of taxpayers and ratepayers to

students&apos; living expenses could not be sustained at the 1962

level, in view of other pressures on public expenditure.

Meanwhile the burden of the parental contribution has become

heavier.    The Government&apos;s conclusion is that a system in which

students rely on just two main sources of support - parents and

grants from public funds - is unsustainable.    Students need

access to additional forms of support towards their living expenses

Welfare benefits

2.10 In recent years social security benefits have grown to form

an increasingly important part of some students&apos; budgets. This

results partly from changes in the benefit rules, and partly from

changes in students&apos; behaviour.    The changes from national

assistance to supplementary benefit in 1966, and changes in

housing benefit in 1983, have allowed more students to claim.

Students&apos; awareness of their eligibility to claim has also

increased.    The effect of the increase in claims has been to

create quite disproportionate administrative problems for both

the housing benefit and the income support schemes.

2.11 The Department of Education and Science recently

commissioned surveys of students&apos; income and expenditure; the

findings are summarised in Annex B.    The undergraduate survey

found that 77% of the students claimed benefits during the

academic year or in the long vacation or both.    Their average

receipts were  249.   About a quarter of the students received


RESTRICTED

nothing in benefits, and a further quarter under  200. At the!

other extreme, a handful received more than  1,000*.

2.12 The Government believes that student dependence on welfar?

benefits is inappropriate and undesirable.    The welfare system

exists to meet the needs of those who are in involuntary

difficulties.    It serves social and not educational purposes:

the taxpayer supports the latter through the grants system, itl

is undesirable that students should learn to depend upon a wronfl

understanding of the reciprocal obligations of the citizen and I

the state.    For these reasons the Government announced in the

1985 White Paper on Social Security5  its intention of

consolidating student support into a single system and ending tm

entitlement of full-time students to claim social security

benefits.

Student budgets

2.13 One important finding of the survey of undergraduate incoj

and expenditure was that almost half the students covered

expected to have debts outstanding at the end of the year

surveyed (1986-87).    The average amount these students owed was

 341.    About 40% of students had overdrafts (average debt  268)

15% had credit card debts (average  174), 6% borrowed from

friends or relatives (average  283), and just under 2% had

commercial loans (average  662).    A few had debts exceeding

 1,000.

4 These figures exclude first year students, as their

benefit claims over the year could have included some from befoi

the start of their course.

RESTRICTED

2.14 The survey found that the undergraduates&apos; actual income

during the academic year was on average about one-third more than

the maintenance grant:  2,606, when the average gross grant,

including any contributions due, was  2,018.    This additional

income came from a variety of sources, including students&apos; own

earnings, loans, savings, and social security benefits.   About a

third of the additional income came from parents: although some

provided less than their assessed contribution, on average

parents overall provided  214 beyond the sums indicated by the

contribution scales.    Parents in addition provided board and

lodging in term and the short vacations worth on average  114.

2.15 The Government considers that students need access to

additional support towards their living costs.    However, in the

Government&apos;s view it would not be reasonable to expect parents to

contribute more; indeed, the Government&apos;s objective is to reduce

the parental contribution.    Nor does the Government consider that

taxpayers, many of whom do not share the advantages that students

have once they graduate, should be expected to contribute more by

grant.    The Government also rejects the principle of student

dependence on welfare benefits.    The need is for an additional

form of support.

Participation in higher education

2.16 In the White Paper &quot;Higher Education: Meeting the

Challenge&quot;6, the Government made clear the priority it attaches

to increasing participation in higher education.   We need more

men and women with the insight, knowledge and intellectual

training which can be had from higher education.    The Government

is committed to increasing the opportunity for people from all

6    Cmnd 114, HMSO 1987.

backgrounds to participate in higher education.    Chart 5 shows

how the proportion of young people entering higher education has

grown since 1960, and the further increase for which the

Government is planning up to the end of the century.

RESTRICTED

2.17 The present system of student support has accompanied this

increase in educational opportunity since the early 1960s. Bud

the Government does not believe that the same system can promotf

the further increase in the participation rate that is needed it

the next decade, in view of the constraints on the two sources &lt;

funding. Moreover, as the number of school-leavers falls, then

will need to be a more diverse range of entrants into higher

education. Addition of a loan to the present sources of studerv

support will provide the necessary flexibility.

2.18 The increase in the participation rate while the present

system has operated has not been uniform.    Female participation

starting from a low base, has progressed faster than male, as

Chart 5 showed.    On the other hand participation from the less

advantaged socio-economic groups has not increased so rapidly, j

survey carried out for the Robbins committee found that 3.2% of

21 year olds whose parents were in manual occupations had enterj

full-time higher education by 1962.    A comparable figure for 19

was 6.9%7.

Effects of the grant system

2.19 How far these trends are related to the grant system is

difficult to establish.    The decision to study at the higher

level does not turn only on the financial support available. I&apos;

depends at least as much on expectations established at school

and in the home from an early age.   What is certain is that the

7 &quot;Higher Education: Report of the Committee appointed by

the Prime Minister under the Chairmanship of Lord Robbins&quot;, Cmnt

2154, HMSO 1963, Appendix One Table 1. The 1985 figure is a DB

estimate. The Robbins survey also found that a further 3% of ^

year olds had entered part-time higher education. No comparably

figure for manual participation in part-time higher education i-

available for 1985.

13


RESTRICTED

overall participation rate has continued to increase at the same

time as the real value of the grant has been declining.

2.20 It is of course not possible to know how access would have

been affected if a different system of student support had

applied.    Here experience overseas of other systems can be

illuminating.    Annex C contains a survey of student support

arrangements in a range of other countries.

2.21 Chart 6 compares recurrent public expenditure on student

support in the United Kingdom and a range of Western countries.

As a proportion of total recurrent expenditure on education as a

whole, or as a proportion of recurrent expenditure cn higher

education, UK expenditure on student support was substantially

higher than elsewhere.    As a proportion of GNP, the UK figure

was similarly the highest.    Averaged over all students, public

expenditure on support per student in the UK was double the next

highest figure8.

2.22 The effectiveness of this level of expenditure is open to

question.    As Annex C shows, participation in higher education in

the UK is towards the middle of the range for the countries

surveyed (excluding the USA), despite our high expenditure on

student support.    On the other hand on measures of the proportion

of graduates in the population, the UK figure is high by

comparison with other European countries.    This may be related

to the competitive entry system in the UK: the resulting low

drop-out rate leads to a greater proportion of students emerging

with a qualification.    It is clear, at all events, that our

system of support is concentrated on a relatively narrow range of

types of student.

A student contribution

2.23 The survey of other countries&apos; arrangements highlights the

availability of a greater variety of public support towards

students&apos; living costs, particularly in the USA.    It is also

notable that in those cases where provision is made mainly or

entirely through grants, a relatively small proportion of

students has access to it.    Where loans are available as well as

grants, the support generally extends to a larger proportion of

students.    This is shown graphically in Charts A and B in Annex

C.    Britain is unique in attempting to support a large proportion

of students with a grant.

2.24 This apparent generosity is a mixed blessing.   A would-be

student embarking on a designated course at first degree level,

and meeting the conditions relating to such matters as residence,

is certain of receiving a mandatory award - though its value is

subject to means-testing.    On the other hand the supply of higher

education places is subject to constraints on public expenditure,

in which student support is one factor.    And as the income and

15


RESTRICTED

expenditure survey showed, the maintenance grant scarcely meets!

the needs of some students, while in many families the parental

contribution bears heavily.

2.25 The continuing rise in the participation rate, despite the

fall in the value of the grant and the sacrifice of potential

earnings during the period of study, is evidence of students&apos;

estimate of the value of higher education.    Indeed, economic

analysis suggests that, in financial terms alone, higher

education would be worthwhile to the student even if no

maintenance grant were available.    This analysis is set out in 1

Annex D.    It shows that the return on the individual graduate&apos;s]

personal investment in higher education (earnings forgone, off si

by the maintenance grant) in recent years has been in the regioj

of 25%, taking all subjects together.

2.26 The same analysis shows that the return to society on its!

investment in the graduate&apos;s higher education is much lower:

between 5% and 8%.    The individual graduate benefits more than

the community as a whole from the latter&apos;s investment in the

former&apos;s higher education.    The division of costs, on the other!

hand, goes the other way.    That is why there is scope for the

individual student to bear more of the cost of the investment.

2.27 Graduates with high incomes do of course contribute to

public expenditure by paying high taxes.    But this results from!

their earnings, and does not relate to the cost of their higher

education; high earners who have not had the privilege of highe

education pay equally high taxes.    Students&apos; direct contributioi

to their living costs is relatively small: on average a little

over  300 a year from earnings, drawings on savings and loans,

against total average living expenses of almost  2,900.

supported derives predominantly from income tax.    Many tax-

payers have incomes lower than those that students are likely to

earn as graduates, as Chart 7 shows.

Moreover, as Chart 3 showed, many students come from families

with incomes above the average, while the less advantaged socio-

economic groups are under-represented in higher education. Under

the present system taxpayers in general - poor and middling as

well as rich - are contributing to the living costs of students

who in many cases come from, and as graduates are likely to

occupy, the more advantageous positions in society.

2.29 Society as a whole needs graduates&apos; talents, and the

Government does not propose to remove the existing maintenance

grant.    But the Government intends to ensure a fairer

distribution of the costs and widen the resources available to

students by offering a loan facility that will over a period of

years partially replace the existing grant.

Top-up loans

2.30 The loans proposed by the Government will top up the

existing grant and parental contribution.    At the same time they

will more than compensate the average student claimant of welfare

benefits for the loss of entitlement.    The new loan will provide

a substantial net addition to the resources available to

students.

2.31 These proposals derive from the work of the review of

student support, chaired successively by George Walden and Robert

Jackson, Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State at the

Department of Education and Science.    The review was established

by the Government in 1986 in response to the growing

unsuitability of a system based on grants only for modern

conditions.   There will be no separate report from the review;

the review group&apos;s thinking is subsumed here.    The review group

wishes to record its gratitude for the information and analysis

CHAPTER III:  THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S PROPOSALS IN DETAIL

The loan

3.1 The main features of the top-up loan scheme that the

Government proposes are:

zero real interest

no means-testing

repayments responsive to earnings

no cross-liability of spouses.

These terms represent a further effective subsidy, as graduates

will not be required to pay commercial rates of interest. The

loan facility will first be made available - subject to

Parliament&apos;s approval - in the 1990-91 academic year.

3.2 These proposals are set out more fully in the following

paragraphs.    The Government will be discussing their implications

with interested parties - including the financial institutions

(see paragraph 4.1 below) - and will be open to suggestions for

adaptation and refinement.

Eligibility

3.3 The loan facility will be offered to all full-time home

students in higher education, except postgraduates, up to the age

of 509,    jt will be available from autumn 1990 to all students

9    The definition of higher education in the Education

Reform Act 1988 (Schedule 6) includes first degree courses, DipHE

courses, BTEC HND and HNC courses and the Diploma in Management

20


RESTRICTED

who are eligible, including those already part-way through thei

courses, so as to offer at once access to the additional

resources that the Government intends to provide through the

loan.    The same loan facility will be available irrespective of

subject of study or of the level of the student&apos;s grant, if any

3.4 Unlike the maintenance grant, the loan facility will not b&lt;

means-tested.    The size of loan available in individual cases

will not be dependent on the resources of the student&apos;s parents

or spouse, or the student&apos;s own income.    How much of the facili

is used will be a matter of individual choice.

3.5 A student embarking late in life on study at first degree j

level has not the opportunity thereafter to repay the loan. Th

facility will not therefore be available to students aged 50 or

over at the start of their course. Students embarking on highe

education at that age can be assumed to have accumulated other

resources on which they can rely in place of the loan. They wi

continue to have access, as now, to the other elements of the

mandatory awards regime.

Value of loan facility

3.6 The Government proposes that the loan facility, like the

maintenance grant, should be available at three rates, according

to whether the student is living in term in the parental home,

away from home in London, or away from home outside London. Thi

Studies, Certificate of Education courses, and other courses

leading to examinations or with entry requirements above the

standard of the GCE advanced level or the BTEC National

Certificate or Diploma.    The loan will not be available for post

graduate courses (which are also covered by Schedule 6) or for

courses at the Long-Term Residential Colleges.

21


RESTRICTED

home rate would also be appropriate for any students in

establishments providing free board and lodging.

3.7 The loan facility is intended to provide support throughout

the year, at a level which will make it unnecessary for students

to look for supplementary support from the social security

system.    It is not intended however to cover the long vacation

that follows the end of the course, when the graduate is

available for work.    The loan facility for the final year of

study is therefore calculated to cover 38 weeks, the average

duration of term and the short vacations.

3.8 The cash value of the loan facility will have to be settled

nearer to the introduction of the new regime.    The illustration

below is based on the hypothesis of the value of the maintenance

grant increasing by [4.5% in 1989-90 and 3.5% in 1990-91]. The

loan maxima, grant including parental contribution, and total

resources for an individual student in the first year of the

scheme would then be:


RESTRICTED

maximum loan     maintenance total

facility grant resources

(including

contributions)

in a full year of study

&apos;elsewhere&apos; 420 2,215 2,635

London 460 2,625 3,085

home 330 1,765 2,095

in the final year of study:

&apos;elsewhere&apos; 310 2,215 2,525

London 340 2,625 2,965

home 240 1,765 2,005

For some students, such as those with dependents, additional

allowances will continue to be available as part of the

maintenance grant.    Including the allowances, a student&apos;s total

resources on average will be  2,239 for those at home,  3,229 ii

London and  2,779 elsewhere.

3.9   After 1990-91, the Government proposes to make no further

increase for a number of years in the grant or parental

contribution.    The maximum grant, and the average contribution,

will be maintained at the 1990-91 cash level.    Students&apos; total

resources in grant and loan will continue to be reviewed annual]

in the light of evidence of cost increases, as the grant levels

are at present.   But any uprating will be applied to the loan

facility only.    In real terms, therefore, the value of the gran

- and the burden of the parental contribution - will fall, and

the loan facility will expand to compensate.


RESTRICTED

3.10   That process will continue until the grant and the parental

contribution taken together is approximately equal to the loan

facility.    On the hypothesis of 3% inflation annually after 1990-

91, that point is reached in 2007-08.    The effect is illustrated

in chart 8 below, which shows in constant prices the net grant,

parental contribution and loan facility for a typical student

before the introduction of the new regime, on its introduction,

and in 2007-08.

NOTE: Figures apply to students with average parental contribution and award

for 1990-91. The gross award is equivalent to the elsewhere rate of

grant plus average additional allowance of  137.


RESTRICTED

How the uprating is apportioned between grant and loan facility

after 2007-08 will need to be decided nearer the time. The

present intention is that it should be applied to both equally.

This will maintain an equilibrium between the student&apos;s own

contribution, and the reduced contribution of the taxpayer and

the parents.

Parental contribution

3.11 When the loan facility is introduced in 1990, the levels of

both grant and parental contribution will be unaffected. Some

students may choose to use the loan facility to minimise the

extent to which they rely on support from their parents.   As the

real value of the loan increases, the effect will be felt at all

points on the income scale as a reduction of the real cost of the

parental contribution.

Interest

3.12 The Government proposes that the loan should be provided at

a real interest rate of zero.    This would be achieved by

revaluing the outstanding debt annually in line with the Retail

Prices Index.    Chart 9 shows how the debt would be built up and

paid off in the case of a student starting a three-year course

away from home outside London in autumn 1990, using the full loan

facility, and completing repayments over a five year period, on

the hypothesis of 3% annual inflation.

RESTRICTED

These repayments would amount to about 5 - 10% of the cost to the

public of the average student&apos;s higher education.

Repayments

3.13 The liability to start repayments should not immediately

follow graduation.    The Government proposes that the liability

should begin in the April following the end of the period of

study.    Graduates will therefore have nine months&apos; grace before

any liability begins.

3.14 The Government proposes that repayments should be

responsive to individuals&apos; economic circumstances.    A choice to

pursue a vocation where earnings are low should not be inhibited

by an obligation to complete repayment of the loan.    This applies

particularly to the decision to interrupt work in order to raise

children.    It is not the Government&apos;s intention that the

repayment obligation should constrain such choices.

3.15 Various repayment regimes are possible.    For example:

A      The repayment period could be fixed as a number of

years - eg 10 - and each year&apos;s instalment calculated

by dividing the outstanding debt, revalued as in

paragraph 8.11, by the number of years remaining. In

any year where earnings were low - for example, less

than 85% of national average income - repayments would

be deferred and the period extended.    For those whose

income was only a little over that threshold, a

tapering scale of repayments would apply.

B      The repayment period could be variable, with the annual

instalment fixed, for example, at  500 (in later years

26


RESTRICTED

this might need to be larger in the light of any

inflation).    This would allow graduates with small

loans to complete repayments quickly, and give those

with large loans longer.    For periods of low income,

arrangements similar to those under Option A would be

needed.

C      A combination of Options A and B would have the

repayment period fixed initially in line with size of

the debt.    This would allow students with large loans

longer, and involve roughly similar instalments for

all.    The same provisions for low income would apply.

D      A different approach would relate repayments directly

to taxable income.    The repayment period would not be

fixed, and the instalment would be expressed as a

percentage of taxable income - perhaps in the region &lt;

4% - rather than a fixed sum.    Deferral of repayments

for periods of low income would then be automatic:

those with earnings below the income tax threshold

would make no repayment, and the instalments for thosi

with low incomes would be in proportion.    As with the

other options, any repayment deferred would be

revalued and added to the outstanding debt.

As part of the consultations described in paragraphs Chapter IV,

the Department of Education and Science will study further the

practicability of the possible repayment regimes.

3.16   Under any of these options except A, the repayment period

will vary in line with individual circumstances.    It will in any

case increase over time up to 2007-08, as the loan facility come

to provide a larger component of the resources available to

students.    The Government expects that a student taking out a

27


RESTRICTED

small loan then earning an average graduate salary would

complete repayments in five years.    Graduates with larger loans

or lower earnings would take longer.

3.17 The Government does not intend that repaying the loan

should be a life-long commitment.    Under all four options, most

graduates would be able to complete repayment in a span of time

much shorter than the normal term of a mortgage.    But a limit

must be established for cases where repayments are repeatedly

deferred because of low income.    The Government therefore

proposes that any outstanding loan should be written off in the

following circumstances:

death: there will be no charge on a graduate&apos;s estate

for any loan outstanding

where there has been no evasion of repayments, either

- on the graduate&apos;s reaching the age of 50; or

- 25 years after the loan commenced,

whichever is sooner.

For students starting courses aged 40 or over, however,

cancellation of any outstanding loan will apply from the age of

60 rather than 50.    For students aged 50 or over on starting a

course, the loan facility will not be available.

3.18 The Government proposes to reduce the loan outstanding if

repayment is completed early.    How this will operate depends on

the repayment regime adopted.    An incentive for early repayment

will help bring forward the benefits to the taxpayer arising from

the loans scheme.


RESTRICTED

No responsibility of spouses

3.19 The repayment will be individually calculated on the basi

of personal earnings.    A spouse&apos;s income will not be taken int

account.   A woman who interrupts her career while raising

children may make no repayments during that period, until her

income rises above the repayment threshold on her return to

employment.

Potential difficulties with loans

3.20 The regime proposed is designed, with the benefit of

experience overseas, to avoid difficulties which can arise in

using loans to support students&apos; living costs.    The potential

difficulties, and the ways of meeting them, are analysed in And

G.

Access Funds

3.21 At the same time as introducing the loan facility, the

Government intends to establish three Access Funds to provide

additional support to home students in the form of discretionar

bursaries.   These will be available in cases where access to

higher education might be inhibited by financial considerations

or where students, for whatever reasons, face real financial

difficulties.   The Access Funds will be administered by the

higher and further education institutions themselves, which wil

be responsible for applying criteria to their own students,

assessing individual circumstances and making the payments.

There will be three Funds, each of  5 million a year.

29


RESTRICTED

3.22 The undergraduate Fund will be available to all full-time

home students on higher education courses in publicly-funded

establishments, including those on such courses in further

education colleges.    Students with discretionary awards and

students who are supporting themselves without an award, as well

as those with mandatory awards, will be able to seek assistance

from the Fund.    The Post-graduate Fund will provide discretionary

assistance to home students studying at levels above first

degree, who will not be eligible for loans.

3.23 The institutions will bid for their allocations from these

two Funds to the Universities or the Polytechnics and Colleges

Funding Councils.    Where the Councils&apos; remit does not apply,

other arrangements will be made.    The Department of Education and

Science will discuss the operation of the Funds with

representatives of the two Funding Councils and of the higher

and further education institutions.

3.24 There will be a parallel Fund for full-time home students

aged 19 and over in further education, including those on further

education courses in higher education establishments.    It will

provide assistance in the form of discretionary bursaries,

administered by the establishments, which will be responsible for

assessing their students&apos; needs and making the payments.

Students who have discretionary awards or who are supporting

themselves will be eligible, subject to the policies of their

institutions.    The availability of this Fund will be confined to

publicly-funded institutions.   The Department of Education and

Science will discuss the administration of the Fund with

representatives of the the local education authorities, the

Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council and the institutions.

3.25 The Government hopes that the institutions will themselves

work out imaginative arrangements for enhancing the value and

30


RESTRICTED

scope of the Funds, for example by linking payments to

sponsorship, using them to help students find paid employment,,

making some payments on a repayable basis, as well as making

grants.

Social security benefits

3.26 These arrangements will make it possible to implement the

Government&apos;s long-standing commitment to removing full-time

students from dependency on social security benefits.    The new

loan facility, and the two new bursary funds, in combination ari

intended to give students access to the resources they need.

From their introduction full-time students in higher or further]

education will no longer be entitled to claim income support,

unemployment benefit or housing benefit.

3.27 Students&apos; entitlement to other social security benefits

will not be affected.    They will still be able to claim,

according to their circumstances, refunds for medical or dental

charges, and child benefit.   Moreover, students who are single

parents or disabled will continue to be able to claim income

support and housing benefit.    Students with dependents will also

have access to the additional allowances under the grant regime

3.28 The restriction of benefits will apply only to students

personally, not to their partners.    The partner of a student, 1

entitled to a benefit in his or her own right, will not lose thi

entitlement merely by virtue of the relationship with the

student, and will be able as now to claim benefits individually

or on behalf of the family unit.   The husband of a mature

student, for example, will thus be able to claim unemployment

benefit or income support if he is seeking work, and housing

31


RESTRICTED

benefit if appropriate, subject to the conditions applying to all

claimants.

3.29 The surveys of students&apos; income and expenditure included

data on benefit claims.    These provide a basis for estimating

claims in 1990-91, taking account of factors such as the changes

in housing benefit entitlements in April 1988 and likely

developments in vacation employment opportunities. The

Government estimates that in 1990-91 students would have claimed

on average about  150 in housing benefit and income support in a

full year of study.    The expectation is, however, that some 50%

of students would make no claim; the average among those making a

claim would be about  300.    For students in their final year of

study, whose claims do not include a long vacation, the average

claim would be about  35, and the average received by each

claimant (only about 20% of students) would be approximately

 175.    The various rates of loan proposed for 1990-91

substantially exceed those figures for claims.    Students who

would have been able to make claims at or near those average

rates will find therefore that the loan facility will give them

access to a significant increase in resources even after the loss

of their benefit entitlement.

3.30 Some students in 1990-91 would have claimed more than

those average figures.    For those students, the availability of

the Access and Further Education Funds may be particularly

important.

3.31 The Government believes that ending students&apos; dependence

on social security benefits will, like the availability of a

loan, contribute to increasing their economic awareness and their

self-reliance.    It will also put an end to the anomaly of short-

term claims by students from a series of different addresses

32


RESTRICTED

generating administrative costs that can exceed the benefit

payment.

Costs and Savings

3.32 Introducing the new regime will involve a net increase in

public expenditure of about  120 million in the first year. As

repayments are made they will offset costs, growing to balance

them by the start of the next century.    Thereafter repayments

will outweigh costs, producing a net saving in public expenditua

which will stabilise at something over  200 million (at 1990-911

prices) once the regime is fully developed.    Annex E sets out

this estimate in full, together with the assumptions on which itl

is based.

The mandatory awards system

3.33 The Government does not propose to make major changes in

the mandatory awards system at the same time as introducing the j

new regime. Its view is that the net increase in resources

provided by the availability of the loan facility, together with

the extra flexibility that it and the bursary funds will offer, j

will give students the scope they need to adjust their budgets ii

the light of individual circumstances.

3.34 The Government nevertheless intends, subject to

Parliament&apos;s approval, to remove certain restrictions on the

availability of mandatory awards.

i. The moratorium on new designations. For certain types

of course - for example, first degree courses provided

by universities - designation of a new course as one

33


RESTRICTED

for which a mandatory award is available is automatic.

For other courses, designation is dependent on approval

by the Secretary of State.    Since 1981 a moratorium has

applied to such designations, and a number of courses

which meet the Secretary of State&apos;s normal criteria are

awaiting designation.    From September 1989 the

moratorium will not apply to any course leading to a

first degree, including courses provided by

establishments not maintained or assisted by recurrent

grant from public funds.

ii.    Disregarding previous study.    Mandatory awards are not

available to students who have previously attended, for

a period of more than six months, a course of higher

education of more than two years&apos; duration, or who have

satisfactorily completed the equivalent in part-time

study.    This disqualification applies whether or not

they received a grant for the earlier study. From

September 1989 the rules will be changed so that

mandatory awards will be available to students whose

previous study was not supported from public funds.

3.35 As the students affected by these changes are in higher

education, they will in any case have access to the top-up loan

facility.

3.36 The Government will moreover continue to keep the mandatory

awards system under review, with a view particularly to reducing

its complexity.    One such simplification, which could also be

implemented in 1990, concerns the basis on which income is

assessed for the purpose of establishing the parental

contribution.   At present gross income is abated by various

factors, and the contribution calculated against the residual

income.    Use of gross income as the basis of the calculation

34


RESTRICTED

would simplify the system for both parents and local education

authorities.    The issues are considered further in Annex F. The

Government will welcome comments on the desirability of moving t&lt;

a gross income basis.

Monitoring

3.37 The Department of Education and Science will monitor the

introduction of the new regime, so as to measure its effects on I

such matters as participation by social class or gender. As a j

first step, preparations are in hand for a further survey of

students&apos; income and expenditure to be undertaken shortly before

the introduction of the new regime, so as to provide a base-line

for later comparisons.

CHAPTER IV:  NEXT STEPS

Consultations

4.1 The Department of Education and Science is now discussing

with the banks and building societies, and others with expertise

in this area, the arrangements for making loans and collecting

repayments.    The Government&apos;s objective is to identify a cost-

effective scheme which the financial institutions will be able to

administer.

4.2 The Department is also initiating discussions with the

local education authorities about implementation of the revisions

of the mandatory awards system.    These discussions will cover in

particular their views on the possibility of basing contributions

on gross rather than net income.

4.3 The establishment of the two new bursary funds will

introduce a new role for the higher and further education

institutions.    Their experience in the field of student welfare

will provide a basis for the operation of the new funds to meet

local needs and circumstances.    The DES will discuss the

administration of the funds with the Funding Councils and

representatives of the institutions and the local education

authorities.

Legislation and timetable

4.4 The Government will introduce a short Bill in the 1989-90

Session of Parliament to implement the new regime.    Its main

purposes will be as follows:

Conclusion

4.5 The Government is convinced that the availability of a loa

facility to top up the maintenance grant will provide a valuable

extension of the sources of support available to students. It

will support the broadening of participation in higher education

at the same time as sharing the cost of supporting students&apos;

maintenance more equitably between taxpayers, students&apos; families

and students themselves. The loan will give students a personal

stake in the investment made in their future.

4.6 There is however scope for discussion about the way the

loan scheme should be structured so as to provide students most!

effectively with the support they need.    Four options for

repayments have been set out above.   Comments are invited

specifically on the desirable structure of the loan regime, and!

on the possibility of adopting gross rather than residual incorol

as the basis for calculating contributions.

ANNEX A

THE CURRENT AWARDS SYSTEM

1. The main features of the present system of student support

are:

i) payment of tuition fees: tuition is free for those

holding a mandatory award (defined in paragraph 4);

ii) a contribution towards board and lodging, books and

other maintenance expenses, subject to a means test;

iii) it underwrites one opportunity for all suitably

qualified people, regardless of age or sex, to

undertake a full-time course of higher education;

iv) mandatory awards are generally available for full-time

study only, on the assumption that part-time students

have earnings from employment or other resources;

v) subject to acceptance on an appropriate course,

students are free to choose the institution where they

study and their subject; and

vi) mandatory awards cover the full period of a student&apos;s

course, regardless of its length.

2. In England and Wales student support is administered by

local education authorities; in Scotland by the Scottish

Education Department; and in Northern Ireland by the Education

and Library Boards.    The arrangements for Scotland and Northern

Ireland closely resemble those in England and Wales, though there

1


are minor variations.    It has been the policy of successive

Governments to maintain parity of treatment throughout the Unitej

Kingdom so far as the main features of the system are concerned.

England and Wales

3. The Education Act 1962 imposes a duty on local education

authorities (LEAs) to provide mandatory awards to students in

specified circumstances, principally for first degree courses.

It also gives LEAs the power to make discretionary awards in

other cases.

Mandatory Awards

4. Mandatory awards are available for designated courses. Thesl

are full-time first degree courses, certain courses for

university certificates or diplomas, courses for the Dip HE, HNIj

and initial teacher training. In addition the Secretary of StatJ

has power to designate individual courses which are comparable I

standard to first degree courses, though a moratorium has applil

to such designations since 1981.

5. In general, a student may receive an award for only one

attempt at an advanced qualification. Those who have undertake!

previous advanced study on a course lasting more than two years!

are ineligible, whether they received an award or not, if they 1

attended the course for more than six months. The only exceptij

is that a mandatory award is available for a graduate undertakii

a post-graduate course of initial teacher training or a two-yeal

Batchelor of Education course.

6. To qualify, students must have been ordinarily resident in ;|

the United Kingdom, Channel Isles or Isle of Man for the three I

2


years preceding the academic year in which their course begins.

Exceptions apply if the student, or the student&apos;s parents or

spouse, have been temporarily employed abroad.    There are also

some exceptions to the residence requirement for students from

European Community countries, and refugees, asylees and their

spouses and children.

7. The award comprises a contribution to maintenance costs, and

payment of tuition fees.    The maintenance grant rates are

reviewed annually.    The figures quoted here are for the 1988-89

academic year.    For students resident in the parental home the

basic maintenance grant is  1,630.    For those living outside the

parental home it is  2,425 for those studying in London, and

 2,050 elsewhere.    For students receiving free board and lodging

at college, the rate is  895.    The grant is assumed to cover the

Christmas and Easter vacations and 30 weeks of term-time.

8. Students aged 25 or over, or who have supported themselves

for at least 3 years before the start of their course, are

regarded as independent of their parents for awards purposes, as

are those who have been married for at least three years. A

parental contribution is assessed for other mandatory award

holders.

9. The parental contribution is based upon the parents&apos;

residual income; the income of both parents is taken into

account in its calculation.    Residual income is defined as the

parents&apos; gross income in the preceding financial year less

certain deductions, chiefly for other adult dependents, interest

payments (including mortgage interest), superannuation, life

insurance and pension scheme contributions.    After residual

income has been calculated, and the parental contribution

assessed, a further deduction is made in respect of any other

dependent children of the family.

3


10. A nil contribution is assessed where parents&apos; residual

income is less than  9,900.    At  9,900 a contribution of  37 is I

assessed; contributions are then assessed at the rate of  1 for j

each  9.33 of additional income up to a residual income of

 12,600, then  1 for every  6.66 up to a residual income of

 18,400, and  1 for every  5.33 thereafter.    The contribution is

limited to a total maximum of  4,900: this protects parents with

more than one child in higher education simultaneously1.

11. In the case of married independent students, the spouse&apos;s

contribution is similarly based on residual income. No

contribution is assessed on incomes below  7,800.    At  7,800 a I

contribution of  10 is assessed; contributions are then assessed

at  1 in every  7 up to a residual income of  12,600, then fl inl

every  5 up to a residual income of  18,400, and  1 for every  4

thereafter, with again a maximum of  4,900.

12. A contribution is similarly expected from any unearned

income the student may have.    The student&apos;s contribution is not

based on residual income.    On incomes (after deduction of tax

and national insurance) beyond  525 the student is assessed to

contribute pound for pound towards the grant. However,

scholarship or sponsorship income to a limit of  2,150 is

disregarded, as are all earnings from work, child benefit and

certain other payments.

13. These contributions apply only to the maintenance element &lt;j

the award.   Tuition fees are normally met in full from public

1 These contribution scales apply to students beginning

their courses in 1988. For students who reached 18 before 15 J

March 1988 and either began their courses before 1 April 1988 oj

had attended another designated course in the previous two year^

the contribution is one-third higher. The reduction in the I

contribution from 1988 reflects the ending in the 1988 Budget ofl

the opportunity to obtain tax relief on covenanted payments.

4


funds, and are not subject to parental or other contributions.

They are paid direct to the college by the award-making body.

14. In addition to the main rate of grant, supplementary

allowances are available, for example to cushion students aged 26

or over against a drop in income when they begin their studies,

for students with adult or child dependents, for disabled

students, and for extra weeks of study required beyond the period

covered by the basic grant.

Discretionary awards

15. Awards may also be made at the discretion of the local

education authority to students following a degree or comparable

course who do not qualify for a mandatory award, because, for

example, they do not meet the residence conditions.    In such

cases the award must be made at the full mandatory rate.

Students following other courses may receive discretionary awards

at any level the LEA determines; some such awards are made for

fees only, and include no maintenance grant.

Scotland

16. For students ordinarily resident in Scotland, Students&apos;

Allowances are paid at the discretion of the Secretary of State.

The range of courses for which Students&apos; Allowances are offered

by the Scottish Education Department includes all courses which

are designated by the DES for mandatory awards.    The SED also

offers Students&apos; Allowances for certain other courses for which

in England and Wales support is offered on a discretionary basis

by LEAs or other award-making bodies.    The conditions of

eligibility for awards are similar to those in England and Wales,

though there are minor differences in the previous study rules.

5


I

17. The Scottish arrangements also differ from those in England!

and Wales in the treatment of travel.    The rates of maintenance

grant are slightly lower, but students may claim repayment of

essential travelling expenses in excess of  54 per annum. In

England and Wales the grant includes a flat-rate allowance for

travelling expenses.

18. The Scottish local authorities also make awards equivalent

to the English discretionary awards.

Northern Ireland

19. Arrangements in Northern Ireland closely resemble those in

England and Wales.    The principal difference affects trainee

teachers, whose awards are discretionary rather than mandatory,

though they are paid at the same rate and are in practice

automatically available on obtaining a place at college.


SURVEYS OF STUDENTS&quot;   INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

1. The Department of Education and Science commissioned two

surveys, covering undergraduates&apos; and mature students&apos;  income and

expenditure, which were undertaken in the 1986-87 and 1987-88

academic years respectively.    The contractors for the first,

Research Services Limited, published their report in April 19881.

The report on the survey of mature students is not yet

available, though the Government has taken some preliminary

findings into account.    Some conclusions of the undergraduate

survey are mentioned in Chapter II; more detail is given here.

2. The undergraduate survey was based on a representative sample

of single undergraduates normally resident in Great Britain, aged

under 26, and studying on full-time courses (excluding sandwich

courses) in Great Britain for first degrees at universities,

polytechnics and other institutions.    Interviews were carried out

in May and June 1987.    The survey was primarily concerned with

undergraduates&apos;  income and expenditure during the academic year

1986-87, the 38 weeks from October to the following June, but

information was also collected about earnings and receipt of

social security benefits during the previous Summer vacation.

Comparable surveys were carried out in 1974-75 by the Office of

Population Censuses and Surveys and in 1982-83 by the National

Union of Students (NUS).

Income

3. During the 38 weeks of the academic year, undergraduates&apos;

mean income was  2,800, made up as follows:

grant 1,120

parental support 1,113

own income 119

board provided by parents 114

loans 99

drawings on savings 96

social security benefits 91

gifts from relatives 49

2,8002

4. Undergraduates&apos; main income - the grant and any contribution

or other parental support, and a mean of  114 attributed for the

value of board provided by parents in the vacations (and, for

home-based students, in term) - averaged  2,346. University

undergraduates generally received a higher proportion of this as

a parental contribution, and female undergraduates had

fractionally higher parental contributions than males.

Undergraduates from one-parent families (17% of the sample) had

main incomes about  100 higher than those from two-parent

families.    Generally those whose parents were in social grades t.

and B had larger main incomes;  in one-parent families the

disparity was almost  240, but in two-parent families it was on]

 55.    Undergraduates with small parental contributions, and thos

2    The difference between the total and its components is!

the result of rounding.


relying on parental contributions entirely, had the largest main

incomes, though their advantage was not great.

5. On average, undergaduates received in main income  328 more

than the maximum gross grant (including additional allowances and

extra weeks payements) applying to their place of study.

However, around 15% received less than the maximum grant

(excluding allowances and extra weeks) - about  280 less on

average.    This arose where assessed parental contributions were

high - typically homes with parents in social grades A and B and

no other dependent children.    Overall, of those undergraduates

whose parents were assessed to make a contribution,  35% did not

receive it in full.    The comparable figure in the NUS survey of

1982-83 was 46%.

6. In secondary income - from own earnings, loans, drawings on

savings, social security benefits and gifts from relatives -

undergraduates received on average  454.    Undergraduates with

large assessed parental contributions had the largest earnings

and drew most heavily on savings.    Undergraduates from one-parent

homes relied more on loans than those from two-parent homes, and

drew more on savings.    Benefit receipts were higher where parents

were in social grades C, D and E.

7. Housing benefit was received by 43% of undergraduates not

living in the parental home.    The average received was  211, but

this varied substantially according to area: in the Midlands the

average figure was  121, but in London it was  296.    A very small

number - under 1% - claimed more than  500 in housing benefit.

8. In addition, 15% of undergraduates claimed other benefits

during the academic year.    These claimants&apos; mean benefit receipts

were  49, but the mean conceals large variations: the median was

 8.   Most claimants received small sums in refunds of medical and

dental charges.    A very small number, however, claimed

3


substantial sums - in one case over  500 - in supplementary

benefit or disability allowance.

9. In addition to this income within the academic year, during

the long vacation 90% of undergraduates received further income

from work, benefits or both.    Their average long vacation incort

was  476.    Earnings from employment were reported by 59%: averag

earnings were  531 (net of tax, other deductions and the direct

costs of working) from almost 8 weeks&apos; work.    Benefits were

received by 58% of undergraduates, averaging  193 over 8 weeks.

While total long vacation income hardly varied by social grade,

its composition did: where parents were in grades A and B, week

earnings were higher and benefits were claimed for a shorter

period.

Comparisons

10. The survey report calculated that, at constant 1987 prices,

the purchasing power of undergraduates&apos; total income had risen

about 5% since the NUS survey of 1982-83.    A 21% decline in

amounts paid to them in the form of grants and other awards

(including any parental contribution) had been more than made

good by an increase in support from parents beyond the assessed

contribution, and by a substantial increase in the amount or

housing benefit received.    The result was a real reduction in tl

public funding of their maintenance of about 5% as shown below:!

(b) Does not include the imputed value of board provided by

Expenditure

11. The survey recorded undergraduates&apos; total expenditure during

the 38 weeks of the academic year as  2,882, made up as follows:


rent 779

food and common household expenses 462

entertainment, tobacco and alcohol 399

miscellaneous 252

leisure travel and motoring 227

books, equipment, course travel 172

clothing 132

gifts 118

travel to college 115

payment for parental board 114

fuel 56

post and telephone 56

2,8823

12.    Undergraduates&apos; expenditure during the academic year on

items classified in the survey as basic - accommodation, food an&lt;

drink consumed in their accommodation, the imputed cost of

parental board, essential travel and necessary course expenses -

was on average  1,698.    Variations related mainly to their typel

of accommodation and region, reflecting variations in travel and

prevailing rents.    The average rent paid in London was  997,

compared to  735 elsewhere.    Undergraduates with high total

incomes did not spend appreciably more than those with low

incomes on these basic items.

3    The survey was constructed to balance income and

expenditure, but total income as recorded exceeded total I

expenditure by  82.    Expenditure figures were based on a diary

maintained by students over one week, and a questionnaire asking

students to recall expenditure back to the beginning of the

academic year.    The researchers anticipated a degree of

approximation in responses, and concluded that a 3% discrepancy

between income and expenditure was acceptable.

6


13. Expenditure on other items - entertainment, leisure travel,

clothing, postage and telephone, gifts and miscellaneous -

averaged  1,184.    Generally this expenditure was higher for

undergraduates in rented accommodation, and lowest for those

living in the parental home.

14. Expenditure on entertainment was significantly higher for

undergraduates in London than elsewhere.    There were also

variations associated with type of accommodation.    The main

variation, however, was the tendency for undergraduates with the

highest total incomes (excepting those living at home) to spend

most, particularly on eating out and alcohol.

15. Expenditure on course expenses - books, equipment,

stationery, photocopying, and course travel - averaged  172.

There was considerable variation according to subject of study

and type of institution.    Course expenditure did not vary

significantly by social grade of parents, but undergraduates with

high total incomes spent more than those with low total incomes

on these items.

16. In the long vacation, 31% of undergraduates incurred

additional expenditure on accommodation averaging  157. Housing

benefit averaging  153 was claimed by 22%.    Both expenditure and

benefit claims were highest in London.    Other long vacation

expenditure was not recorded.

Comparisons

17. Total expenditure increased by about 17% in real terms

between 1982-83 and 1986-87.    Expenditure on board and lodging

changed little overall; expenditure on accommodation rose by 20%,

and fell by 24% on food and other household expenses.

Expenditure on books and equipment fell by 11%. Expenditure

7


increased on clothing (36%), travel (47%), and entertainment,

tobacco and alcohol (48%).


ANNEX C

INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS

Any attempt to compare different countries&apos; systems of student

support is beset with difficulties.    There is a question of

definition: a course that one country classifies as higher

education may be categorised at a different level elsewhere.

Some support, such as subsidised housing or meals, is provided in

kind, and its value is difficult to calculate.    Comparisons of

the value of support are also sensitive to exchange rate

movements.    Moreover, such data as are available are often some

years out of date, and coverage is not always complete for each

country.    These difficulties are explored in more detail in DES

Statistical Bulletin 4/87, &quot;International Statistical Comparisons

in Higher Education&quot;.

2. With those limitations, the information presented here is

intended to give an impression of the nature of the support

regimes operating in a range of countries, their value to the

individual student, their cost to the public, and their effects

measured by such criteria as participation and numbers obtaining

qualifications.

Student support systems

3. Charts A and B with Table 1 summarise the student support

systems in a range of European and North American countries.

4. Chart A shows the maximum value of support available to an

individual student, and the form it takes.    In practice the

actual value of the support is generally less, as it is subject

to means-testing.

1


5.    It must be read in conjunction with Chart B, which shows tl

proportion of students receiving this support.    In some countrj

the maximum shown as available in Chart A, while relatively

generous in itself, is in fact available to only a small

proportion of full-time higher education students.

STUDENT SUPPORT:

MAXIMUM AVAILABLE AMOUNTS OF GOVERNMENT

ASSISTANCE 1987-88

(1) Main rates, exclusive of allowances, for students living away trom home. England and Wales figure weighted to reflect

higher London rate of grant- All amounts at 1987 PPP.

(2) Free tuition.

(3) Means-tested exemption from all or part of fees.

(4) Free tuition for assisted students.

(5) Negligible fees available.

(6) Tuition fees are charged, about  388 by universities and  313 by Higher Vocational Institutions.

(7) National and Local Government Universities charge tuition fees of on average  814 (27% of university students attend

such institutions).    Fees charged by private universities average  1,970.


PROPORTION OF FULL-TIME HIGHER EDUCATION STUD J

RECEIVING GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE


6. In some countries the student has to pay tuition fees out of

this support.    In Japan fees are heavy and in practice absorb a

large part of the grant; even the relatively small numbers of

students receiving the grant thus have to rely for living costs

on other sources of support.    A tuition fee is also charged in

France, Ireland and the Netherlands, though it is subsidised to

varying degrees.

7. So far as Britain is concerned, it is notable that the grant

is available to a very high proportion of full-time higher

education students.    The proportion would be higher still if

discretionary awards were included; but for comparative purposes

the charts cover only central government support.

8. The value of the grant in Britain is also relatively high.

As Chart A shows, the maximum support available is higher in a

number of other countries, but in many means-testing is applied

more severely.    Students in France, Ireland, Japan, Norway, Spain

and West Germany consequently receive less support than they

would in Britain with comparable parental means.

9. By international standards, the British system is generous in

the level of the grant after means-testing, in the proportion of

full-time higher education students provided for, and in

including free tuition.    No other country attempts to provide

support at this level to such a high proportion of these

students.    Generally, the expectation that parents will provide

for their student offspring is stronger in other countries than

in Britain.

10. The comparisons in Chart A are based on purchasing power

parities, which value currencies according to the local cost of

goods and services.    The effect is to show the value of student

support in countries where the cost of living is high - such as

Germany or Scandinavia - as less than exchange rates would

3


suggest.    This basis gives the fairest impression of what goodsf

and services a student can in practice buy with the support

available.

11.    Table 1 compares loan terms in countries where loans apply|r.

The loans are interest-free in West Germany, and in the very l|.

small schemes operating in France and Japan.    Otherwise, although

interest is generally subsidised, it is in many cases close to J

commercial rates.

12. The interest-free loans in France are available to help

students with financial emergencies, not for routine living

costs.    In 1985-86 under 1% of the student population received

such loans, averaging  625.    In Australia government funds

allocated to institutions similarly provide for emergencies. I

1986 about 3% of students received loans averaging  250.

13. Several countries are reconsidering their student support

arrangements.    Both Denmark and Sweden plan to increase the

proportion of grant, and reduce the proportion of loan, in theii

support systems.    The present Dutch system, relatively recently

introduced, is also subject to review.    In Australia, the

Government is introducing a reform affecting tuition rather thai

living costs: students are to be required to repay about 20% of

the tuition costs of the courses they have attended through an

income tax surcharge.

USA

14. The charts do not attempt to summarise the complex

arrangements developed in the United States.    Students rely on i

combination of Federal, State and institutional funds, and

financial aid officers in institutions help them draw up

individual support packages.

15. Federal grants are available under the Pell Grant Program

(maximum  1,315 pa in 1986-87); the Federal Supplemental

Opportunity Grant Program (maximum  2,285, or one half of the

total support provided from other sources, whichever is less);

and, where matching funds are provided by individual States, thi

State Student Incentive Grant Program (maximum  1,430). Federa

loans are available under the Robert T Stafford Loans Program,

formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan Program (maximum  9,857 fo

an undergraduate course) and the Perkins Loan Program (maximum

5


 9,855 for an undergraduate course).    Students may also

participate in the College Work-Study Program, under which jobs

are available in higher education institutions or in other

public or private non-profit organisations: funding is divided

between the individual institutions (20%) and Federal Government.

16. Students&apos; financial resources determine the amounts

available from the federally funded schemes.    Pell Grants, which

serve as the foundation for other Federal grant, work and loan

schemes, and Perkins Loans are targeted at students from low-

income backgrounds; students from families with above-average

incomes cannot generally receive assistance under either. Funds

provided by the Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant Program,

which are administered by individual institutions, and the State

Student Incentive Grant Program, administered by each State, are

allocated to students in particular need, most typically to those

in receipt of Pell Grants.    Students in need receive first

consideration for part-time employment under the College Work-

Study Program.    Eligibility for Stafford Loans is somewhat wider;

however, students whose families have above a moderate income

(about  17,000 in 1986-87) must demonstrate financial need.

17. In 1986-87 18% of the 11.2m undergraduates received Pell

Grants of on average  850.    Five per cent received Supplemental

Educational Opportunity Grants of on average  415, and about half

that number received State Student Incentive Grants averaging

 285.    Loans to the 20% of undergraduates who took up Stafford

Loans averaged  1,305, and the 5% using Perkins Loans received on

average  600.     About 5% of undergraduates had earnings under the

College Work-Study Program, averaging  560.

18. In addition to Federal funds, all State governments provide

some form of financial assistance to needy students.    There is

wide variation in amounts.    In total, State aid in 1984-85 came

6


to  715m - about 10% of the value of Federal funding for student]

support.

19. The higher education institutions are the third main source

of support.    In 1984-85 institutional aid amounted to  1.5bn -

about the equivalent of 20% of the Federal programme.

20. Students are required to pay their own tuition fees. In

1984-85 these averaged  280 at publicly maintained institutions!!

and  3,033 at private institutions.    The fee due is however taken

into account in the assessment of grant or loan entitlement, and

many institutions provide direct assistance to needy students.

21. Forty-six per cent of all undergraduates received some sorB

of financial aid during the 1986-87 academic year. Thirty-fivel

per cent received aid from the Federal Government, 15% State aidj

14% institutional aid and 7% assistance from other sources, such

as scholarships and sponsorships.    The average amount of aid

received was  2,180.    Federal assistance averaged  1,700 per

student aided, State assistance  730, institutional aid  1,200,1

and other forms of support  810.    Forty-one per cent of those whd

received aid relied only on grants.    Fifteen per cent received

only loans.    The remainder depended on a combination of grants,!

loans, work-study and other sources.

22. Repayment of the Perkins and Stafford Loans begins six

months after completion of studies and must generally be

completed within five to ten years.    Fixed interest rates of 5% I

(Perkins) and 8% (Stafford Loans) are applied from the beginning!

of the repayment period.    Repayments may be deferred if the

borrower continues in education with assistance under either

scheme, is unemployed, joins military service, the Peace Corps oi

the domestic ACTION programme, or if the borrower is a woman wita

pre-school age children who is just entering the work force.

Once repayments have started they must continue without further I

7


deferral.    The debt can be reduced if the borrower becomes a

full-time teacher of a shortage subject, and is cancelled in

cases of permanent total disablement.    The default rate on the

Stafford Loans is about 7%, and about 13% for Perkins Loans.

23. Revisions of these programmes planned for 1988-89 will

increase students&apos; dependence on loans, through an expansion of

the Stafford Loans Program in particular.    Requirements for the

institutions to provide matching funding are also to be

increased1.

Sharing of Costs

24. A recent study calculated the relative shares of parents,

the individual student, the state and philanthropic funding in

five countries.    The author took account of a range of parental

incomes, in order to show the effects of means-testing. The

results of this analysis are reproduced below in Charts C, D and

E, showing low, middle and high income backgrounds respectively.

Charts C, D and E2

1 Italy is also not represented on Charts A and B.

Educational allowances are awarded on a competitive basis by each

region to students whose parental income does not exceed  2,005

p.a.  (1986-87).    The level of support is linked to scholastic

achievement and varies between regions according to regional

resources and to whether the student is living in the parental

home.    The amounts available range from minima of  105 to  210 to

maxima of  520 to  1,040 p.a.

the United States, 198.5-86 (see notes below).

United Kingdom: &quot;Low income&quot; is under  8.520 [S 14,368], which is the start of the

expected parental contribution per Figure 2.1. Total cost is XL&apos;S estimate of  1.945,

per Table 2.1. The taxpayer portion is the &quot;elsewhere-than-London&quot; mandatory grant

of  1,830 [83,0861. The remaining need is assumed to be a family contribution, per

Chapter 2.

Federal Republic of Germany. &quot;Low income&quot; is under DM23,820 [811,028], which is

the start of the expected parental contribution per Figure 3.1. Total cost is the &quot;more

adequate budget&quot; estimate of DM9,500 [84,398], per Table 3.1. The taxpayer portion

is the &quot;effective grant&quot; within the 10-month maximum BAfoG with an 8 percent

discount rate assumption per Table 3.3, or DMT.880 [ 83.648] x (1.00 - 0.297) =

DM5,539 [82,565]. The student contribution is the &quot;true loan,&quot; or DM7,880 [83,648]

x .297 = DM2,340 [81,083] plus one-half of the remaining need of DM1,620, or

DM810 [$375]. The parental contribution is the remaining DM810 [8375].

France: &quot;Low income&quot; is 50,000F [86,720], which is still high enough for a 12-point

family to be eligible for only the third largest grant. Total cost is assumed to be

815,000F [$6,720], per Table 4.6. The taxpayer contribution is a bourse of 10.440F

[1,468] plus 2.000F tax relief for a total of 12.440F [81,672]. Net (after tax relief)

parental contribution, cash and in-kind, is 2.560F [8344] per Table 4.6. No student

contribution is assumed for bourse recipients, per text.

Sweden: &quot;Low income&quot; is assumed to be approximately 90,000 Skr [$12,000], a level

at which the Swedish parent, who is not officially expected to contribute anything at

any income level, would probably be unable to supplement the Study Means total of

31,627 Skr [84,217]. The total cost is assumed to be the Study Means, per Table 5.1.

The taxpayer and student portions are per Table 5.4.

United States: &quot;Low income&quot; is assumed to be in the $10,000 815,000 range. The total

cost and the taxpayer, parental, student, and institutional shares are all per Table 6.5.

- United Kingdom: &quot;Middle income&quot; is assumed to be  15,000 [525,290). Total cost is

N.U.S. estimate of  1.945 [53.280] per Table 2.1. The parental contribution is  1,274

[52,148] per Table 2.3. The taxpayer portion is the mandatory grant (elsewhere than

London) of  1830 [53,086] minus the expected parental contribution, or  556 [S937].

The student contribution is the remaining need, or  115 [5194].

Federal Republic of Germany: &quot;Middle income&quot; is assumed to be DM36,000

[S 16.667]. Total cost is the &quot;more adequate&quot; budget of DM9,500 [55,398] per Table

3.1. The parental contribution is DM5,583 [52,585] per Table 3.4. The maximum BAfoG

is assumed to be DM7,500 for 10 months, DM1,917 [5888] of which (7,500-5,583)

would be awarded. The taxpayer contribution is the &quot;effective grant&quot; of 1,917 x (1.00

- 0.297) = DM1,348 [S624] per Table 3.3, assuming an 8-percent discount rate. The

students&apos; portion is the &quot;true loan&quot; of DM1,917 x 0.297 = DM569 [5263] plus the

gap of DM2,000 [5926] between the total cost and the maximum BAfbG, or DM2,569

[SI,189].

France: &quot;Middle income&quot; is 125.000F [516,801] per Table 4.6. Total cost is 20.000F

[52,688] per Table 4.6. The taxpayer contribution is 3.000F ($403] of tax relief; the

parental contribution, net of tax relief, cash, and &quot;in-lcind,&quot; is 11.000F [51,478]; the

student contribution, 6.000F [S806] in earnings, all from Table 4.6.

Sweden: &quot;Middle income&quot; can be anywhere in the range of 150-225,000 Skr [520-

30,000], as there is no means testing or expected parental contribution. The total cost

is the &quot;moderate budget&quot; per Table 5.4. The taxpayer contribution is 14,134 Skr

[51,885]. Students pay their portion of study means and split the needed supplement

of 5,258 Skr [5701] with their parents, for net contributions of 2,629 Skr [5350] and

20,122 Skr [S2.683] for parent and student respectively per Table 5.4.

United States: &quot;Middle income&quot; is assumed to be in the range of 530 535,0(K). The

&apos; United Kingdom: The total cost is the XL&apos;S estimate of  1,945 [$3,280] per Table

2.1. High-income families are ineligible for taxpayer-borne contributions, and students

are discouraged from working or borrowing, so the entire cost is assumed to be borne

by parents.

Federal Republic of Germany: The total cost is the &quot;more adequate&quot; budget of

DM9,500 [$4,398] per Table 3.1. High-income families are ineligible for BAfoC, so

there is no taxpayer contribution. Parents are assumed to contribute what would have

\ been the BAfoG, or DM7,500 [$3,472]; students contribute DM2,000 [$926] to make

up the full budget.

/    France: The total cost is 20.000F [$2,688] per Table 4.6. The taxpayer contribution is

&apos;     3.000F [$403] of tax relief. High-income parents are assumed to provide the remaining

net 17.000F [$2,285],

Sweden: The total cost is the &quot;moderate budget&quot; per Table 5.4. The taxpaver and

student contributions are 14,134 Skr&apos;[$1,885] and 17,493 Skr [$2,332] respectively per

STUDS


These tables show that, in the case of a low income family, the

UK taxpayer contributed more than in any of the other countries

surveyed except the USA, where the taxpayer contributed a smaller

proportion of a larger support bill.    The tables also show that

in countries other than the UK, the burden that here falls on the

parents was shared between the parents and the students.

These findings are in line with the statistics on costs presented

in Chapter II, which show that UK public expenditure on student

support is relatively substantially greater than in other

countries.    In other countries a higher proportion of students&apos;

living costs is borne by parents, and by the students themselves.

Participation in higher education

25.    The public contribution to students&apos;  living costs has no

direct relationship with levels of participation in higher

education.    In the UK the participation rate has increased while

the real value of the maintenance grant has declined.    The DES

Statistical Bulletin &quot;International Statistical Comparisons in

Higher Education&quot; showed a range of participation rates between

27% and 60%, with the UK at 31%.    Chart F presents more recent

data for a wider range of countries.

26. Potential students&apos; decisions about participating in higher

education do not depend on financial considerations alone. The

chart confirms that there is no direct correlation of either the

quantity of support or its form with participation rates. The

rates are similar in Japan and the Netherlands, though there are

wide disparities in the availability of support. In the USA the

complexities of the system, and the extent of reliance on loans,

do not inhibit an exceptionally high participation rate.

27. Another measure of the effectiveness of student support

systems in promoting recruitment is the proportion of the adult

population with qualifications obtained in higher education. As

Chart G shows, this proportion is high in the UK.

relative efficiency of higher education in the UK, where by

international standards a high proportion of students complete

their courses.    This may relate to the availability of grants to

support full-time study, but other factors are at least as

powerfully involved: the degree of specialisation in A level

courses, the selectivity of entry to higher education in the UK,

and the general expectation that the student phase of life does

not continue beyond one&apos;s early twenties.

30. A common objective for student support systems is to ensure,

at a minimum, that they present no obstacle to working class

participation.    Here international comparisons are particularly

difficult, as the information available relates to the proportion

of students coming from working class backgrounds as defined by

each country - no standard social class classification exists.

Differences between countries on this measure may simply show

that the working class forms a larger or smaller proportion of

the total population in one country than another.    Changes over

time within a country may also reflect growth or shrinkage of the

working class as a proportion of the population.    This measure

does not show whether someone from a working class background is

more or less likely than someone from a more advantageous

background to undertake higher education.    These limitations must

be borne in mind in considering Chart I, which shows the working

class proportion in the student body in a range of countries.

32.    As with participation overall, the chart suggests no clear

correlation between form or quantity of student support and

working class representation.    Its growth in Spain and France may

be attributed to the severity of the means tests applied to the

support, which is effectively available only to low income

families.    The reduction in Holland, Sweden and the UK may

relate to a reduction in the size of the working class in the

population overall.


PERSONAL AND SOCIAL RATES OF RETURN ON HIGHER EDUCATION

1. Paragraphs 2.25 and 2.26 of the White Paper argue that the

personal rate of return on students&apos; investment in higher education

is significantly greater than the social rate of return on the

nation&apos;s investment.     This Annex does not purport to treat the

question exhaustively, but briefly sets out the line of argument

leading to that conclusion.

2. From the point of view of economic analysis, discounting non-

financial considerations, estimates of the personal rate of return

on degree-level qualifications can be made by treating higher

education as a process by which individuals invest in acquiring a

degree by incurring present costs (including the &quot;opportunity costs&quot;

of foregone earnings) with the intention of gaining future career

benefits.     This is an investment decision, and if costs and

benefits are restricted to measurable financial quantities it is

possible to deduce a return on that investment which can then be

compared with the returns on other options open to the individual.

There is by analogy a social rate of return which relates public

investment in higher education to its presumed general labour

market benefits.1

3. In calculating both the personal and the social rates of return

the benefits from higher education are taken as the extra earnings

accruing to individuals because of their higher education, measured

1.     The public costs of higher education are taken as the

costs of tuition; they exclude the costs of maintenance on

the basis that these represent in effect a transfer of

income to students, and do not have real resource costs.

The public benefits of higher education are based on the

estimated labour market benefits from higher education.


by comparing the earnings of graduates with those of people whose

highest qualification is A-levels2.    But to attribute all the

difference in earnings to initial higher education would be to

ignore the contribution of innate ability.    It is therefore usual to

discount that contribution by applying an &quot;alpha factor&quot;

representing an assessment of the extent to which the difference in

earnings is explained by higher education alone.

4. The latest available estimates for the social rate of return are

for 1985.    The following figures show social rates of return

averaged over the period 1981 to 1985, in order to increase sample

sizes and eliminate year-to-year fluctuations.

2.     Lifetime earnings are measured by using the earnings of a

cross-section of people of different ages and

qualifications and assuming that these represent the

prospects for the current outflow of new graduates. For

the personal rate of return to the individual earnings are

measured as take home pay, but for the social rate of

return gross earnings updated for employers&apos; National

Insurance contributions are used. Both sets of earnings

are also updated equally to allow for general growth in

the economy which is assumed to keep percentage earnings

differentials unchanged.


allowance for 2% growth in future earnings and differentials may be

an under-estimate in the light of the UK&apos;s longer-term growth

prospects.

6. Estimates of the personal rate of return on higher education are

analogous to the social rate of return, but cover the costs and

benefits of a degree to the individual.    They therefore exclude

tuition expenditure;    include the value of the maintenance award as

an offset to earnings foregone;    and measure earnings net of tax.

7. On this analysis the personal rate of return on higher education

is a great deal higher than the rate of return to society in

3.     Note to the tables

tuition across all subjects. Earnings figures came from

the annual General Household Survey (GHS). The GHS sample

is around 500 male graduates each year, and after

splitting by subject group and age group the individual

sample cells are fairly small even after grouping several

their numbers are too small to make any difference to the

general.    It is also well above that available on almost all other

forms of investment.    On the face of it, if these figures represent 1

a fair proxy for the individuals* perceptions of the financial

benefits of higher education, there would be a strong incentive for 1

individuals to enter higher education, irrespective of the level of

public investment.

8.    Rate of return analysis has its limitations. Nevertheless, the

conclusion that there is a marked divergence between personal and

social rates of return is likely to hold under any realistic

scenario relating to graduate earnings.   ~~T\\* o-h e r (*w . ap^nnJl*    is I

supported by the findings of other forms of labour market analysis. I

The persistence of earnings differentials over a working life, for

example, is consistent with what is known about qualification-

related employment differences at various ages. The compression or

expansion of earnings differentials over particular periods of time I

also seems to reflect evidence from first destinations surveys aboutB

the changing pressure of the demand for graduates relative to their I

supply.


THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF THE LOAN SCHEME

The table below shows an estimate of the net effect on the

Exchequer of introducing the loan scheme, compared to continuing

the existing system of support for students&apos;  living costs.    It is

expressed in constant 1990-91 prices.

2. The estimate is based on the hypothesis that the number of

students eligible for loans grows in line with the projection

shown in Chart 5 up to the end of the century, then remains

constant thereafter.    The grant (including contributions) is

assumed to increase in line with the GDP deflator up to 1990-91.

Thereafter inflation is assumed to run at 3% annually. The

student&apos;s total resources are increased annually by that factor.

This increase is made available by increasing the loan facility

only.    The grant and contributions remain fixed at their 1990-91

value.    The effect is that over time the loan facility

represents an increasing proportion of the student&apos;s total

resources.    This continues up to 2007-08, when the loan and the

grant (including contributions) are roughly equal. Thereafter

the annual uprating for inflation is applied to the two

components equally.    For the purpose of estimating the cost of

continuing present policies,  it is assumed that the average

welfare benefit receipts of the students remain constant at the

forecast 1990-91 level.

3. The estimate of the outlay on loans is highly sensitive to

the assumptions made about the numbers taking advantage of the

loan facility and the size of their loan.    The estimate is based

on the assumption that 80% of the loan facility available each

year is taken up.    That is consistent with 80% of eligible

students taking up the full facility, or all taking up 80% of the

facility, or some mix of the two.    An 80% take-up rate is high by


comparison with loan schemes operating in other countries: the

estimate is deliberately conservative. If take-up were lower,

loan outgoings would be reduced, as would eventual repayments.

4. The estimate of repayments depends on the assumptions made

about prospects for graduate employment and earnings, and about]

the numbers whose repayments are deferred or who default.    For i

this purpose a cross-sectional analysis of graduate earnings has

been undertaken, based on the General Household Survey, so as to

construct a profile of graduate earnings over time. An

adjustment is included for women&apos;s rate of participation in the|

labour market.    On that basis, the estimate takes the assumption

that between 10% and 15% of graduates will be unable to make

their repayments in any year because their income is low, and

that of the remainder a further 10% will default.    These again

are deliberately conservative assumptions.

5. The estimate is based on the repayment regime described as

Option A: repayments are deferred when income is less than 85% of

the national average, and the repayment period is fixed in

relation to the size of debt, being five years on average

initially, rising to ten years on average from the turn of the

century.    Other regimes would affect the pace at which repayments

counter-balance outgoings.

6. The table projects the financial effects of the new regime ut

to the year 2027 (years are academic years).    Beyond that date,!

loan outgoings and repayments stabilise, subject to fluctuations

resulting from changes in student numbers.    In the table, plus

figures are costs, minus figures are savings.    The basis is theI

United Kingdom.

BASIS OF CONTRIBUTION

1. The contributions due from parents or spouses are related to

income.    However, gross income is not taken directly into

account.    Gross income is reduced by a number of allowances,

parallel to the allowances available against income tax. The

contribution is then calculated against the income remaining,

known as residual income.    Fuller details are in Annex A.

2. This system has two disadvantages.

(i)   The range of allowances is subject to criticism as not

being comprehensive.    In particular, while a deduction

is made for mortgage interest payments, no deduction is

allowed for rent.    A family with a mortgage thus

benefits from both income tax relief on the mortgage

interest, and a reduced contribution, while a renting

family receives neither advantage.

(ii)   The requirement to declare all the details needed to

assess contributions is seen by some parents as a

nuisance or even an intrusion.    Some decline to have

their income assessed, with the result that the student

receives no maintenance grant.    The off-putting

complexity of the forms involved was criticised by the

House of Commons Education, Science and Arts Committee

(First Report 1986-87, HMSO 1986).    LEAs similarly find

calculating the deductions administratively cumbersome.

These difficulties would be avoided if contributions were based

on gross rather than residual income.

1


3. The intention underlying the present system is that its

effect should harmonise with that of income tax.    Where it is

judged right that income tax relief should be given to support al

particular activity, the student support system reinforces that I

effect.    However, this is desirable only if it is assumed that

the income tax system unaided has insufficient effect in the

economy; and if the income tax system is insufficient on its ownB

it is anomalous that the reinforcement applies only to families I

containing students, not others.

4. The effect of basing contributions on gross rather than

residual incomes would be felt mainly in families where a

deduction is claimed for mortgage interest.    Families where the

other deductions are claimed would also find that they were

expected to contribute more.    Families where none of the

deductions is claimed would contribute less.    However, if the

transition to a gross income basis is to leave the balance

between public funding and family contributions unchanged, the

contribution scales themselves would also have to be adjusted.

It is not possible to estimate the combined effect of the two

changes on individual families.

5. The use of gross rather than residual income could introduce

a new set of anomalies - for example, if no allowance were made

for the presence of adult dependents in a family.   Avoiding them

- by, in that case, retaining allowances for adult dependents -

would to some extent reduce the simplification of the

administration of awards that the gross income basis offers, and

would perpetuate the need to disclose some details of family

circumstances.    The present system has the advantage of

familiarity.    The Government would welcome views on whether a

move to a gross income basis would be desirable.


ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS RAISED IN CONSULTATION

1. This Annex examines some of the arguments and concerns

expressed in evidence to the Review of Student Support, and

shows how the Government&apos;s proposals are designed to meet them.

2. The chief points raised were the following:

i. Disincentive to participation: The prospect of a debt

burden will discourage participation in higher

education by certain groups, viz:-

women

ethnic minorities

working class children

mature students.

ii. Influence on subject choice: Students will be unduly

influenced in their choice of subject by career

prospects and length of study.    They will favour

subjects which they see as offering the highest

income, and avoid those leading to occupations, like

the Church, with a low expectation of earnings. They

will also be disinclined to enter prolonged

professional training - such as in medicine.

iii. Effect on length of study and performance: In order to

reduce or avoid debt, students will seek part-time

employment when they might be studying.    This will

extend the period of their studies, or cause them to

perform poorly - or both.    More students will fail to

complete their courses.

1


iv. Bidding up salaries: Graduates with loans to repay will

seek higher salaries.    Employers will have to meet the

.....

v. Recovery of debt: Student debts will be unsecured. The

administration of a loan scheme will be a headache, and

a high rate of defaults on loan repayments must be

expected.

3. These arguments were carefully studied in the review, in the

light of the experience of other countries with established loan

systems.    Indisputably a sudden switch from a grant system to af

100% loan system, with commercial interest rates and an

inflexible repayment regime, would put access to higher education

at risk.    But the Government&apos;s proposals for the gradual

introduction of a low-interest top-up loan with repayments

related to earnings are designed to meet these objections fully!

Disincentive to women

4. Apart from the scaling of repayments to income, women will

be protected by the additional safeguard that spouses&apos; incomes

will not be taken into account in calculating loan repayments.

Thus no repayment will be due while a woman graduate&apos;s family

responsibilities keep her out of the labour market. Overseas

experience, reviewed by the National Union of Students1, shows no

correlation between the use of loans and reduced female

Disincentive to lower socio-economic groups

5.    The argument here rests on two premises:  that children from

the less advantaged groups are less likely than middle-class

children to see higher education as a worthwhile investment, and

that they are less willing to incur debt for an investment in

their own future.    To the extent that the first is true, however,

it acts already as a disincentive, since the decision to enter

higher education involves foregoing present earnings.    That the

introduction of a loan element will compound the disincentive

involves an unproven cultural assumption.    The growth in recent

years, and across all social classes, of all forms of credit

dependence - mortgages, credit cards, and hire purchase - is a

strong argument to the contrary.    Chart A shows that the

proportion of unskilled manual workers using mortgage finance for

house purchase has more than doubled (from 11% to 29%) between

1970 and 1985, while the increase among professionals (from 57%

to 76%) has been much slower.

For everyday purchases, all groups used credit to roughly the

same extent in 1985, with skilled manual workers most likely to

use credit (63%) and unskilled manual workers least likely (53%);

at the same time 59% of professionals were using credit2.

6.    Evidence from overseas on the relationship between loans and

representation of the lower socio-economic groups in higher

education does not establish that they have a deterrent effect.

The study by the National Union of Students concluded that such

an effect could be observed in other countries, but the data

presented do not bear this out.    Though the study finds evidence

of some decline in working class participation in a number of the

countries surveyed, it fails to explore alternative

explanations3.    On the information about participation rates

overseas studied by the review group, and summarised in Annex C,

there is no evidence that use of loans in student support systems

elsewhere has in practice had the effect of reducing

representation of lower socio-economic groups.

3 The evidence quoted from Denmark showed a reduction in

working class representation at Copenhagen university, but the

study did not explore how far that was attributable to the

decline noted in employment and income prospects for graduates,

rather than to the existence of loans.    In the case of Sweden, a

decline in the proportion of students from working class or

farming backgrounds in post-secondary education was correlated

with the decline in the ratio of grants to loans since 1965, and

attributed to a greater unwillingness to borrow.    But the study

did not explore alternative explanations, such as the growing

availability of vocational training as an alternative to higher

education, or a decline in the value of a degree in the labour

market, to both of which working class students might have been

more sensitive.    For the USA, the data showed a decline in lower-

income participation between 1969 and 1974, but then some

recovery by 1981: the relationship of this to social or labour

market conditions, or changes in the support regime, was not

explored.    For the last country studied, Canada, figures for male

students at Ontario University showed that the proportion from

higher income backgrounds had grown between 1971 and 1981.

However, the figures also showed that the proportion of higher-

income families in the population had grown over the same period

at a faster rate.    The result was that the participation rate for

students from higher income backgrounds had in fact fallen over

the period, while that for students from lower income bands had

in general remained static or risen.

Disincentive to mature students

7. It is argued that mature students with family V

responsibilities will be unwilling to borrow to meet everyday

expenses.    However, preliminary findings from the survey of suchl

students&apos;  income and expenditure indicate that tney already incur

substantial debts under the present system.    For them, access to

a loan on terms considerably more favourable than are available

commercially will come as a help.   Moreover, the loan facility

will continue to be available up to the age of 50: in other

countries the age-limit for obtaining a loan is commonly 30.

Influence on subject choice

8. Students&apos; choice of subject is influenced by a variety of

considerations.    One is the economic judgement: the return in

expected remuneration as weighed against the sacrifice in present

earnings.    For many students this is not the decisive factor.

They may have a vocation towards employment not attracting high I

remuneration, or they may choose non-vocational subjects to which

their interests, abilities and natural bent incline them.

Subject choice is also constrained by the availability of places

9. In the Government&apos;s view subject choice should continue to

be a matter of personal preference, but that preference needs tc

be informed by a better educated understanding of the needs of

the employment market, and the future rewards associated with

particular lines of study and professional preparation.   A systen

of support which requires no contribution by the student

undermines the realism of subject choice by providing excessive I

insulation from its economic implications.    That is in the

interests neither of the student nor of the economy.

Length of study and performance

10. During the course, partial dependence on a loan may

introduce conflicting pressures.    Some students may seek part-
