YH^S^POCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT

CABINET

broadcasting white paper

Memorandum by trfe^&amp;e^etary of State for the Home Department

1. This paper summarise^^^tk key points in the proposed

White Paper on the future of ^broadcasting (copy attached)  and sets

out my handling proposals.

BACKGROUND &lt;yll/&gt;

2. Our last Manifesto included a^c^hiitment to bring forward major

broadcasting legislation in the cou  e^f this Parliament. It

indicated that our objectives for braJ sft|tf ting were &quot;to provide -

consumers with a wider range of progranroa^f to encourage independent

producers, and to preserve the high stancferds which we have

traditionally enjoyed in British broadcasting&quot;.

3. The White Paper proposals show how we cart^u*^il this

commitment.    They have been worked out by the MMj^nzarial Group on

Broadcasting Services under the chairmanship of tl^yp^me Minister.

They take account of the recommendations of the Peac^^C\Committee

(in the &quot;Report of the Committee on Financing the BBC^XKm&gt;,   19861

and the Home Affairs Committee (in their report &quot;The Fu^yj?^of

Broadcasting&quot;, June 1988). &lt;v\v/&gt;


&lt; r1ffi^HITE PAPER&apos;S PROPOSALS

4.vv^Cwr general approach is as follows.    The broadcasting scene is

charTcr^ra^yery fast indeed as new opportunities become available.

The les^^ative framework has to change accordingly.    The Government

should non^Seek to lay down a blueprint for the future by picking

favoured #et5troplogies;    rather it should create an enabling

framework v$c k^ncreased opportunities for additional channels as

the viewer chAaarjgs.    More channels, together with a steadily

increasing rolS^for subscription (which enables the viewer to signal

his preferences directly), and greater separation of the different

activities making up^tocadcasting (for example, programme

production, channellyfcaoitaqing, transmission), will bring us closer to

a broadcasting systemma^ed on consumer choice.    Safeguards on

minimum standards to pr^ct viewers and listeners and their

families from shoddy ward^^^ exploitation will remain essential

but they should be able to ex^cise much greater choice over what

they hear and see.    They wil^ be)better served by a more

competitive, innovative and efrajG^nt broadcasting industry.

Certain important positive prog Spaing obligations are retained, but

there is a substantial liberalisal(&gt;on&gt;\Darticularly of ITV, and

increased reliance on choice,rather^xha^ regulatory imposition, to

sustain range and quality. ^X&lt;7)

5.     The key proposals are these: V

(i) a new fifth channel with 65-70%^  Jtional coverage will

begin broadcasting at the start of 1993,&gt;^n ^ sixth channel

will also be authorised if technical studm^^/tow it to be

feasible;

(ii) there will be a new flexible framework pro^jNina

operators to deliver multi-channel local servicesw^Vpa such

combination of cable and microwave transmission (MUwS^^.s they

judge best; ^ll/)


(iii)    the UK&apos;s fourth and fifth Direct Broadcasting by

^^S tellite (DBS) channels will be advertised early next year,

vr^J^h the consequence that five new high quality DBS channels

^hc\rf)d soon be available to British viewers.    Viewers will

conw^t^ to be able to receive other satellite services direct,

but sJfepk. will be taken to safeguard standards on taste and

deceno^^^

(iv)   ^^e^ White Paper invites views on possible models for

the future constitution of Channel 4 on the basis that its

distinctive renu-fe-^is retained and its advertising air time is,

as advert isers(6eilland, sold separately from that on ITV. The

Welsh Fourth Chai^nel)yAuthority will continue to provide the

Fourth Channel irrTOj/a;

(v)    the ITV systemYwvll be replaced by a regionally based

and less regulated Channel)};

(vi)    all commercial sexvj&amp;es will be free to decide their

own mix between advertising a4jcrS\jbscription.    In most cases

licences will be allocated by Competitive tender subject to a

quality threshold; v&lt;^?)

If

(vii)    all these services will be\6ubject to consumer

protection obligations on programme content.    Operators of

Channels 3, 4 and 5 will be expected to sfrS&amp;vhigh quality news

and current affairs programmes dealing wvjtjj^&amp;ational and

international matters and to show the news (fSLpossibly also

current affairs)  in main viewing periods.    Ii^^nd^.tion,

provision will be made for at least one body vfe^fi^.s

effectively equipped to provide high quality news/^xx\gramines on

Channel 3.    Channel 3 and Channel 5 will be expec^jcQ/Q provide

a diverse programme service, to ensure that a minimi^wwy 25% of

original programming comes from independent producers^^jfrfdv to

ensure that a proper proportion of programme material ajtt^EC

origin;


^^Hviii)    the IBA and the Cable Authority will be replaced by an

^--^rtOkpendent Television Commission (ITC), which will have tough

ste J$ions at its disposal including the right to remove or

refi^yto renew a licence but will not have the IBA&apos;s detailed

invo^^enfent in scheduling.    There will be provisions, which the

ITC wl^fc^^if orce, to guard against too great a concentration of

ownershi^^d monopolistic cross media holdings.    The    ITC will

also have\a duty to plan for and arrange provision of schools

broadcasts by independent television;

(ix)    the niwhp4K)urs from one of the BBC&apos;s channels will be

assigned to the /frC^for allocation by competitive tender. The

BBC will be allowe^^w-etain the other set for developing

subscription servica&amp;^Y&apos;wie White Paper looks forward to the

progressive introductioia^f subscription on the BBC&apos;s

television services and^lQ/eventual replacement of the licence

(x) we will proceed witlC^he\plans which I announced on

19 January for the deregulatidn&apos;a/j3 expansion of independent

radio as foreshadowed in the RackiS^Sreen Paper;

(xi) there will be increased serration of the different

economic activities involved in broadcasting;    thus there will

be greater scope for licensees to act as/^ofe&gt;lishers, with

reduced reliance on in-house production,^o&amp;0^bocreased

opportunities for independent producers.    s^l^Arivatisation on

a common carrier basis is the longer term obygtpSfce for the

transmission infrastructure;    and if that cann^x  achieved

promptly the BBC and ITC will be required in the^ijj^&amp;tim&lt;? to

contract out the operation of the transmission sys4 ip^\

(xii) the Broadcasting Standards Council (BSC), esvaWWtehed

to reinforce standards on sex and violence, will be ma&lt;re //\


^^tatutory.    The exemption of broadcasting from the obscenity

^^gislation will be removed.    All uk television and radio

vr^^Hces will be subject to consumer protection obligations,

anocT^a net ions will be sought against unacceptable foreign

saxeA^xte services receivable here.

I. SUMMARY

1.1 This White Paper sets out the Government&apos;s proposals for

broadcasting in the UK in the 1990s.

1.2 The Government places the viewer and listener at the centre

of broadcasting policy.    Because of technological, international

and other developments, change is inevitable.    It is also

desirable:    only through change will the individual be able to

exercise the much wider choice which will become possible. Our

aim is to open the doors so that individuals can choose for

themselves from a much wider range of programmes and types of

broadcasting.    In this as in other fields consumers will rightly

insist on safeguards which will protect them and their families

from shoddy wares and from exploitation.    But the Government

believes that, with the right enabling framework, a more open and

competitive broadcasting market can be attained without detriment

to programme standards and quality.    Its single biggest advantage

will be to give the viewer and listener a greater choice and a

greater say.    The Government is also clear that there need be no

contradiction between the desire to increase competition and widen

choice and concern that programme standards on good taste and

decency should be maintained.    Both are essential if the quality

of British broadcasting is to be safeguarded and enhanced into the

next century.

1.3 Chapter II sets out the Government&apos;s general approach. It

explains more fully why radical reform of the framework for

broadcasting in the UK is both necessary and desirable.

Chapters III to XI contain the Government&apos;s specific proposals.

The main ones are these:

-   Most viewers will have a major increase in choice with the

authorisation of a new fifth channel, to be operated as a

national channel, with different companies providing the

-1-


services at different times of the day.    A sixth channel will

also be authorised should technical studies show this to be

feasible.

The present ITV system will be replaced by a regionally

based Channel 3 with positive programming obligations but

also greater freedom to match its programming to market

conditions.

Provision will be made for at least one body which is

effectively equipped to provide high quality news programmes

on Channel 3.

Options are canvassed for the future constitution of

Channel 4 on the basis that its distinctive remit is

preserved and its advertising is sold separately from that on

Channel 3.    The Welsh Fourth Channel Authority will continue

to provide the Fourth Channel in Wales.

- There will be a new flexible regime for the development of

multi-channel local services through both cable and microwave

transmission (MVDS).    This will provide a further major

extension of viewer choice.

- The UK&apos;s two remaining Direct Broadcasting by Satellite

(DBS) frequencies will be advertised by the IBA early next

year.    This will provide scope for two further UK DBS

channels in addition to the three being provided by British

Satellite Broadcasting (BSB).

- Viewers will continue to be able to receive other

satellite services directly, including those from the

proposed medium-powered Astra and Eutelsat II satellites.

Steps will be taken to ensure that the programme content of

all such services is supervised.

-2-


All television services (including those of the British

Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)) will be given freedom to

raise finance through subscription and sponsorship (subject

to proper safeguards). All services (except the BBC) will

also be free to carry advertising.

- A new agency, the Independent Television Commission (ITC),

will be established in place of the Independent Broadcasting

Authority (IBA) and the Cable Authority to license and

supervise all parts of a liberalised commercial television

sector.    It will operate with a lighter touch than the IBA

but will have tough sanctions.    Its functions are set out in

Annex A to this White Paper.

The BBC will continue as the cornerstone of public service

broadcasting.    The Government looks forward to the eventual

replacement of the licence fee which will, however, continue

for some time to come.

- The night hours from one of the BBC&apos;s channels will be

assigned to the ITC.    The BBC will be allowed to retain the

other set on the basis that it uses it as fully as possible

for developing subscription services.

- The part played by independent producers in programme

making in the UK will continue to grow.

- The Government will proceed with its proposals for the

deregulation and expansion of independent radiof under the

light touch regulation of a new Radio Authority.

All UK television and radio services will be subject to

consumer protection obligations on such matters as taste,

decency and balance.

-3-


- The Broadcasting Standards Council (BSC), established to

reinforce standards on taste and decency and the portrayal of

sex and violence, will be placed on a statutory footing.

The exemption of broadcasting from the obscenity

legislation will be removed.

- There will be a major reform of the transmission

arrangements, giving scope for greater private sector

involvement.

1.4 The likely timetable for the main additional television

services in prospect is summarised in Table 1.

1.5 The Government intends to bring forward at the earliest

opportunity legislation to give effect to those of the proposals

in the White Paper for which legislation is needed.    In framing

the legislation the Government will have discussions with the

relevant regulatory and other bodies, and will take account of any

views on its proposals.    Comments should be made by

28 February 1989 to the Under Secretary of State, Broadcasting

Department, Room 669, Home Office, 50 Queen Anne&apos;s Gate, London

SW1.

II.    THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S APPROACH

Introduction

2.1 This White Paper contains the Government&apos;s proposals for a

new enabling framework for the expansion of British broadcasting.

In many areas the Government has reached clear decisions. In

others it has identified options which it will consider further in

the light of comments on this White Paper.    This Chapter explains

the Government&apos;s general approach.

2.2 The Government has not started with a blank sheet of paper.

Recent debate about the future of broadcasting has produced many

valuable suggestions and ideas.    The Government has tried to take

account of as many of these as possible.    The Government

understands and values the rich heritage of British broadcasting:

although its proposals are radical they preserve strong elements

of continuity.    Our broadcasting system has had notable successes.

One of the Government&apos;s main objectives is to enable it to

maintain and strengthen its quality, diversity and popularity.

2.3 Two reports have been particularly influential in recent

debate about the future of broadcasting:    the Peacock Report

(&quot;Report of the Committee on Financing the BBC,&quot; Cmnd 9824,

July 1986); and the main report of the Home Affairs Committee&apos;s

inquiry into broadcasting (&quot;The Future of Broadcasting&quot;, Third

Report of the Home Affairs Committee, Session 1987-88, June 1988.)

The Government owes a particular debt of gratitude to the work of

both these bodies, whose recommendations have shaped or informed

its proposals at many points.    (The Government is responding

separately to those of the Home Affairs Committee&apos;s

recommendations not covered in this White Paper.)


Future prospects

2.4   There are bound to be uncertainties about the nature and pace

of change.    Even so there are a number of developments already in

train which, even if Government were to take no action, would

affect the broadcasting environment.

Broadcasting and telecommunications are increasingly

converging.    Technological developments are making possible,

and very probably economic, the delivery of additional

services in new ways.    By one means or another the limitations

imposed by spectrum scarcity are likely to be overcome or

bypassed.

This means that more programme services will be feasible,

both domestically and internationally.    Some of these will

develop whatever the attitude of the Government.

Technology will make possible the provision of improved

sound and visual images.    A new high quality transmission

standard, MAC (Multiple Analogue Components), is being

introduced for DBS services.   There is also the prospect of

satellite-delivered high definition television services,

using the MAC-compatible system being developed by a

consortium of European industry and broadcasters.

Direct payment for television programme services is likely

to grow significantly.    The development of the market for

video rental and for prerecorded video tape is evidence of

the demand, and technology for subscription including pay-

per-view now exists.

-   The curiosity and range of tastes of British audiences -

which have helped to make Channel 4 a success - will

increasingly influence the shape of new services as they

develop.


The combination of additional programme services and an

increasing role for subscription is good for quality as well

as choice of programmes.    It makes it easier for high quality

programmes to be aimed profitably at particular sections of

the market.

-   As delivery systems proliferate, national frontiers begin

to blur or disappear.   There will be increasing demand from

an international market for programme material. Programme

services of international reach are likely to develop

further.    There will be increasing interest in the scope for

agreement on programme standards, particularly within Europe.

With increasing prosperity, and greater leisure time and

expenditure, the audio visual sector is likely to become more

important in advanced economies.

There is some international evidence to suggest that even

in a more open market, where a large number of services can

exist, a few services become considerably more popular than

the rest and attract much of the viewing time.    (This may be

partly because services with a major share of the market are

best placed to sustain programmes with high production

values).    There will need to be regulatory safeguards - eg on

media ownership - to ensure that the opportunities are

realised to provide the viewer with a broader and more varied

choice.

The Government&apos;s approach

2.5   In a rapidly changing environment, the existing framework for

broadcasting in the UK must change too.   But change is desirable

as well as inevitable.   Through it the individual can exercise

choice from a greater range and variety of services.    The growth


of choice means that a rigid regulatory structure neither can nor

should be perpetuated.    It would not be sensible for the

Government to try to lay down a detailed blueprint for the future.

The Government should not try to pick winners.    It should enable,

not dictate, choice.    A new enabling framework must be flexible

enough to allow for technological change.    As new services emerge

and subscription develops viewer choice, rather than regulatory

imposition, can and should increasingly be relied upon to secure

the programmes which viewers want.    Rules will still be needed to

safeguard programme standards on such matters as good taste and

decency and to ensure that the unique power of the broadcast media

is not abused.

2.6   The principles underlying the Government&apos;s approach are

these.

Broadcasting services must remain independent of

Government editorially and, to the greatest extent possible,

in economic and regulatory terms.

- Because of broadcasting&apos;s power, immediacy and influence,

there should be continued provisions, through both the law

and regulatory oversight, governing programme standards,

including the portrayal of violence and sex.

- There are significant differences between radio and

television as broadcasting media which need to be reflected

in their respective regulatory arrangements.

There should be opportunities for new services to develop,

as the market demands, and Government should not attempt to

determine artificially the relative success of different

technologies.


There should be no unnecessary constraints on increasing

the range, variety and quality of programmes from which

viewers and listeners can choose.

There should be increasing opportunities for direct

payment for television programme services through

subscription, whether on a pay per channel or pay per

programme basis.

There should be vigilance against uncompetitive practices

and market distortions.    Partly for this reason, and to limit

barriers to the entry of new operators in the market, there

should be a greater separation between the various functions

which make up broadcasting and have in the past been carried

out by one organisation.    These include programme production,

channel packaging and retailing, and transmission or

delivery.

The emergence of a production sector which is independent

in that it neither controls nor has guaranteed access to a

delivery system fits this objective and should be further

encouraged.

Broadcasting companies and organisations of all kinds

should be briskly and efficiently run.    They should give

value for money to the viewer and listener and compete

effectively with each other and abroad.    The present duopoly

can no longer be insulated from the disciplines necessary to

bring this about.

Through greater competition, downward pressure should be

exerted on the costs to UK industry of television airtime.

-   Wherever possible the Government&apos;s approach to

broadcasting should be consistent with its overall


deregulation policy.    This is that the Government should help

enterprises to set up, develop and meet the needs of

consumers by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers. This

implies both less regulation (removing restrictions which are

outmoded or unnecessary) and better regulation (lighter, more

flexible, more efficiently administered).

2.7   The Government&apos;s specific proposals are set out in the

following chapters.


introduction

3.1 This Chapter is concerned primarily with the BBC&apos;s television

services. Chapter VIII explains the role envisaged for the BBC in

providing public service radio broadcasting.

/    3.2   The BBC has a special role.    It will continue to be expected

I    to provide high quality programming across the full range of

I    public tastes and interests,  including both programmes of popular

I    appeal and programmes of minority interest, and to offer

/    education, information and cultural material as well as

1  entertainmentIt is well placed, because of the income at

present guaranteed by the licence fee, to provide demanding

programmes of the kind which, as the Peacock Report acknowledged

(Chapter 12.2-12.3), even a fully developed broadcasting market

might fail to do.    The Government agrees with the Home Affairs

Committee that the BBC &quot;is still, and will remain for the

foreseeable future, the cornerstone of British broadcasting&quot;

(paragraph 150).    This does not mean that the BBC has to involve

itself in every aspect of broadcasting, or that it should be

insulated from change.

The pursuit of efficiency and accountability

3.3   The Peacock Committee believed that both the BBC and the ITV

system had suffered from cost and efficiency problems arising from

what it called &quot;the comfortable duopoly&quot; (Chapters 4 and 11). The

Government&apos;s proposals for the independent television sector - set

out in Chapter VI - will mean that the BBC will face much greater

competition.    Over the past months the BBC itself has striven for

increased efficiency and has also sought to be more open and

responsive and accountable to viewers about the way in which it

works.    The Corporation has started on a process of tightening its

management structure and shifting resources into programme


improvements through savings elsewhere.    There is scope for

further progress.    The BBC&apos;s pursuit of efficiency has been re-

inforced by the Government&apos;s decision, described in Chapter X, to

refer possible restrictive labour practices in television and film

production to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

3.4 The Government has noted the recommendation of the Home

Affairs Committee that &quot;the Home Office and the BBC should review

the structure of the BBC&apos;s advisory councils and committees with a

view to reducing the amount of administrative and management work

and the expenses involved&quot;  (paragraph 151).    The provisions in the

Royal Charter requiring the appointment of a General Advisory

Council and empowering them to appoint other persons or committees

to advise them reflected the view that the BBC should be open to

advice from a wide range of community interests.    The Government

is aware that the BBC is itself reviewing the nature and scope of

the current arrangements.    It will consider the case for any

changes in the light of the outcome of the BBC&apos;s work on this

subject.

Commercial enterprise

3.5 Consistent with its Charter the BBC is also taking a more

enterprising approach to commercial opportunities in order to

finance programme developments.    BBC Enterprises Ltd - the world&apos;s

largest exporter of television programmes and also responsible for

co-productions, magazines and consumer products - is being

developed as a competitive commercial company.

The licence fee settlement

3.6 The Government welcomes these developments.    It had already

provided a powerful incentive for them by making clear, having

accepted the Peacock recommendation that the BBC should not in the

present environment be financed through advertising (paragraph


6.15), that the licence fee would be indexed to the RPI, at least

for the three years from 1988 to 1991.    In effect the Government

has applied a double squeeze.    Inflation in the broadcasting

industry has generally run ahead of RPI and the notional base

figure on which the 1988 licence fee was calculated represented

less than the actual level of spending for which the BBC had

budgeted.    This squeeze has encouraged the BBC to target its

activities more effectively.    It no longer tries to get involved

in every new broadcasting development.

3.7 The Peacock Committee recommended that the BBC should become

responsible for administering the collection of the licence fee

(paragraph 628).    The Government and the BBC agree.    The BBC

clearly has the most direct incentive to maximise the efficiency

of licence fee collection.    The Government proposes to make the

necessary legislative changes.    The Government is considering

further the Home Affairs Committee&apos;s recommendation that non-

payment of the licence fee should be treated as a civil debt

rather than a criminal offence (paragraph 152).

Subscription, the licence fee and niaht hours

3.8 The BBC has a role in the Government&apos;s desire to enable

subscription to develop.    Subscription for BBC programmes cannot

be considered in isolation from the future of the licence fee and

the use made of the night hours.    The Government has been greatly

helped by the Peacock and Home Affairs Committee reports and by

the study &quot;Subscription Television&quot;  (May 1987), which the

Government commissioned from Communications Studies and Planning

International Limited (CSP) - later incorporated into Booz Allen

and Hamilton - and by the comments which the study prompted.

3.9 The Government&apos;s consultants advised against the wholesale

immediate switch of existing services to subscription, mainly

because this would result in a loss of consumer welfare since some


viewers would not subscribe to services now available to them.

But they went on to note that subscription already plays an

important role on new services provided by cable and satellite,

and also recommended the gradual, incremental introduction of

subscription on existing terrestrial services.    They suggested

that the downloading of services in encrypted form during unused

night hours would be a natural starting point.    Our consultants

had in mind that subscription offers a means of establishing a

direct relationship between the viewer and the provider of the

television service, and that it could finance additional programme

material.

3.10 As new television services proliferate the system of

financing the BBC television and radio services by a compulsory

licence fee alone will become harder to sustain.    Though the

Government accepts the advice of its consultants that a sudden,

wholesale switch to subscription would be undesirable and

damaging, there should be a greater role for subscription. The

Government looks forward to the eventual replacement of the

licence fee.    The timing will depend on experience gained of the

impetus and effects of BBC and other new subscription services.

The Government intends to encourage the progressive introduction

of subscription on the BBC&apos;s television services.    Account will

need to be taken in due course of the implications for financing

BBC radio services.

3.11 The Government accordingly proposes to authorise the BBC to

encrypt its services so that it can raise money through

subscription.    The extent and pace of the move towards

subscription will be for the BBC to judge in the first instance.

But the BBC will have in mind the objective of replacing the

licence fee.    To provide a financial incentive, the Government

intends after April 1991 to agree licence fee increases of less

than the RPI increase in a way which takes account of the BBC&apos;s

capacity to generate income from subscription.    If subscription


goes well it may be possible to freeze or even reduce the licence

fee.    The Government has informed the BBC of these decisions and

will be discussing the details further before firm targets are

set.

3.12   As our consultants noted, a natural starting place for

subscription would be during the night hours.    The BBC has already

started a downloaded night hours service, in conjunction with a

commercial partner, British Direct Television, providing

information for the medical profession.    It plans to run other

similar services, and also to move into entertainment services,

catering for particular tastes and interests, drawing on its

programme archives.    It will be for the BBC in this area, as more

generally, to decide the best mix of programme services within the

framework of financial incentives laid down.    The Peacock

Committee proposed that the night hours (which it defined as

lasting from 1 am to 6 am) should be removed from the BBC and

other broadcasting authorities and sold for use to provide new

services by the highest bidder (paragraph 652).    There is,

however, scope for new services to be provided in other ways. If

the BBC lost both its night channels they would find it hard to

introduce subscription without running the risk of depriving

viewers of valued programming which they think of as being free.

It would also hamper the BBC&apos;s plans for building substantially on

its initial downloading experiment in a way which offered the

prospect of substantially widening viewer choice and establishing

a firm base for subscription technology.    But the Government

accepts the case for removing the night hours from one of the

BBC&apos;s channels, and assigning them to the ITC (see Chapter VI,

paragraph 6.22).    They could revert to the BBC if testing the

market in this way did not prove successful.    The Government

proposes to allow the BBC to retain the night hours of one of its

channels, on the basis that it uses them as fully as possible for

developing subscription services.


3.13 The introduction of subscription will reduce one particular

drawback of the licence fee, namely its insulation of the BBC from

its customers and from market disciplines.    The proposal,

described in paragraph 3.7, that the BBC should assume

responsibility for collecting and enforcing the licence fee, will

also give it more direct experience of the impact this has on

those supporting its services.    The BBC, with the pressure of

indexation and with its new Board and management team, is grasping

the need to make the best use of its assets to meet some of its

programming costs.

3.14 The Government&apos;s proposals on subscription in relation to

the independent television sector are set out in Chapter VI.

3.15 This paragraph deals with subscription-related points which

apply to both BBC and independent sector services.    It is clearly

in the interests of viewers that the subscription systems used by

different operators should be compatible.   The Government

therefore hopes that industry will work to develop at least

minimum standards, to ensure an adequate degree of compatibility.

It does not at present plan to prescribe minimum standards itself,

but it will keep the position under review.    Both the Peacock and

the Home Affairs Committee reports recommended (paragraphs 611 and

90 respectively) that it should be made a mandatory requirement

for all new television sets to be fitted with a peritelevision

socket, in the interests of easing the path to subscription. The

Government agrees that the fitting of some kind of baseband

connection (of which the peritelevision socket is an example) to

all television sets and ancillary equipment is highly desirable.

While it is possible to connect ancillary equipment (such as

decoders and videocassette recorders) to television sets via the

UHF aerial socket, this will not always produce satisfactory

results, particularly if more than one item is to be connected.

The Government is not, however, convinced at this stage that the

right course is to make the fitting of peritelevision sockets


mandatory.    There are several ways in which an appropriate

connection might be provided.    The Government would expect

industry increasingly to fit suitable connectors as standard

equipment without the need for compulsion; but it will keep the

question of a mandatory requirement under review.

BBC TV programmes

3.16 A further stimulus for change at the BBC has been the

Corporation&apos;s acceptance of the Government&apos;s independent

production targets (as explained in Chapter X).    This will both

add to the talent at the BBC&apos;s - and its audience&apos;s - service and

promote the pursuit of efficiency.

3.17 On the question of programme standards, it should be noted

that BBC programmes, like others, are within the terms of

reference of the Broadcasting Standards Council and, if Parliament

agrees, will be brought within the scope of the obscenity

legislation.   These matters are more fully discussed in

Chapter VII.

Sponsorship

3.18 The Home Affairs Committee supported the responsible

introduction of sponsorship of BBC programmes in the field of the

arts and sport (paragraph 161).    The Government shares the BBC&apos;s

view that any relaxation of current sponsorship restrictions

should not be at the expense of editorial independence or

transparency for the viewer.   But there is force in the Home

Affairs Committee&apos;s argument.   After discussions with the BBC on

this subject, agreement has been reached on less restrictive

arrangements for the broadcast coverage of sponsored events, such

as arts and sports events.


peview of the BBC&apos;s role

3.19    It will be necessary to review the role of the BBC when the

present Charter expires at the end of 1996.    It would be premature

for the Government to express a view in this White Paper on the

Peacock Committee&apos;s suggestion that in the longer term a Public

Service Broadcasting Council should be responsible for

commissioning public service programmes which even a fully

developed consumer market in broadcasting would not otherwise

deliver (paragraphs 682-689).    Experience needs to be gained first

of the progress and impact of the reforms set out in this Chapter

and elsewhere in this White Paper.


IV:    THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION SECTOR: THE RECENT BACKGROUND

Introduction

4.1 The Government agrees with the Peacock Committee (Chapter 12)

that we should move away from a highly regulated television

duopoly towards a more competitive future, for the benefit of the

viewer.    This must be achieved without detriment to the variety,

range and quality of programme services, and without debasing the

content of programmes.

4.2 New programme services offer the prospect of wider choice of

programmes for the viewer, additional outlets for TV advertising,

business opportunities for the growing programme production

sector, and a wider trial of subscription.    The Government

proposes that forthcoming legislation should create a liberalised

enabling framework for the development of new services, subject to

the necessary consumer protection requirements.

4.3 As has already been said, Government should not try to pick

winners.    There is no question   of betting with public money on

any of the opportunities now opening up.    But the timing of change

is important.    As Peacock recognised (Chapter 12), an orderly

transition is needed to a genuinely competitive consumer market.

4.4 This and the following two chapters are concerned with the

development of the independent television sector and the scope for

further, additional programme services.    This Chapter briefly

recapitulates the development of the independent television sector

thus far.    British broadcasting is already on the move away from a

highly integrated duopoly.    The next Chapter summarises the

results of technical studies which the Government has had carried

out into additional television delivery mechanisms, and describes

the respective characteristics of these systems.    Chapter VI sets

out the Government&apos;s proposals for the management of change, and

in particular for a new enabling framework for the independent

television sector.

-20-


The ITV system

4.5 Under the Broadcasting Act 1981 the Independent Broadcasting

Authority (IBA)  is required to provide public service

broadcasting.    This function has been discharged through programme

contractors, nearly all of which are publicly quoted companies

with obligations to their shareholders.    The selection of

programme contractors has been a matter for the IBA. The

Broadcasting Act 1987 provided for the extension of the present

contracts until the end of 1992.    The system has many achievements

to its credit, but is now too restrictive.

4.6 The contractors&apos; main source of revenue is the sale of

advertising time on ITV and Channel 4 in their area of operation.

At present there is little direct competition in the sale of TV

advertising time.    (The existence of different contracts in the

same area for different times of the day or week provides only

limited competition.) As well as meeting the costs of their public

service contractual obligations, the ITV companies pay rentals to

the IBA to finance the Authority&apos;s network of television

transmitters and supervisory services, and a subscription to

finance the Fourth Channel and the Welsh Fourth Channel (S4C).

Companies making sufficient profits pay a levy.

4.7 Channel 4 and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority (which

provides Sianel Pedwar Cymru - S4C) are primarily commissioning,

purchasing and editing bodies rather than programme-making

organisations.    The Channel 4 Television Company is a subsidiary

of the IBA, and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority is a statutory

body in its own right.   Both organisations are funded out of

subscriptions raised from the ITV companies.    Channel 4 has a

statutory remit to cater for tastes and interests not properly

served elsewhere on ITV, to encourage innovation and experiment in

programming, and to devote a suitable proportion of its airtime to

-21-


educational programming.    S4C provides a mixture of Welsh language

programmes and Channel 4 material in Wales.    The Home Affairs

Committee rightly referred to the success of Channel 4 and S4C in

carrying out their remits (paragraph 34).

4.8 The Peacock Committee made a number of recommendations

bearing specifically on the ITV system.    For example, a majority

proposed that ITV contracts should be put out to competitive

tender (paragraph 655).    The Committee also proposed that

Channel 4 should be given the option of selling its own

advertising time.    It would then no longer be funded by a

subscription from the ITV companies (paragraph 660).

4.9 There has been growing concern on the part of advertising at

the cost of television advertising and at the absence of effective

competition in the sale of airtime.    There has also been concern

that the income of ITV, which reflects its monopoly control of a

limited resource under conditions of strengthening demand, has

been deployed in part to fund inefficiency.    This highlights the

disparity, noted by the Peacock Committee, between ITV and BBC

television&apos;s revenue.    It seems clear that the finance is

available to sustain additional programme services, so that the

viewer has more choice.    The introduction of such services will

bring desirable competitive pressure on ITV and may ease the

pressure on the price of air-time.   The beneficial effect on the

price of airtime should not be overstated.    If new services did no

more than fragment the existing ITV/C4 audience the effect on

price paid by the advertiser for airtime per viewer might be

little affected.    But in practice new services are likely to

provide some relief by capturing viewers from the BBC and,

perhaps, by increasing overall viewing time.    Another way of

increasing the commercial viewership would be to increase the

minutage allowed for advertisements, although this has to be

balanced against viewer enjoyment and the impact of the

advertisements.

-22-


4.10 The Government has considered the future regulation of the

ITV system against the background of the Peacock Committee&apos;s

recommendations.    The IBA and the ITV companies have been making

efforts to bring greater efficiency and competition into the

system, including greater use of independent producers. The

Government believes that a more radical approach is needed. This

reflects no criticism of the IBA or its contractors.    But it no

longer makes sense to look at the ITV system in isolation from

prospective additional programme services and from the independent

television sector as a whole.   The Government&apos;s proposals are set

out in Chapter VI.

Cable

4.11 The use of cable as a television delivery system dates back

originally to the 1950&apos;s, when it was used to provide television

to parts of the country where off-air reception was poor. The

cable systems built in this period were so-called &apos;narrowband&apos;

systems, capable of carrying only the terrestrial television

channels, perhaps together with one or two sound channels. They

were thus simply an adjunct to the terrestrial transmission

system.    Several of these older systems are still operating,

together with more recent Satellite Master Antenna TV (SMATV)

systems, in which programme material is received from satellite

and delivered to a limited number of users by cable.

4.12 Advances in cable technology have, however, enabled it to

play a more significant, independent role in the broadcasting

environment.    The development of coaxial and fibre optic cable and

sophisticated electronic switches has given the new &apos;broadband&apos;

systems the capacity to carry a large number of television and

sound channels, as well as other text and data services. Equally

importantly, they can carry &apos;return&apos; signals from the home. This

opens up the possibility of &apos;interactive&apos; services, such as home-

-23-


shopping and home-banking. In the longer term, broadband cable

systems have the technical potential to offer the full range of

telecommunications services.

4.13 The Government has been keen to facilitate the development

of broadband cable, at a pace determined by the market, as a way

of providing additional programme services, developing new

interactive services and also, in the longer term, as a possible

route to increasing competition in telecommunications. The

present regulatory framework for cable was proposed in the White

Paper &apos;The Development of Cable Systems and Services&apos;   (Cmnd 8866.

HMSO 1983), and enacted in the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984.

The 1984 Act established the Cable Authority, and gave it the dual

role of promoting the development of broadband cable, and of

supervising the content of programme services carried on cable

systems.

4.14 There is evidence that viewers in cabled areas have welcomed

the choice provided by broadband cable systems.    But the growth of

new cable systems has been slow, though it is now picking up. One

reason for this slow growth has been hesitation on the part of

potential investors faced by the high capital costs of installing

a cable system and the absence of any significant revenue in the

early years.

Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS)

4.15 The development of satellite technology has opened up new

ways of delivering television and radio services to the home. A

satellite positioned in a geostationary orbit can transmit a

signal in a pattern (or &apos;foot-print&apos;) sufficient to cover a very

large area.    A single frequency can therefore be used to broadcast

a service to a large number of homes.    So satellite technology can

offer its own distinctive and attractive way out of spectrum

scarcity - by enabling spectrum to be used efficiently and

economically.

-24-


4.16 These attractions have been recognised for some time. In

1977 the World Administrative Radio Conference allocated

frequencies for Direct Broadcasting by Satellite (DBS). The

United Kingdom, in common with other countries, was allocated an

orbital position for a direct broadcasting satellite (or

satellites) together with frequencies in the 12 Ghz band

sufficient for providing five television channels as well as a

number of associated sound and data channels.

4.17 Originally the Government envisaged that the BBC and the IBA

might provide separate, competing DBS services.    Because of the

high risks and costs involved it was later decided that the

development of DBS might be facilitated by enabling a service to

be provided by a co-operative joint venture of existing

broadcasters and other interests.    This venture was to have

operated under a new broadcasting authority, the Satellite

Broadcasting Board, whose members would have been drawn from the

governing bodies of the BBC and the IBA.    Provision for this was

made by Parliament in the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984.    But in

June 1985 a shadow consortium established for this purpose decided

not to proceed with the project.    The 1984 Act had, however,

separately given the IBA power to award franchises for the

provision of a DBS service.    The Government invited the IBA in

1986 to advertise programme contracts for three DBS channels

through this separate statutory route.    British Satellite

Broadcasting Limited (BSB) applied for the franchise in

competition with others and were awarded it in December 1986. BSB

plans to start its services in the Autumn of next year.

4.18 The 1984 Act envisaged that the regulatory regime to be

exercised by the IBA over DBS would be a modified form of public

service broadcasting.    (Thus formally it is the IBA which is to

provide the DBS service through its contractor.)    UK DBS would be

subject in most respects to the same standards as the IBA&apos;s

-25-


terrestrial services, except that it would not be required to

provide a wide and balanced range of subject matter. In

recognition of the high costs of satellite technology, Parliament

decided that DBS should have a 15 year contract period, rather

than the 8 year franchises awarded to terrestrial contractors.

BSB plan to provide a news and events service; a general

entertainment service, which will share a channel with childrens&apos;

programmes; and a film service.    BSB&apos;s services will be financed

by a combination of advertising and subscription.

4.19 The Government&apos;s basic approach has been that the market

should decide how far and how fast DBS is to develop in the

United Kingdom.    It has not tried to pick a winner and then back

it with taxpayers&apos; money.    Rather, it has enacted the necessary

legislative framework to create the opportunity for private

enterprise to provide a commercial DBS service.

4.20 The Government was concerned that BSB should have a fair

opportunity to establish itself.    DBS is a challenging commercial

proposition.    It involves heavy up-front investment and requires

the operator to gain a significant audience against competition

from well established broadcasters.    Accordingly, the Government

accepted that BSB should be protected from direct competition from

other DBS operators in its early years.    To this end, it indicated

that it would not allocate the additional two DBS channels until

BSB had been operational for at least three years.    BSB have,

however, recently indicated that they would be willing to see this

moratorium liftad.    Paragraph 6.29 explains the arrangements

envisaged for allocating the UK&apos;s fourth and fifth DBS channels.

4.21 DBS can be used to deliver separate sound and data services

as well as for broadcasting television channels.   The Government

believes that it should be for DBS operators to decide what use

should be made of their spare capacity, subject to their

contractual or other obligations.    As explained in Chapter VIII,

-26-


any DBS radio services which may be developed will be regulated by

the new Radio Authority.

4.22   There is a growing demand for the transmission of data for

commercial purposes, and satellite technology (including DBS)

provides a new method of meeting this demand.    It is especially

well suited to the transmission of data from a single source to a

large number of different points (so-called &apos;point-to-multipoint

links&apos;).    An example would be the distribution of pricing

information by a retailer from its headquarters to each of many

retail outlets.    Such data is generally intended only for

reception by a restricted group of recipients; indeed, it may be

encrypted to prevent unauthorised persons gaining access to it.

Data services addressed to closed user groups are one step removed

from traditional broadcasting, since they are by definition not

intended for general reception.    They are therefore considered in

law as telecommunications services, and require a licence under

the Telecommunications Act 1984.    The Government set out its

policy on the provision of telecommunication services over fixed

links (which includes satellite links) in a Ministerial statement

made in November 1983.    This made it clear that for a period of at

least seven years the Government did not intend to license

operators other than British Telecom and Mercury Communications to

run such links.    But an exception to this policy was made in the

case of specialised services provided by satellite, where the

position was to be kept under review.    The Government announced

last month the names of the further six operators it would license

to provide point to multipoint satellite services in the UK.

These services can include the transmission of data (to open and

closed user groups), voice and vision services.    The use of

reception dishes for satellite signals of all kinds, whether these

originated in the UK or abroad, is also to be liberalised

completely.

-27-


Low and medium powered satellite services

4.23 Low and medium powered satellite services employ capacity on

telecommunications satellites using frequencies and facilities

which are the same as those used for international telephone and

data links.    Up until recently they have not been operated

primarily as direct broadcast services, but have been designed to

be received at the head-ends of cable systems, from where they are

redistributed to individual subscribers.

4.24 Most (though not all) of the services available have

concentrated on offering specialised entertainment programmes with

low production costs.    Services now being uplinked from the

United Kingdom cover feature films, pop music videos, sports,

children&apos;s programmes, light entertainment and the arts. Although

these channels originate in the United Kingdom, they are also

transmitted to other European countries, and much of the material

which they carry has been of American origin.    In addition there

are a number of other services available in the UK from other

countries.

4.25 The commercial providers of these services may finance their

operations in various ways.    They may make a direct charge to

cable operators who take their services.    They may also insert

advertising in their services and, depending on contractual

arrangements and the advertising regulations in force in his

country, the cable operator may show this advertising or may

choose to insert his own advertisements in the gaps. Thirdly,

they may also seek to sell their services to individual

subscribers who are equipped with the necessary receiving

equipment.

4.26 This last possibility was opened up when in May 1985 the

Government announced that it was prepared to permit individuals

who wished to do so to receive television signals from

-28-


telecommunications satellites, assuming that they were able to

obtain planning consent for the receiving dish.    Hotels are a

major new market for film channels, and a number of pubs and clubs

take pop music television services.    A Luxembourg company, SES,

plans shortly to launch a medium-powered satellite called &apos;Astra&apos;

with a capacity for 16 channels which will be capable of direct

reception by UK viewers.   Most of these channels are likely to be

aimed specifically at the UK audience.    A further medium-powered

satellite, Eutelsat II, is due to be launched in 1990.

4.27   The Government&apos;s proposals for regulating the content of

those satellite services which are at present unregulated are set

out in Chapter VII.


V:    THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION    SECTOR:    TECHNICAL OPTIONS FOR

ADDITIONAL PROGRAMME SERVICES

Introduction

5.1 Chapter IV described the recent development of cable and

satellite technologies, which are able to deliver additional

broadcast programme services.

5.2 Because it wishes to see greater diversity of choice for the

viewer, the Government has examined the scope for introducing

additional television services on UHF and VHF, including through

use of frequencies not now assigned for broadcasting use within

the UK.    This possibility was mentioned in our consultants&apos; report

on &quot;Subscription Television&quot; (see paragraph 3.10 above), following

which the Government put in hand work to assess the technical

feasibility and potential population coverage of such services.

5.3 In parallel the Government also commissioned a feasibility

study into Multipoint Video Distribution Systems (MVDS - also

known as MMDS).    MVDS is a technology which uses the microwave

frequencies above 1 GHz to transmit television and sound channels

from terrestrial transmitters to aerials on individual buildings.

It has been in use for some time in the United States, originally

as a means of distributing programmes, and more recently as a

system for the delivery of multi-channel television services

direct to the viewer.

5.4 In considering the scope for additional services of whatever

sort the Government has kept in mind the possible impact on

existing terrestrial, cable and satellite services and on planned

services such as DBS, and also the advantages of increased

competition and viewer choice.

5.5 The results of the two studies were published in July and

[October] 1988, with the aim of enabling commercial operators and

-30-


technical experts to analyse the outcome and indicate to

Government the extent of commercial interest.    This Chapter

summarises the key findings of the two technical studies, and sets

out some of the respective characteristics of the various possible

means of delivering additional programme services to the viewer.

Further terrestrial channels

5.6 The Government has concluded (as indicated in a Lords Written

Answer on 28 July 1988) that a national network, or a series of

regional networks, covering 65-70% of the population, could be

made available at Ultra High Frequency (UHF) from the beginning of

1993, with perhaps some limited coverage earlier.    The new service

would make use of Channels 35 and 37.    These can be received by

existing TV receivers, although most viewers would need a new or

additional aerial.    Both channels are at present used for a

variety of non-broadcasting purposes.    These users would be moved

to other frequencies.    The Government is satisfied that

aeronautical radar - one of the current non-broadcasting users -

could be moved without risk to aircraft safety.   Most video

cassette recorders and some home computers would need to be

retuned in areas in which this new fifth channel was receivable

irrespective of whether their owners chose to receive the new

service.

5.7 In the longer term, a sixth network at UHF covering up to 50%

of the population might be feasible.    But this has not yet been

studied in detail, and the cost and interference implications

could be significant.    Further study is also needed of the

implications for existing users of the spectrum involved. The

Government has put these studies in hand.

5.8 For completeness the Government has also studied the

technical feasibility of providing additional television services

on VHF frequencies but (as indicated in a Written Answer on

-31-


20 April 1988) has concluded that this possibility should not be

pursued in view of its major technical disadvantages.

Multipoint Video Distribution Systems (MVDS)

5.9 The feasibility study into MVDS was carried out by Touche

Ross Management Consultants.    They advised that MVDS systems would

be feasible in both the 2.5 GHz and the 12 GHz bands.    In time

systems at even higher frequencies might be viable.    The number of

channels provided and the coverage achieved would depend on the

amount of spectrum which could be made available for the service.

Within each coverage area a substantial minority of households

(perhaps up to 30%) would not be able to receive a signal.

Aerials would need to be placed at or above roof-top level. At

2.5 GHz either lattice or dish aerials could be used; at higher

frequencies a dish would be needed.    The study indicated that

reception equipment for 2.5 GHz could be bought off the shelf from

the United States at around  250.    Equipment for a 12 GHz service

might, the study suggested, initially cost about double that

amount.   Many of the components in a 12 GHz MVDS receiver could be

common to components used in DBS receivers (as DBS also operates

in the 12 GHz band).    There are signs that, as DBS receiver

technology develops and moves into mass production, the cost of

12 GHz MVDS receivers may fall significantly.

Satellite services

5.10 There are two remaining Direct Broadcasting by Satellite

(DBS) channels from the five allocated to the UK at the World

Administrative Radio Conference in 1977.   There have recently been

suggestions from some of our neighbouring states that the existing

DBS plan should be redrawn.   The Government will examine any

proposals carefully.    It intends to safeguard absolutely any

services, whether existing or committed, in the five channels at

present allocated to the UK, including the three to be used by

-32-


BSB, while considering any reasonable options which offer the

prospect of an increase in the number of DBS channels with UK

coverage.

5.11 Receiving antennae for low powered satellite services are at

present large (around a metre in diameter) and more expensive than

those envisaged for DBS.    As paragraph 4.26 noted, a medium

powered satellite, Astra, is due to be launched later this year;

and a further medium powered satellite, Eutelsat II, is due to

follow in 1990.    The operators of these proposed services say that

most viewers in the UK will be able to receive an acceptable

signal with a considerably smaller dish than those now needed for

low powered satellite services.

Cable

5.12 The development of cable services was outlined in the

previous chapter.    Most broadband systems offer 16 or more

television channels in addition to the four BBC and IBA channels,

and also text and data services and the capability to carry return

signals from the home.    In comparison with MVDS, broadband cable

offers greater channel capacity, interactivity without the use of

the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and possibly better

future picture and sound quality, but the capital costs of setting

up an MVDS system are potentially lower.

Comparative features

5.13 MVDS, cable and satellite services would all cost the viewer

more money than further terrestrial channels for the equipment

needed to receive them.    But, for this money, MVDS, cable and

satellite services would all provide several television channels,

and potentially other services, rather than one or two.    All the

delivery methods, except cable, also have costs in spectrum terms.

Satellite broadcasting uses spectrum most efficiently because a

-33-


single transmitter in space, using a single frequency, can achieve

national or indeed international coverage, when a comparable

service transmitted from the ground would need a number of

frequencies and many transmitters.

Delivery of BBC 2 and Channel 4 by satellite

5.14   The Government earlier this year held exploratory

discussions to examine the possibility of arranging for BBC 2 and

Channel 4 to be transmitted by satellite.    As explained in the

previous paragraph, a satellite transmission system is

particularly well suited to the delivery of a channel on a

national basis.    The UHF frequencies presently used to transmit

BBC 2 and Channel 4 would have been released for a number of

additional terrestrial channels, which might have been either

regional or national.    As well as providing scope for additional

channels, this approach would have encouraged the acquisition of

receivers capable of receiving services transmitted in the

sophisticated MAC standard, which offers better picture quality

and an evolutionary route to High Definition Television, and would

thus have provided an early opportunity for the BBC and Channel 4

to take advantage of these new technical possibilities. These

discussions indicated that, while this approach held a number of

attractions, some of the practical and other difficulties would be

likely to prove intractable in the short to medium term. The

Government has accordingly decided that for the present this

approach to the provision of additional television services should

not be pursued.


VI:    THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION SECTOR:    THE WAY FORWARD

Introduction

6.1 As explained in Chapter V, there is likely to be scope for at

least one further terrestrial channel, with 65-70% coverage, at

UHF, and for the development of MVDS systems offering a number of

further channels.    Cable offers a route to a multiplicity of

programme services and is one example of the convergence of

broadcasting with a wide range of other one way and interactive

services.    Satellite services may increasingly develop for direct

reception as well as for programme provision to cable and other

operators.    The Government is clear (for the reasons explained in

Chapter IV, paragraph 4.10) that it would be wrong to consider ITV

in isolation from other existing and prospective parts of the

independent television sector.    Transmission arrangements and

telecommunications policy are further important - and

interrelated - parameters.

6.2 As already stated the Government does not seek to lay down a

blueprint.    It seeks to create a flexible framework allowing

entrepreneurs and viewers, subject to the minimum necessary

regulation, to decide in the market place which technologies

should play the most significant roles.    Apart from the need for

continued consumer protection, in which the Broadcasting Standards

Council will have a reinforcing and overarching role to play, the

main purpose of the regulatory framework should be to ensure

fairness and propriety in the allocation of franchises, and that

players are operating on a fair and competitive playing field.

But in some cases further programming obligations are justified.

Structure of chapter

6.3 This chapter is organised as follows.    The Government&apos;s

proposals for a new regulatory body for all independent television

services, the Independent Television Commission (ITC), are set out

-35-


in paragraphs 6.5-6.8 and Annex A.    Paragraphs 6.9-6.27 deal with

the proposed regime for Channels 3-5 and any further UHF TV

services.    For convenience, those parts of the proposed regime

which are common to Channels 3-5 are set out in the initial

section on Channel 3  (paragraphs 6.9-6.20).    The section on

Channel 4 and S4C (paragraphs 6.23-6.27) also explains the special

role envisaged for those services in reinforcing quality in the

independent television sector.    Paragraphs 6.28-6.31 are concerned

with DBS and other satellite services.   The Government&apos;s proposals

for local services (delivered primarily by cable and MVDS) are

contained in paragraphs 6.32-6.41).

6.4 The remainder of the chapter is concerned with those of the

Government&apos;s proposals (apart from establishing the ITC) which

have implications ranging across the whole of the independent

television sector.    (In some cases there are also implications for

the BBC.)    Paragraphs 6.42-6.45 deal with telecommunications

issues; paragraphs 6.46-6.47 with financing; and paragraphs

6.48-6.53 with ownership.    Transmission arrangements are covered

separately in Chapter IX.    Table 2 gives a simplified summary of

the proposed programme content requirements.

Independent Television Commission (ITC)

6.5 The Government thinks it right - as the Home Affairs

Committee recommended (paragraph 105) - that all independent

sector television services should be brought within the ambit of a

single agency which can look across the board, rather than being

limited, as the IBA and Cable Authority now necessarily are, to

particular delivery technologies.   The Government therefore

proposes that there should be an Independent Television Commission

(ITC).    The ITC would apply lighter, more objective programme

requirements.   The way in which the Commission enforced them could

be tested in the courts.    The ITC would therefore adopt a less

heavy handed and discretionary approach than the IBA necessarily

-36-


does at present.    The main functions which the Government

envisages for the ITC are summarised in Annex A.

6.6 It would not be sensible for the ITC to take on the

Cable Authority&apos;s duty to promote cable.   The Government envisages

that this will be displaced by a general duty to ensure fair

competition across the independent television sector.

6.7 The Government proposes that the ITC should be a licensing

body rather than a broadcasting authority.    This means that it

will supervise, but not itself provide, programme services,

applying broadly the same light touch regulation across the board.

6.8 There will need to be carefully worked out transitional

arrangements for the handover from the IBA and the Cable Authority

to the ITC, and the Government will pursue this in consultation

with interested parties.    The ITC will need to assume at least

some of its functions as soon as enabling legislation has been

enacted.    The Government is considering whether it should be set

up on a shadow basis after the Second Reading of the proposed

Broadcasting Bill.

Regime for Channels 3-5

UJ_Channel 3

6.9 As the UK moves towards a more competitive multi-channel

broadcasting market, the existing regime for ITV would become

increasingly hard to sustain.    It would be even less sustainable

to try to make all new services conform to the present

requirements of the ITV system.   Many of these were laid down by

Parliament because of the absence of competing alternative

services.    As viewers exercise greater choice there is no longer

the same need for quality of service to be prescribed by

legislation or regulatory fiat.   The point is crucial and can be

-37-


simply put.    When there was only one television channel it was

natural and right for the BBC to take great care about the balance

between different types of programmes on that channel.    When there

are 10 or more channels within the reach of the average viewer he

and she can increasingly sort this out for themselves provided

that the choice before them is sufficiently varied. The

development of payment by subscription, drawing on a new source of

funding, will help to ensure that it is.   That freedom of choice

from a varied output of programmes is the Government&apos;s aim. The

Government believes that the time is now right to make major

changes to the regime for what might henceforth be called

Channel 3.    If Parliament agrees, these changes will take effect

from 1 January 1993 when the present ITV contracts, as extended,

come to an end.

6.10   There should be no relaxation of the requirements not to

show material which is inherently unacceptable.   The following

&quot;consumer protection&quot; requirements will therefore apply to

Channel 3, and to all independent sector television services1

including the new local services discussed in paragraphs

6.32-6.41:

news should be impartial and accurate;

- nothing should be included in the programmes which offends

against taste and decency or encourages crime or disorder

or is offensive to public feeling;

- programmes should omit all expressions of the views and

opinions of the persons providing the service on religious

matters or on matters which are of political or industrial

controversy or relate to current public policy;

1 the BBC also accepts similar obligations

-38-


due impartiality should be preserved in dealing with such

matters; and

the content of advertisements should be subject to the

same requirements, where they are relevant.

Any Channel 3 licensee who fails to meet these minimum standards

will be liable to the penalties set out in paragraph 6.19.

6.11   In addition to these consumer protection requirements the

Government proposes that Channel 3 should be subject to the

following positive programme requirements.    They are not, and need

not be, as extensive as those now governing ITV.    But the Peacock

Committee warned against a policy which they termed commercial

laissez faire (paragraphs 571-573), under which there would be no

constraints on the ability of broadcasters to sell audiences to

advertisers, leading to a curtailment of the range and diversity

of programmes provided.   With these considerations in mind each

Channel 3 station will be required:

to show regional programming, including programmes

produced in the region.    The Government envisages that

this should become, for the first time, an express

statutory requirement;

to show high quality news and current affairs dealing with

national and international matters, and to include news

coverage (and possibly also current affairs) in main

viewing periods;

to provide a diverse programme service calculated to

appeal to a variety of tastes and interests;

to ensure that a minimum of 25% of original programming

comes from independent producers; and

-39-


to ensure that a proper proportion of programme material

is of EC origin.

6.12 Taken together these requirements will ensure that Channel 3

helps forward the main objective of enlarging viewer choice. The

first reflects the Government&apos;s agreement with the Home Affairs

Committee (paragraph 171 of their report) that the regional basis

of what will become Channel 3 is crucial.    The third will ensure -

on the same basis as for national commercial radio services - that

Channel 3 is not monopolised by programmes of appeal to only a

single target audience.    The fourth and fifth requirements will

help to ensure a competitive and flourishing UK programme

production market.    It will be open to Channel 3 licensees to

contract out all their programme making if they find it efficient

to do so.    In addition, the Government considers that schools

broadcasts should not be provided by the BBC alone.    It proposes

that the ITC should have a duty to plan for adequate provision of

such programming by the independent television sector, and should

be able to include the necessary requirements in the licences of

whichever of its UHF licensees it considers appropriate.

6.13 The second requirement, concerning news, would in itself do

much to ensure that the public does not lack opportunities to keep

itself informed.    However, the Government believes it necessary to

go further, in the case of Channel 3 alone, to ensure that there

is adequate competition to the BBC and to guarantee the continued

availability of a high quality news service of the kind which ITN

has provided throughout the existence of the ITV system.    ITN has

its existence by virtue of section 22 of the Broadcasting

Act 1981, which requires there to be at least one news

organisation in which each ITV contractor must be given

opportunities to invest.    The Government intends to retain this

provision in modified form:    it proposes to impose a duty on the

ITC to ensure that there is at least one body effectively equipped

-40-


and financed to provide news on its Channel 3 service.    Channel 3

licensees would be required to finance the organisation and in

exchange would have the opportunity to own shares in it. However,

whereas at present all ITN shares are held by ITV contractors,

under the new provision some shares would be held externally, by

bodies without licences on any television channel.    Eventually a

majority of shares might be held by non-licensees.    The detailed

arrangements need further study and consultation, but one approach

would be as follows.    Initially the Channel 3 licensees might hold

the majority, or all, of the shares in the news organisation or

organisations.    The supply of news to Channel 3 would be governed

by a service contract which would, unlike the funding for ITN at

present,  include a profit element to establish the organisations&apos;s

commercial value.    The ITC would be under a duty, at the right

time, to ensure that some, perhaps the majority, of shares were

sold to non-licensees.    No external investor should hold more than

5% of the shares.

6.14 Although not having general control of scheduling, the ITC

would have powers to ensure that the news service provided by one

or more of the news organisations was shown by Channel 3 stations

and, as already indicated, that this should include exposure

during peak viewing times.   As a necessary safeguard, the ITC

would have power to withdraw, after adequate notice, its approval

of a news organisation established under the arrangements

discussed in the previous paragraph which failed to deliver an

acceptable service.

6.15 The Government envisages that the Channel 3 programme

service should be provided with the same universal coverage as at

present, but by the companies rather than being provided, as now,

by a broadcasting authority.    It follows from this that, subject

to what is said above about news coverage, the ITC would not have

the IBA&apos;s responsibility for detailed approval of scheduling or

prior clearance of particular programmes.    It should be for the

-41-


operators to decide what to show and when to show it, subject to

the general law and the regulatory requirements described in

paragraphs 6.10-6.11.    It would also be their responsibility to

decide on commercial grounds on any arrangements for networking or

syndicating programmes among themselves.    This means that much of

the detailed supervisory work now done by the IBA would come to an

end.    The operators will also be free to decide their own mix

between advertising and subscription.

6.16 In order to create more opportunities for entry to the

broadcasting market and competition within it the Government

proposes that there should be a separate night hours licence, or

licences, for Channel 3.    It will be for the ITC to determine the

exact boundaries, and to decide on possible additional licences

covering other times of day - eg for a breakfast time service.

The ITC will also be responsible for the geographical division of

Channel 3 into regions, whose particular interests licensees will

need to cater for, as envisaged in paragraph 6.11 above. The

Government envisages that the extent to which the regional and any

schools programming obligations apply to any night time or

breakfast time licensees would be determined by the ITC taking

account of the basis on which the Channel 3 licences were being

divided up.

6.17 The present arrangements for awarding ITV contracts have

been conscientiously applied, and in some respects reformed, by

the IBA.    But they have been widely criticised as arbitrary and

opaque.   The Home Affairs Committee saw advantage in introducing a

more commercial element into the allocation of ITV franchises, and

recommended that a suitably regulated tendering process should be

introduced (paragraph 134).    The Government agrees and proposes

that the ITC should operate a two-stage procedure.    In the first

stage applicants for licences would have to pass a quality

threshold.    They would have to satisfy the ITC that they would

meet the programming requirements set out in paragraphs 6.10 and

-42-


6.11 above - in other words that they were qualified to take on a

Channel 3 licence.    They would also have to meet whatever

ownership tests are eventually imposed:    this subject is discussed

in paragraphs 6.48-6.53.    All applicants passing this threshold

would go on to the second stage in which they would offer

financial tenders for the licence.    The ITC would be required to

select the applicant for each licence who had submitted the

highest tender.    Both stages of the procedure will be open to

public scrutiny.    This two stage procedure will provide a more

objective method of licence allocation which will be fairer to all

applicants, and will at the same time secure a proper return for

the taxpayer for the use of a public resource.    In order to ensure

that the tender procedure meets the latter objective and that

there is a fair sharing of risks between Channel 3 operators the

Government envisages that each licensee will also be required to

pay levy in the form of a percentage of advertising revenue at

progressive rates, the initial level of which will be prescribed

when licences are advertised.    This will replace the present ITV

levy.

6.18 The ITC will not have or need the IBA&apos;s present powers to

block takeovers, which reflect the discretionary nature of the

present contract allocation process.    But those buying into

companies will have to satisfy the proposed programming tests and

the ownership rules discussed in paragraphs 6.48-6.53 below.

Subject to these tests and rules, takeovers can be a useful way of

bringing new ideas and talent into television and re-inforcing

pressures for efficiency.

6.19 The quality tests set out in paragraphs 6.10 and 6.11, which

would be reflected in licence conditions, would not cease to apply

when operators had been selected.    They would continue throughout

the licence period.    The ITC would be responsible for monitoring

performance and following up complaints by the public.    The ITC

would undertake formal reviews of the performance of licensees at

-43-


intervals or as needed.    As recommended by Peacock (paragraph

657), the ITC will have power, after a review, to issue a formal

warning (a yellow card) and to remove a licensee (a red card) one

year later if performance remains unsatisfactory - for example in

failing to deliver a sufficiently diverse programme service. The

Government is considering whether, as an additional sanction, the

ITC should be able to impose financial penalties. This

enforcement machinery will be designed for effective use if

necessary.

6.20   The Government has carefully considered the arguments for

and against fixed term or unlimited licences for UHF independent

television services.    It Could be argued that the new flexibility

as regards takeovers (paragraph 6.18 above) will ensure against

the inefficiency or rigidity which an indefinite licece might

otherwise produce, and that an indefinite licence would avoid the

risk of failing interest or involvement towards the end of a fixed

term.    Against this, under an entirely open-ended system

competitive tender would benefit the Exchequer only once. It

might also be difficult for the ITC to secure agreement to any

necessary future structural changes either in licence conditions

or in the system more widely, such as changes to the geographical

framework of Channel 3.   Taking account of these considerations,

the Government proposes that the licences for UHF independent

television services should be for a fixed term of ten years (as

recommended in paragraph 658 of the Peacock Report), but that it

should be open to licensees, during the final years (perhaps the

last four) of their licences, to apply for licence renewal for

further 10 year terms.    The licensee would have to satisfy the ITC

that he was continuing to meet his programming obligations and

otherwise sustaining a satisfactory performance, and the ITC would

retain the ability to make structural changes in the system. The

licensee would also have to pay a licence renewal fee to the ITC,

which would be calculated on a formula based on the licensee&apos;s

historical advertising, subscription and sponsorship revenue.

-44-


Where the ITC was not satisfied that the licence should be renewed

it would be open to it to proceed to competitive tender on the

basis proposed in paragraph 6.17, or else to invite the licensee

to re-apply for renewal after a further period during the currency

of the existing licence.

(ii)    Channels 5 and 6

6.21   The Government proposes that, subject to what is said below,

the same regulatory regime (although without the regional

programming obligations) and the same licence allocation and

review arrangements should apply equally to Channel 5. The

Government proposes that Channel 5 should come on stream from the

beginning of 1993, when the new Channel 3 licences will start. It

will enlarge the choice of a majority of viewers in the UK, and

should bring significant relief to the advertising market (see

Chapter IV, paragraph 4.9), though Channel 5 operators will be

free to determine their own mix between advertising and

subscription.    Channel 5 will not be able to achieve universal

coverage (see paragraph 5.6), but it will be expected to achieve

sufficient coverage of those areas where it can be received to

justify the allocation of scarce frequencies.    Paragraph 5.6 noted

that certain costs would be incurred as a result of the freeing of

frequencies for Channel 5.    The Government envisages that

arrangements will need to be made for Channel 5 licensees to meet

unavoidable costs of this kind.    Bearing in mind that Channel 3

will be regionally based, and that there will be new opportunities

for localised television services (discussed later in this

Chapter), the Government believes that Channel 5 licences should

be national in scope.    Although it sees no need to impose the

additional burdens inherent in a regional structure on Channel 5,

the Government envisages that the Channel could be split up by

time into two or more different licences covering different parts

of the day and night.   The Government sees a good case for such

segmentation, which will promote competition and enhance

-45-


diversity.    It will be for the ITC to decide how large these

segments should be.    Channel 5 licensees will, like those on

Channel 3, be required to include accurate,  impartial and high

quality news and current affairs at suitable times in their

schedules, on the basis explained in paragraphs 6.10 and 6.11.

6.22 Should Channel 6 prove to be feasible, it would be subject

to broadly the same regulatory regime and oversight as Channel 5,

as would be the night hours which the ITC would allocate by

competitive tender following release from the BBC (see

paragraph 3.1%.)

(iii)    Reinforcing quality:_Channel 4 and S4C

6.23 The programming remits of Channel 4 and S4C have been a

striking success.    These remits must be fully sustained.    They are

needed to reinforce the quality, range and diversity of

programming provided by the independent sector.    The Government

does not accept that in future only the BBC need concern itself

with the range and quality of programmes traditionally associated

with public service broadcasting.    By this means the independent

sector will continue to cater for minority interests and provide

educational programming (in a wider sense than schools broadcasts,

for which see paragraph 6.12).    The Government accordingly

proposes that Channel 4 should be required to cater for tastes and

interests not served, or underrepresented, by other parts of the

2

independent television sector ; to encourage innovation and

experiment in the form and content of programmes;    to devote a

suitable proportion of its airtime to educational programming; to

devote a suitable proportion of its airtime to high quality news

and current affairs programmes including during main viewing

2

the precise formulation of this element will depend in part on

the future structure of Channel 4 and its relationship with other

parts of the independent television sector.

-46-


periods;    and to maintain a distinctive character of its own.

Channel 4 would also be expected to maintain universal coverage,

to show a proper proportion of programme material of EC origin,

and to observe the consumer protection requirements set out in

paragraph 6.10.    The Government also envisages that Channel 4

would still be expected to operate on a publishing house model,

commissioning much of its programming from the independent

production sector.

6.24 It does not follow that the present structural arrangements

for Channel 4 should remain unchanged.    It is now clear that under

the present arrangements the revenue from Channel 4&apos;s air time

could sustain its service.    There is a strong case that it should

be directly funded from this source.    Greater competition between

those selling television air time - a pressing demand from those

whose expenditure on advertising has paid for the independent

television system - is essential.    The Government&apos;s wider

proposals for a more competitive independent television sector

mean that the place for Channel 4 within such an integrated ITV

system will no longer be available.    Structural change is

accordingly unavoidable.

6.25 The Government believes that Channel 4&apos;s special role is

best fulfilled by an independent organisation subject to ITC

oversight, but without direct financial or structural links to the

Channel 3 licensees.    The ITC would be responsible for arranging

the transmission of the service, as explained in Chapter IX.

Advertising will be sold separately from the advertising on

Channel 3 or other channels;    while this is probably best made the

responsibility of Channel 4 it might in practice choose to

contract this out.   There are a number of different constitutional

models which might meet these objectives, and the Government would

welcome comment on the best way forward.    The following list of

options is intended to be illustrative rather than exclusive:

-47-


The service on the Fourth Channel could be provided by a

private sector company licensed by the ITC in much the same

way as services on Channel 3.    On this approach the programme

remit would need to be clearly expressed in the form of

licence conditions which the ITC would need to enforce

rigorously.    The licence could then be awarded by competitive

tender, as described in paragraph 6.17.    In particular it

would be necessary to ensure that the Channel should continue

to provide a service which, as well as being innovative and

experimental, addressed a wide range of minority tastes.

However, an express requirement that it should be different

from all services licensed by the ITC could not sensibly be

laid down as a licence condition.    The Channel would be given

the freedom to recover the costs of fulfilling its

programming remit by its own efforts in selling air time,

charging subscription or raising funds through sponsorship.

Channel 4 could remain as a non-profit making body, in

the form of a subsidiary of the ITC, and given freedom to

raise funds through advertising, subscription and

sponsorship.    However, to avoid Channel 4 being wholly

dependent on these sources, a minimum level of income could

be guaranteed.    This would provide a safeguard against any

erosion of the remit which might otherwise arise as the

competition for advertising and subscription revenue

intensifies.    Various mechanisms could be devised to achieve

this outcome.    For example, the ITC could predetermine,

subject to Government approval, a baseline, whether expressed

in cash terms or, as now, as a percentage of the advertising

revenue of the independent television system, to which

Channel 4&apos;s income would if necessary be made up.    For this

purpose the ITC would draw on the proceeds of competitive

tender and the levy.

-48-


A further possibility would be to establish some kind of

link between Channels 4 and 5, with the former pursuing the

special remit and the latter being subject to the more

commercial regime already described.    Such linkage would

enable the operators of the two Channels to plan their

schedules on a complementary basis, thereby strengthening

their competitive challenge to the other established

channels, which enjoy a stronger position:    Channel 3 because

it is already in place, though in a different form, and is

universally available;    and BBC because of its ability to

cross-schedule two national channels.

There are competing considerations:    a fully privatised Channel 4

would have greater incentives to efficiency and the Government

believes this approach would be practicable.    But there are fears

that if Channel 4 were operated by a private company anxious to

maximise profits, it might be tempted to weaken the remit and thus

run into difficulties with the ITC.    On the other hand, if Channel

4 remains in the public sector, and particularly if it does so

under an arrangement which, like the present system, guarantees

its income and accordingly insulates it from any market

disciplines, then the incentive to efficiency will be diminished

and, in programming matters, it may be vulnerable to sterile

elitism or precious self-indulgence.   The Government would welcome

views on these and other possible arrangements from the industry,

other interested parties and viewers.    By whichever means, it

regards the upholding of the remit as an essential part of the new

pattern of television broadcasting.

6.26   The Welsh Fourth Channel has also fulfilled expectations.

It is operated by a separate broadcasting authority - the Welsh

Fourth Channel Authority   - though it is transmitted by the IBA.

It is funded by a subscription levied on all ITV companies at a

level fixed between the IBA and the Welsh Fourth Channel

Authority.   The Channel receives substantial subsidy from the BBC

-49-


in the form of ten hours a week of Welsh language programming

provided without charge.    It also commissions - in general

following competition - original programmes from ITV (in practice

the contractor in Wales) and from independent producers. The

Channel has worked to bring into being within Wales an independent

production capability, operating in the Welsh language, together

with the necessary supporting facility infrastructure.    There is,

unlike Channel 4, no realistic prospect of its advertising revenue

covering its programming and transmission costs, although the

Government considers that S4C should become responsible for the

sale of its airtime, which may of course be contracted out as is

also possible in the case of Channel 4.

6.27 The Government believes that the independent television

services operating in the UK should continue to finance the cost

of the Welsh Fourth Channel (net of its own advertising revenue).

In future the ITC should fix, after consultation with the Welsh

Fourth Channel Authority, the level of the Authority&apos;s revenue and

arrange for this to be paid through subscriptions levied on the

licensees operating UHF services, including Channel 5, any Channel

6 and Channel 4, if it is a licensee.    The subscription should be

expressed as a percentage of the advertising and subscription

income of each licensee, though the rates may be different for

advertising and subscription revenue respectively.    They should be

determined before the companies competing for the licence in

question enter their bids, though the subscriptions required might

in the event be reduced by any contribution to S4C&apos;s costs from a

surplus on Channel 4, if this is a non-profit making subsidiary of

the ITC.

Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS)

6.28 BSB plans to provide three channels nationwide.    One channel

will introduce subscription, but the service as a whole will

provide important relief to the television advertising market.

-50-


BSB plans substantial commitment to original programming, which it

will largely commission from the independent production sector.

BSB has gone ahead (without funding from the Government) to an

extent not paralleled in other countries.

6.29 The Government gave BSB an undertaking last year that the

UK&apos;s fourth and fifth DBS channels would not be allocated until

BSB&apos;s service had been in operation for at least three years. BSB

have, however, recently indicated that they would be willing to

see this moratorium lifted.    The Government has therefore decided

to make these channels available for allocation as soon as

possible.    The IBA expect to advertise the contracts for the use

of these channels in January next year.    This could mean awarding

the franchise as early as June, with a view to the service

starting in mid-1990.    This will account for all the DBS channels

now allocated to the UK.    But it would be sensible to make

legislative provision for the possibility that the UK is allocated

any additional DBS channels in future.    The ITC will allocate

licences for any future DBS services.    These services will be

subject to the viewer protection requirements described in

paragraph 6.10.    They will also be required to meet the positive

requirements on independent production and on EC material

described in paragraph 6.11.    The Government does not believe it

right to impose the diversity requirement, and clearly the

regional programming requirement would not be apt.    The Government

is inclined not to require any future DBS services to show news

and current affairs, though it would consider carefully any

contrary views.

6.30 In the light of these proposals the Government will be ready

to consider, in consultation with the IBA, any suggestions BSB

might wish to make for modifications to the present programming

and other obligations applying to DBS services under the 1984 Act.

-51-


Other satellite services

6.31 The Government proposes to leave the further development of

other satellite services to the market.    But it does propose to

put in place consumer protection regulation by the ITC of the

content of such services.    Chapter VII outlines the Government&apos;s

proposals for doing so.

Local services:    cable and MVDS

6.32 Chapter IV (paragraph 4.13) described how Parliament has

provided a statutory framework for the provision of programme

services locally by cable.    The last chapter (paragraph 5.9)

outlined the results of the study commissioned by the Government

into MVDS, a technology which is also well suited to the delivery

of services at the local level.    This section sketches a new

enabling framework which the Government is proposing in order to

facilitate the use of cable and MVDS for the local delivery of

services.    The details are bound to be complicated.    In preparing

broadcasting legislation, the Government will take account of

comments received on the proposals set out in the following

paragraphs.    The Government does not want those investing or

considering investing in local services to experience a period of

extended uncertainty about the Government&apos;s approach. It

therefore aims to make clear its firm intentions for legislation

not more than two months after the end of the consultation period

(ie by the end of April 1989).

6.33 The Government has decided against creating a specific new

regulatory structure for MVDS, to sit alongside the existing

arrangements for cable.    Rather it proposes to provide a new

enabling framework, which will leave operators free to decide upon

the best mix of technologies.    In practice this will at present

mean a choice between, or a combination of, cable and MVDS; but

the framework will be sufficiently flexible to leave the way open

-52-


for new technologies which may emerge.    The Government expects

that cable will continue to play a significant part under the new

arrangements.    It offers greater channel capacity than other

delivery mechanisms, and can carry interactive services.    But the

extent to which it is used will be left to the commercial

judgement of operators.    Similarly, the present high technical

requirements imposed on cable, which were designed to stimulate

the growth of cable as a competing, interactive telecommunications

medium, will be considerably relaxed.    Subject to minimal

technical requirements, including those related to the Wireless

Telegraphy Act 1949, operators will be free to build to the

standards they choose.    The extent to which they lay down cable

facilities physically capable of functioning as a fully

interactive telecommunications network will be a matter for their

judgement; not one for Government or regulators.

6.34   These new arrangements will be based on fifteen year local

franchises awarded by the ITC.   The ITC will be assigned suitable

frequencies for local services, and will be responsible for

advertising franchises.    It will be for the ITC to decide on the

size of each area for which a franchise will be awarded, taking

account of a combination of frequency availability and market

demand.   The Government would not seek to lay down the pattern

which will ultimately emerge.    The Government does not propose to

impose specific coverage obligations on local franchise holders to

offer the delivery of services to a specified percentage of

households in the area, given that there will be opportunities for

takeovers.    Applicants for franchises will first have to satisfy a

number of criteria (eg as to their financial soundness, and

technical competence), and the franchises will thereafter be

awarded by competitive tender.    Successful applicants will also

have to comply with any relevant Telecommunications Act and

Wireless Telegraphy Act licensing requirements.    The Government

envisages that initially only one franchise is likely to be

awarded in any one area.    But the ITC will have an obligation to

-53-


consider at an early point in the franchise period whether a

further franchise or franchises should be awarded for the area.

While they remain local monopolies delivery operators will be

liable to levy.

6.35 These franchises will be for the local delivery of services

in a particular area, whether by conveying the service through

cable, by transmitting it, or by a mixture of the two. The

franchisee will thus undertake, for a carriage fee, to deliver a

service on behalf of others.    Delivery can be conceptually

distinguished from retailing (ie arranging for channels, either

singly or in bundles, to be offered to viewers, in return for some

financial reward, either directly from viewers in the form of

subscription payments or from advertisers), and also from service

provision (ie making or acquiring programmes and packaging them

into channels).

6.36 The arrangements for cable in the Cable and Broadcasting Act

1984 effectively gave broadband cable operators local monopoly

rights over both the delivery and retailing of services.    (It is

also open to them to engage in service provision, though in

practice almost all television programme services on cable have

been originated and packaged by others.)   This degree of

integration was considered necessary in the case of cable because

of the heavy initial investment requirement.    For the new

framework, however, the Government sees advantage in separating

delivery from retailing so far as possible, so that local monopoly

at the level of delivery does not preclude the development of

competition in the retailing of services.   The ITC will therefore

be under a general duty, subject to the qualification mentioned

below, to ensure that local franchise holders are confined to

service delivery and do not themselves retail programme services;

as mentioned, in the main they will deliver services on behalf of

other operators in return for a carriage fee.    However, the

Government recognises that franchise holders may need the prospect

-54-


of revenue from the retailing of some services in order to invest

in the delivery network, particularly where MVDS is to be

supplemented with cable.    The ITC will therefore be given

discretion to allow franchise holders to retail some services

where satisfied that the system necessary to deliver services on

behalf of other retailers would not otherwise be built. The

Government is giving further thought to the extent and formulation

of this discretion.    The Government envisages that the planning of

the new local services will begin at the earliest opportunity, and

that it might be possible for some such services to be available

to viewers before 1993.

6.37   To ensure acceptable programme standards, a local delivery

franchise holder will not be allowed to carry any independent

service which does not have a licence from the ITC.    In practice,

some of the programme services carried will be licensed under

arrangements described earlier; for instance, a franchisee might

carry DBS services, or Channel 5 in parts of the country to which

the UHF coverage does not extend.    Any other services will be

licensed under the consumer protection regime set out in

paragraph 6.10 above.    Any service which undertakes to comply with

these requirements will be licensed, provided that it does not

fall foul of the ownership restrictions described in

paragraphs 6.48-6.53, but failure to maintain the requirements

would lead to loss of the licence.    Entry to the market will not

otherwise be limited.    The Government envisages that retailers of

programme services will not need to be licensed except to the

extent that they are also service providers or delivery operators,

or themselves insert advertising.    It is likely that, as with

cable, most of the services will be nationally available channels.

But the new delivery franchise holders will provide a route

through which more locally-oriented programme services can reach

an audience, if there is a market for them.    This means that there

will be exciting market opportunities for small scale television

at the city and inner-city levels.    There will also be

-55-


opportunities for groups who do not think that their interests are

satisfactorily catered for at present.    In particular, the way

will be open for services aimed at ethnic minorities.    There may

also be potential for services in Scotland with programmes in

Gaelic.

6.38 Although it is envisaged that the delivery of television

programme services will, to begin with at least, represent the

main part of a franchise holder&apos;s business, they will not be

limited to such services.    They will also be permitted to deliver

sound-only services.    In addition they would be able, subject to

what is permissible under current telecommunications policy, to

deliver telecommunications services; and, provided they made their

facilities equally available to others, also to retail them. They

would in practice only be able to deliver one-way services unless

the area was cabled; and under the prevailing telecommunications

duopoly policy, a review of which is due to begin in November 1990

(see paragraph 6.42 below), these would be limited to services for

general reception.    But, depending on the outcome of the duopoly

policy review, the Government envisages that these franchise

holders might later be enabled to carry a full range of

telecommunications services.

6.39 The Government has not yet taken firm decisions about which

frequencies should be assigned to the ITC for local services. The

band chosen must provide enough spectrum to allow the delivery of

a wide range of services and be available for a number of years

ahead.    The 2.5 GHz band is one possibility which has been widely

canvassed.    But the spectrum that might be made available in that

band is generally very limited and is likely to be needed for

other uses in the early to mid 1990s as the spectrum needs of

mobile radio expand.    The 12 GHz band offers the prospect of

compatibility with DBS technology, but there are still

considerable uncertainties, at a national and international level,

as to possible competing uses for it.    Trials are taking place to

-56-


confirm the suitability of these frequencies for MVDS. Much

larger amounts of spectrum are potentially available at higher

frequencies, for example 27-29 GHz or 38-42 GHz.    Such frequencies

appear to provide the right longer term solution but doubts have

been expressed about the availability of equipment at commercially

acceptable cost in the shorter term.

6.40 The Government will be consulting the Cable Authority, the

Director General of Telecommunications and the cable industry

about the position of the broadband cable industry, and how it

will be affected by these proposed arrangements.    The Government

considers that broadband operators already awarded franchises

should be offered a choice.    Either they could retain their

existing rights (ie to retail as well as deliver cable services in

their area) and obligations (ie to install cable) for the

remainder of their licence period; or they would be able to

transform into technology-neutral delivery operators for their

franchise areas.    If they chose the latter option they would lose

their present effective local monopoly over the retailing of

services, but at the ITC&apos;s discretion they would still be

permitted to retail a number of services provided they made their

system available to other retailers as well.    The Government is

considering further whether such a choice should be extended to

the eventually successful applicants for any advertised franchises

for which applications have to be submitted by the date of

publication of this White Paper.    Again, it will make clear its

firm intentions for legislation two months after the end of the

consultation period.

6.41 A number of cable operators have been asking to be allowed

to use MVDS straightaway to deliver services to the home, in

advance of legislation.    They have been seeking to use frequencies

in the 2.5 GHz band, as this is the area at which they consider

domestic reception equipment to be readily available today at a

reasonable price.    As explained above, however, there would be

-57-


severe difficulties in finding any more than a limited amount of

spectrum for this purpose.    It would also be inconsistent with the

general principle suggested above that cable operators who decided

to use MVDS should accept restrictions on retailing under the

proposed new framework, rather than retaining all their existing

monopoly privileges.    There has also been interest from one or two

operators in using microwave frequencies to distribute services to

a limited number of points within their franchise area, from which

they would be delivered to individual households by cable. The

Government will be prepared to consider proposals of this nature

on their merits, subject to the availability of spectrum.

Telecommunications issues

6.42 The Government&apos;s proposals for the independent television

sector are relevant in various respects to its general

telecommunications policy, which is to promote wide and effective

competition in the supply of equipment, the provision of services

and the running of networks.   The present duopoly, which is

intended to allow Mercury time to establish its competing national

network and to give BT time to adjust to its new status, is due to

be reviewed in November 1990.

6.43 In their Recommendation 15 (paragraph 665) the Peacock

Committee proposed that the national telecommunications systems

(ie BT, Mercury and any subsequent entrants) should be permitted

to act as common carriers with a view to the provision of a full

range of services, including delivery of television programmes.

The Committee also recommended that, as a quid pro quo, such

common carriers should divest themselves of their cable operations

and should not themselves provide services over these networks.

The Home Affairs Committee did not find a universally favourable

reaction from its witnesses (including the operators concerned) to

this suggestion, but recommended that the advantages of optical

fibre as a means of transmission of entertainment as well as

-58-


telephony and data should be taken into account in the context of

the duopoly review (paragraph 38).    The Government believes that

implementation of Recommendation 15 in its original form would be

impracticable and could inhibit the growth of competition in

telecommunications networks.    But it, too, sees attraction in the

underlying idea as a route towards additional competition in the

programme services market.    The Government therefore proposes to

examine it further at the time of the review of the

telecommunications duopoly policy.

6.44 The Government has considered the case for relaxing the

present constraints on provision by the broadcasters of data

transfer services in addition to those, such as teletext, which

are permitted at present.    The Government does not wish to pre-

empt the outcome of the review of the BT/Mercury duopoly, and

recognises that whatever is decided the broadcasters, like any

other provider of telecommunications networks and services, would

need to obtain a licence under the Telecommunications Act to

provide any service not intended for general reception. It

therefore proposes to put in place a contingent provision which

would permit these services to be offered, without prejudice to

the decisions of the review, and to be activated only in the light

of its outcome and any subsequent decision on licensing.

6.45 Teletext itself has been highly successful in the UK. It

has provided the opportunity for the development of information

services which are valued by viewers.    And it has also been

ingeniously used to provide subtitles for the deaf.    BSB&apos;s DBS

service will also include teletext, which it will be permitted to

provide on a subscription basis.   With the prospect of additional

channels the Government sees scope for the further development of

teletext.    It will provide a regulatory structure designed to

facilitate the development of new services.

-59-


Financing of independent sector programme services

6.46 The Government proposes to allow all independent sector TV

operators the freedom to decide their own mix between advertising

and subscription.    Aspects of subscription which are relevant to

the independent sector are discussed in Chapter III (paragraphs

3.9 and 3.15.)

6.47 The Government envisages that the ITC will have a duty to

draw up and enforce a code or codes on advertising and

sponsorship.    This should allow more flexible regulation of

advertising and sponsorship than is now possible under the

Broadcasting Act 1981.    The Government in particular favours

liberalising the restrictions deriving from the 1981 Act on

sponsorship, provided adequate safeguards are built in for

editorial independence and transparency for the viewer. The

Government proposes that any maximum limits on advertising

minutage should be subject to Government approval, and that the

Government itself should take power to adjust this limit, after

consultation with the ITC, in case this should prove necessary in

order to allow relief to be brought to the advertising market, or

for other reasons.

Ownership

6.48 With the greater choice and variety that lies ahead, the

Government is determined that ownership in the independent sector

should be, and remain, widely spread.    The existing controls on

takeovers will be removed.    The underlying thrust will be that the

ITC&apos;s regulation should bite on performance rather than through an

extensive and rigid set of disqualifications, although some

disqualifications will be necessary.    But clear rules will also be

needed which impose limits on concentration of ownership and on

excessive cross-media ownership, in order to keep the market open

for newcomers and to prevent any tendency towards editorial

-60-


uniformity or domination by a few groups.    The Government proposes

to make the greatest possible use of subordinate legislation for

such rules in order to ensure maximum flexibility in catering

quickly for changing circumstances.    The Government would welcome

comments on the scope and formulation of such rules.

6.49 The Government envisages that local authorities and bodies

whose objects are wholly or mainly of a religious or political

nature (and also bodies which are affiliated to or controlled by

such bodies) will be disqualified from holding any ITC licence.

6.50 The Government believes that the present position that ITV

and DBS franchises may not be controlled by non-EC companies

should be maintained for DBS and applied to Channels 3, 4 (if

provided by a separate licensee) and 5, and any further UHF

services.    It will consider further the question of whether this

restriction should apply also to local technology-neutral delivery

operators.

6.51 In the case of licences to provide Channel 3, 4 (if provided

by a separate licensee) 5 or any further UHF services the

following further restrictions will apply

- no group may control or have an interest in more than two

such licences

no group may control or have an interest in more than one

such licence if they cover the same area

- no group holding a licence with cross regional coverage

may hold or have an interest in any other licence covered

in this paragraph.

6.52   In the case of licences to deliver locally delivered

services, the Government envisages in broad outline that the ITC

-61-


will have duties to enforce separation between the delivery and

retailing of services (subject to the discretion referred to in

paragraph 6.34 above), to prevent any one group or interest from

achieving a dominant position, and where feasible to promote

competition in the delivery of locally delivered services.

6.53   The Government is considering what further rules additional

to current competition legislation are needed to restrict

concentrations of ownership.   The Government would welcome

comments on the implications of basing these rules   on the

following general principles:

no licence holder for a particular area should control

other broadcast media for that area

no licence holder for a service with national coverage

using UK broadcasting frequencies should have an interest

in any other services or broadcast media with such

coverage (subject to the preservation of the position of

the shareholders in BSB for the duration of its franchise)

ownership of services not using UK broadcasting

frequencies, but receivable in the UK should, as the

Home Affairs Committee recommended (paragraph 43), be

capable of being taken into account by the ITC in

operating its controls

at least in the short term, no designated national public

telecommunications operator should be allowed to hold an

ITC licence for Channel 3, 4 (if provided by a separate

licensee), 5, any further UHF channels, DBS or a local

delivery franchise

national newspaper interests in national services using UK

broadcasting frequencies (and vice versa) should be

-62-


limited; and a similar principle should apply in the case

of local services and the local press.    One possibility

would be to follow the reciprocal 20% limit already

proposed in the case of radio interests in newspapers, and

vice-versa.

VII:    programme standards

Consumer protection obligations

7.1 In developing broadcasting policy the Government has attached

central importance to programme standards.    This chapter, with its

focus on the response to public concern about the portrayal of

violence and sex on television, necessarily concentrates on what

are sometimes called the consumer protection aspects of programme

standards.    That does not imply that the Government views the

matter only in negative terms.    In other chapters the emphasis is

on positive aspects of programme standards such as quality, range

and diversity.    The Government has sought to open up and

strengthen the UK&apos;s programme production sector.    More generally,

as Chapter II explained, the greater strength of the viewer in

broadcasting should promote programme quality as well as increased

diversity of choice.

7.2 The BBC, the IBA and the Cable Authority, as regulators of

programme standards, have all accepted similar consumer protection

obligations.    (In the cases of the IBA and the Cable Authority

these are statutory obligations reflecting Parliament&apos;s wishes.)

Programmes should not offend against good taste or decency, or be

likely to encourage or incite to crime or lead to disorder, or be

offensive to public feeling.    Special care should be exercised at

times when young children may be expected to be viewing. The

Government believes that it is essential that all forms of

broadcasting in the UK should continue to be subject to such

obligations.    The unique power of the broadcasting media to shape

perceptions, and their influence over attitudes and actions, are

widely recognized.    The consumer protection obligations need to be

properly enforced so that the quality of programming is maintained

and the power of television and radio is not abused.


CONFIDENTIAL

7.3 Recently there has been much public concern about the

portrayal of violence and sex in broadcast programmes, especially

on television.    The Government recognizes that concern, as do the

broadcasters.    The Government has no wish to undermine the

regulatory bodies in carrying out the often difficult and delicate

task of enforcing consumer protection obligations. It

nevertheless believes that further steps are needed to meet public

concern.

Exemption from Obscene Publications Act 1959

7.4 The Government sees no case for continuing the current

exemption of broadcasting from the Obscene Publications Act 1959,

and proposes that it should be removed at the earliest

opportunity.    This does not imply any relaxation of the stricter

consumer protection standards which broadcasters have long been

required to observe throughout the hours of broadcasting. But

there is no justification for not applying the obscenity law to

broadcast programmes, particularly since it already applies to

cable programmes.    The Government envisages that prosecutions for

any offences will require the consent of the Director of Public

Prosecutions, as is now the case with cable programmes.    It will

be a defence for a person to show that he or she did not know and

had no reason to suspect that the broadcast would render him or

her liable to be convicted.    It will also be a defence to prove

that the broadcast was justified as being for the public good.

The Broadcasting Standards Council

7.5 As a further measure, the Government has sought to strengthen

standards and reinforce the work of the individual regulatory

bodies by establishing a Broadcasting Standards Council (BSC),

initially on a non-statutory basis.    The Government announced on

16 May 1988 that Lord Rees-Mogg would be the first chairman of the

BSC.


CONFIDENTIAL

7.6 During the pre-statutory phase the Council&apos;s role is to:

draw up, in consultation with the broadcasting

authorities and the other responsible bodies in the

broadcasting, cable and video fields, a code on the

portrayal of sex and violence and standards of taste and

decency;

monitor and report on the portrayal of violence and sex,

and standards of taste and decency, in television and

radio programmes received in the UK and in video works;

receive, consider and make findings on complaints and

comments from individuals and organisations on matters

within its competence and ensure that such findings are

effectively publicised;

undertake research on matters such as the nature and

effects on attitudes and behaviour of the portrayal of

violence and sex in television and radio programmes and

in video works;

prepare an annual report, which the Home Secretary will

lay before Parliament and publish.

7.7 In addition, the Council is consulted by the Government on

the implications, for the matters within its remit, of the

negotiations under way in Europe for the regulation of

transfrontier broadcasting, and on the implementation of the

result of those negotiations.

7.8 The Home Affairs Committee particularly welcomed the

inclusion of research in the BSC&apos;S remit, and recommended that the

BSC should base its role in a changing broadcasting environment on

- 67 -


CONFIDENTIAL

properly researched findings (paragraph 117).    Both the Government

and the BSC recognize the importance of this aspect of its work.

7.9 Since his appointment Lord Rees-Mogg has, among other things,

been discussing with the relevant bodies the adequacy of

arrangements for enforcing proper standards in relation to

imported fictional material; and how best they should publicise

the Council&apos;s views on programmes and programme standards. The

Government will frame its proposals for the statutory powers of

the BSC in the light of these discussions, and experience of the

working of the Council.

7.10 It would be possible to provide in the legislation for the

Broadcasting Standards Council to be combined with the

Broadcasting Complaints Commission (BCC), which deals with

complaints of unfair treatment and invasion of privacy.    It would

arguably be more rational and less confusing to the viewer and

listener to bring the current functions of the BSC and the BCC

together under a single body.    This need not preclude the

operation of separate panels for the two distinct functions. The

Government is also considering whether the BCC&apos;s current powers to

require the broadcasters to publish its findings and to help it in

its consideration of complaints should be extended to the work now

undertaken by the BSC.    The Government will reach conclusions on

these matters in the light of experience of the working of the

BSC, and after consulting both the BSC and the BCC.

Regulation of satellite services

7.11 Another area in which the Government sees a need for further

action is that of satellite programme services other than high

power direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS) services.    The latter

are already covered by the Cable and Broadcasting Act 1984. Other

satellite services fall to be regulated by the Cable Authority if

they are taken by UK cable systems - as nearly all of them at

- 68 -


confidential

present are.    But since 1985 direct reception of low and medium

power satellite services has been permitted in the UK. Such

services,  if not taken by cable, are not now subject to UK

regulation.    The Government proposes to close this regulatory gap.

It is not causing problems at present.    But the Government thinks

it right to put in place safeguards against the possible future

development of unacceptable satellite services.    The Government

proposes to tackle the matter in three ways.

7.12 First, the consumer protection regulation of programme

content by the proposed new Independent Television Commission (for

which see Chapter VI and Annex A) will be extended to cover all

satellite services uplinked from this country but received direct,

whether in the UK or abroad.

7.13 Secondly, the UK has taken a leading role in the work

towards the proposed Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier

Broadcasting.    The Convention is described in Chapter XI. Its

significance in the context of programme standards is that parties

will be able to have recourse to its enforcement procedures

against any satellite service, uplinked from a country which is a

party to the Convention, which falls short of the programme

standard obligations in the Convention.    Agreement on the content

of the Convention has yet to be reached.

7.14 Thirdly, the Government proposes that satellite services

uplinked from abroad should be monitored here either by the new

Independent Television Commission or by the Broadcasting Standards

Council.    If it is believed that programmes on such services are

obscene or grossly offensive the monitoring body will be able to

warn them and, if need be, notify the UK Government. The

Government will if necessary seek recourse under any appropriate

international instrument, or make representations to the

Government of the uplinking country.    In some cases this could

lead to the conclusion of a bilateral agreement.    But as a further

- 69 -


confidential

sanction, the Government is considering the creation of an offence

of advertising on, or providing goods and services to sustain, a

satellite service which the Government had previously identified

in a Statutory Instrument - after notification by the monitoring

body - as having consistently failed to observe the necessary

minimum programme standards.    It would also be an offence to

procure in the UK these things to be done outside the UK, and to

advertise, market, or provide decryption equipment in the UK for

such a service.

Powers of direction

7.15   It was partly with the power and impact of television and

radio in mind that the Government decided in October 1988 to

direct the BBC and the IBA not to broadcast direct statements by

representatives of terrorist organisations, or their apologists,

connected with Northern Ireland.    Such appearances had caused

offence to many viewers and listeners, and had also provided a

public platform to propagate terrorism.    It was right that this

should be ended.    The national interest requires that such powers

should be provided to the Government and for this reason it is

proposed that they should be continued in any future broadcasting

legislation.    Such arrangements are compatible with the proposals

to introduce a less regulated framework for broadcasting.

VIII. RADIO

8.1 Radio is a valued part of the lives of many people.    It has a

lively character and importance all of its own.    It now faces

great opportunities for development and expansion.    Spectrum for

many additional services will become available between now and

1995; decisions were needed on how the spectrum was to be used.

The case for substantial deregulation of independent local radio

is compelling.    There is much evidence of demand and potential for

additional services.    It is feasible and healthy to expose the BBC

to competition in the provision of national radio services.

8.2 Against this background the Government published in

February 1987 its Green Paper &quot;Radio:    Choices and Opportunities&quot;

(Cmnd 92).    At the national level the Green Paper saw a continuing

need for public service radio broadcasting provided by the BBC,

but proposed that side by side there should be additional national

radio services provided on commercial lines to introduce diversity

and the stimulus of competition.    At the local level it proposed

that the BBC should be able, subject to the overall resources

available to the Corporation, to complete its chain of local

stations (as it is now proposing to do), but that local

independent stations, including new community radio services,

should operate under broadly the same much lighter regulatory

regime as envisaged for the new national services.    At both levels

broadcasting should increasingly take place without unnecessary

simulcasting (ie where the same service is broadcast at the same

time on more than one frequency).

8.3 There were over 500 responses to the Green Paper. They

confirmed the view that the time was now right for major change.

The Government therefore announced on 19 January 1988 (Hansard,

Cols 647-649) that it intended to bring before Parliament

legislative proposals based with some modifications on the Green

Paper.


CONFIDENTIAL

8.4    In outline the Government&apos;s proposals are as follows. There

will be scope for at least three new national commercial services

operating alongside the BBC.    A new VHF frequency will be

available for one of these services.    The BBC&apos;s existing Radio 1

and Radio 3 MF frequencies will be reassigned for the other two.

The BBC will retain sufficient frequencies to broadcast its

national services, whose editorial content it is seeking to

strengthen.    The new national services and independent local

services will be subject to a lighter regulatory regime. They

will not be required to comprise education, information and

entertainment, although they may follow a public service pattern

if they wish.    Programme operators will be responsible for their

own services, subject to requirements (set out in full in

paragraph 7.7 of the Green Paper) of taste and decency and of

avoiding editorialising and giving undue prominence to views on

religious matters or matters of political or industrial

controversy.    At the local level licensing criteria will include

financial viability, local audience demands and the extent to

which the proposed services would enhance the range of programming

and the diversity of listener choice.    National services will be

expected to provide a diverse programme service calculated to

appeal to a variety of tastes and interests and not limited to a

single narrow format.    The proposed competitive tender procedure

for national services will be subject to this test. National and

local services will have to keep their promises of performance in

order to retain their licences.    In the interests of preserving a

competitive radio broadcasting market, no group will be able to

control more than one national service and more than six local

services.    There will be a 20% limit on radio interests in

newspapers, and vice-versa.    The Government will seek flexibility

by setting these limits in subordinate legislation.    There will be

transitional arrangements striking a balance between the

legitimate interests of existing stations and the importance of

not delaying bringing new stations onto the air.


CONFIDENTIAL

8.5 A new slim Radio Authority will be responsible for assigning

frequencies and issuing licences to, and supervising the

performance of, all independent stations.   Advertising and

sponsorship will be more flexibly supervised: stations will not

generally be able to receive public authority funding, but there

will be certain clearly defined exceptions.    Stations will be

responsible for their own transmission arrangements, and will be

expected to broadcast on single frequencies unless there are good

reasons to the contrary.    The number and scale of local services

will depend on local demand and wishes.    The Government&apos;s

proposals will create an environment in which community radio,

based on a combination of local identity and cultural diversity,

will be able to fulfil its potential.

8.6 The Government also proposes to provide for any satellite

radio services for direct reception to be regulated by the Radio

Authority under its light regulatory regime.    In the case of

satellite programming delivered to stations, Radio Authority

regulation will bite on the stations taking the service. The

Authority will also license miscellaneous radio broadcasting

services, such as special event and university radio.

8.7 There is scope for a considerable expansion of radio services

and a much wider range of listener choice.   The Government

proposes to help these developments by deregulation and the

provision of a new enabling framework.    At the same time, the

consumer protection requirements which safeguard minimum standards

will be retained.    Public service radio broadcasting will continue

under the aegis of the BBC.   The longer term future of the licence

fee was discussed in Chapter III:    subject to the reforms proposed

there, BBC radio services will continue to be funded from the

licence fee for some years to come.    But BBC radio services will

be subject to a much stronger stimulus of competition. The

Government&apos;s proposals will create the conditions for an expansion


CONFIDENTIAL

of radio which should benefit broadcasters, advertisers and

listeners alike.    In the meantime the Government, as a step

towards the new radio arrangements, has endorsed in a modified

form proposals by the IBA for a limited number of additional

stations operating under present legislation.

8.8   In May 1988 the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee

published a report on &quot;The Government&apos;s plans for radio

broadcasting&quot;  (Second Report, Session 1987-88).    The Government&apos;s

White Paper response (Cmnd 411, June 1988) noted the Committee&apos;s

approval of the proposal to establish a new Radio Authority and

agreed with the Committee&apos;s recommendation that the new Radio

Authority should be funded and staffed sufficiently to enable it

to enable it to carry out its functions effectively. The

Government also welcomed the Committee&apos;s comment that the

proposals that the new national stations should offer a diverse

(but not necessarily general or untargeted) programme service, and

that these should be allocated by competitive tender, struck a

proper balance.

IX: TRANSMISSION

The UHF Network

9.1 The UHF transmission networks run by the BBC and the IBA give

a highly effective service to the public.    They reach 99.4 per

cent of the households in the UK, providing them with a reliable,

high quality signal.    This is a considerable engineering

achievement, and it is highly regarded internationally. As

broadcasting enters a more competitive phase, the Government

intends to see that high technical standards are maintained, while

moving the UHF transmission system progressively into the private

sector, and separating transmission (ie service delivery) from

service provision.

9.2 The Government considers that the best arrangement in due

course would be a competitive, regionally based, privatised

transmission system with certain common carrier obligations. The

route towards this objective is complicated at present by the way

in which the IBA&apos;s system is entwined with that of the BBC, and by

the fact that the BBC&apos;s transmission responsibilities are rooted

in its Charter which lasts until the end of 1996.    The Government

proposes to discuss with the BBC, the IBA and others how the

objective of moving towards a privatised transmission system might

best be taken forward.    It will also be considering how, given it&apos;s

inherent monopolistic characteristics arising in part from

topography, any necessary regulatory oversight should be arranged.

9.3 Until such a system is in place the BBC will continue to have

responsibility for transmitting its television and radio services.

The Government hopes that the BBC will, during this transitional

period, test the market for the operation of its own transmission

system by commercial contractors on a regional basis.    This would

be consistent with the steps which the BBC has already taken to

test the market for a range of support services, as part of its

general policy of devoting as great a proportion as possible of


CONFIDENTIAL

its resources to programme making.    This would be a useful step in

itself, and would also prepare the way for privatisation in due

course.    The advent of new services - such as the new national

commercial radio services - will open up new commercial

transmission opportunities.    The Government also envisages that

the BBC might, in the transitional period while it retains a

transmission role, be able to arrange for its contractors to offer

a transmission service to new entrants.

9.4   As far as the transmission of independent television services

is concerned, the Government envisages that the ITC should have a

supervisory role.    Overall responsibility for spectrum management

must remain with   Government;    the ITC will have responsibility

for ensuring that the arrangements made for the transmission of

all national or quasi-national services - ie Channels 3, 4, 5 (and

6 if feasible) - and the proposed service using the night hours

reallocated from one of the BBC&apos;s channels - for which see

paragraph 3.14 - make proper use of the frequencies available.

This will involve the ITC satisfying itself, among other things,

that the use of the frequencies is planned as efficiently as

possible.    The Government does not, however, envisage that the ITC

should itself discharge the responsibility for transmitting these

services.    In due course this responsibility would devolve to the

privatised transmission system.    In advance of the setting up of

such a system the Government proposes that the ITC should take

over the IBA&apos;s transmission infrastructure but should be required

to arrange for the operation of the transmission system to be

carried out by private sector contractors.    It would appoint a

number of different contractors, each operating in a particular

part of the country, with the aim of fostering a competitive

transmission industry, and preparing the ground for full

privatisation.    During this transitional period the main role of

the ITC would be to appoint the contractors and monitor their

performance.


CONFIDENTIAL

DBS

9.5 Under the existing arrangements the IBA owns and operates the

uplink for its DBS contractors.    The Government believes that DBS

licensees should in future be responsible for the uplink

themselves along with the rest of their transmission system (ie

the satellite).    The IBA is presently constructing the uplink for

British Satellite Broadcasting and will operate it while the law

remains as it is.    The Government will discuss the transitional

arrangements with the parties concerned.

Local services

9.6 The holders of local delivery franchises will be responsible

for making their own transmission arrangements though they will be

subject to ITC oversight, especially since it will be responsible

for planning the use of the frequencies allocated to it for this

purpose, and for providing advice to Government on coordination

and international clearance for the use of the frequencies. It

will be open to the operators to have an in-house transmission

operation.    If they choose not to undertake this themselves they

may make arrangements with a separate private sector company,

including those companies undertaking UHF transmission work under

the arrangements described earlier in this Chapter.


CONFIDENTIAL

X:    PROGRAMME PRODUCTION

10.1 The Government&apos;s enabling framework approach will enlarge

not only choice for the viewer but also opportunities for service

providers, including technicians and engineers, producers,

writers, film makers and those with the entrepreneurial skill to

bring projects to fruition.

The independent productions initiative

10.2 Traditionally, broadcasters in the UK have themselves made

the television programmes they have not acquired from abroad.

Channel 4 broke this mould.    The results have exceeded all

expectations.    Independent producers constitute an important

source of originality and talent which must be exploited, and have

brought new pressures for efficiency and flexibility in production

procedures.

10.3 The Government has already set the BBC and the ITV companies

the target of commissioning 25% of original material from

independent producers as quickly as possible.    Both the BBC and

the ITV companies are committed to achieving this target by the

end of 1992, subject to satisfaction on cost and quality. Good

progress has already been made.    A framework for the business

arrangements for commissioning programmes has been agreed.

10.4 The Government has welcomed these developments, and the

willingness of the BBC, IBA and ITV companies to embrace change.

Under the arrangements proposed in Chapter VI, the Government

envisages that independent producers will continue to play a

greater part in programme making in the UK.    So far as the

position after 1992 is concerned, the Government&apos;s proposals for

the independent television sector in any event envisage that no

licensee should be required by the ITC to maintain any in-house

production capacity as a condition of obtaining a licence.


CONFIDENTIAL

Reference to Monopolies and Mergers Commission

10.5 In March 1988 the Government referred to the Monopolies and

Mergers Commission certain questions as to possible restrictive

labour practices in television and film production. The

Government believes that this reference - the first to be made

under the provisions of Section 79 of the Fair Trading Act 1973 -

will help the efforts being made within the industry - including

the independent production sector - to improve working practices.

The MMC hopes to be able to make its report by the end of the

year.    The Government will take account of its conclusions in

preparing legislation and hopes that the report will help the

industry to face up to an increasingly competitive environment and

succeed in international markets.

10.6 The developments outlined in this chapter are an important

part of a more general feature of the Government&apos;s approach, as

exemplified by the proposals in this White Paper:    namely, to

counter the excessive degree of vertical integration which has

characterised broadcasting in the UK as an industry.    A greater

separation of the different economic activities making up

broadcasting will help to promote competition and efficiency.


CONFIDENTIAL

XI:    THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION

11.1 Broadcasting in the UK has a high international reputation.

The Home Affairs Committee commented (paragraph 18) that &quot;from our

international discussions we have come to appreciate that,

whatever criticisms of programmes are made legitimately at home,

abroad British television is seen to be amongst the best, if not

to be the best, in the world&quot;.    The quality of UK programming has

led to a steady and continuing flow of international awards. The

UK is second only to the United States of America as an exporter

of television and cinema works.    Over 80% of all European

television and cinema exports come from the UK.    The UK television

and cinema industries regularly produce overseas net earnings,

with a total of  114 million in 1987.

11.2 Until recently, the international trade of audiovisual works

has been conducted on the basis of purchases or exchanges between

national markets.    Broadcasting in all countries has been a

national industry, aimed predominantly at domestic audiences. But

television will become an increasingly international medium as

satellite broadcasting makes national frontiers less impermeable

than before.    Transnational broadcasting will allow television to

play a unique role in international trade: it will become possible

to have international trade in ideas, cultures and experiences

with a degree of immediacy unachievable by any other means.

11.3 Television as an international medium thus offers exciting

opportunities for the future.    The Government welcomes the

increasing readiness of UK broadcasters to seize these

opportunities.

11.4 Just as all countries have developed means of regulating

their domestic broadcasting services, these new technological

developments make it desirable that there should also be a measure

of international regulation.    European countries have been


CONFIDENTIAL

considering for some time the need for such regulation.    Two major

concerns have been evident in this context.    First, there is a

need to ensure that programmes meet certain fundamental standards,

particularly on matters such as taste and decency.    Secondly, if

harmonisation of these fundamental standards can be achieved, many

countries recognise the complementary need to avoid unnecessary

restrictions on the reception of foreign television programmes and

thus to ensure that the free flow of information is maintained.

11.5 The Government has played an active part in these moves

towards international regulation.    It wishes to achieve a system

which facilitates the development of an open market for television

services in Europe and removes the existing obstacles to the flow

of television programmes across frontiers.    At the same time, the

Government wishes to ensure that standards of programming within

the UK are maintained and are not undermined by services received

here directly from other countries.    Work on the development of

international instruments has proceeded on two fronts: in the

Council of Europe on a draft Convention on Transfrontier

Broadcasting; and in the European Community on a EC draft

Directive on Broadcasting.

11.6 Through its mass media committees, on which the UK is

represented, the Council of Europe has been considering the

problems of the international regulation of broadcasting.    At the

first Council of Europe Conference of Broadcasting Ministers, held

in Vienna in December 1986, and in which the UK played a leading

role, it was decided that the Council of Europe should prepare a

European Convention on Broadcasting with binding effect. The

purpose of the Convention will be to facilitate the transfrontier

transmission and re-transmission of television programme services

which comply with certain prescribed minimum standards covering

both programme content and advertising.    The minimum standards

will be enforced through a procedure enabling receiving States to

take action against countries which transmit offending services.


CONFIDENTIAL

Parties to the Convention will guarantee freedom of transmission

and will agree not to restrict re-transmission in their

territories of all services which comply with the prescribed

minimum rules.    Transmitting States will for their part be obliged

to ensure that programme services transmitted within their

jurisdiction comply with the Convention.

11.7 Work on the preparation of the Convention is not yet

complete, and final agreement has not yet been reached on the

proposed code of standards.    The Government is seeking to ensure

that the code is compatible with the UK&apos;s national standards on

taste and decency and does not impose unnecessary restrictions on

the length and content of television advertising.    A second

Council of Europe Conference of Broadcasting Ministers is due to

be held shortly in Stockholm.

11.8 The Government has also played a full part in the work

taking place in parallel in the European Community on the draft

Directive on Broadcasting which was introduced by the European

Commission in May 1986 and subsequently revised in March 1988

following discussion in the European Parliament.    The Government

supports the aim of the draft Directive of assisting the

television industry in Europe, including the UK, by eliminating

obstacles to the free flow of television services.    The draft

Directive is intended to provide a limited harmonisation of Member

States&apos; laws on advertising, the protection of children, and

copyright in the broadcasting field in order to break down the

existing barriers to the free movement of broadcasting services

throughout the Community.    The draft Directive is being discussed

in a Working Group of the EC Council of Ministers on which the UK

is represented.    It is not at this stage clear when the Council

will be invited to take a final position on the draft.

11.9 These international instruments, if concluded, will

contribute to the maintenance of programme standards throughout


CONFIDENTIAL

Europe, while removing the barriers which have hitherto inhibited

the free flow of broadcasting services.    They are consistent with

the approach of the Government towards domestic broadcasting

services in establishing an enabling regulatory framework to allow

increased opportunities for broadcasters and viewers, while

ensuring the maintenance of programme standards regarding taste

and decency.    Both instruments will require primary legislation to

bring them into force in the UK.    If their preparation can be

concluded in a way which is satisfactory from the viewpoint of UK

interests, the Government will seek the necessary provisions in

the proposed broadcasting legislation.

11.10   If, however, it is not possible to achieve agreement in

either forum - and to reach a European consensus or such matters

is inevitably far from easy - the UK will still have other

measures available (see the proposals in Chapter VII) to provide

safeguards against unacceptable services receivable in the UK.

There should be no question of UK broadcasting interests being

denied access to other European markets because of any absence of

agreement on international regulation:    the quality of programmes

and services produced in the UK makes it highly likely that they

will continue to be demanded by other European and other overseas

audiences.    There are also increasing opportunities for co-

operative ventures in programme making with broadcasters in other

European countries, and the Government hopes that these will

develop further.


CONFIDENTIAL

ANNEX A: FUNCTIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION (ITC)

The Independent Television Commission

1. Since, as Chapter VI explained, the Government does not

believe the present federal ITV system, provided by a broadcasting

authority by means of contracts with programme providers, could or

should be sustained, it is necessary to consider new supervisory

arrangements.    In a rapidly changing broadcasting world, the main

requirements for a regulatory body are flexibility; the ability to

look at the television system as a whole to ensure that the

various enterprises are able to compete on equal terms; and the

powers to enforce statutory requirements on programme services,

(in particular on the observance of consumer protection

requirements on such matters as taste, decency and appropriate

advertising content).

2. The Government believes that these needs are best met by a

new regulatory agency:    the Independent Television Commission

(ITC).    The ITC will replace both the Cable Authority and the IBA;

but there remains a continuing need for the Welsh Fourth Channel

Authority to provide the Fourth Channel in Wales.    The principal

functions of the ITC will be:

(i)    To decide, within the statutory framework, the

geographical structure of Channel 3, which will remain a

regionally based service.    It will stipulate both the

geographical areas and the hours of the day to be covered by

licences, which will be allocated by competitive tender.

(ii)    Similarly to determine, within the statutory

framework, the hours and nature of the franchises available

on Channel 5.    This will operate on a national basis. The

ITC will allocate these licences by competitive tender.


confidential

(iii)    To deal on a similar basis with any new programme

services which are subsequently introduced and also with new

services using the night hours which the Government proposes

to reallocate from one of the BBC&apos;s channels. The

legislation will create a flexible framework for this, with

the necessary powers being activated by subordinate

legislation.

(iv)    To provide for Channel 4, whether as its own

subsidiary or as a licensee, and to ensure that its special

remit is adhered to.

(v)    To allocate, by competitive tender, any future DBS

licences and to supervise DBS programme services.

(vi)    To license satellite programme services uplinked from

the UK.    These licences will contain conditions enabling the

ITC to exercise consumer protection oversight of such

services, and to enforce their conformity with any

international obligations accepted by Government.

(vii) To determine, subject to the statutory framework, the

nature and pattern of franchises for local television

programme services, whether delivered by cable, MVDS or both;

to allocate local delivery licences by competitive tender;

and to license service providers.

(viii) To supervise the transmission arrangements for

independent services, in order to ensure conformity with

international obligations and the observance of technical

specifications designed to limit interference.    In the

transitional period before the establishment of a privatised

transmission system the ITC will also be responsible for

appointing, and monitoring the performance of(transmission

contractors.    It is envisaged that Channels 3 and 4 should


CONFIDENTIAL

remain universally available, while the other Channels should

achieve sufficient coverage to justify the allocation of

scarce frequencies.

(ix)    To collect tender and levy revenue for the Exchequer.

(x)    To settle with the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority,

subject to arbitration by Government in the event of dispute,

the subscription to be levied from operators of off air

terrestrial services to fund the Fourth Channel in Wales.

3. While the IBA&apos;s DBS contractors (at present only British

Satellite Broadcasting) remain in being as such the ITC will need

to fulfil its predecessor&apos;s contractual obligations.

4. The ITC will assume the powers and duties of the Cable

Authority in relation to any licences it has issued.

5. The ITC will have general responsibility for oversight of

advertising and programme content.    It will issue a code governing

advertising and sponsorship.    The Commission will have a duty to

plan for and arrange adequate provision of schools broadcasts by

the independent television sector.    It will also have a duty to

ensure that there is at least one body effectively equipped and

financed to provide news on Channel 3.    The ITC will also be

responsible, in association with the Broadcasting Standards

Council, for establishing a code governing the portrayal of

violence and on acceptable standards of decency.    It will be

responsible, through its licence conditions, and the period

reviews proposed for the operators of services on Channels 3, 4

and 5, for enforcing both these and the positive programming

obligations, such as the requirement of diversity on Channels 3

and 5.    It will have at its disposal sanctions ranging from

warnings to licence withdrawal.    The Government is considering

further whether it should also be able to impose financial

penalties.


CONFIDENTIAL

6. The Government envisages continued controls on ownership,

including concentration of ownership.    The ITC will be responsible

for enforcing these rules, both at the stage of initial allocation

of licences and in subsequent changes in share ownership.

7. The ITC will be responsible for collecting from its licensees

finance for the functions at present carried out by the

Broadcasting Complaints Commission.    It will itself be financed

from licence fees, to be paid in instalments during the currency

of the respective licences, in accordance with a formula

determined in advance, so that those competing for licences are

aware of the extent of this liability.    The fees must also meet

the costs of any work undertaken for the ITC by the

Radiocommunications Division of the Department of Trade and

Industry, together with the ITC&apos;s share of the costs of the

Government&apos;s domestic and international radio regulatory

activities.    It will be possible for the ITC to apply

differentiated scales of fees but the formula adopted should not

provide for disproportionate contributions by the more successful

licensees.    The ITC will also charge its licensees rental for

their transmission facilities, while these remain its direct

responsibility.
