ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

^^^^lemor andum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

The British e^^%as been performing well in recent years,  thanks to

prudent monetar^njfiscal policies and supply side reforms.    Growth this

year is turning or^^fl^pnger than expected at the time of the Budget, and

may reach 4 per ceWjpEnemployment has fallen by over 500,000 over the

last 12 months,  and lower than any other major European country

except Germany. ^^^^k.

2. But we cannot affor^^o be complacent, or to relax our vigilance.

Inflationary pressures remain, which we have recently had to counter by

raising interest rates by 2i per cent from their low point at the

beginning of last month; and the current account of the balance of

payments has moved sharply into de^^it.    Domestic demand is higher than

expected and the economy is growing faster than is sustainable in the

medium term - even allowing for nLpfS^ply side improvement which has

undeniably taken place. ^^^^V

3. In these circumstances the top pfformy must be to support and

strengthen the prudent monetary and f^Ij^Aolicies which have buttressed

the good performance of the economy,  and^^^Mi are essential to get

inflation down further.     It would be very^K^^ing indeed if the public

sector were to add any more to the demands^Hfc^^ the private sector is

putting on the economy.    That would furthermaerjmse upward pressure on

prices and on interest rates,  and could seriou^^^^amage confidence both

internally and externally.

4. We must at the same time continue to focus our attention on improving

the supply performance of the economy.    A lower tax burden and falling

share of public expenditure in the economy are essential^fcmnponents of

this policy.    To achieve  them requires continued restrMm^bn spending.

WORLD ECONOMY

5. Growth in the world economy picked up strongly in the aEcff^Lhalf of

last year, and the signs are that this buoyancy has continued^S^p^e first

half of 1988. World trade growth in 1988 could be the fastestTsjAk1984.


6. A number of factors underlie this unexpectedly strong growth: the

%  beneficial effects of the oil price fall have probably come through later

^Wthan expected; the major economies, notably Japan, appear to have adjusted

^kell to earlier sharp changes in exchange rates; the newly industrialised

^^^^aoxaies and some middle  income countries have been growing rapidly; and

the ^potentially harmful effects of the stock market collapse were

cms fully avoided.

7. Buoyant activity has so far had little effect on consumer price

inflation in the major economies.    There are, however, emerging signs of

inflationary pressures.    Commodity prices have risen by 50 per cent during

the last year, albeit from a very depressed level.    In response there have

already been^teme rises in interest rates.

8. Whethewft^_or Id economy grows at a sustainable rate with low

inflation thr% year will largely depend on the policies followed by the

major countrie= ^P^^ G7 will need to ensure that any signs of rising

inflation are de^^^^ith promptly;  that continued progress is made in

reducing imbalanceSdffmpar t icular the United States Budget deficit); and

that there is no rmd^^n of the wild swings in exchange rates of the

early 1980s. ^ffW

THE BRITISH ECONOMY

9. The prospect for the United Kingdom is for another year of strong

growth,  for the seventh year running, and at a rate closer to 4 per cent

than the 3 per cent I predicted at the time of the Budget. Manufacturing

output has been growing particularl^fcetrongly;  it has already passed the

1979 peak and should soon pass ttAw^j-time peak recorded in  1974. With

such strong growth,  employment shOTM^ itinue to rise and unemployment to

fall.    The Annex summarises the most recent Treasury assessment.

10. Domestic demand has so far been gtmaJM^very rapidly in 1988.

Consumers expenditure continues to r i s e syd^^kl y, but the main contrast

with earlier years is the surge in investmejMJ^^s companies (including

foreign investors) take advantage of the hrB^W^rates of return in the

United Kingdom since the early 1960s. Surve j_%r^investment intentions

and figures for orders - notably for cons true C^oj^^^ 11 demonstrate the

strength of this investment boom.

11. There have been some worries on capacity shortages.    But only in the

construction sector are there clear signs that the industry is working

close to its limits.    Construction output rose by 10i per^^nt in the year

to the first quarter of 1988,  and orders are very high.  V% has

inevitably put upward pressure on construction costs.    E^KwfcLe&apos; t^ie

Confederation of British Industry surveys show that manufa^P^n^g

companies expect to be able to cope with likely demand in nkZfl_spite

strong order books. ^ ^

4l


12.    Inflation at the end of this year is likely to turn out higher than

the Budget forecast, and this will be exacerbated by the effect on the RPI

^of higher mortgage rates.    Pay is continuing to grow much more rapidly

^bhan is desirable, especially in the public sector.    A slowdown would

^fkarove the prospects  for both inflation and employment.

^3^Jfce have been forecasting for some time that the current account would

ni^^into deficit during the present period of strong investment growth.

But so far this year the recorded current account deficit has been running

well above the level implied by the Budget forecast, at an annual rate

equivalent to about 2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product.

14. This ji^^^substantial deficit,  and one which can readily be financed

only if we^^ 2^iue t0 pursue sound financial policies,   including a Budget

surplus, whi^flwkll keep downward pressure on inflation and thereby

maintain the^^ta^nce of the financial markets.    There is a marked

contrast betwee^oTM present circumstances and earlier periods of current

account deficit^k^^kat public sector borrowing is now negative - we are

repaying debt.    N^P^Aeless,  there must be a risk with a deficit of the

size now in prospec^P^^^t market sentiment will turn against us,

especially if market^HkSfce that we are losing our grip on either monetary

policy or public expen%it^^u

CONCLUSION

15. Confidence in the United Kingdom remains high both at home and

abroad.    We must keep it so.    That will require a continuation of firm

financial policies  to bear down ^^^flation.    And it means that we must

avoid expenditure commitments noi^J^^may be unsustainable as economic

growth moderates.    Recent rises  in^wkest rates have demonstrated our

determination to tighten monetary pn^^^^s and when necessary.    We must

show the same determination in the re^Pamt of public spending.

16. It is essential,  therefore,  that we follow the recommendations in the

Chief Secretary&apos;s paper. w2^.
