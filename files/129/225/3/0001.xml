1988 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

^^J^lemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury

Our object ive^H|(^kbr ing public spending down progressively as a

proportion of ^^^o^^l income.    Over the past  five years we have succeeded

in achieving th i^^  rt^r s ing the overall trend of the 1960s and 1970s. As

a result of our su^^^^in this,  and of our supply side reforms, we have

been able to combineJ^^ady but controlled growth of public expenditure

in real terms with t^tf^^pination of public sector borrowing and with

reductions  in personaT^Lax^ion.

2. These policies have^aid the foundation for our economic success.

And it is because the economy has been strong that we have been able to

afford more resources for our priority public spending programmes.    It is

particularly important that we continue to follow these policies, not

least given the overriding need to^fcintain confidence both at home and

overseas, as the Chancellor points out in his paper.

3. There remains a major task ahel^^^us.    The overall burden of tax

(excluding the North Sea),  at 37.7 p^^^^,  is still well above the

34.3 per cent  figure we inherited in  lW-^^ we are to get below that

figure,  and maintain confidence,  public a^B iture must continue to grow

significantly less rapidly than the Grossni^tfic Product (GDP).

4. But the plans in the last Public Expend%uft-eAWhite Paper involve

growth in expenditure only just below that of Gtt^^an average of 2V4 per

cent real growth a year in spending on departmental programmes (ie the

planning total excluding privatisation proceeds), compared with a

reasonable assumption for the trend growth of the economy of 2i per cent a

year.

THE BIDS ^j^L

5. The baselines for this year&apos;s Survey are based on those plans. They

total  172.1 billion in 1989-90,   181.2 billion in 1990-91 ,%^fcwith an

uplift factor of 2i per cent,   188.9 billion for 1991-92. DeKrM^nts

were asked to review their programmes within their baseline fijftrf^^mcl to

put proposals  to me, where they felt,  after a review of pr ior i t Fe^pLaat

additional resources were required.    My minute of 7 July to the P^^J^

Minister summarised the bids received from Departments.    In additio^^e^k

must take account of the nationalised industries, of higher e xpe c t e na^^

1


payments to the EC, and of the extra provision agreed for local authority

| relevant current expenditure.

W

6. The size of these bids clearly puts our objectives at risk. If

W^^^\ing like this were accepted,  the growth rate in real terms of the

^^^3|king total  (excluding privatisation proceeds) would exceed that of the

^onw as a whole.    Public expenditure would rise as a percentage of GDP,

as^f^^h the tax burden.    There would be no prospect of progress towards a

20 pence basic rate.    This would reverse the progress we have hitherto

made towards our objectives.    We would be seen in the financial markets

and more generally as having lost our grip on public expenditure, at a

time when the battle against inflation clearly calls for restraint; and as

having builttf^massive spending commitments for the period up to 1991 on

the basis cVVn^exceptional rate of economic growth in  1987 and 1988

which is not^B|S^nable over a period of years.    Letting expenditure rip

in this way cO^W^Rnly lead to painful retrenchment later in this

Parliament - pra^Kmr the kind of short term reversal that  our careful

planning has enai^^l^B to avoid.

7. If these conseq^BK^e are to be avoided, we need to keep as close as

possible to the exisci^^J^anning totals,  and ensure that the ratio of

total public expendituM^deluding privatisation proceeds)  to GDP

continues to decline ste r%over the three Survey years.    To achieve

this, the bids must be cut back, and we shall need to look for policy

changes and other savings to help offset any that are unavoidable.

8. In particular,  for a number of years the Government&apos;s capital

programmes have benefited from inci^fces in construction prices below

those of inflation generally.    Bu^^JTj^e are now clear signs that

pressures  in the construction indu^R|^^re causing prices to move against

us.    A number of the bids have a lar^^%rR^truetion content;  we will need

to consider very carefully whether we^M^^d be adding to those pressures,

which may well exceed the industry&apos;s pnl^^^capac i ty to deliver.

RUNNING COSTS ^^^W

9. Running costs bids are also much too higk^ ^ey imply a real rise of

5 per cent in Civil Service costs in 1989-90 ovej^^88-89, an increase in

Civil Service numbers of 20,000 to more than 60^000 by 1990-91, and a

rise in the share of public expenditure devoted to administration.

10. We should be criticised for reversing our past achievements on Civil

Service manpower and losing control of Civil Service costs^if we were to

allow increases on anything like this scale.    I hope therefore that

colleagues will co-operate in settlements which will en^tKjf^ as agreed

last year, to hold roughly constant the running costs share in planned

expenditure.    This means  that all Departments will need to aW^P^for less

than their bids,  in most cases much less. *A


11. We agreed last year that realistic three-year running costs

I   settlements would be conditional on the development of satisfactory

  management plans.    I am grateful to colleagues for the personal impetus

jhey have given to this process.

12. In a few cases it is doubtful whether there is yet a satisfactory

^^aAwork for adjusting provision.    In some cases there should be scope

fo^^ning for clearer and more ambitious efficiency targets.    I shall ask.

myofficials to explore that scope with Departments before the

bilaterals.

13. For Departments with satisfactory management plans underpinning

agreed three^tear settlements,  I should be willing, on a limited scale, to

consider asU^extra margin of provision where they commit  themselves to

increasing ^l^^tf_s for services for which they charge and for which

demand pressures are strong.    I also propose in future White Papers to

show administrw^^^fccosts both gross and net of receipt income.

14. These smal 1 iffidRm;ations to the running costs system are outlined in

the annex.    They stToJI^^rovide some  increase in flexibility and bring out

more clearly the cos^^B_:inaneing Government administration.    They give

no ground for relaxing_mr^tefforts to contain these costs, or for the

unacceptably high level ^0^ds received in this Survey.

NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES

15. Some of the nationalised industries are already bidding for more than

their baseline provision,  and all ^^ihem have the opportunity to put in

revised bids this month.    I propA^Mat our aim for the industries, for

so long as they remain in the pubnR^^tor,  should be to keep overall

provision to baseline or less.    We plan to privatise the Water and the

Electricity industries during the prew^BWturvey period.    We will need,

therefore,  to take account of the loss^^^^ir substantial negative

External Financing Requirements;  this wi^|^^^d careful handling in the

Autumn Statement although it does not becTmJW^najor factor until the last

of the Survey years,   1991-92.    In the meanW^^_e should continue to

examine their plans rigorously - as for the^_M^ndustries - bearing in

mind the implications both for public expendiz\iT^0Ukile they remain within

the public sector and for proceeds when they a^Fprivatised.

LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE

16. Cabinet on 7 July endorsed the decisions that had bea_reached in the

Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy,  SujfcWAnittee on

Local Authority Expenditure about the Rate Support Granr%fl(|^^ments for

England and Wales  for  1989-90.    We have agreed to make prc^R^a for

&quot;relevant current&quot; expenditure by local authorities  in Engl^^fl^k  29,140

million and in Wales of  1, 785 million.    Taken together, thes^nay^plans

represent an addition to programmes  for  1989-90 of just under

billion; we will need to take account  in the remainder of the sW^pjjf

this substantial  increase.    I am discussing the equivalent settleaR^^^^r

Scotland with the Secretary of State. ^^^J^


CONCLUSION

^   17.    I ask the Cabinet:

^^^P       i.      to agree that public expenditure should be held as close as

possible to the existing planning totals, and that, after excluding

^P^^Lprivatisation proceeds,  the ratio of total public expenditure to GDP

? ^Jyiould continue to decline steadily over the three Survey years;

ii. to agree that the share of running costs in planned public

expenditure should be held constant; and to agree the proposals in

the Annex;

iii. kf^^kte that,  to secure these objectives,  bids for expenditure

and r^^B^^costs must be cut back and difficult decisions need to be

taken areas ;

....

iv. to ag e^at our aim for the nationalised industries,  for so

long as the^k^Ain in the public sector,  should be to keep overall

provision to ^^K^Lne or less;

fife.

v. to agree tl^^W^khould now conduct bilaterals with colleagues on

their spending pr^^ra^kes,  and to note  that,  if it proved impossible

to reach agreement ^^^t^ese discussions,   it might be necessary at the

appropriate time to establish a small group which would consider

outstanding issues and make recommendations to the Cabinet.

Vunnlng costs;   Treatment of Receipts

^cL

I vKS we introduced the running costs system in 1986 it was

agreed^^B^ running costs expenditure should generally be planned

and cont^bj^ on a gross basis. We also agreed that where blocks

of work can be made entirely self-financlng and can demonstrate

satisfactory management control systems they can be exempt from

gross control. Six such exemptions have already been agreed

and more applicAA^is have been made in the present Survey. To

reflect   the   risn Rkcale   of   this   exemption   from   gross control

1 propose to prov^|dWk supplementary analysis in the 1989 White

Paper showing trend s\*3^dmini strati on costs both gross and net

of receipts. ^SZ^

2 The exemption arrangeawn^s provide an important element of

flexibility in the running costs system. But they cannot usually

be applied where receipts are insufficient to finance in full

the blocks of work which generate ttffc* To increase the incentives

for generating more receipts and o^*flgbacity to respond to marginal

demand pressures in such cases, I^R^Jd be willing in this and

future Surveys to consider marginal^Mcreases in agreed gross

running costs provision where these are^^ped up with undertakings

to increase receipts over and above exis^^BLtrends and forecasts

and departments have management plans ^lipble for three-year

settlements of their main running costs provision.
