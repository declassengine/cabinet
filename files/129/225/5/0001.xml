1988 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

^^^|e^ mo rand urn by the Chief Secretary,  HM Treasury

At  its meet ing^A^yly &gt;  Cabinet set the objectives of keeping as close as

possible to the^^B^ing planning totals,  and of ensuring that public

spending as a prmAr^jiDn of national  income continued to fall over the

three Survey years^^^^the level already reached.

Report on the BilaterS^F^

2.    I have conducted bilaJ^Kfc discussions with colleagues against that

background.    The starting point was that Cabinet had agreed in July to add

 1.7 billion to provision for local authority current expenditure in

1989-90.    Subsequently,  figures were agreed for the later two years,

leading to additions of:

(  billion)

^VTL989-9Q       1990-91 1991-92

rlr~    

^^y^ 2.0 2.2

In addition,   further expenditure in the Surj^^Aears was committed as a

result of previous decisions on the 1988 head^^n view Body awards,  and on

changes to the new social security regime.    Tlk^re^ere also increases

necessary to meet new forecasts of our net payme^tf^to the EC. These

three items amounted in total to a further  1.5 million,   1.6 billion, and

 1.2 billion in the three Survey years.    Apart from these items of agreed

additional expenditure,  I was also faced with substantial additional bids

on a large number of programmes, so that the total additions sought

amounted to:

8.7 13^i(W 18,7

In the course of bilateral discussions, additions to programflfe^^^^e been

agreed of about half these amounts, ie (including local authorm^^urrent

expenditure): 40Em


- CMO UNTIL 31/12/1988

I am grateful to colleagues for the reductions in their bids and the

savings that they have agreed to provide.

Details of the settlements are at Annex A.    These include large

 Additions that were unavoidable (eg estimating changes on social security)

^Hwiell as those increases that were already committed.    But  in addition

to these,  we have been able to agree substantial discretionary increases

^n^^|L&gt;rity services.    These increases have been made possible by savings

aUrsing from the success of our policies in reducing unemployment,

encouraging Right to Buy, restraining expenditure under the Common

Agricultural Policy,  and continuing to improve the performance of the

nationalised industries.    The Government&apos;s sound fiscal policy has also

reduced the bur den of debt interest.

4. At CaD\g^ be Chancellor will set out  the level of Reserves which he

believes wi l^B^^equired,  and,   in the light of this, he will then put

proposals to colle^ues on the planning totals to be adopted for the next

three years. 9

Capital Spending ^^Wm^

5. The new plans inc^Hfc^xtra gross provision for capital investment

amounting to some  2  wtljj  in 1989-90 .    This  includes  increases for

housing, hospitals, and ^P^son and road building.    It also includes

additional investment by the water authorities on anti-pollution measures;

by British Rail on service improvements; and by LRT and CAA on safety

measures.

Science and Technology ^^^^k.

6. The bilateral discussions on science and technology reflected the

objectives agreed earlier by E(ST). agreed additions to DES

spending on science and technology whiK a*^int to at least   120 million a

year.    This expenditure is partially of^P&amp;d^w savings  in areas of lesser

priority within the Energy, Agriculture, TinjBrr^de and Industry

programmes. ^^^ ^ v

Running Costs and Manpower ^^^^^^

7. The settlements are within the agreed objective of keeping the running

costs share of the planning total roughly constant,  though next January&apos;s

White Paper will show a higher increase in 1989-90 than in previous years.

It will show planned manpower roughly stable at about 590^^00 over the

Survey period. ill

8. We need to ensure that our record on Civil Service costs and size

remains defensible over the Parliament.    To this end it  is ^BtStffeL that

most colleagues have now agreed three year cash settlements t^t fre only

to be reopened where significant and essential developments maw^^P^

adjustments necessary.    I hope to reach similar agreements with^^^J^

remaining departments during next year&apos;s Survey. ^^^f^.


- CMO UNTIL 31/12/1988

1988-89 Outturn

|    9.    The estimated outturn for the planning total in 1988-89 is  153.6

J^billion,   3.3 billion below the plans in the last Public Expenditure White

^Jtaper.    A number of additions have already been made to programmes during

P^tfke current year,   including the  increase of over  1 billion in health

^R^Wnditure.    These increases have been offset by higher privatisation

^proj^ds, higher than expected local authorities and new towns receipts

(^rceeding the overspend on local authority capital expenditure), and

lower social security expenditure resulting from the fall in unemployment.

1989-90      1990-91 1991-92

Defence   ^% +   161       +   610       + 1024

The additions recognise the pressure on the programme and, on the

basis of current inflation forecasts, result in a real increase in

expenditure oveA^Vie period 1988-89 to 1991-92 . The additions

represent a firnft^kree year agreement that will only be reopened in

agreed exceptional^jftpwistances.

FCO (diplomatic wing) +     26       +     48        + 71

Increases for scholarships\gm&lt;^exchanges, running costs, BBC External

services grant, security features and new technology are offset in

part by favourable overseas price movements and savings on broadcast

relay stations.

ODA ^fifr     33        +      76        + 101

For the aid programme, the increases pvotffete for the expected costs of

the sub-Saharan debt initiative, and f o^trakUK&apos; s contribution to the

IMF ESAF; the settlement also providw3%J|ditions to bilateral aid

including ATP soft loans. On super annua tic^^B^jvis ion is made for

war service credit for former colonial serva%s^^

EC Contributions +   500       +   630       + 230

The White Paper figures were necessarily based on^fche artificial

assumption that the EC 1.4% VAT contribution would bemmtaained. The

new figures reflect the effect of the new arran B^ts for the

financing of the Community, and other factors such as l^^^Lncreased

import duties paid to the Community as a result of the bu^aag^ of UK

imports. ^jjj^


Mdh? -    421       -    396        -    268 i!

V* J

Th^^Vductions are due to revised forecasts of the impact of CAP

refo^l^Vneasures, of the size of UK harvests and (in 1989-90) of the

effeclQ#^he American drought on world agricultural prices. The

projec^^^^^ake allowance for future devaluation of the Green Pound.

Other agriculture +14+8 +5

Increases for running costs, flood prevention, and other programmes

are offset in pa^A^y estimating and policy reductions in capital

grants, and by iS^kos from increased funding by industry of R and D

and ADAS . ^^fl^.

Forestry +9+12 +14

Increases mainly reflect n^JhAc planting grants following the removal

of tax relief in the 19^B^Budget. Forestry Commission disposals

programme has been increased and will be subject to a policy review.

DTI a +      72        +      79        - 72

There are increases in provision for^K^pnal Development Grants as a

result of a surge in applications utj^fe closure of the scheme; for

Shipbuilding Intervention Fund Support ;^ Xaf or relocation plans. The

reduced requirement in 1991-92 results ^^Mthe run down of existing

launch aid commitments. ^4^^

ECGD +      56 W f     27        - 34

The changes reflect new economic asssumptions.

Energy +34 ^^V. - 93

The changes result mainly from decisions on nuclear R&amp;D^^^grammes,

notably to run down the fast reactor and fusion progr^^uS^ which

generate redundancy and restructuring costs as well a^jfen9s&apos;

Further estimating savings arise on the Redundant Mineworkers payments

Scheme. In the two later years the reductions also reflect Jfce

transfer of nuclear safety research to HSC/HSE. ^


llAloyment -   205       -   305       - 405

I Se^j^L result from the rapid fall in unemployment and from the

I decW^^P number of school leavers. This has enabled substantial

savin^^3l^&gt; be made on the Youth Training Scheme, while still meeting

the GovBfci^fcrt&apos;s guarantee. There are other reductions in Redundancy

Fund, End^^^rise Allowance Scheme, and adult training expenditure.

There is increased provision for stricter benefit administration.

Transport +   324       +   398       + 406

The increases ar^U^.marily for construction and maintenance of

national roads anoMa^BAges, reflecting increased construction prices,

continuing traffic gJKw^Land the extension of VAT to new construction

work. There are also^B^^ler increases for local authority roads and

I airports. ^j^^

Environment

- 1209       - 1073       - 798

Increased projections of receipts from council house and other sales

will yield some  4 billion over thegthree years. There are additions

to gross capital spending on housi&amp;^T^ around  450 million a year.

Plans include increased spending 4W^e Housing Corporation on new

homes for rent and by local authoritiefc^^ renovation of their own

stock through Estate Action. There a^^Meo additions for the Urban

block and for the costs of preparation fdf^Ufc^ Community Charge.

I PSA + 16 29

A combination of higher receipts from disposals and net rents and

modest additions to the net baseline in 1989-90 and 1990-91 will

enable the PSA to meet foreseeable requirements for majcr works, to

continue to reduce the maintenance backlog and to i%jp^, in improved

management structures, working towards full payment a ^^ntying in

1990 and Trading Fund status by 1993. ^%


Home Office +   246       +   354       + 324

ThBreB are increases for prison building and prison manpower, and

smaS^^mncreases for a range of non-prisons spending, partly offset

by hjtfKfk local authority capital receipts and a number of other

savingsimaures.

Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department

and other legal +34       +61       + 106

There are increa^B for legal aid, running costs, and court building;

for the Serious%fcAd Office; and for the Crown Prosecution Service,

particularly in 19^2^

Education and Science  ^Ca +    363       +    405       + 370

The agreed additions provi^p^fcr an increase of some 16 per cent in

the Science budget between^RV8-89 and 1989-90; put the polytechnics

and colleges on a sound footing for their new, independent status;

allow the value of student awards to be maintained; and provide for

sufficient capital allocations   to al^w local   education authorities

&apos;&quot;&quot;,g&quot;&quot;d -  

Arts and Libraries 4       + 2+20

The settlement rolls forward the three4^L  programme agreed in the

1987 survey (with increases in the new thiriRg^^r, for example for

incentive funding); and provides for the c%psRuction programme for

the British Library, St Pancras project.


[flA&apos;th and Personal Social Services       + 1256       + 1477       + 1896

I Tl^sBttlement represents the largest increase ever made available for

I theJ0^% It provides for the increased salary costs resulting from the

I nurse^j^^rading review and the 1988 Review Body pay awards. It also

I provide^^^tesources for service growth and to correct health

I authoriti|^^accumulated revenue deficits. Provision has also been

I made to meet forthcoming Whitley pay settlements, the growing cost of

I AIDS treatment, and increased capital spending. Health authorities

I will   also   benefit   from   new   cost     improvement   programmes   and a

reduction (of A^^77 million) in employers&apos; superannuation

I contributions,    ^S^V1?   tne   total   extra    resources    for the NHS in

England alone to  lP^J^.lion   in    1989-90    and   over     2    billion in

1990-91 .

I Social Security - 157 + 1626       + 3685

Lower   unemployment has led^oTonsiderable savings on this programme,

I amounting to over  1% billion a year. This saving has been   offset in

I 1989-90   by   increases   elsewhere,    notably   as a result of changes in

I other economic assumptions and of a Lwrge rise in the   estimated cost

of   disability   benefits.    In   the tWl years these increases greatly

exceed the savings from lower unempl^Bkj:.    Child   benefit   has been

frozen   as    last   year,    and   more   hew^^^s been provided for poorer

families.

Scotland +171     ^+254 +348

Wales +177 +180 +202

Northern Ireland +136 +185 +270

The settlements for Scotland, Wales and Northern %j^^nd reflect

broadly the normal working of the territorial block^^^ila. They

also include sums for regional development outside the^^^^rks and

special additions made in respect of the recent EC J ruling\j|2||T.


^feflj^nins and Excise +16 + 29 +59

Th^T Additions provide for the costs of increasing workloads, net oi

cunn20^ -e efficiency savings of about 2h per cent a year, and for the

fundi^n^i an approved major computer project for the handling oi

import^^^^xport freight.

Inland Revenue +48 +61 +66

Increases provide for the introduction of Independent Taxation. There

are partial of^  from reductions in forecast costs of life

assurance premiulftfl^ief and mortgage interest rate relief to

non-taxpayers. ^t^t^kV

Nationalised industrieyTj -       2        -      13        + 1373

Cabinet&apos;s remit to keep^^^fcal nationalised industry provision to

baseline or less is fulfilloj^^^ years 1 and 2. The whole of the

additional provision in year 3 is accounted for by the loss of

electricity industry&apos;s substantial negative EFLs after privatisation.

Settlement provides for increased cai^^al investment in water industry

to meet EC and domestic requireilBm^^ partially offset by price

increases of 9.8 per cent. LarvVllcreases *-n London Regional

Transport (LRT) to finance investmw^lkWire more than offset by

reductions from baseline in other t^|OT rt industries. LRT fares

will rise by about 12 per cent and Britis^^pil fares by 9.4 per cent.

Electricity prices will rise around 6 per cS|Pki 1989-90.

Local authority relevant +1,715 968 +2,196

Ministers agreed in July to make provision for relevant public

expenditure in 1989-90 by local authorities in Great ^frritain which

implies substantial increases over baseline. Figuremw^later years

are broadly the same in real terms as the provisi Pkgreed for

1989-90.
