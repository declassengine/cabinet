Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 635th March, 1952CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that, when we discussed this question on 14th February(C.C. (52) 17th Conclusions, Minute 4), I pointed out in paragraph 4 of my memorandum C. (52) 32 that the then Egyptian Government was not in every respect satisfactory from our point of view and it remained to be seen whether itwould be able to command sufficient support in the country to maintain its position.I considered nevertheless that we must take the risk that it might not be able to giveeffect to an agreement with us, in view of the serious consequences which failure to reach any agreement would entail. Since then that Government has been replaced by a Government under Neguib al Hilaly Pasha. This has been done onthe orders of King Farouk, who was dissatisfied with the lack of determinationshown by Aly Maher Pasha&apos;s Government in bringing to account the members ofthe former Wafd Government, who by their corrupt administration and anti-british policy were responsible for the Cairo riots of 26th January. Aly Maher was makingefforts to conciliate the Wafd, and might therefore have proved difficult from our point of view in any negotiations. Moreover, he was personally unreliable, and anti-British intrigues had led to his internment during the war in 1942. It was forthese reasons that, despite his tentative efforts to rehabilitate himself with us, i could not place great confidence in the successful outcome of negotiations withhim, necessary as it then seemed that we should at least show willingness to resume negotiations.2. The new Government is in my view a considerable improvement on theGovernment of Aly Maher. In the first place, Neguib al Hilaly is himself an honestman. He is pledged to attack the corruption which has always vitiated Egyptianpolitical life and which became a notorious scandal under the Wafd. In effect hehas been put in office by King Farouk with the first object of breaking the powerof the Wafd by bringing their leaders to justice. Since he was himself expelledby the Wafd in November 1951, he may be expected to carry out this policyenergetically. Moreover, the rest of his Government consists either of compara-tively competent and honest officials, or of men who have been disillusioned bytheir experience of the Wafd. They seem to be about as good a Government aswe can hope for in Egypt.3. If this Government can deal thoroughly with the members of the formerWafd Government party, exposing their corrupt practices and the bankruptcy oftheir anti-British policy, there is a good chance that they may discredit the Wafdfor some time. There is of course a danger that the Wafd, whose strength shouldnot be underestimated, may overthrow them, despite the support of King Farouk.If, however, the Government succeeds in its attack on the Wafd, there is a betterhope that any agreement reached with us will be lasting.4. The Egyptian Parliament has now been prorogued. This is usually a prelude to dissolution and new elections. We may therefore reckon that we shallhave a period of about two months within which to reach an agreement, beforethe Egyptian Government has to authorise new elections and submit its policy to41955
the new Parliament, If, during this period, we can reach an agreement which appears to go some way towards meeting Egyptian aspirations, we may hope thatthe present Government may secure its ratification; if we do not reach such an \Jagreement, we may expect a return to the turbulent conditions which renderedour base in the Canal Zone largely useless and which will probably lead next timeto the destruction of all British commercial and cultural interests in Egypt and toincalculable results in the international field.5. I have therefore been considering whether we should not now allow rather more latitude to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo than is permitted to him byhis present instructions. That part of his instructions which is relevant to thefuture defence agreement with Egypt is contained in paragraphs 8 and 9 of mydespatch No. 65 to Cairo. In these instructions, which were drafted in the lightof C.C. (52) 17th Conclusions, Minute 4, 18th Conclusions, Minute 5, and 19thConclusions, Minute 2, it was stated that it was impossible to foresee how negotia-tions would develop or what adjustments or concessions might meet the politicalrequirements of both Governments, and that, since our proposed heads ofagreement might not in fact suffice to secure an agreement, we might be preparedultimately to go rather farther to meet what we expected the Egyptians to ask for.6. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo has now commented on these instruc-tions to the effect that the minimum which we should put forward, when the newEgyptian Government approach us with a request for a resumption of negotiations,should be acceptance by us of the principle of evacuation against acceptance byEgypt of participation in the Middle East defence organisation. There is no doubtthat the new Egyptian Government, like every other Egyptian Government, couldnot possibly accept less than this, if it is. to have any hope of surviving, and,since it seems that a deal with this Government may be our best, if not our last,chance of reaching an agreement, I consider that the instructions to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Cairo should now be amended on lines which will take account oftwo conditions essential for an agreement, namely, acceptance by us of the principleof evacuation, subject to satisfactory agreements on certain fundamental points,and to make a real effort to provide equipment for the Egyptian armed forces.recommendations. I therefore recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo shouldbe instructed as follows:  (a) He should aim at securing from the Egyptian Government an agreement in principle to participate in the Allied Middle East Command on thelines of his previous instructions.(b) In particular he should secure Egyptian agreement to - (i) the retention in Egypt by the United Kingdom of such technical and administrative personnel, under the command of the AlliedMiddle East Command, as are required to maintain at a state of operational readiness British military equipment held in theAllied military base;(ii) the establishment of an Allied air defence organisation in Egyptwhich shall include the personnel considered necessary by theSupreme Allied Commander, Middle East, in agreement withthe Egyptian military authorities, to supplement Egyptian airforces and ground protection forces available. The overalldirection of the air defence will be vested in the Allied middle east Command.(c) In return for satisfactory arrangements on these lines, Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Cairo would be authorised to inform the egyptian government that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to with-draw progressively from Egypt, within a limited period to be determined,mobile fighting units of the British land forces. Such withdrawal would,of course, be subject to any future agreement which might be reached between the Supreme Allied Commander, Middle East, and theEgyptian military authorities regarding the retention in Egypt of forcesplaced under the Allied military command.
(d) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo should be authorised to inform theEgyptian Government that, if a satisfactory agreement with Egypt on defence can be reached, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would make aspecial effort to provide arms and equipment for Egyptian forces. Hecould inform the Egyptians that we would be prepared to apply to egypt the same criteria as we at present apply in considering requestsfrom fellow members of N.A.T.G.(I am submitting separately for the consideration of my colleagues a proposal that we should agree that the Americans should now meet an Egyptian request for 22 armoured cars and other motor transport to equip a force of gendarmeriein Egypt; if this proposal were approved, we could point to this as an earnest of our intentions.)A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5th March, 1952.
