Iff(THIS DjJUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET&quot; C.(52) 92.23th MARCH, 1952.cabinet european DEFENCE community memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.Proposed Tripartite declaration on February 14th the Cabinet approved in principle a suggestion thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government might make a declaration of support for theEuropean Defence Community (E.D.C.) (C.C.(52) 17th Conclusions, minute 6)and I later informed my colleagues that a draft had been prepared duringthe meeting of Foreign Ministers held in London on February 17th - 19th(C.C.(52) 18th Conclusions, minute 3).    The draft of this declaration, whichwill be tripartite, is still being discussed with the United States and french governments.   Its present form is given in the text attached at Annex A,   some changes of wording may be necessary in this text to bring it into line withthe proposed tripartite security guarantee towards Germany, the text of&apos;which forms Annex III of my memorandum C. (52) 31 of 8th February.   Ido not, however, expect any changes of substance.   The idea is that the UnitedKingdom and the United States Governments should mark their interest inthe E.D.C. by declaring their intention to maintain armed forces in Europe andto take a hand through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation if any memberof the Community threatens to break away.Proposed British Guarantee2.       It was also suggested that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should make aseparate declaration on their own, and a text was in fact agreed inLisbon between M.Schuman and myself.   We are now, however, beinb pressed to go further than this.   We have been warned by the French Ministers that,before the final debate in the French Assembly, we shall once more be strongly pressed to join the E.D.C,  This I have declined to do.   In the meantime wehave been asked to enter into a Treaty relationship with the E.D.C. by extending to Germany, Italy and the European Defence Forces the undertakings we havegiven to France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, under the brussels treaty, to afford automatic military assistance if they are attacked.   In returnwe should receive from the Community reciprocal undertakings.3. The arguments for agreeing to this proposal are:-(a) we shall reassure our European neighbours and encourage themto complete the negotiations for the, E.D.C. which at present areflagging-COPY NO.     7 0
(b) we shall establish a formal and special relationship between theUnited Kingdom and the E.D.C., thus demonstrating to the europeans and Americans that, though not a part of the Continent,we are linked with its fortunes;(c) we shall avoid the unsatisfactory position under the Brussels treaty which will otherwise apply once the E.D.C. is established, for,whilst British obligations would remain unchanged, the other parties to the Treaty, having merged their forces in the E.D.C.would be the less able to he hp us;(d) whilst technically there is a difference between the Brussels Treaty,which provides for automatic military assistance, and the north atlantic Treaty, which leaves discretion to each party to take&quot;such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North atlantic area&quot;, the two Treaties will work out the same in practice.   Itseems certain that an attack on an E.D.C. country would in px*actice.\:b&apos;ring N.A.T.O. into play.4.       The objections are:-(a) we shall be undertaking commitments to two countries, Germany andItaly, which are liable to get involved in trouble;(b) xhe United States Government will not have exactly matchingcommitments.   Whilst the difference may be technical rather thanreal, an isolationist-minded United States administration might, say,in five or ten years&apos; time, seize upon this loophole;(c) whilst the Brussels Treaty and the E.D.C. will run for fifty years, theNorth Atlantic Treaty can be denounced after twenty years from 1949.If the United States Government were to denounce the Treaty from1969 onwards we should be left with heavy commitments in Europewithout any assurance of American support in fulfilling them.Recommendations5.       My recent conversations in Paris have left me with the clear impression that the E.D.C. is not likely to be established unless we respond to this latestproposal.   I believe that without running too great a risk we can give the desired undertaking provided that it is limited to the period during whichthe United Kingdom is a party to the North Atlantic Treaty.   Our commitmentunder the tripartite declaration referred to in paragraph 1 above would alsobe limited to the same period.   We should be left then only with the risk, referredto in paragraph 4(b) above, that an isolationist-minded United states administration might refuse to act in the spirit of the North Atlantic treaty and be unwilling to go to war in defence of one of the E.D.C. countries.   This,I think is a risk we can accept, especially as the United States Government willbe publicly committing themselves towards Germany and the   E.D.C. in threeways:   (i)  under the tripartite declaration referred to in paragraph 1 above;(ii)  under the proposed security guarantee towards Germany and Berlinwhich formed Annex III of my memorandum circulated as C. (52) 31 of the 8thFebruary;  and (iii) under the relationship which it is proposed to establishbetween the E.D.C. and N.A.T.O. which I mentioned in my memorandum C. (52) 41of the 15th February and described fully in my statement to the House on the28th February.
6.       M. Schuman did not dispute my contention that any undertaking qn our part must be limited to the period during which the United Kingdom is a partyto the North Atlantic Treaty.   He even said that a British declaration in place of a treaty would be sufficient.   But it seems to me that if we are willingto enter into this commitment it should be given in a formal document, apdthis applies equally to the reciprocal commitment from the E.D.C. upon whichwe must of course insist.   I propose therefore that these commitments shouldbe embodied in an appropriate treaty instrument concluded between the E.D.C.and the United Kingdom, the substantive clauses of which should be on the linesof those set out in Annex B.7.       When making this communication I would propose to repeat with allpossible emphasis that this is the limit to which the United Kingdom can goin the way of association with the E.D.C.;  that we cannot accept membership andthat we shall be unable to respond to any future pleas that we must take yetfurther steps and actually join the E.D.C. in order to save the whole projectfrom failure.8.       I accordingly seek the approval of my colleagues to:(a) our joining in a tripartite declaration on the lines set outin Annex A;(b) our giving an undertaking to the E.D.C., in return for a reciprocal undertaking by the E.D.C. in the terms set out in annex B; -(c) my explaining our attitude as suggested in paragraph 7 above to the French arid other Governments parties to the E.D.C.,and to the United States Government.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.28th MARCH, 1952.
ANNEX a revised Draft of the Declaration to be issuedby the British, French and United states government on the occasion of theSignatureof the Contractual Agreements with Germany.The Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdomand France have today marked the establishment of a new relationship between themselves and the Federal Republic of Germany through the signature ofthe Convention on General Relations and the related Conventions.   TheseConventions and the Treaties, to which France but not the United States or theUnited Kingdom are party, for a European Defence Community and a european coal and Steel Authority provide a new basis for uniting Europe and forassociating Germany with the West, whilst ensuring against any futurerevival of German militarism.   They make possible the removal, of specialrestraints hitherto imposed on Germany and permit the participation of theFederal Republic as an equal partner in Western defence.These Conventions and Treaties respond to the desire to provideby united efforts for the prosperity and security of Western Europe.   TheUnited States and United kingdom&amp;n Governments share that desire and wishto assist in establishing and maintaining measures necessary to fulfil it.They will support and cooperate with the European institutions establishedby these Treaties.Western defence is a common enterprise in which the United Statesand United Kingdom Governments are already partners through their membershipin N.A.T.O.   They have each expressed their resolve to station such forces inEurope as may be necessary and appropriate to contribute their fair shareto the Joint Defence of the North Atlantic area.    Thus they have each an abidinginterest in the effectiveness of the Treaty creating the European defence community and in the strength and continuing integrity of the Community.Accordingly if any action from whatever quarter threatens the continuingintegrity and unity of the Community the two Governments would consider ita matter of the gravest concern to them calling for consultation underArticle IV of the North Atlantic Treaty in order to agree the measures tomeet the situation thus created.
ANNEX BSUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES OF proposed agreement BETWEEN THE european defence COMMUNITY AND THE UNITEDKINGDOM.1. If at any time, while the United Kingdom is a party to the north atlantic Treaty, one of the parties to the European Defence Community Treatysigned.......or the European Defence Forces established under that Treaty, should be the object of an armed attack in Europe, the UnitedKingdom will, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter;,afford the party or the Defence Forces so attacked, all the military and otheraid and assistance in its power.2. So long as Article I remains in force, the Parties to the E.D.C. Treatyare agreed that if the United Kingdom or its armed forces should be theobject of an armed attack in Europe, they and the European Defence forces will afford all the military and other aid and assistance in their power.-5-
