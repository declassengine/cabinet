The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No...V*r...\C.(52) 646TH MARCH, 1952CABINETDEFENCE programme memorandum by the Minister of defence at the meeting of the Cabinet on 29th February (C.C.(52) 25thConclusions, Minute 2) I was invited, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, to examine the possibility of easing the balance ofpayments problem to the extent of about  40 millions either by makingmilitary equipment available for sale to dollar countries or by settingfree productive capacity in the metal using industries which could be usedfor the manufacture of exports.    I now report as follows:-2. In addition to the 500 Centurion tanks now on offer to the Americans,on which we might perhaps obtain a down payment of some  6 millions in dollarsin 1952/53, the Wat? Office are prepared to offer for delivery in 1952/53another 100, with the normal British allowance of ammunition and spares.They should realise between  6 millions -   7 millions in dollars in pay-ment.    The equipment of regular armoured divisions would not be affectedbut that of the first contingent of the Territorial Army would be delayed.T.A. Units would only receive minimum training requirements.The War Office might also release for sale for export engineeringequipment to ths value of  1 million.    A similar provision of  1 million is included in Air Ministry Estimates.3. As regards aircraft, it has already been agreed that 200 Swifts areto be offered to the Americans.    These will not begin to come off theproduction line until the end of 1952, but if we could obtain a down paymentof 20 per cent on signing the contract this would produce  3 millions in dollars at once.We could not release any more aircraft for export, except for afew of obsolete types, unless we were prepared to reduce our promisedcontribution to N.A.T.O. forces in 1952 and subsequent years.    We could secure substantial relief if the United States were willing to finance con-tracts we had already placed for the supply of aircraft, e.g, Canberrasand Venoms which form part of this contribution.    This would need a high level approach to the Americans and might well cover a wider field thanaircraft.The Air Ministry are also exploring the possibility of finding hard currency customers for certain surplus bombs.4. As regards naval equipment, the present prospects are that sales for dollars in 1952/53 are not likely to exceed about  0. 5 million.
5. It is clear that we cannot-xaise anything like  40 millions by sales of military equipment unless we can make some far-reaching new arrange-ment with the Americans.6. For every 1,000 tons of steel transferred from defence, exports tothe value of about  400,000 might be achieved.    The War Office are pre-pared to surrender 6,000 tons of steel, most of which is alloy steel, fromtheir heavy bridging programme, and 10,000 tons of sheet steel by reducing their order for jerricans.    The Air Ministry would also be prepared toreduce their orders for vehicles by  1 million which would release either the vehicles themselves or equivalent steel for exports.    Some contractswould have to be cancelled.    The Admiralty say that any substantial cut intheir steel allocation would appreciably slow down their shipbuilding,modernisation and conversion programmes especially in the anti-submarine frigate field, and would consequently affect the progress of later merchant shipbuilding.7. I was also asked to examine the possibility of effecting a furthersaving of  5 millions by deferring the stockpiling of oil for the service departments.    The Service Departments have now supplied me with detailsof their programmes.    The Admiralty propose to add to stock during thefinancial year 800,000 tons of oil fuel at a cost of  4 millions and also .3 millions worth of diesel oil.    The Air Ministry are proposing to spend 1. 7 millions in 1952/53 on stockpiling aviation fuel mainly for jet aircraft.A decision to postpone the 1952/53 stockpiling programme might thereforesave  6 millions of foreign exchange - of which  2^; millions would be in dollars.    There would also be an indirect saving of between  5 millions and  6 millions largely in dollars by reduction in chartering tankers.The War Office are making no provision for stockpiling in 1952/53.    Anysaving in their case would have to take the form of a reduction in the stocks which they hope to hold on 31st March, 1952,    Before reaching a conclusion on a matter of such strategic importance I should like to discuss it further with the Chiefs of Staff.The various proposals are summarised in the Appendix to this the figures are, of course, extremely approximate.    I recommend:-that the Service and Supply Departments should be authorised tonegotiate the sales of equipment envisaged in this paper;that steel should be diverted from the Service programmes tothe extent set out in this paper.that an immediate approach should be made to the Americans ata high level with a view to persuading them to make off-shorepurchases of aircraft out of the British contribution toN.A.T.O, forces, for delivery to the Royal Air Force.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,6TH MARCH, 1952.8.paper.(1)(2)(3)
