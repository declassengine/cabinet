(THIS 1^%-UMENT- IS-T-HE--PR-OPERT-Y-OWiER..JRK. ITANNiG-MA-JEST--Y-iS-GOVERNMENT-)RESTRICTEDC,(52) 52 COPY NO,    G J23RD FEBRUARY, 1952CABINETRESIGNATION OF chairman OF IRON AND steel corporation OF GREAT BRITAINMemorandum by the Minister of supply am circulating herewith, for the information of my colleagues,copies of the letters exchanged between Mr. Stephen Hardie and myselfaregarding his resignation as Chairman of the Iron and Steel Corporation ofGreat Britain.D.S,Ministry of Supply, W, C, 2. ,23RD FEBRUARY, 1952,Chairman of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great britain to the Minister of Supply2ist February, 1952.I have given serious consideration to the differences in policy in regard to prices and other fundamental matters apparent between us inrecent conferences.   I recognise, moreover, that the divergence of view between usis unfortunately such that there is little prospect of reaching that basis of constructive and harmonious working which I had hoped we might attain.In the National interest I have expressed to you my strong viewsagainst the Governments decision to increase maximum prices of iron andsteel, especially in view of the large increase in the profits of the publicly-owned companies, which for the Corporation^ first financial period to 30th September,1951, are at an annual rate of approximately S.65,000,000,,I have urged steps, and offered my aid, to rectify the severeshortage of raw materials, and have protested against the decision to placeon the steel producers heavy levies to meet the cost of imported manufacturedsteel.In my opinion, the combine-d effect of the direction, dated13th November, 1951, given by you to the Corporation, the statement you made tothe House of Commons at the time, and your policy towards the Corporation since,is to prevent me from carrying out my duties and responsibilities as Chairmanof the Corporation.Accordingly with regret I tender to you my resignation as chairman of the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain.
Minister of Supply to the Chairman of the Iron and steel corporation of Great Britain22nd February,1952.I have received your letter of 21st February, 1952, in which youtender your resignation as Chairman of the Iron and Steel Corporation ofGreat Britain.You give as your reason the divergence of view between us on policy.   But, as you know, there has not at any time been any disagreementwhatsoever on policy between the Corporation and myself save in regard to onematter, namely the question of whether the cost of importing finished steelshould be included in the price of steel or should be borne by an Exchequer subsidyThis is, of course, not a new issue.   When the late Governmentabolished the subsidy last August the Corporation expressed its disagreement with the decision.   After the change of Government you urged us to reverse thepolicy of our predecessors, and to re-introduce the subsidy.   We explained to you that for the same reasons as those given to you by the previous Government we felt unable to accede to your request.I am also surprised that in your letter you do not refer to the factthat the Government^ decision to raise steel prices, which you have now made public in advance of the issue of the Order, was taken in agreement with theCorporation.   Moreover, you fail to point out that, even assuming there was arise in profits last year as great as you suggest, this would be more than offset by the increased costs the industry will have to bear, after full allowance hasbeen made for the proposed increase in prices.I am of course aware, as you yourself informed me officially a tour meeting on February 6th, that serious differences of opinion have arisen between yourself and the other members of the Corporation on the questionof steel prices and that recently on this important issue you were out-votedby your colleagues.   In these circumstances I accept your resignation.
