(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC-MAJESTY&apos;-S GOVERNMENT)secret. (52) 77 COPY NO: ^19th MARCH, 1952.CABINETSOUTH AMERICAN MEAT PURCHASESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Food.AGREED STATEMENT OF THE position the authorised carcase meat programme for the calendar year1952 provides for a total supply of 1,591,000 tons as follows:-Home production 972,000 tonsImports from Southern Dominions 389,000   &quot;Imports from Irish Republic 45,000   &quot;Imports from South America 185,000   111 ,591,000   &quot;2. The imports from South America represent 174,000 tons fromArgentina and 10,000 tons from Uruguay.   These amounts are includedin the non-sterling import programme at a value of  25,millions,Of these amounts 108,000 tons would be supplies arriving during thefirst six months of 1952 on the existing agreements with thesecountries at an average price of  130 a ton ( 14 millions), and 76,000 tonsrepresents arrivals in the second half of 1952 from new purchases at anaverage assumed price of  146 a ton ( 11 millions).3. It is now believed that the availabilities of South American meat inthe 12 months to June 1953 will be greater than the supply implicit in the1952 calendar year import programme.   The Minister of Food is not seeking to reopen the import programme for the current calendar year.   But heasks to be authorised to enter into commitments to purchase up to  50 millions of meat from South America during the period June 1952 to June 1953.He bases his expectations on getting 300,000 tons from the Argentine andUruguay during this period at an average price of  175 per ton - a figureabout half-way between the Argentine ideas and our own.4. Both the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food agreethat a financial ceiling for the Minister&apos;s expenditure on South American meat for the period to June 1953 should now be settled, since the 1949 Trade and&apos;Payments Agreement with Argentina provides for an annual review of meatprices and quantities and negotiations have already begun in Buenos Aires.They therefore seek a decision on this point.
5, The Minister of Food attaches great importance to improvement ofthe meat ration, believing that it is impossible for this country to workhard and find contentment at the sort of level of food rations which isimplicit in the import cuts which have been made, and that one of the most effective possible recompenses would be an increase in the meat supply.If the ceiling were placed at  50 millions instead of  25 millions for the year *1952/3, this would mean that about 120,000 tons more would be availablein the first half of 1953 than in the first half of 1952 - i. e. the meat rationwould be 4cL /5d. higher in the first half of 1953 than in the first half of 1952.6. The Minister also points out that current indications are thatArgentina will need to earn somewhere between about  65 millions and  85millions in order to cover her essential imports from the sterling area in1952/53 - the main items are oil, coal, steel, tinplate^ machinery &quot;and capital goods, raw materialsfromthe rest of the sterling area and freight.Apart from our meat purchases, United Kingdom essential imports fromArgentina - mainly oils and fats, feedingstuffs and raw materials - in 1952/3may cost somewhere around  28 millions.   The Minister of Food feels that in these circumstances the results of restricting our meat purchasesto  21. 5 millions from Argentina ( 25 millions from South America) will be(a) to drive Argentina to turn to other suppliers for her essential requirementsaridVsQ, to-,lose a traditional United Kingdom export market, and (b) unnecessarilyto deprive&apos; tihte British consumer of vitally needed meat supplies,CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERS VIEW7. The Chancellor&apos;s view is that the financial ceiling on meat purchases from South America up to June 1953, should, if we are to have proper regardto our payments difficulties, be at no greater rate than the  25 millionsauthorised for the calendar year 1952.   The balance of payments prospect ie&quot;wholly uncertain and there is as yet no definite indication that the position will improve in the course of the next twelve months to the point at which itwould be possible to increase our expenditure on imports.   Whatever &quot;thefuture may hold, it would be most imprudent at the present timerin the.middle of an acute balance of payments crisis, to enter into long-term commitment which involved an increased rate of expenditure.   There is real difficulty in deciding to spend so much foreign exchange at this particular moment,8, Taking the assumption of  175 a ton (see paragraph 3), this wouldmean that during 1952/53 we should get 143,000 tons of South American meat.This is some 40,000 less than is implicit in the present programme for the calendar year 1952.   As far as can be seen supplies from home productionand the Southern Dominions combined will be slightly less than last year.Nevertheless on present prospects, it appears that the South American meatpurchases envisaged by the Chancellor might enable the Minister of Food,by drawing on stocks, to maintain a meat ration slightly larger than in thefirst half of 1952, though still in the Minister&apos;s view too low, (There are, ofcourse, many uncertainties in forecasting rations so far ahead),9. Further, notwithstanding, the cuts already made, the consumption of meat and bacoim combined will on the present 1952 programme be abdnt 2% above 1951,tlKXigh still some 19% below the 1950 level.10. As to our bilateral balance of payments with the Argentines  on past experience, any estimate of the position by mid-1953 is highly conjectural.Nor does the Chancellor agree with the Minister of food s contention! ^t
(a) and (b) of paragraph 6,   The exports mentioned by the Minister are ofan essential kind and could be exported elsewhere without difficulty;and some of them cost us dollars.11. We ought to look at our balance of payments structure as a whole and not attempt to achieve a series of bilateral balances with each majorcountry.R.A.B.G.LL-G.19th MARCH, 1952.
