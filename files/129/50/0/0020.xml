v 1 (THIS DOCUMENT IS -THE PROPERTY OF- HER BRITANNIC-MA JEST Y^S-GOVERNMENT)^confidential.(52) 70 COPY NO. 13I0TH MARCH, 1952CABINETEGYPTNote by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs my colleagues may be interested to read the attached record of a conversation between Sir James Bowker, Assistant Under-Secretary at theForeign Office, and Mr. Searight, the SHELL representative in Egypt.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,10TH MARCH, 1952.RECORD OF CONVERSATIONMr. Searight, who is the Shell representative in Egypt, came to see me.this morning.   Mr. Allen was present during most of our talk.I knew Mr. Searight in Cairo, and remember him as intelligent andlevel-headed, and as having close contacts with Egyptians.   He was emphatic that:(a) We now had a last chance of reaching an agreement with the Egyptians, andthat we had little time left;(b) That the alternative to an agreement was the end of our commercial interests in Egypt and an occupation of Cairo and Alexandria;  and(c) To reach an agreement we should have to make concessions to the egyptians, i.e. some concession about the King&apos;s title to the Sudan to satisfy theKing and some recognition of the principle of evacuation.   In Mr. Searight&apos;view, we should now make up our minds whether to accord the principle of evacuation in the hope of securing Egyptian co-operation on defence or give up all hope of ever getting such co-operation or any defence agreement.Mr. Searight spoke highly of the new Egyptian Prime Minister as anhonest man.   He said that in accepting the post he must have been satisfied that hecould rely on the army and at least the officers of the police.   Mr, Searight thoughthe had some chance of splitting the Wafd.   His objective was to associate withhimself leaders of other political parties such as Abdul Hadi (Saadists) andHaikel (Liberals) and also Ahmed Hussein, the former Minister of Social Affairs
in the Wafd Government.   But, in Mr. Searighfs view, if the new Prime MinisterIvas to succeed in his objective, he would have to have &quot;good treatment&quot; from her MajestyTs Government.Incidentally, Mr. Searight expressed the view that if the riots ofthe 26th January had gone as the Wafd Government had intended, and hadstopped at the murder of a few British nationals and attacks on British property,the Wafd would now have been more firmly entrenched in the Government of thecountry than ever.R.J. BOWKER6th March, 1952
