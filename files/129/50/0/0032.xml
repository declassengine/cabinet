The Committee, however, felt that it should also examine in greater detail and with more time than was then available, the question whetherthe Central Office of Information should be abolished or retained. This it has nowdone, and I ask my colleagues to endorse the conclusions reached.2. The Committee in the first place invited the Treasury to investigate theprobable financial consequences of abolishing the Central Office of Information.The Treasury, in the course of this investigation, consulted twenty-four departments which make most use of the services provided by the Central Office. The reportfurnished by the Treasury pointed out that previous investigations a Committeeof Officials in 1946, the French Committee on the Home Information Services in1949 and the Select Committee on Estimates in 1950-^had all favoured a centralagency on the grounds of economy and efficiency. It went on to say that in thefield of home information services (in the light of all the twenty-four Departments&apos;views) the abolition of the central agency seemed likely to produce no significantimmediate financial gain or loss, and it might well double the cost of the overseas information services. There might, moreover, be a considerable deterioration inthe quality of information work. In the long run, the result of abolishing the centralagency was likely to be greater expense all round, since one common service Depart-ment is easier to control than many small pockets of information work in differentDepartmental Votes.3. While recognising that there may be political arguments in favour of abolishing the Central Office of Information, my Committee consider that thefinancial arguments against doing so are very powerful. We recommend, there-fore, that the Central Office should be kept in being.4. This, however, led us on to consider whether there is any duplication, asbetween the Central Office and the departmental staffs engaged on somewhat similar work, that could be avoided. We were not thinking here of the Press Officersemployed by most Departments to deal with press inquiries; we recognise thattheir work could not in practice be transferred to the Central Office of Information.We were informed, however, that some Departments notably the National SavingsCommittees, the Post Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Works,the Ministry of Labour, D.S.I.R. and the Defence Departments conduct a gooddeal of their own information work in the media employed by the Central Officeof Information (exhibitions, campaigns, posters, &amp;c.) and maintain separate staffsto do it. Under the last Government, consideration was given at various times to thepossibility of transferring such activities from the Departments to the Central Officeof Information, and some were in fact transferred (e.g., Ministry of Food publicity);but in the cases mentioned above they have been left with the Departments.42004
5. This arrangement tends to administrative confusion and to doubts aboutthe Vote on which particular items of expenditure should properly fall. It is alsoopen to the obvious objection that, if the idea of a common agency is sound andthe overhead costs justified, it should be applied throughout the whole field andfurther economies thus achieved. If all the departmental activities mentioned above were transferred to the Central Office of Information there would no doubt be some increase in the staff of the Central Office, but it should be more than offset bystaff reductions in the Departments.6. Though we realise that some of the Ministers concerned may find itconvenient to have their publicity work under their own direct control, we considerthat the present situation is wasteful of resources. On grounds purely of efficiency and economy we are bound, therefore, to recommend that information work shouldbe more concentrated in the Central Office of Information than in the past, andthat other information services (apart from the work of dealing with press inquiries)should be considerably restricted, and that, to this end, the Cabinet, should authorise a further examination by the Treasury of the departmental publicity work done.outside the Central Office of Information, with a view to making the most economical arrangements for its transfer to the Central Office. We also suggestthat, if the changes which we recommend are made, the Treasury might usefullyre-examine the administrative structure of the Central Office and the manner inwhich Ministerial control is exercised over its work.7. At the same time we recognise, though this goes beyond our terms ofreference, that there is a political aspect of this question which may cut across our recommendations. No doubt, a centralised information agency of this charactermight, in the hands of an unscrupulous extremist Government, prove both a powerful and a dangerous weapon of propaganda. That might be regarded as an argument for spreading the control of Government information services more widelyamong the departments, even if it involved some increase in their cost to the nation.This is a matter on which only the Cabinet can decide. We only mention it as itis clearly one of the factors which have to be taken into account.S.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, SWA,17th March, 1952.
