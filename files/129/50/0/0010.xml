secret. (52) 60 COPY NO.   bS4TH MARCH, 1952CABINETREVIEW OF PENSIONSNATIONAL, INSURANCE BENEFITS AND pensions memorandum by the Minister of National insurance have been having discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequerabout the review of National Insurance pensions and benefits.2. The problem is twofold.   Pensions and benefit rates are falling along way behind national assistance scales.   The resulting drift to assistance isalready causing much concern to members of our party.   Assistance rates are bound to go up in the near future and if they are not accompanied by anadequate increase in national insurance rates, national insurance will sooncease to occupy the position designed for it by the Beveridge Report and thewar-time Coalition:   that of being the first line of defence against want.   We shallbe back on &quot;the means test&quot;.3. The other side of the problem is the ever-increasing number of old people.   Everyone agrees that steps must be taken to prolong the working lifebut opinions differ about how national insurance can best help to bring this about.   My own view is that the only practicable step we can take, withoutcreating an impossible burden for pensions for the future, is to raise the pension age beyond the present conventional ages of 65 men, 60 women.   The possibilityof raising the age was referred to by Mr. Gaitskell in his Budget speech lastyear and it is recognised as inevitable by many writers on social topics,.  any increase in the pension age would, of course, be accompanied by appropriateprovisions to prevent hardship to those coming up to pension age during the transitional period.4. I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer may find it possible to provide funds for the review of pensions promised in &quot;BritaiiiStrong and Free&quot;.   But we can only make a really substantial improvement in thesituation I have described if, in addition to altering benefits and contributions, we make further changes in the insurance scheme,5. I accordingly seek my colleagues&apos; approval to open negotiationswith both sides of industry immediately after the Chancellor&apos;s announcement,with a view to working out a scheme for an increase in the statutory age for pension, possibly as far as age 67, and if it appears that such a change would be accepted without serious controversy, to adapt benefit rates and contributions to such an extent as the increase in age may render practicable.O.P.Ministry of National Insurance, S. W. 1. ,4TH MARCH, 1952.
