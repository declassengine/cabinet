Pnnted for the Cabinet.  February 1952Copy No.CABINETTHE QUESTION OF THE MONOPOLY IN BROADCASTINGv i . Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal ^. ..; At their meeting on 2.1st February (C.C. (52) 21st Meeting, Conclusion 2) mydollfeagues invited me to circulate a memorandum on the question of maintaining the monopoly enjoyed by the British Broadcasting Corporation. ,: 2. On 20th November, 1951, the Cabinet (C.C. (51) 9th Meeting, Conclusion 4)decided that, as the B.B.C. Charter was due to expire on 31st December, ah interimCharter should be granted for a period of six months to enable the new Governmentto give full consideration to the question of the terms of the Charter which was to succeed it. I was asked to take the Chair at a Committee of Ministers to studythis subject; we hope to be in a position to present our report and the draft of a white Paper in about a fortnights time. But in the meantime it has become evident that much controversy is likely to be aroused on two of the main questions to be decided, namely:-(a) whether the B.B.C. is to continue to have an actual monopoly of sound and television broadcasting; and-   (/)) whether commercial broadcasting shall be permitted in the form ofsponsored programmes or advertisements.Although these questions are distinct, they are linked because those who wish tobreak up the B.B.C.&apos;s monopoly do so because they wish to introduce sponsoredprogrammes.3. The arguments advanced in favour of breaking the monopoly of the B.B.C.and introducing other broadcasting agencies which would obtain their revenue bycommercially sponsored programmes, as in the United States, Australia and other places, are many and various. It is argued that monopoly gives the favouredcorporation an excessive if not dangerous power over public thought and ideas;that it leads to complacency and rigidity; that the Corporation becomes unwieldyand unmanageable; that the fact that there is no alternative employer gives it too great a power over its employees; and, finally, that it is far more susceptible thana number of private corporations to manipulation by an extremist Government for purely political ends.4. It is also said that, on the technical,side, commercially sponsored pro-grammes would, owing to the financial support available, ensure more variedprogrammes and better performances than is possible under the system of a publicly owned monopoly. It is indeed argued that television can never be fully developedwithout the funds derived from commercial sponsoring. That, it is urged, is theexperience of the United States.5. The arguments advanced against breaking the monopoly of the B.B.C. andgranting licences to other broadcasting agencies based on commercial sponsoringare equally varied and equally strongly held. It is argued that there are powerfultechnical considerations which must be taken into account. For one thirig, toencourage competitive broadcasting at the present time would be extremely waste-ful. It would involve heavy additional capital expenditure, both of money andmaterial, at a time when both are scarce. Moreover, there is already a serious shortage of wavelengths, though it is recognised that the progressive developmentOf Very High Frequency transmission on shorter wavelengths will lessen this objection. \.41903SECRETC. (52) 5123rd February, 1952
6. But the; opposition is based mainly on wider grounds. It is pointed outthat there is no evidence that commercial sponsoring will lead &quot;to a higher and betterstandard of broadcasting. It is said by those with experience of broadcasting inthe United States that sponsoring in that country has led them to exactly the opposite conclusion; Broadcasting based on advertising has led inevitably to corn-petition for the largest number of listeners, and the result has been a progressivevulgarisation of the programmes, both in sound broadcasting and television. Noris there any certainty that the political balance would be any better maintained.Financially powerful corporations like the co-operative societies could warp the programmes provided for listeners on one side; and great capitalist combinationscould do the same thing on the other. We-were told of one famous broadcaster inthe United States who was unable to get a place on the air at all, because his politicalviews were not acceptable to the sponsors. &quot;-&apos;7. Finally, there is no sign that there is a public demand for any change inthe present system. The B.B.C., though not perfect, is generally considered, at homeand abroad, to have done a good job and to have maintained a high standard of programmes.8. For these reasons the Committee of Ministers have been gradually driven to the conclusion that the present arrangements should be continued for the periodof the present Charter. It should be emphasised that these do not give the B.B.C.a statutory monopoly. The position is that, under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts,the Postmaster-General has the right to issue as many licences for broadcastingas he thinks proper; but in practice and in accordance with governmental policyhe never has issued more than the one to the B.B.C. It seems to the Committeethat this gives a very desirable elasticity. We fully recognise that the question of the&amp; monopoly will have to be considered further. With an improvement in theeconomic situation and the development of higher frequency broadcasting on asubstantial scale an entirely new position will arise. That will in our opinion bethe critical moment for making a final decision on the question of monopoly.9. As things are at present, however, the capital investment required and thecalls on material resources involved must, we understand, prevent any substantialdevelopment of broadcasting by new agencies. We also have come to the conclusionthat, for reasons stated above in paragraph 5, the present provision in the B.B.C.licence which prohibits the broadcasting of any commercial advertisement orsponsored programme without the consent in writing of the Postmaster-general should be continued for the time being; and no agency other than the B.B.C. shouldbe licensed to operate a sound or television broadcasting station without theapproval of Parliament. Our proposals would therefore in effect be continuing the B.B.C. monopoly for the immediate future.10. Unfortunately, opinion in the Conservative Party in the House ofCommons seems to have been moving in the opposite direction. A group of back-bench members have produced proposals (which are receiving very wide supportamong their fellow members) advocating the immediate setting up of a body to be known as the British Radio Communications Commission, on the lines of similarorganisations now well established in other countries. Its composition and functions would be:  The British Radio Communications Commission(a) The Commission should consist of five full-time members of high standing,with power to employ a reasonable staff of technicians and others.(b) To avoid any political bias the members should be appointed by the PrimeMinister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Lord Chamberlain.(c) The Commission should be responsible to Parliament through a seniorMinister.The Functions of the commission the responsibilities of the Commission should include:  (a) The establishment and regulation in Britain of a system of broadcastingwhich would allow listeners and viewers a wide choice of programmesfrom different sources, including sponsored radio.(b) The allocation and control of all radio frequencies, the co-ordination of therequirements of the Service Departments and representation at inter-national conferences.
(c) The licensing of all civilian non-governmental broadcasting agencies, including the B.B.C.

(d) The regulation (including such prohibitions as may be appropriate) of political controversy and religious and educational broadcasts.

(e) The maintenance of moral, cultural, and ethical standards; the protection of small advertisers; the affiliation of local stations to national to programmes; anti-monopoly action.

(f) The enforcement of standards and rules for advertising and sponsorship.

It will be seen that these proposals do not involve the abolition of the B.B.C. It is to continue as one of the agencies for sound broadcasting and television. But the monopoly would be ended at once, and the new British Radio Communications Commission set up.

11. We feel bound to warn our colleagues of the dangers of these proposals. There is no sign, as I said earlier, of any demand for such action in the country, and there may well be considerable opposition to it on the part of wide sections of opinion in all parties. In addition, the proposals are likely to invite the strong opposition of the Press, who will regard their advertising revenue as seriously threatened. But we cannot deny that the proposals have attracted much support on the Conservative back benches.

12. I have not attempted in this paper to embark upon the other aspects of broadcasting which need to be considered. There are not in the view of my Committee likely to be fundamental differences of opinion over other provisions of the new Charter. The monopoly issue and the associated question of commercial broadcasting are, however, likely to arouse deep-seated prejudices, both in favour and against the continuation of the present arrangements. I have therefore felt that it is right to bring this particular issue to my colleagues in order to obtain from them a considered decision of policy before proceeding further with the drafting of our report and a White Paper.
