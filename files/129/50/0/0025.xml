(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY ^-GOVERNMENT;confidential. (52) 75COPY NO12TH MARCH, 1952CABINETFUTURE OF.THE COUNCIL QF europe memorandum by the Seercretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsWhile we should keep as our ultimate objective the fusion ofthe Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O. E. E. C.) with the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,I think it would be wholly premature to launch this idea at the forth-coming meeting of the Committee of Ministers for the following reasons:-(i)    although the size of the O.E.E.C. is to be reduced, it will continueto deal with the serious trade and payments problems and it would be inexpedient to make radical changes in its structure at the present time;(ii)    we should not risk losing present valuable O.E.E.C. functions by amalgamating it with a body which threatens to become federalist;(iii)    the fusion of these two Ministerial bodies would be unlikely toprovide much additional work for the Assembly of the Council of europe which already receives and debates a report from the O. E.E.C, ;(iv)    it will not satisfy the federalists whose aim is to give in the draftNew Statute increased powers to the Assembly.The proposed fusion thus provides no answer to the immediateproblems-with which I shall be faced in Paris next week.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,12TH MARCH, 1952.
