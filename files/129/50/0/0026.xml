THIS DOCUMENT IS THE &apos; PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1952SECRET Copy No.   g 3C. (52) 7613th March, 1952    &apos;CABINETBAMANGWATO AFFAIRS: SERETSE KHAMAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations on 6th December, 1951, we announced our decision progressively to restoreTshekedi Khama&apos;s liberties as a private citizen (C.C. (51) 11th Conclusions,Minute 4). This is going as well as can be expected, pending settlement of theconnected question of Seretse&apos;s future. I can give my colleagues an oral report ifthey wish.2. I now want to turn to settlement of Seretse Khama&apos;s future in accordancewith the programme which I set out in C (51) 21, and which my colleagues endorsed.3. The last Government withheld recognition from Seretse as chief for anindeterminate period, but their promise to review the position within five years is proving more and more unsatisfactory. It is unfair on the Government, the bamangwato and Seretse himself. The Bamangwato will not settle down, andcriticism will continue until a final answer is given. Meantime the ProtectorateAdministration is having great difficulty in carrying out our decision about Tshekedi.4. To rest on this indecisive basis over Seretse and wait for three years morebefore review will not therefore produce peace, but three years of discord in theReserve and of recurrent criticism in Parliament. It could lead to bad troubles inthe Reserve, endanger or make impracticable of fulfilment our decision aboutTshekedi, and at the end of the three-year period present us with an even worseproblem to solve. It is really asking the impossible of the High Commissioner andhis officers.  We must therefore review and settle Seretse&apos;s future now.5. His recognition as chief is, in my opinion, out of the question. It wouldoutrage white opinion in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. It is one thing thatmight unite and inflame South Africa in support of the demand for transfer ofthe High Commission Territories, which are completely at South Africa&apos;s mercyeconomically and geographically. Many African chiefs in the Territories and leading Africans in the Union are opposed to recognition for this reason and becauseof ah innate dislike of miscegenation.6. Nor could Seretse go back to the Reserve as a private citizen. The senti-ment and the dynastic leanings of the tribe are at present such that they would inevitably treat him, and no other, as chief. Effective administration would become impossible unless we also accepted him as at least de facto chief. Without effectiveadministration, the tribe would suffer and deteriorate, and we should not havefulfilled our trust. For us to accept Seretse as de facto chief, or indeed to let himbecome chief in all but name, would create much the same difficulties with theUnion as legally recognising him.7.   Even in the event of his renouncing all claim to the chieftainship for him-self and his children and agreeing to abstain from the public life of the Reserve,we could not agree to his early return.  The tribal sentiment towards him would41994
create an impossible situation, unless an effective native administration had inthe interval become firmly established and Seretse himself adhered unequivocallyto his renunciation. The firm establishment of an alternative native administra-tion may take years. There is no hope of successful promotion of anyone elseas chief until the tribe really believe that Seretse is out of the running for ever.8. The best solution would be Seretse&apos;s abdication. We might persuade himto do so by offering him suitable employment in some other part of the world andconvincing him that this would be in the best interests of his people. The Secretaryof State for the Colonies has sounded the Governor of Jamaica about the possibilityof offering Seretse a post there under the Government of Jamaica. The governor would personally welcome the appointment, but finds it difficult to judge whatthe reactions of his Ministers and the public would be, though his guess is thatSeretse would be generally welcome in Jamaica. I think there is an even chance of persuading Seretse to abdicate.9. If, however, he refuses to renounce his claim to the chieftainship, it will benecessary immediately to announce that we have reviewed his future, that we havedecided to confirm and make permanent and final (with no provision for any fur-ther review) the previous Government^ refusal to recognise him as chief and thathe cannot be permitted to return to the Protectorate in any capacity for a period to which no limit can be set at present. The offer of a job would of course remain open.10. In their White Paper (Cmd. 7913) our predecessors based their decision on grounds arising domestically within the Bamangwato Reserve and did not admit that they had been influenced by the South African attitude. They ventured tohint off the record at other considerations, but in public they persisted with their original story. This attitude has become increasingly difficult to maintain. More-over, it has had the result that most of the Bamangwato, ignorant of how theirhighest interests are at stake, want Seretse back and blame Tshekedi for the Gov-ernment&apos;s denial of Seretse to them.11. If Seretse does not abdicate, we should therefore explain that good gov-ernment demands that there should be an end to uncertainty and to the unhappyexpedient of direct rule by European officers and that the way should be openedto restoration of the chieftainship in the person of some more suitable candidate.I also recommend that, in regard to the external issues i.e., the effect on the Terri-tories&apos; relations with the Union, we should say quite frankly that Seretse&apos;s recogni-tion or return as chief in all but name would gravely prejudice the future well-being and happiness of the million Africans who inhabit Bechuanaland, Basutoland andSwaziland. Opposition leaders would find it very difficult to attack us on this, since there is no doubt that this consideration was paramount in their minds and counsel.Indeed we can imply that this was so and say that we agree with them over it. &apos;12. There will, of course, be criticism. But, as I said in my earlier paper(C. 51 (21) of 19th November, 1951), there is no solution to the Bamangwato prob-lem which does not include factors open to criticism. We have to be content witha solution which is the best on balance. All my information confirms that thisview is increasingly held by many who earlier opposed or were unhappy about our predecessors&apos; treatment of Seretse. Even the Anti-Slavery Society has come round to the view that to recognise Seretse might mean losing the High commission territories and the Observer, which was perhaps the strongest critic among thepress, has begun to change its tune.13. I understand from the Colonial Secretary that Africans in the african territories for which he is responsible have hitherto shown little interest in theSeretse affair and that he has no reason to believe that the course which I now propose would lead to any increase in that interest.14.   I therefore seek authority to proceed on the following lines: -(1) first to try to persuade Seretse that abdication would be in the best interestsof his people and that he should accept the offer of a Governmentpost in Jamaica.   (This offer is subject to the Governor, clearing theproposal with his. Executive Council which cannot be done till the.    last moment for fear of leakage).
(2) If negotiations with Seretse are successful, to make a suitable announce-ment of their outcome, incorporating his renunciation of claim to the chieftainship; the precise form of announcement will depend on the outcome of the negotiations with Seretse but a provisional draft is inAppendix A.(3) If Seretse refuses to abdicate, to proceed as in paragraph 9 above and inthis event to make a statement on the lines of the draft in Appendix B..   - -  ICommonwealth Relations Office, S.WA,13th March, 1952.APPENDIX ADraft statement for issue if Seretse agrees to abdicate(Subject to adaptation in the light of events)Her Majesty&apos;s Government have further considered the succession to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribe in the Bechuanaland Protectorate and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations has discussed at length withSeretse Khama the latter&apos;s future.2. Seretse Khama has agreed to renounce his claim to the chieftainship of the tribe. Her&apos; Majesty&apos;s Government believe that this decision, which is evidence of seretse Khama&apos;s self-abnegation and regard for his people&apos;s interests, will make for the ultimate happiness and well-being not only of the Bamangwato but of their fellow Africans in Bechuanaland and the other two High Commission Territories.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have assured Seretse Khama that it is theirfirm intention to end at the earliest possible date the temporary expedient of directrule by European officers and to restore the tribal system of administration.Seretse Khama&apos;s own renunciation of claim to the chieftainship, coupled with hisuncle Tshekedi Khama&apos;s similar renunciation, opens the way to the passage ofthis office to some other suitable candidate.   ,4. Her Majesty&apos;s Government, being anxious to assist Seretse Khama andhis wife in building up a new life for themselves in some alternative sphere, areglad to be able to announce that the Jamaica Government have offered him aGovernment post and that he has accepted it. Her Majesty&apos;s Government hopethat this will afford Seretse Khama full scope to perform useful service.APPENDIX draft statement for issue if Seretse should refuse to abdicate(Subject to adaptation in the light of events)Her Majesty&apos;s Government have further considered the succession to the :chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribe in (the Bechuanaland Protectorate andSeretse Khama&apos;s claim to be recognised as chief.2. The White Paper issued by the previous Administration in March, 1950(Cmd. 7913), which withheld the recognition from Seretse Khama as chief, promisedreview of the position within five years. It also provided that both Seretse andhis uncle Tshekedi Khama should remain outside the Bamangwato Reserve, thatthe functions of the Native Authority should be vested in the District Commissioner,and that a council of local elders should be established which would progressivelyassume responsibility for the administration of the tribe.3. The principal reasons cited in the White Paper were as follows. Inaccordance with the custom of his tribe Seretse, as their chief-designate, should
have consulted his people when,he contemplated choice of a consort. His failure to do so betokened irresponsibility in a potential ruler and by his precipitatemarriage he was unmindful of the interests of his tribe and of his public duty. Hisrecognition would not make for the unity and well-being of the tribe.4. In the White Paper Her Majesty&apos;s Governments predecessors admittedtheir awareness that a strong body of opinion in Southern Africa would be opposedto recognition and, although they stated that their decison was based on quite different grounds which appeared to them good and conclusive, there can be nodoubt that this consideration was in their minds. They would have failed in their responsibility if they did not pay due regard to the need for reasonable goodwillbetween the High Commission Territories and their immediate neighbours. all three of these Territories depend on the use of the communications, ports, markets and industry of their neighbours and one of theni Basutoland can have nocontact with the outside world save through South Africa.5. The White Paper also recorded that among prominent Africans both inthe High Commission Territories and in other parts of Southern Africa there wasa considerable body of opinion against recognition of Seretse as chief.6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government agree with the reasons which actuated their predecessors in withholding recognition from Seretse. But the promise to reviewthis decision and the indeterminate and unusual character of the temporary arrange-ments contemplated, which&apos; conflicted gravely with customary tribal procedure,have not proved satisfactory or conducive to the well-being and happiness of theReserve. It is now clear that affection for traditional institutions is so strong thatsettled conditions and satisfactory administration will not be restored to the bamangwato until they again have a recognised chief. It has become essentialtherefore to bring to an end the uncertainty created by the original White paper and to terminate as soon as possible the temporary expedient of direct rule byEuropean officers. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly been obliged to review the position without further delay.7. By his disregard for tribal usage and his neglect of the wider considerationson which depend the ultimate well-being and happiness of his people Seretse Khamamade it impracticable for Her Majesty&apos;s Governments predecessors to accordhim recognition as chief. But the interests of the Bamangwato demand that thereshould be a chief and Her Majesty&apos;s Government, having reviewed the situation,have decided that their predecessors&apos; refusal to recognise Seretse must be confirmedand made permanent and final, and that the tribe should be invited to put forward in due course a candidate other than Tshekedi or Seretse. Further, good govern-ment and the well-being of the Reserve demand that Seretse Khama should absenthimself from its vicinity until an alternative chief has been securely established withhis own native administration.8. These decisions leave with Her Majesty&apos;s Government a desire to take an interest in Seretse&apos;s future and to offer him help in building up a new life in some alternative sphere. They are glad therefore to be able to announce that the JamaicaGovernment have offered him a Government post in that Colony, which her majesty&apos;s Government have strongly urged him to accept as affording opportunityof useful service in an alternative sphere.
