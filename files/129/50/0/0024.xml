LEVY AS A STAFF SIDE REPRESENTATIVEMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service have from time to time to appoint persons to panels from whichBoards or Tribunals of Arbitration are drawn.   These Boards or Tribunalsdeal with the various issues which arise about wages, conditions of service, etc, .within the field of industrial relations.   So far as the workers&apos; side isconcerned I have to appoint persons either nominated by the workmen or as representing their side.   The Statutes and agreements under which I make such appointments differ in their terms;  but I am advised that I have in all ofthem a measure of discretion.2.       In the recent disputes in which the Firemen&apos;s Union were concerned,they nominated three Communists from whom one was to be selected asthe Workpeople&apos;s Representative on the Arbitration Board.   Two wereofficials of Civil Service Unions and the third was a professor.   I refusedthem all:  I gave no reason but they knew perfectly well why I refused.   Notrouble arose and it v/as clear that the Union did not want to call public attention to my decision on this occasion.   They submitted another nominationfrom a list acceptable to me.3.       On my invitation, in order to reinforce the Panel of Workpeople&apos;representatives for the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, the Staff Sideof the National Whitley Council for the Administrative and Legal departments of the Civil Service has nominated Professor Hyman Levy, against whom there is nothing except the fact that he is a Communist.   I have hithertorefrained but I must now make a decision.   It may be relevant to note thatthis nomination was made immediately after my refusal of the nominees fromthe Civil Service Unions to the Fire Brigades Arbitration Board.   It is possiblethat it is in the nature of a challenge.4.        I consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer who is directly concerned and he has warned me that the rejection of the Staff Side&apos;s candidate will undoubtedly create a considerable storm in Civil Service Staff Associationcircles and arouse a great deal of publicity and Parliamentary activity.I agree with this.   Nor do I think that in practice the Professor could do much damage.   There is the further point that it is not easy to assert that a mancannot do a good job as an Arbitrator merely because he is a Communist.5.       On the other hand if I make the appointment it will not be easy torefuse the nomination of Communists on other occasions e. g. , when aNational Union of Railwaymen or a Foundry Workers or Electrical TradesUnion or Civil Service Clerical Association case arises.   I think, moreover,that the Trades Union Congress would be shocked.
6.       I expect trouble either way and should be grateful for the guidanceof my colleagues.7.       If it were  left to me, I should refuse to appoint Professor Levy andrely on the discretion which I possess as sufficient ground for saying that heis unacceptable to me.   No doubt the true reason would be inferred but I wouldnot say any more unless I were strongly pressed.   In that event, I shouldjustify my decision by pointing to the security measures that have alreadybeen taken in the Civil Service against civil servants and by saying that,while normally any matters likely to affect security are referred to a specially constituted tribunal, I could not risk inadvertent disclosures,I should therefore feel it my duty to draw the Chairman&apos;s attention to theCommunist sympathies of Professor Levy.   The Chairman is responsiblefor selecting the members of the Panel to sit on each occasion and it wouldbe in the public interest that he should be aware of any qualification attachedto Professor Levy&apos;s appointment.   But I think this would be most undesirable;any person appointed by me must be fully acceptable on all occasions onwhich he may be liable to serve.8.        On the broadest grounds I want to discourage the nomination of self-confessed Communists in present circumstances for enquiries or arbi-trationsfor which I am responsible in the industrial relations field.W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W, 1. ,11TH MARCH, 1952.-2-
