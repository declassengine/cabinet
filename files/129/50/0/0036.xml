- (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 86 COPY NO.   (, j24TH MARCH, 1952CABINETFUTURE OF THE CENTRAL OFFICE OF INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Postmaster-general  have read the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper (C. (52) 82) on theFuture of the Central Office of Information and I feel bound to register mystrong objection to the conclusions reached, if - as I must assume - theyare intended to include the Post Office.2. In my view there is a very real danger of carryingcentralisation to a point where the centralised organisation is beyond theoptimum size for efficiency, the more so when it is coupled, as it is here,with a tendency to compress the Post Office into the same mould as that ofother Government Departments, despite its obviously different responsi-bilities and operational work.   I can certainly see no evidence of anybenefit that the Post Office is receiving from its present use of theCentral Office of Information.   Indeed, if we could be released from ourpresent obligations to use it as much as we have to, we could both improve the effectiveness of, and cheapen, our public relations machine.3. The idea of a common agency may well be sound in the case of departments which, in spite of their differences, have on the whole acommon purpose in the sense that their functions are primarily political or administrative.   But in a nation-wide trading concern like the PostOffice, where publicity is inextricably mixed up with every one of itsnumerous and frequently highly technical services, the publicityorganisation must be in close and daily contact with all these services.4. The Post Office operates four great commercial undertakings,Posts, Telephones, Telegraphs (inland and overseas in each case)and Savings.   It might even be argued that it is largely by the accidentof history by which we became nationalised before the days of the conception of the public corporation that we are a Government department at all.   Our publicity work is far more akin to the other nationalised public utilities than to a normal Government Department.   Yet no one has so farsuggested that these organisations should be compelled to depend fortheir public relations on a large centralised body which cannot possibly have the necessary background knowledge of the services that it isattempting to explain to the public.5. The Post Office has an accumulated experience of generationsof how the public reacts on all questions with which it has to deal andit has a publicity organisation that has proved itself in practice over manyyears.   Our Publicity Officers are kept in the closest touch with theworking of the machine, not only at Headquarters but in our various Regions.This latter point is of special value.   In fact I should say that local
knowledge, day to day contact with Post Office policy and problems,and absorption in the Post Office team spirit (something that is very strong)are not only of the greatest importance, but that each one is essentiallycomplementary to the others.   Not one of them is available to us if wehave to rely on the Central Office of Information.6. I feel most strongly, therefore, that none of the Post Officepublicity work should be included in the arrangement proposed in theLord Privy Seal&apos;s paper.D.Post Office Headquarters,  . C. 1. ,24TH MARCH, 1952.
