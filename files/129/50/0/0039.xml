7(THIS-tmUMENT -IS--THE PROPERTY OF HER-BRITANNIC MA JEST Y-&apos;S- GOVERNMENT)1SECRETC. (52) 89 COPY NO.   b /25TH MARCH, 1952CABINETTHE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATIONSEXTERNAL services memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Jjrant-in-Aid for the British Broadcasting Corporation(B.B.C.) External Services for the financial year 1952/53 has been fixed,after consideration by the Cabinet Government Information Services committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, at the same figure as lastyear, viz. :  4,750,000.   As my colleagues know, this decision has obligedthe Corporation to save about  360,000 in order to meet rising costs.   some services have had to be cut.   In addition to these economies the B.B.C. now have to find a further sum of  80,000 in order to finance measures to counter the recently-introduced Soviet and satellite jamming of the Corporation^services to Finland and to the Soviet satellites.2. On the 5th February, I addressed the Chancellor of theExchequer on this subject, pointing out that if, as was anticipated, the B, B. C.could be allowed to reduce their expenditure in 1952/53 on civil defence, the net increase required for anti-jamming measures over and above the sum laid downin the Grant-in-Aid might only be  50,000.   This has since been confirmed,in that I now understand that the B. B. C. will in fact not be in a position to spendmore than  70,000 of their allocation to Civil Defence of  100,000 in thecoming financial year.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, however, been unable to accede to my request. It is his view that, whereas the measures to counterjamming involve additional costs, the essence of the recommendations of theLord Privy Seal&apos;s Committee was that increased costs of essential services must be compensated for by economies in less essential services. I do not,of course, contest this as a general principle: but I would ask the Cabinet toconsider the effect of its ,strict application to the problem raised by Sovietjamming.4. Unless this sum of  50,000 can be provided from outsidethe Grant-in-Aid the Corporation will be obliged to reduce its output further inorder to find it.   The Corporation could do so in the following ways, or a combination of them, all of which I consider unacceptable :-(i)  By giving up entirely all broadcasting to Latin America (annual cost  50,000);(ii)  By giving up broadcasting to Russia and the associated anti-jammingmeasures (annual cost  50,000);(iii)  By giving up broadcasting to Bulgaria, Roumania and Albania and the associated anti-jamming measures if, as is almost certain, jamming iextended to these services (annual cost  50,000);
(iv)  By a combination of further cuts in the European services viz.eliminating the Danish, Portuguese, Dutch and Swedish services(annual cost  40,000) and the elimination of the services inAfrikaans, Tamil, Marathi, Cingalese, Siamese and Vietnamese(annual cost  19,000).5. These cuts would not, moreove r, effect savings equivalentto their annual cost in the coming financial year.   The net saving would beof the order of some two-thirds of their cost.6. The B. B. C. may, in the course of the coming financial year,be able to effect savings of the order of  10,000 -  15,000 by deferring certainprojects.   These savings, if made, will probably however have to be devoted to maintaining, in the face of hostile jamming, the relays of their programmes to Eastern and South-eastern Europe over a broadcasting station leased from theAustrian authorities.   The cost of maintaining these relays is not included in thesum of  50,000 for which provision is now being sought.7.  50,000 is not a large sum, but I would emphasise that animportant matter of principle is at stake.   There is no reason, to suppose that soviet and satellite jamming will be limited to the Corporation^ programmesdirected to Soviet Russia and to the satellite States.   The jamming of theirFinnish service shows already that this is not the case;  and the Yugoslav and turkish services (to name two obvious examples) may well strike the Russiansas suitable targets at any time.   Is the Corporation therefore to be obliged toreduce its output whenever Soviet or satellite jamming is extended?   There is evidence to show that the situation is likely to deteriorate.   If the  50,000for anti-jamming is not forthcoming the Corporation will be forced to suspendoverseas broadcasts on the lines set out in paragraph 4.   And if jamming isextended, and no financial provision made to meet the necessary counter-measures, further programmes will have to be dropped.   Our overseasbroadcasting policy will thus, in fact, be decided not by us but by the degreeof jamming decided on by the Soviet Government and their satellite agents.8, Nor will this only involve reductions in our overseas broad-casting.   It will also mean that the Corporation will lose the use of the frequencies concerned at the best listening times.   Once they have beenvacated and taken into use, either by friend or foe, it is impossible to recoverthe audience which previously listened on them to the B. B. C.Re commendation9. In these circumstances I feel bound to invite the Cabinet toagree that the Grant-in-Aid to the External Services of the B.B. C. should beincreased by  50,000 in the financial year 1952/53.A.E.Foreign Office, S. &quot;W. 1.,25TH MARCH, 1952.
