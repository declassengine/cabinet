(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 61 COPY NO.   ^5TH MARCH, 1952CABINETJOHN DEERE PROJECTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i am very sorry to trouble the Cabinet again on the questionof John Deere, but in the Conclusions of 21st February (C.C.(52) 21stConclusions, Minute 3) it is stated that, if the offer to be made to theCompany by the President of the Board of Trade did not succeed, thematter could be further considered.2. I regret that the Company will not undertake to build the factorythemselves, and have ordered their manager in Scotland to enter into nofurther commitments.   They wish to have a free hand to go elsewhere unless they can be assured of a definite date in this country.   This, the Presidentof the Board of Trade does not wish to be committed to;  but I feel I must warnmy colleagues that when this news becomes public a strong reaction will develop.   I feel that Ministers v/ill be in some difficulty in defending theposition.   Our offer to let the Company have the steel required at once ifthey would do the building seems to me to have demolished the argument for stopping the project (i. e. , lack of steel), and I personally shall have some difficulty in thinking up a way out.3. I am satisfied that the Company would like to go on with this project in Scotland and our predecessors in office had promised them thatit would proceed in spite of rearmament.   The Company tell me that if itdoes they will bring in during the next five years the dollars shown in theAppendix.   I therefore ask that a date be given which will enable them to plantheir affairs in an orderly and business-like way.Scottish Office, S.
