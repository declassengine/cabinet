COPY NO.    1 OCABINETIMPORT CUTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have considered possible import cuts with the Lord president and the Departmental Ministers concerned.    It is understood that ministers are free to express to the Cabinet any reservations they may feel on individual items.secret.(52) 595TH MARCH, 19522, Without breaking contracts, we cannot save much between now andthe end of June.    Meanwhile the drain on the gold reserves is unlikely tobe halted, and we may be unable tc*.avoid an open crisis of sterling,3. The purpose of these cuts is to attempt to hold the position in thesecond half of the year, when any further drawing on the reserves wouldbe highly dangerous.    We cannot afford to take risks on this.    We -mustcut at least  100 millions off the 1952 import programme from non-sterling sources, in addition to such extra earnings as may be possible bydiversion from defence production and savings from postponing Servicestockpiling.4, In deference to the Cabinet decision, I have omitted savings oncoarse grains (although this is the only major quick dollar savingavailable).    I have also omitted savings from reduction in the housing programme, although the increase in the housing programme affects thebalance of payments directly, not only because of softwood imports butalso because of consumption of metals and cement, and diversion fromother building work which could contribute directly to import-saving and export.5, Savings from the dollar area are particularly important, for thisis the hard core of the problem.6. The items in the list, excluding further deliberalisation of tradewith Europe, are as follows:- Saving; in 1952Total Dollar Area m  mMILITARY PREPAREDNESS ITEMSWheat.  Reduction of stocks at end-1952 from13 to 10 weeks&apos; consumption;  this iscommercially adequate, but weakens our strategic position.Canned Corned Meat.   Stopping newpurchases   for strategic stockpile fromArgentine and Uruguay;  we already havestocks enough for six months&apos; Service and 8emergency civilian needs, _ _c/f 17 9-1-
 m  mb/f 17 9FOOD CONSUMPTION ITEMSSugar,    Reduction in ration to 8 oz, saves 6 millions a year in dollars; purchasesare largely committed, and we should not get actual dollar saving until early in 1953,but we should be strengthening our stocks,which would help to offset other stock losses.     4jr 4-jCarcase meat.    If we made no new purchases of Argentine and Uruguaymeat we should save  12 millions in 1952; the meat ration would fallwell below 1 /- for part of the year.    We may be unable to buy at atolerable price (both in itself and in relation to the prices we pay theSouthern Dominions) in any case, and we should not take a decisionnow.    If we cut the sugar ration now, and we could not get the meaton tolerable terms, we should have the sugar available to restore the sugar cut and thus avoid cutting both sugar and meat - cutting bothwould, in the view of the Minister of Food, reduce caloric intakebelow an adequate level,,Oils and fats.    Reduction of 25,000 tons inpurchases, borne partly by stocks andpartly by reduction of linseed consumption by industry. miscellaneous Government purchases.    No newpurchases of canned fish, milk products,coffee, rice, dried fruit.    These have, ofcourse, been heavily cut already. 5 2RAW MATERIAL ITEMSSoftwood.    Reduction in stocks by further50,000 standards, to risky level. 3-2-Other timber. Tighter licensing of hardwoodand plywood0Pulp/paper.  Reduction in prices achieved byceiling policy, and some further cuts. i-3 (3)Cotton.     Lower demand and reduction of stocks. &apos; 31 (17)MISCELLANEOUS ITEMSTobacco.   Postpone purchases of 20 millionlb. of 1952 purchase to 1953.    Unless greatrisks were to be run with Revenue, thiswould only be a postponement. 44 44Machinery.   Tightening of dollar licensing(very slow to produce much saving). 1 1Manufactures.    Tighter licensing. Z\, Zk3TOTAL......911441
OfOb7.    DELIBERA.LISATIONTo continue to import non-essentials freely from Europe, when weare paying 80 per cent gold (and will shortly be paying 100 per cent) in our european Payments Union (E.P.U.) settlements cannot be defended.    OurE.P.U. deficit is at last beginning to show signs of falling, but we shall haveto pay them $50 millions in dollars this month, and we need to get into a surplus position and earn the dollars back as quickly as possible.    We are approaching the season of the year, moreover, when we normally have alarge deficit with E.P.U., and we simply cannot afford to be in deficit.At the same time we want to avoid doing more damage to the Europeaneconomy (and particularly to France) than we can help, and to avoidretaliation.8. It is proposed that over a selected field we withdraw the open general licences (which permit import without quota restriction) and impose a standstill on the issue of new licences for a period of some weeks.    Weshould in this period permit supplies to come in under existing contracts,and issue new licences where this is needed for the economy.    We could then decide, in the light of the course of events, at what level we should issue licences at the end of the standstill period.9. We should of course aim at securing a substantial net saving.10. A list has been prepared accordingly, of which the following arethe prmcipal characteristics:-Food.    It is recommended that we should not restrict wines andspirits, fresh fish, citrus fruits, or (more than they are restrictedalready) tomatoes and fresh vegetables.    The reasons for notrestricting wines and spirits (great administrative difficulty, and damage to France) would require to be explained publicly;restricting fresh fish is administratively impracticable; the food supply case against citrus fruits is very strong; quotas have alreadybeen announced for the permitted imports of tomatoes and freshvegetables during the summer season.    The only significant fooditems to be included would be cheeses and hog and sheep casings.Raw Materials.   A number would be included, such as hardwood, dork,rosin, cement.Textiles.   This is by far the largest group of imports still unrestricted,and would be the biggest item on the list (restriction to about 25 percent of 1951 level would save about  20 millions).Machinery.    There wuld be administrative difficulty in reversion to individual licensing;  on the other hand, the size of the imports are substantial (Germany, Belgium, etc.) and may be expected to growas less machinery becomes available from United Kingdom production.It is intended in any case to revoke the present arrangements bywhich importers can, in certain circumstances, get machines duty-free, but this is unlikely to be an adequate deterrent.Other goods.   The list would include various miscellaneous manufacturesand other goods, such as electrical appliances, buttons, flower seeds,bulbs, roll film, hollow-ware, etc.
11. The advantage of this approach is that firstly, it provides forstopping new purchases for a period without incurring the difficultiesof forcing breaking of contracts, and secondly, that it provides flexibility,in the issue of new licences when the time comes to issue them.12.    exports the Cabinet Conclusions also raised the question of increases of exports.    This is, of course, of prime importance, for our whole futuredepends upon our ability to expand our exports greatly, especially to the dollar area,,1     I do not think we can rely upon very much more from this source in the second half of 1952 than we are already counting on, but thewhole effort of our industry must be directed towards a further majorexport expansion, and how we can achieve this is one of the most urgentthings that we have to tackle.R.A.B,Treasury Chambers, S,W.lj5TH MARCH, 1952.
