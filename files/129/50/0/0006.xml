confidential. (52) 5629th February, 1952CABINETFUTURE OF THE COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government1. introduction the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his paper C. (52) 40 proposes thatthe Council of Europe should be reconstituted so that it may become primarilyan institution of the new six-power Continental Federation. Britain and other european countries not party to the Federation would presumably assume some kind of &quot; country membership &quot; of the Council or perhaps retire from it altogether.Having taken, some part in the movement towards European Unity, while ourParty was in Opposition, I venture to trouble my colleagues with the following observations:  2. Retrospect(a) The Attitude of the Conservative Party in OppositionThe revival of the European idea in the post-war years owes everything toMr. Churchill. Without him there would have been no European Movement andno Hague of Brussels Congress. Without these there would have been no Councilof Europe.It was, of course, clear from the start that our membership of the Common-wealth and our special relationship with the United States would preclude us from joining a European Federation. As I understood it, however, the conception forwhich Mr. Churchill and many of us in the Conservative Party (as well as some in other Parties) were working was a European Community, developing on what might be called Commonwealth lines, which Britain would join as a full member.As such, we should hold a balance between France and Germany, and might thusfoster their reconciliation and keep the leadership of Europe in our own hands.That this was no mere personal interpretation of our policy is suggested bythe attitude we adopted as a Party towards the Schuman Plan and the european army.The Schuman Plan was not, of course, a British proposal. Nor could we have accepted its &quot; supra-national&quot; character as devised by M. Monnet. It will beremembered, however, that we divided the House of Commons upon a motioncensuring the Socialist Government for their refusal to take part in the preliminarytalks in Paris, to which the French Government had invited us. At Strasbourg,moreover, with Mr. churchill&apos;s approval, we put forward an amended version ofthe Schuman Plan which, in our view, would have been acceptable to Britain.The conception of a European Army was first put forward by Mr. Churchillhimself, at Strasbourg, in a resolution calling for &quot; the immediate creation of a unified European Army subject to proper European democratic control and acting in full co-operation with the United States and Canada.&quot; The special mention inthe text of this resolution of Canada and the United States, distinguishing them fromthe European Powers, suggests that it was then our intention that Britain shouldbe a full member of the Army.41926 copy No.   ^Printed for the Cabinet.   February .1952
Later on, M. Pleven brought forward detailed proposals for the formationof the European Army. These had also been drafted by M. Monnet and were toofederal in character to be acceptable to us. As in the case of the Schuman Plan,however, we expressed regret in the House of Commons that the Socialist Govern-ment did not send high ranking military representatives to attend the ensuingnegotiations.(b) The Attitude of the Labour GovernmentOur conception of a European Community, in which Britain would be a full member, was not accepted by Mr. Attlee and his colleagues. Indeed, their negative attitude towards all things European literally drove the Governments of France,Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries back upon the idea of a purely Con-continental Federation. As a result, the Schuman Plan Treaty was signed and thenegotiations on the European Army brought almost to a conclusion without ourview of these two matters ever being put forward at the official level. Whether thispolicy will be maintained by the Labour Party in Opposition remains to be seen.(c) The Attitude of the Conservative government it would scarcely have been possible, when we came into office last October,to revive at once our original conception of a European Community in which britain could have joined as a full member. The Schuman and Pleven Plans were too far advanced. Had we come forward, indeed, with amendments to these Plansor alternative proposals, our initiative might well have been regarded by the Frenchand German Governments as an attempt to sabotage their own efforts. It wouldcertainly have been resented by General Eisenhower, as further delaying german rearmament. In the circumstances, therefore, it is hard to see what more we could have done than we did; namely to undertake that we would appoint an ambassador to the Coal and Steel Authority and that we would associate our armed forces inEurope as closely as possible with the European Defence Community, if and whenit came into being.3. Future PolicySo much for the past. What of the future? In the next few weeks we are likelyto be faced with one of two things. Either the European Defence Community willbecome a reality. Or, in spite of agreements here and at Lisbon, it will become adead letter or even be rejected by the French and German Parliaments. what should our attitude be towards either of these eventualities?(a) If the Defence Community does come into being. ...A purely Continental system binding Germany to the West would no doubt be preferable, from a British point of view, to the complete absence of any Europeansystem at all. It could, however, present serious economic and political dangers toour interests, especially if it fell under German domination.At a time when British industry faces a critical shortage of coal, steel, scrapand iron Ore, the emergence of a giant continental cartel in these commodities mightwell make our problems more difficult. If, on top of that, we were to see the mar-kets and the sources of supply of Western Europe and its Colonial possessionspass into a German dominated customs union, the outlook would be dark indeed.There is the graver political danger that a German-dominated Continentalsystem might in certain circumstances side with the Soviets. In that event we shouldbe in as bad a position as we were in 1940. I, therefore, agree whole-heartedly withthe Foreign Secretary that we can only welcome a Continental Federation if it is formed within the framework of the Atlantic Community and can be kept there.To do this, the closer our association with the organs and institutions of Europe the better.If the Continental Federation comes into being we cannot escape altogetherthese dangers. We can, however, reduce them in so far as we can exercise influenceupon its development. One way of doing this would be through close association with its different functional authorities, such as has already been suggested in res-pect of the Schuman Plan and the Defence Community. Another is through theorgans of the Council of Europe. I agree with the Foreign Secretary that it is most desirable that the institutions of the six-power Continental Federation should developwithin the Council of Europe. It is important, however, to ensure that in working for this we should do nothing to diminish Britain&apos;s status in the Council of Europe
or that of our Scandinavian, Greek and Turkish friends. Our aim should be to subordinate the Continental Federation to the Council of Europe rather than to subordinate the Council to the Continental Federation.(b) If the Defence Community does not come into beingThanks very largely to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s untiring efforts, the ContinentalGovernments seem to have reached some measure of agreement upon the defence community proposals. But can they carry their Parliaments and their peopleswith them? The recent debates in the French and German Parliaments suggestthat this is, at the least, doubtful. Should the Parliaments reject the defence community proposals, a serious situation may arise, unless new proposals are putforward to take their place. The whole idea of European Unity may be abandoned and we should be faced, instead, with a return to intense nationalism both in Franceand Germany. In Germany this might lead to a Neutralism, sliding all too easilyinto an association with the Soviets. In France it would perhaps start withGaullism and degenerate into a new Vichyism.It seems to me that if the proposals for a European Defence Community shouldcollapse it will be essential to our interests to find something to put in their place.If I am right in this, the natural initiative for us to take would be to revive our original conception of a United Europe in which Britain could join as a full member.Such a Europe could not, of course, be a Federation. But Federation is notthe only form of constitutional association between States. We have ourselvesdevised another: the Commonwealth relationship. Britain, with the full supportof the Commonwealth, might join a European Union or Confederation organised on Commonwealth lines. The following might be its main features:  (1) Continuous consultation between Governments assured by frequentmeetings of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.(2) The creation of a European public opinion through the consultative assembly.(3) The linking of the European currencies individually or collectively to sterling.(4) The setting up of Specialised, but not Supra-national, Authorities in whichultimate responsibility would rest with national Governments. these might include a European Army, composed of national units of at leastdivisional strength in which the joint command would be responsible,as in the N.A.T.O., to the different national Governments. This, indeed,was Mr. ChurchuTs original conception.I can see no constitutional difficulties in the way of Britain joining such a union to the fullest extent, provided it is made clear that, for the purposes of theEuropean Community, our special arrangements with our partners in the Common-wealth must be regarded as a domestic matter.This Commonwealth solution to the problems of European Unity is muchdiscussed on the Continent at the present time. Nor would it involve any verygreat change in existing Continent plans. As a result, of pressure by the BeneluxPowers, the supra-national character of the Schuman Plan and the defence community have already been very much modified. It may well be that we shouldhave little difficulty in obtaining such further amendments to both these plans as might seem necessary or desirable.5. conclusion in the last few weeks we have certainly done all that our French and Americanfriends could expect of us to help bring the Continental Community into being.If, as a result of our efforts, it does become a reality we must face up to the possibledangers which it may present to us and seek to influence its development by allpossible means and epecially through the Council of Europe. If, in spite of all our efforts, however, the Continental Community should collapse, we should seize the opportunity to come forward with our own constructive alternative to federation.Meanwhile, I cannot help asking whether the forthcoming meeting of theCommittee of Ministers is the right moment to bring forward proposals forremodelling the Council of Europe.  The Coal and Steel Authority &quot;is not due tobe set.up until six months after the Treaty has been ratified by all its signatories.41926 b 2
The Defence Community is still very far from ratification. Accordingly, evenif a Continental Community does come into being there will still be plenty of timeto determine its eventual relationship to the Council of Europe. If it does not and we come forward with alternative proposals we shall want the Council toremain in something like its present form. I would, accordingly, suggest that forthe time being we accept as much of the proposed new statute as we reasonablycan and postpone raising larger issues until the situation is clearer.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,29ih February, 1952APPENDIX1. The Schuman PlanMr. Eden said in his speech of 26th June, 1950, in the House of Commons:- Column 1913, Hansard, Volume 476&quot; I beg the Government tO consider this, that if Germany obtains the dominant role in that partnership it might not be a revised militarism somuch as an artificial bid for neutrality it would have disastrous consequences for us and immense advantages for Russia. I say deliberately that in all itsdreams of wedge-driving Russia could hope for nothing better than thereduction of Britain to the status of observer in Franco-German relations.&quot;Column 1916&quot; Would we be prepared to enter discussions as a result of which a high authority would be set up whose decisions would be binding upon the nations who were parties to the agreement? My answer to that question would be,yes, provided that we were satisfied with the conditions and the safeguards.&quot;Columns 1923-24&quot; If the Schuman proposals were not to succeed, nobody denies that thiswould be a calamity for peace. If they were to succeed without us, there wouldbe real dangers for us, I think, political as well as economic. The government must feel as we do, that whatever the mistakes or differences of the immediatepast, here is an opportunity to play our part not only in uniting this nationbut in uniting the free countries of Western Europe. Our appeal to theGovernment is to seize that opportunity. I pray that we shall not appeal invain, remembering always that if this country is to be worthy of itself, it hasnot to follow but to lead.&quot;2. The European ArmyMr. Churchill said at Strasbourg, August 1950:  &quot; Those who serve supreme causes must not consider what they can get, but what they can give .... We should make a gesture of practical and con-structive guidance by declaring ourselves in favour of the immediate creationof a European Army under a unified command, in which we should all beara worthy and honourable part.&quot;Mr. Eden said in his speech in the House of Commons on 12th February,1951:-Columns 49 and 50, Hansard, Volume 484&quot; . . . . this European Army would, of course, form part of general eisenhower&apos;s Atlantic Force. French, Belgian and German units would berepresented in it, and maybe others also. I should hope that we would be there.&quot; I do not suggest that the whole of our defence effort on the Continentshould be in the European Army, but to me it seems that there is here a uniqueopportunity for which we may never forgive ourselves if we miss it . . . .&quot;
&apos; I understand that the representatives of France, Italy, Belgium and theNetherlands are meeting in Paris I believe it will be in the next few days to discuss this project. It has many technical problems, which the Right hon.Gentleman no doubt has in mind. We are to be represented there, I under-stand, by our Ambassador, but only as an observer. I would beg the Govern-ment, even at this late hour, to reconsider their decision and to send a delegate to this Conference who will make constructive suggestions and try to meetthe technical difficulties in a spirit of a real desire to see a European Forceestablished.&quot; It seems to me that there are really, broadly, only two policies for germany. One is to try gradually to bring Germany into closer co-operationwith the West. That is surely our policy that of both sides of the House politically and economically. If that is to be followed, then it is bound sooner or later to find some expression in the sphere of defence. It is absolutelyinescapable, as it was before. Would it not be immensely advantageous to peace if that German contribution could find expression in a European Armywhere French, Belgians, Dutch and British would serve side by side? &quot;Column 157&quot; Does the Minister of State absolutely rule out our taking our part withthe other Powers? We used to declare the Socialists used to declare for international security forces. Can we never join this, even if it is a good one? &quot;
