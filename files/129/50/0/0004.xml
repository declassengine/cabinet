E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,27th February, 1952.ANNEXWarning Statement on KoreaWe, the United Nations members whose military forces are participating in the korean action, support the decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the united nations Command to conclude an armistice agreement. We hereby affirm our determination fully and faithfully to carry out the terms of that armistice.   We41918
expect that the other parties to the agreement will likewise scrupulously observe its terms.The task ahead is not an easy one. We will support the efforts of the united nations to bring about an equitable settlement in Korea based on the principles which have long been established by the United Nations, and which call for a united,independent and democratic Korea. We will support the United Nations in itsefforts to assist the people of Korea in repairing the ravages of war.We declare again our faith in the principles and purposes of the united nations, our consciousness of our continuing responsibilities in Korea, and our determination in good faith to seek a settlement of the Korean problem. We affirm,in the interests of world peace, that if there is a renewal of the armed attack,challenging again the principles of the United Nations, we should again be unitedand prompt to resist. The consequences of such a breach of the armistice wouldbe so grave that, in all probability, it would not be possible to confine hostilitieswithin the frontiers of Korea.
