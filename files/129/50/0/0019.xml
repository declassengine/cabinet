11 ?/r*(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CjfcCRETC. (52) 69                                                                                     COPY NO.   /O - -lOth MARCH, 1952CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH EGYPT on defence AND THE sudan memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs with reference to my memorandum C (52)63, I have now receivedfrom H. M0 Ambassador at Cairo a number of telegrams which confirm the view expressed in that memorandum that we should make every effort to reach an agreement with the present Egyptian Government.   That Governmentappears to be honest and reasonably well disposed towards us, but its positionin the country is not a strong one.   H.M. Ambassador at Cairo thereforeconsiders that we must help it by agreeing to issue a joint statement afcgrat thebasis of the negotiations at an early stage.   I agree with his view.2.      My colleagues will remember that, when we discussed this questionpreviously, we approved the text of a draft communique which might beissued by ourselves and the Egyptian Government on the resumption of negotiations (see paragraph 3 of Foreign Office telegram No. 78 Saving to cairo of the 20th February).   H.M. Ambassador at Cairo has now suggested,in his telegram No. 493 (Annex 1), the text of an alternative joint statement.I would favour the acceptance of paragraphs 1,2 and 3 of his draft since Iam convinced that it will be essential for us to make such a move for thereasons I have given.   I am not personally afraid of such a statement ofprinciple.   Its application would be a matter of negotiation in which we Gouldreasonably obtain some latitude.3.       I do not however feel that I can recommend acceptance of paragraphs 5, 5 and 6 of the Ambassador1 s draft as they stand.   My own view is that wecannot agree specifically to even conditional recognition of King Faroukrsclaim to be King of the Sudan without to some extent prejudging the decisionof the Sudanese.   I would suggest therefore that, while retaining a referenceto the right of the Sudanese to self-determination, the furthest we can gowould be to state that, in our discussions with the Egyptian Government onthe Sudan, the primary concern of both Governments will be the interestsand wishes of the Sudanese people, together with a recognition of the factthat it is essential that the friendliest relations should link the two peoples.of Egypt and the Sudan.4.       It would then of course be for us to work out in the course of our discussions with the Egyptian Government how such a statement of principlemight be put into practice and we would seek to do this on the lines of paragraphs 10 to 13 of the instructions contained in the draft despatch to cairo attached as Annex B to C. (52) 43.-1-
A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.l0lOth MARCH, 19525.       I therefore recommend that, in addition to approving therecommendations in my memorandum C. (52)63, my colleagues shouldapprove the issue at the appropriate stage of a joint statement with theEgyptian Government on the lines of the draft in Annex II to thismemorandum.
ANNEX i telegram No. 493 of 7th MARCH, 1952 from her MA JEST Y&apos;S AMBASSADOR AT CAIROFollowing is rough draft of a possible joint statement which I would hope we might agree to make provided we are satisfied that the egyptian government would immediately thereafter enter on negotiations with theother sponsoring Powers of the Middle East Command.   I do not personally think we can hope to get away with anything less.(Begins):Her Majestyfs Government in the United Kingdom and the Royal egyptian government have agreed to resume discussions for a general settlement on the following basis:-(1)  Both Governments recognise and agree that the successfuldefence of the Middle East is an international responsibility and depends on the collaboration of all the States concerned intime of peace as in time of war.
