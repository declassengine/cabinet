!]4(THI S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 86 COPY NO.    l&amp; ^)24th MARCH, 1952.cabinet future OF THECENTRAL OFFICE OF INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Minister of works must dissent from the recommendation of the Lord privy seal and his Committee (C. (52) 82) that the information service givento the building industry by the Ministry of Works should be among those centralised in the hands of the Central Office of Information.The building and civil engineering industries with an output of some 1,500 millions a year have never undertaken the research or thepublication of the results of research as one might expect from sopowerful an industry.   The Ministry of Works performs for the industry at a net operating cost of some  12,000 a year the preparation of leafletson building methods, the showing of films, the giving of lecturesand the exhibition of building plant and practice.   All this workdemands a specialised staff who live with the industry.   I have told the National Consultative Council for the building and civil engineering industries that I think the industry should take over the bulk of this work.   This seems to me a more fruitful development than to transfersuch a technical service to a centralised information office whichwould not possess the contacts with the industry which have been built up by the Ministry of Works.D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.25th MARCH, 1952.
