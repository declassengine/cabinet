Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1952mCONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 72.10th March, 1952CABINETTHE UNITED NATIONS DRAFT COVENANTS ON HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights has been asked by theGeneral Assembly to draft two Covenants on human rights-one to contain civil and political rights and the other economic, social and cultural rights. It is now necessary to give instructions to the United Kingdom representative on theCommission.Recommendation2.   I propose that our representative should (a) Continue to advocate a Covenant on civil rights with precise obligations.This should be similar to the Council of Europe Convention on human rights, which we have ratified.(b) Continue to maintain that economic and social rights do not lend them-selves to embodiment in a precisely drafted international instrument&apos;,but, nevertheless, go along with the majority in trying to prepare aloosely drafted Covenant which might serve some useful purpose.(c) Continue to oppose the inclusion in either Covenant of an Article on&quot; self-determination of peoples &quot; as being out of place.Background3. One of the purposes of the United Nations laid down in the Charter isthat it shall &quot; promote respect for and observance of human rights.&quot; In order tocarry out this mandate the Commission on Human Rights, established in 1946,was called on to draft an International Bill of Human Rights. It was decided thatthis should consist of a Universal Declaration of Human Rights-a statement ofaims and an enumeration of rights to be protected, which was adopted by theGeneral Assembly in 1948- and a Covenant with provisions for enforcement. TheUnited Kingdom was one of the principal advocates of a Covenant, on the groundthat a Declaration alone was inadequate. It was also thought that internationalenforcement provisions would embarrass the Russians.4. The United Kingdom supported enforcement provisions in the existingdraft, by which a state party to the Covenant would undertake to reply to anyallegation by another state party that it was in breach of the Covenant. If the explanation did not satisfy the complaining state the matter could be referred toa Human Rights Committee of nine members selected by the International Courtof Justice, which would attempt to compose the dispute.&quot; The Committee would send a report to the Secretary-General for publication giving a brief statementof the facts it had ascertained and of the solution reached, or, if there was nosettlement, of its conclusions on the facts. It was always recognised that this procedure might be used by anti-colonial states to embarrass us by complaints about the Colonies.41975
5. Our aim was to obtain a Covenant including only civil rights, e.g., theright to a fair and public trial, freedom from arbitrary arrest, freedom of speech and freedom of association. These rights have already been the subject of legisla-tion in most countries and can be legally defined and protected.6. In 1950 the General Assembly instructed the Commission to include inthe draft Covenant economic, social and cultural rights. The Commission drafteda number of Articles on such subjects as the rights to work, social security, anadequate standard of living and education. We opposed the inclusion of these rights in the same Covenant with civil rights because (unlike civil rights) theycannot be drafted precisely so as to impose clear obligations. We argued that international action on economic, social and cultural rights should be left to the specialised agencies of the United Nations. We agreed, however, that we wouldnot oppose the attempt to draft a separate Covenant on these rights if the Assemblyso decided.  It has now done so.7. In getting two separate Covenants we have improved the position to someextent. Nevertheless at each stage of the discussion the project has made newdepartures from our original design. This is because the Communist, Arab andsome Latin American countries have used the human rights debates as part of theconcerted attack which they have been making in the United Nations on the more advanced countries, and have tried to turn the Covenant into an anti-colonialweapon. The latest example is the decision of the General Assembly, by a large majority, to include an article on self-determination of peoples, referring particularly to non-self-governing territories, in the Covenant or Covenants. If this decisionstands it will prevent ratification by the United Kingdom of any Covenant in whichit appears.   We may expect further anti-colonial demonstrations of this kind.Covenant on Civil Rights8. It seems to me that we should continue to advocate the type of precisecivil rights Covenant which we have taken the lead in proposing. We must ofcourse seek to eliminate objectionable Articles such as that relating to self-determination. I must, however, warn my colleagues that even if we succeed,which is not likely, we may find that we cannot ratify the Covenant because someof its Articles may be inconsistent with the domestic law or policy of the UnitedKingdom or the Colonies. Moreover, if anti-Colonial feeling continues to growin the United Nations, we shall have to consider whether ratification would be embarrassing.The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights9. Alternative courses are open to us in regard to economic, social and cultural rights:  - (a) To maintain that a Covenant on economic, social and cultural rights whichdoes not create precise legal obligations is valueless. This wouldcertainly be regarded as narrow and unco-operative. We should beconsidered hostile to economic and social progress in the poorercountries, including our own colonies, and to have forfeited ourleadership in these matters.(b) To co-operate, without binding ourselves, in preparing a loosely draftedinstrument, which most countries seem to prefer, something more thana declaration but less than a Covenant with serious obligations. Thisis the course I advocate. It would enable us, without commitments,to exercise some influence on the drafting.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,lOr/z March, 1952.
