&quot;I .1HZ(THIS \ jCUivlENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret CABINET office.(52) 94 RECORD COPY    - COPy NOt Jif.1ST APRIL, 1952CABINETSITUATION IN THE TEXTILE industries memorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will wish to know of the main suggestions which in my view offer some prospect of alleviating the position in the textile industries,and which are under urgent consideration by the Departments concerned.These cover all the important points which were raised in last week&apos;debate.2. I am not at this stage asking for decisions on these proposals.I set them out to demonstrate the type of action which is open to us, should we decide to take it.   None of these proposals involves a sharp reversal ofGovernment policy.   Unemployment in the textile industries, though grievous,is a limited problem, which should not be allowed to compromise thefundamentals of our fiscal and economic policy.3. The possibilities under consideration are the following:-&quot;(a) Purchase Tax.    Suggestions for action have naturally been pressedmost strongly in the field of Purchase Tax.   For instance, it has been urgedthat the Purchase Tax be either reduced or removed (temporarily if not for good) - either by raising the tax free level or by reducing the ratesof tax.   Action under this head is a matter of fiscal policy, and the matter is under consideration by the Chancellor.(b) Special Contracts.      The Departments concerned are examining thescope for placing more contracts for textiles at an earlier date.   TheGovernment already gives some help to areas of high unemployment bysteering contracts to them.   It may be desirable to give these areas someprice preference (as is done in the United States of America) and, in order tomeet the particular problems of the textile industries, to pay greaterattention to the localities in which the main contractor places his sub-contracts.(c) Diversification of Industry.    We should all agree with the view thatsome additional diversification of industry in those areas which areexcessively dependent upon textiles would be desirable.   Since the war therehas been little or no demand by industrialists to set up new types of industryin these areas.   These were, indeed, areas in which until recently therewas a shortage of labour.   Outstanding applications for new industrialdevelopment are of a trivial character.   If, in the situation which has nowdeveloped, industrialists make applications to set up new industries, these will of course be considered sympathetically,   But I should warn my colleagues that I do not see any field for large scale diversification in the foreseeable future.(d) Dollars for Raw Cotton.   Our cotton industry is at a disadvantage in competing abroad in a buyers market unless they get their raw cotton ascheap as their competitors.   Hitherto dollar cotton of American types has-1-
been cheaper than non-dollar cotton of those types and an adequate allocation of dollars for raw cotton in future will be needed to make our industry fullycompetitive.   The Cotton Board are coming to see the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and myself about this matter very shortly.(e) Imports.       We have already stopped the issue of new licences forthe import of Japanese grey cloth.   Imports of textiles from the Continenthave been withdrawn from Open General Licence and when we issue licencesthey will be on a basis which will allow imports at a level approximatelyhalf that of 1951.(f) Japanese competition in Colonial markets.   Japanese imports intothe Colonies are at present limited by licence imposed on balance ofpayments grounds.   Future policy will depend at least in part on the ability of the industry to produce cloth at prices not too far removed from thoseof its principal competitors.   This is one of the matters I have arranged todiscuss with the Cotton Board in the near future.(g) Australian Import Cuts.     I have put it twice to the Australian HighCommissioner that the Commonwealth Government should help us bydoubling their quotas for textiles and by taking certain other administrative measures to ease the position of our textile exports.   Their response has sofar bee. negative but Canberra telegram No. 205 of 31st March createsa new situation.   I feel strongly that we should take advantage of this development and follow up Mr. Menzies&apos; suggestion by issuing an invitation tohim forthwith.   We should indicate to him that we shall wish to discuss among other things particular difficulties affecting the textile industries.P. t.Board of Trade, S. W. 1. ,1ST APRIL, 1952.
