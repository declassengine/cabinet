The Committee, unlike previous Committees which have consideredthe problem since the war, will be small, high-level and given terms ofreference designed to secure early results.3.       The Group will be composed of six members made up of LordLlewellin, as Chairman;  Sir Douglas Ritchie, Vice-Chairman of the port of London Authority;  Mr. F. A. Pope, a member of the British transport commission;  Major Roland Thornton, the Deputy Chairman of the MerseyDocks and Harbour Board;  Sir Ernest Murrant, Chairman of FurnessWithy &amp; Co. ; and Mr. Tom Yates, General Secretary of the National Unionof Seamen, who has been nominated by the T.U.C,4.      The terms of reference will be:-&quot;To investigate the working of the ports of the United Kingdomand in particular the ports of London and Liverpool, and tosecure the co-operation of all the interests concerned in ensuring a quicker flow through the ports of inward and outward cargo;  andto report from time to time. &quot;5.       These terms of reference will enable the Committee:(a) to bring their influence to bear on all port interests soas to ensure action being taken in the many fields which require it;(b) to guide Government Departments and other large importersand exporters as to the ports where their cargoes can be most speedily handled and cleared;(c) to deal with inland transport interests with a view tokeeping the quays and wharves clear and goods flowing;(d) to influence exporters and importers in the direction ofa speedy and regular delivery and reception of their goods.
6.       The Committee will work from, and have a Secretariat drawn from,the Ministry of Transport.   Thus they will be closely in touch with theGovernment and the better able to bring pressure to bear where needed.7.       Simultaneously I shall see that new life is put into the LondonPorts Operations Consultative Panel, an organisation which can, if giventhe right support and if all the interests concerned are represented on it, prove really useful in driving through all the obstacles which have caused serious delay.8.       There is no equivalent in Liverpool to the London Port OperationsConsultative Panel.   I feel that such a Panel is essential and will seethat it is set up,9.       I ask my colleagues for their co-operation in seeing that theCommittee and the Panels get all the help they want from those Departmentswhose work brings them into contact with the ports.L.Great George Street, S.W.1.7th MARCH, 1952.
