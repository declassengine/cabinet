lip(this i^cument is the property of her britannic ma jest y&apos;s government)secret                         CABINET OFFICE-&quot; c.(52) 95 RECORD COPY copy no._:31st march, 1952.cabinet national INSURANCE.Memorandum by the Minister of National Insurance.In his Budget Speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to possiblechanges in the National Insurance Scheme and said that I would be entering into discussions with both sides of industry, particularly with regard to pensions.   he added that he had asked me to take as a measure of what could be afforded uniformbenefits of 32s. 6d. a week for a single person and 54s. for a married couple,with increases in weekly contributions of 7-ld. each from the employer and employee for men and 5^d. each for women.Result of discussions with Industry.2.       I have since sounded the representatives of the Trades Union congress and British Employers Confederation upon the possibility of finding resources to raise the weekly rates of benefits and pensions to 36s. single, 60s. married,by means of an increase in the minimum retirement age for men from 65 to 67(for women from 60 to 62) with a small further increase in the weekly contribution.The representatives of the Trades Union Congress have given me their conclusion in the following words:&quot;The proposal to increase the retirement age with corresponding increases in benefits, raised issues which we could only consider in full consultation with the Movement.   While we could not even consider theproposals without such consultation we should be willing to submit ourconsidered views to a properly constituted enquiry. &quot;The representatives of the employers are divided in view and are not preparedto put forward any definite recommendation.   They are however prepared toco-operate in an enquiry.3.       I have been glad to find that the Trades Union Congress General council are at any rate willing to co-operate in an enquiry into the possibility of raising the pension age,,   As a result of paying pensions at increasing rates to personswho have contributed for a relatively short time at an inadequate rate, a greatgap will in a few years open up between the income and expenditure of theInsurance Fund, and the deficit will reach about  300 millions a year towardsthe end of the 1960s.   I think therefore that the time has come for an enquiry into the whole question of the State&apos;s financial provision for old age and I asktheCabinet to agree to an enquiry.   I would propose making detailed suggestionslater after consultation with the Chancellor and the Minister of Labour and national Service with regard to terms of reference and the selection of individualsto conduct the enquiry.
Immediate proposals:   National Insurance and Industrial Injuries4.      We cannot however await the outcome of the enquiry before doing something to revise the National Insurance Schemes.   I think we should introduce forthwitha Bill giving effect to the proposals outlined by th&amp; Chancellor.   But I am bound topoint out that they will not do as much as I had hoped to close the gap which already exists, and is about to be increased, between insurance benefits and national assistance.5.       The main changes in national insurance and industrial injuries; benefitswill be :-(a) unemployment and sickness benefits, widows&apos; and retirement pensions to be increased to 32s. 6d. ;(b) the rate for an adult dependant to be increased to 21s. 6d. ;(c) the basic rate of industrial injuries benefits to be increased from 45s.to 55s. with an appropriate increase in the widow&apos;s pension under thisscheme.The new rate of widow&apos;s pension under the Industrial Injuries Scheme andother consequential changes in benefit rates are being worked out in agreementwith the Treasury.6.        Additional insurance contributions will be charged.   These will be approximately those announced by the Chancellor;   But I have had manyrepresentations urging that the use of halfpennies should be avoided and the preciserates are being worked out by my Department and the Treasury with the government actuary.Family Allowances7.        The Bill will also increase the family allowances payable under theexisting scheme by 3s. as announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his budget speech.Time Table8.        The Chancellor stated on 17th March that the revised payments for family allowances and national insurance benefits were expected to come into force inSeptember and that the new rates of contribution would become payable shortly   *afterwards.   If we are to keep to this time table it is essential to place orderswith the Stationery Office for the printing of the enormous number of paymentdocuments and insurance stamps at the new rates without any delay.   I therefore propose to give instructions accordingly if my colleagues accept my proposals.   i must, however, point out that once instructions are given to print order books and stamps at a particular rate it will be impossible to replace them by othersat a different rate in sufficient time to bring the changes into force as proposed.   Itmust therefore be realised that, for all practical purposes, the placing of theorders will make it impossible to make any concessions on rates of contributionor benefits during the passage of the Bill.9.       Changes in unemployment and sickness benefit and in industrial injuriesbenefits would be brought into operation earlier, say in July, as they do not involve the same amount of preparatory work.
lO.      In view of the rumours that are now circulating it would, I think, be advisable for me to make a statement before the House rises about the resultsof my discussions with industry, and to announce the course we propose toadopt, including the proposal for an enquiry.   I would propose to agree theterms of the statement with the Chancellor and the Minister of Labour and national Service.Summary11.        I ask for:(1)  authority to introduce a Bill to give effect to the changes in ratesof family allowances and rates of national insurance and industrial injuries benefits, pensions and contributions outlined in paragraphs, 6 and 7 o* this memorandum;(2) agreement in principle to an independent enquiry into the State&apos;financial provision for old age (paragraph 3);(3)  authority to take the necessary steps to enable the new rates ofunemployment, sickness and industrial injuries benefits to bebrought into operation in July, family allowances and pensions inSeptember, and the new rates of contribution shortly thereafter(paragraphs 8 and 9);(4)  authority to make an announcement in the House before the recess,the terms to be agreed with the Chancellor (paragraph lO),O.P.Ministry of National Insurance, S.W.1.31st MARCH, 1952.
