(THIS DOCUMENT-IS-^CiiE -FROFERTY-^F-HJER-B^RiTANMIC-^MAJ^STY*6 government copy NO.  itCABINETEXPORTS OF RUBBER TO RUSSIAMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn the contract with Russia for the supply of one million tons of coarse grain (of which 500,000 tons have still to arrive) it is providedthat the Russians may cease or decrease the supplies of grain if they arenot able to spend the proceeds on rubber from sterling sources &quot;or do not receive appropriate licences&quot;.   This clause, or one similar, has appeared in contracts both for grain and timber since the time when the Russiansbecame apprehensive about our strategic controls.2. Since April, 1951, exports of rubber to Russia from the UnitedKingdom and Malaya have been subject to licence.   We have kept in touch withthe United States in this matter and on the 4th April, 1951, the UnitedStates Ambassador in London was informed in a written memorandum that exports of rubber from Malaya to the U. S0S0R. would be limited to 6,000tons a month.   In informal discussion it has been since agreed that the monthly limitation could not be strictly adhered to and that the total annualfigure would be 80,000 tons, this total to cover supplies either direct or viaLondon.3. In the light of this decision the Russians were informed orally by theBoard of Trade in June, 1951, that while Her Majesty*s Government assumedno obligation whatever in the matter it was contemplated that exports would be permitted to Russia of 80,000 tons of rubber from sterling sources.   It wasmade clear that shipments would have to be spaced out, the spread of Russianbuying in the previous year serving as a guide.   There was no suggestionconveyed to the Russians that regard would have to be paid to any substantial increase in exports from non-sterling sources.   That consideration emergedlater in discussions with the Americans.4. Actual exports to Russia last year of sterling rubber were 56,000tons.   In addition, a quantity of 18,000 tons which was licensed last year butnot shipped (by reason of difficulties in the docks) has been shipped in thecurrent quarter and will count against last year&apos;s limit of 80,000 tons.This still leaves the Russians with 6,000 tons due from last year on thebasis of what was said to them about the 80e000 tons.   There were alsopurchases in 1951 of 10,000 tons-of Indonesian rubber.

The Russians do not recognise that there should be any limit ontheir purchases although they did tell us last year that they themselvesthen had in mind annual purchases of 85,000 tons.   The Russians have alsobeen restive at our attempt to spread out the issue of licences.   They saythat this is inconsistent with normal commercial transactions.6. The problem on which I wish to consult my colleagues is thatthere is a ship in the London docks, and one in Liverpool, and other ships dueto arrive in the next few days, specially chartered by the Russians to load15,000 tons of rubber which they have paid for but for the shipment of whichthey require licences.   We cannot afford to put the current grain shipmentsat risk.   (In discussing the question of licences the Russians have already referred to the clause in the coarse grain contract.)  I have accordinglyalready authorised, in agreement with my colleagues, the immediate issueof licences for 6,000 tons to count against the second quarter of this year.This leaves 9,000 tons unlicensed.70 Some of my colleagues may feel apprehensive at the quantitiesof rubber which will be shipped this quarter.   They include 26,400 tonslicensed during the present quarter, 18,000 tons backlog from last yearJslicensing and the 6,000 tons just referred to.   If the further 9*000 tons were licensed the total would be 59,400 tons for the quarter, but 18SQ00 tonsand indeed the 6,000 tons are a backlog from last year.   Moreover, not all this quantity would be shipped in time to be recorded in the Trade Accountsagainst the current quarter.8e In any event-the ships are here or will be arriving very shortlyand a prolonged hold-up in loading could only produce a major dispute withthe Russians and serious risk to our grain shipments.   Moreover, if welicense the full 98000 tons now, we shall only be anticipating what we shallin any event do in three weeks1 time, \, e. at the beginning of the second quarter.98 I therefore recommend that I should be authorised to issueimmediately export licences for the balance of 9,000 tons,,   I should like totell, the Russians that we still owe them 6,000 tons against last year andthat they need therefore count only 3,000 tons of the 9,000 tons against thesecond quarter.   I would not regard the 10,000 tons exported from Indonesia
in 1951 as a substantial increase in non-sterling exports sinesunless I compromise in this way the Russians will maintain fis?mly that even on our figure of 80,000 tons, 6S000 tons are still due to them forlast year.   I think that we shall be on immeasurably better ground  orarguing both with the Russians and with the Americans if we are able to saythat we have kept strictly to the arrangement for an annual limit of80,000 tons.P.T.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.,11TH MARCH, 1952,
