Printed for the Cabinet. March 1952SECRET Copy No.fC. (52) 80ISth March, 1952CABINETREPORT OF STEEL committee memorandum by the Minister of HealthAt their meeting on 28th December, 1951 (C.C. (51) 20th Conclusions,Minute 5), the Cabinet considered a report which I had circulated on the progress made by the Steel Committee in preparing a plan for returning the iron andsteel industry to private enterprise. The Committee have now completed their work and I present, for the consideration of my colleagues, the attached draft bill which represents their conclusions.2. The Bill repeals the 1949 Act, abolishes the Iron and Steel corporation and transfers its assets and liabilities to a Holding and Realisation Agency, whichwill have the duty of returning the nationalised companies to private ownership.3. Provision is made for the setting up of an Iron and Steel Board to supervise prices, raw materials, major development schemes, research and otherrelated matters.4. All the basic sectors of the iron and steel industry, except the steel founders,are willing to be brought within the ambit of the new Board. The fringe industries(drop forging, springs, nuts and bolts, structural steel, wire rope, wire netting, &amp;c.)have not been included.5. The Committee considered the desirability of providing a guarantee ofcompensation for investors in the event of re-nationalisation. However, in viewof the political storm which this would cause, and of the doubtful effectiveness ofsuch a guarantee, the Committee decided that it would be best not to include this in the Bill. If the attitude of the Opposition in the debates made it desirable,, a clause on these lines could be introduced at the Committee or Report Stage.6.   A detailed summary of the main provisions of the Bill is annexed.H. C.Ministry of Health, W. I,ISth March, 1952.
