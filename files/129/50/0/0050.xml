CABINET OFFIChRECORD COPYTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.. April1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 1002nd April, 1952CABINETEMPLOYMENT IN THE TEXTILE AND CLOTHING industries memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Minister of defence. At their meeting on 25th March (CO (52) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 1).the Cabinet invited us to consider urgently what further orders could be placed forclothing for the Armed Forces and the Civil Defence services, with a view to reliev-ing unemployment in the textile and clothing industries. We have reviewed thepossibilities and submit our conclusions in this memorandum.Armed forces. Almost all the clothing and textiles required by the Armed Forces underthe rephased defence production programme for 1952-53-mobilisation equipment,war reserves and current maintenance have already been ordered, and orders still to be placed would by themselves make a negligible contribution to reducingunemployment. Provided that the storage programme was accelerated and money was forthcoming to cover the cost of this, of reorganising existing capacity, and ofthe additional labour necessary to handle earlier deliveries, it would, however, bepossible to accelerate the placing of orders for the balance of the clothing and textileitems included in the original  4,700 million rearmament programme as mobilisa-tion and war reserves which, under the rephased plan, would not be placed until1953-54 and 1954-55. The total value of these orders for the three Services wouldbe about  59 million, by far the greater part in respect of the Army. The greaterpart of them could be fulfilled in 1952-53, and the balance in 1953-54. The figureof  59 million implies, however, a somewhat greater volume of work than wouldin fact devolve on the spinning and weaving industries owing to the fact that partof the orders for the cloth required have already been placed by the Ministry ofSupply.3. As it would not be possible to defer production in 1952-53 of other types of equipment in order to make room for more clothing and textiles, some expenditure would be incurred in 1952-53 above that provided in the Estimates voted byParliament, and supplementary estimates would be needed. The precise amount ofthese could not be determined until the outturn of the 1952-53 Estimates could beaccurately assessed. Provision would have to be included in 1953-54 for financingany additional expenditure on clothing and textiles in that year due to acceleration of the programme.4. Under this arrangement production of clothing and textiles for the services would, for practical purposes, fall to the normal peacetime maintenance level during1953-54 and remain at that level thereafter. In order to preserve continuity ofproduction and the standards required by the Services it is&quot; desirable that ordersfor maintenance requirements should not be brought forward.42079
5. The measures so far discussed all fall within the  4,700 million rearmament programme. The following measures requiring expenditure additional to this pro-gramme may be worth considering as means of relieving unemployment:-(a) Orders to the value of  24 million for additional mobilisation and war,.    reserve clothing to complete the Army requirements might now be placedin 1952-53. This is made up as follows: - - &quot;v:   .(i)  1.1 million originally planned for 1954-55 and since deferred;(ii)  13 million to complete requirements to authorised scales for whichthere was not sufficient money in the original rearmament programme.(b) Orders might be placed for uniform and kit to bring the Navy upto peacetime scales and to complete requirements of No. 1 and 3 dress&apos;&apos; for the whole of the Regular Army.   These orders would cost about&apos; -  5-1- million.(c) Clothing might be provided for the 140,000 Home Guard which is thepresent target for recruiting or for the full eventual planned strength of840,000. The cost, over and above current provision for the home guard, would be about  3 jnillion for 140,000 men and about  20 mil-lion for 840,000 men.(d) Provision might&apos; be made for additional war reserves costing about 7 million to bring the Navy and R.A.F. up to the scale on which theArmy programme is based.6. The placing of orders as proposed in paragraph 5 would entail additional expenditure requiring, a supplementary estimate in 1952-53 for both cost of increased deliveries and expenditure on storage capacity and labour.Civil Defence7, Among economies recently made in the Civil Defence production pro-gramme were cuts in the provision for uniform for the Civil Defence Corps,amounting to  1 million in 1952-53 and  2 million in 1954-55, and a cut of  500,000in the provision for sandbags in 1952-53: Restoration of these cuts, together withan addition to cover the balance of the 1951-52 programme which it was notpossible to execute in that year, would make a contribution to the extent of about 4 million to solving the present difficulties. &apos;8. We understand that a reduction of about one-third, representing an expen-diture of  4 million, was recently made by the Ministry of Health, in deference to treasury views,, in their programme for ordering sheets, blankets, &amp;c, for civil defence purposes, and the Minister of Health may wish to consider restoring thiscut, in conformity with any general policy adopted by the Cabinet as to the acceleration-tion of placing Government textile orders. The balance of an order by the Ministryof Health for canvas for tented hospitals and shelter for the homeless, to the valueof  2^ million, for which provision has been made.in the 1952-53 Estimates, but which has been held up, could perhaps now also go forward.9. If a start were made with providing uniforms for large numbers of theHome Guard, the Home Office would find it difficult to retain the present rationing of issues of uniform to the part-time volunteers already recruited to the civil defence Corps. The cost of issuing the full scale of uniform to these volunteerscould largely be met from a restoration of the original programme under para-graph 7 above, but in that event extra provision should certainly be made tocreate mobilisation stocks at least for the whole-time element of the Civil defence services. To make provision for, say, 500,000 whole-time members of the civil defence Corps,; Police and Auxiliary Fire Service would cost about  4 million overand above the provision made in the existing programme. To be prepared toput all war-time members of all three services into uniform, including part-time members, might cost a further  15 million.10. A further possibility which might be worth considering is the building upof a Government-held stock of black-out material If our colleagues thought aproposal of this kind worth pursuing in principle, the matter might be further discussed in the first instance between the President of the Board of Trade andthe Minister of Works.
imitations of Scheme&apos; &apos;    w. , -c.11, The figures quoted above represent the maximum expenditure possible,assuming that all additional orders could be fulfilled. It would not be possible,for all items, to accelerate production to the extent suggested; in some cases it maynot even be necessary or desirable to do so. The advantage to be derived frombringing forward production will vary considerably according to the area in whichthe goods are to be manufactured. The extent and nature of the orders to be placed under the scheme would need to be settled by the Board of Trade and the supply departments in association with the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence.Conclusions12.   To sum up (1) orders for clothing and textiles for the Armed Forces -to a maximum ofsome  59 million could be placed in the immediate future, provided itis accepted that expenditure planned for 1953-54 and 1954-55 shallbe incurred mainly in 1952-53 and partly in 1953-54, though the impact on the spinning and weaving industries would be reduced to, the extenttp which advance orders for the cloth required had already been placed(paragraphs 2-4); . . . :\- ,-      &quot;.)&apos;,/&apos;;-:(2) further orders requiring expenditure outside the  4,700 million programme,up to a maximum of  56^ million, could be placed--     .(a) to complete the provision of mobilisation and war reserve stocks;(b) to bring the Navy up to peace-time scales and to complete the requirement of No. 1 and 3 dress for the Regular Army;:(c) to increase the scale of war reserves of clothing for the Navy and;R.A.F.; and Id) to provide clothing for the Home Guard (paragraph 5);(3) the restoration of cuts in the provision of clothing and textiles, for theCivil Defence services would result in the placing of further orders tothe value of about  4 million, a great part of which could be brought forward into 1952-53 (paragraph 7); -(4) further orders might perhaps be placed by the Ministry of Health forsheets and blankets, &amp;c, and approved Ministry of Health orders forcanvas at present held up might be released, the total value of these orders amounting to  6^ million (paragraph 8);(5) up to  19 million worth of orders could be placed to provide uniform for -mobilisation stocks for the Civil Defence services,  4 million of whichwould represent provision for the whole-time element (paragraph 9);(6) the possibility of Government stockpiling of black-out cloth might bediscussed between the President of&quot; the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Works (paragraph 10);(7) to the extent that it proved practicable to accelerate all or any of the ordersmentioned in this paper, the additional expenditure falling on the votes of the Service, Home and Health Departments and the Ministry ofSupply-including expenditure in respect of storage and handlingearlier deliveries could not be found from within present estimates and would have to be the subject of specific provision by way OfSupplementary Estimates later in the year.13. These additional orders would all go towards meeting known require-ments. Though they do not amount to a great deal in relation to the total capacityof the clothing and textile industries, they would no doubt be very welcome at this difficult time and might have a valuable psychological effect.14. We invite the Cabinet to decide whether all or any of these orders should now be placed.V;   : D. m. f. :2nd April, 1952.
