(THE DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF-HER BRITANNIC-MAJESTY ^-GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 85 COPY NO.___y 126th MARCH, 1952.CABINETWORLD PEACE MOVEMENT:ADMISSION OF FOREIGNERS TO MEETINGS HELDIN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Home Secretary.At the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion I circulate this memorandum to let my colleagues know what policy I am pursuing in dealing with foreignerswho seek admission to the United Kingdom to attend meetings connected with theSoviet ..   inspired World Peace Movement.2. The World Peace Movement was started in 19-8, and the World PeaceCouncil, the international body that runs the Movement, held Congresses inParis and Stockholm.   In 1950 it decided to hold a World Peace Congress atSheffield, but my predecessor refused to admit nearly all the leading foreigndelegates and at the last moment the meeting was transferred to Warsaw.   InJune, 1951, he also refused to admit five foreigners, including ProfessorJoliot-Curie, the President of the World Peace Council, who were coming toa weekend conference of the British Peace Committee.3.       Last December Mr, S. O. Davies, M.F., asked me whether I wouldadmit foreigners to attend a proposed meeting in January of the Bureau of theWorld Peace Council, and, after consulting the Foreign Secretary, I told mr.. Davies that I would not.4.       Recently I have considered, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary,whether I should admit foreigners coming to the following gatherings:&quot;(i) the International Women&apos;s Day meetings which began on 8th/9th March;(ii) a proposed meeting of the Executive Council of the WorldFederation of Scientific Workers to be held at Cambridgeon 22nd/23rd March;and    (iii) the British Youth &quot;Peace&quot; Festival to be held nearSheffield at Whitsun.So far as I could judge, the foreigners who desired to come to these meetingswould not have been a^danger to security or to industrial peace, nor were there any special grounds peculiar to individual delegates for excluding them.But all three gatherings, though not formally under the auspices of the world peace Council, seemed to have as their primary aim the furtherance of theWorld Peace Movement, and I thought it right to announce that I would refuse admission to foreigners who sought to attend them.   I have taken this line, not because of the fear that anything that foreign delegates to these meetings might do or say would mislead people in this country, but because i am anxious to support the Foreign Secretary in his efforts to expose the-1-
ill; Jbrld Peace Movement as an instrument of Soviet policy and to encourageother countries to recognise it as such and treat it accordingly.   I agreewith the Foreign-Secretary that it would weaken these efforts if we allowedthis country to be used as a base for developing an international campaignconducted under false colours and designed to undermine the North atlantic treaty Organisation.5,       I propose tp&apos; follow the same line in dealing wiih any futureapplications for the admission of foreigners to attend meetings?,- directly or indirectly connected with the World Peace Movement.   I shall continueto admit foreigners, including nationals of Iron Curtain countries andCommunists or fellow travellers from other countries, for the purposeof attending conferences in this country unless there is some special reason(e. g. danger to security or risk of their stirring up industrial unrest) forexcluding them.   Thus, I should continue the practice of admitting Soviet trade unionists who are invited to attend conferences organised by British tradeunions, or Communist students who are invited to attend meetings of theNational Union of Students.   Moreover, I should propose to allow foreignersagainst whom there is no individual objection to attend the congress of theBritish Communist Party which is to be held in April.6.       To sum up, my policy is to refuse admission to foreignersseeking to come here on the business of or for meetings organised by theWorld Peace Council or its subsidiary, the British Peace Cornxnittee, orany other international or national bodies (other than the British CommunistParty) who can be fairly regarded as instruments of Soviet policy; but,subject always to my being satisfied that they are not a danger to security or to industrial peace, I should not exclude foreign Communists or fellowtravellers coming to attend meetings organised by other bodies, and I shouldalso admit foreigners coming to meetings of the British Communist party on the ground that it is a recognised political party and that, since its support of Soviet policy is well known, its activities are not likely to deceiveanyone.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1.26th MARCH, 1952.
