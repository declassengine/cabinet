The Transport Act, 1947.The Transport Act provides (Section 3(4)) that the British transport commission shall levy such charges as to secure that their revenue is notless than sufficient to meet their outgoings.2. The Act was designed to avoid ministerial control over the changes made by the Commission.The only exception to this principle was the power given to theMinister under Section 82 of the Act to make regulations to increase theCommission^ charges for the purpose of providing them with an adequaterevenue pending the full operation of the machinery provided in the Act for fixing charges.3. The procedure for fixing charges is that the Commission arerequired to submit draft Schemes in respect of their principal services and facilities to the Transport Tribunal, which after -balding a Public Inquiryat which representative bodies of those affected can be heard can confirmsuch Schemes with or without modification.   The Tribunals decision in thismatter is final.   Section 80 of the Act enables the Minister to require theTribunal to review the operation of a Scheme.   This power could hardly beused to reject a Scheme just made but could appropriately be employed if and when circumstances have changed.4. The Tribunal is the former Railway Rates Tribunal set up under theRailways Actj 1921, under a new name and with a widened jurisdiction.   It is a Courtof Record with judicial procedure, and in respect of attendance of witnesses,production of documents, enforcement of orders, entry on property and othermatters, has the powers, rights and privileges of the High Court.   Its threepermanent members are required to be an experienced lawyer as President,a person of experience in commercial affairs and a person of experience in transport business,5.    The Act provided for the setting up of Area Transport Users ConsultativeCommittees and of a Central Transport Consultative Committee,   The purposeof these bodies is to consider and make recommendations about any matter(including charges) affecting the services and facilities provided by the commission which is the subject of representations by users or which appears to be amatter to which consideration ought to be given, or which the Minister of Transportor the Commission may refer to them for consideration.   If the Central Committeemake a recommendation to the Minister he has power to give the Commissionspecific directions in regard to it.
6. The Tribunal are bound to allow charges at such a level that theCommission^ overall finances are in balance.   The powers of the ConsultativeCommittees in regard to charges    cannot reasonably be regarded as authorising^&quot;&quot;-em to re-examine matters which the Tribunal has examined and decided,lead the view has been taken in the past by the Minister of Transport thatthese Committees should properly consider only such matters as are lefttto the discretion of the Commission within the ambit of a Scheme,   Ifrecommendations made by the Committee within these limits were such asmaterially to affect the revenue which the Scheme was intended to providethe Minister could not accept them unless he were to enable the Commission tocomply with their statutory obligation to make both ends meet in some other way e,g. by a subsidy.II, Passenger Fares7. In 1950 the Tribunal confirmed an interim London Passenger charges scheme in accordance with the above provisions.   This raised fares tosome extent but was mainly designed to take a first step towards standardisation.There was some public complaint (as there is always likely to be wheneverfares are increased) but it soon died down.In April 1951 the Commission submitted to the Tribunal a DraftPassenger Charges Scheme covering all their passenger services throughoutthe country including London.   After a public Inquiry which lasted from october to December the Tribunal published a preliminary indication of their conclusions in January and confirmed the Scheme with modifications on 27th February.   Theyprovided that it should come into operation in London four days later on the2nd March, and in the rest of the country on the 1st May.   In London the Schemeauthorises new and increased scales of fares based on mileage and leaves theCommission discretion to adjust existing bus stages in conformity with themileage scale and to bring up sub-normal fares to the normal level.   Theincrease where no alteration in the stage is involved and where no sub-normalfare was previously in operation is about 20%.   In order to mitigate hardshipthe Scheme imposed an overall limit of 42% on increases, but this was not to prohibit the Commission from increasing any single fare by 3d, any ordinaryor day return fare by 6d. or any early morning return fare by 4d.The Scheme provided however that these limitations should not applyto an increase in the cost of travel due to the withdrawal of shift workers&apos; ticketsThe Tribunal did not specifically direct the withdrawal of shift workers&apos;tickets.   The Commission had however indicated their intention of doing so,the question was very fully discussed before the Tribunal and the Schemeleaves  the Commission free to carry out their expressed intention.   the exclusion from the limitations on increases of shift workers1 tickets makes itclear that the Tribunal had it in mind that they would and could properly be discontinued, and the principle involved is consequently not one that can properly be referred by the Minister to the Consultative Committee.,\8. There can be no question that London Transport require substantially increased revenue to meet the costs which they like other undertakings.havehad to meet, and there is no reason to suppose that the increases authorised by the Scheme go further than is necessary for this purpose.   The recent increase in petrol tax will raise a further problem.   The complaints so farreceived however are not so much against the general level of increase asagainst particular increases where the effect of adjustments in stages or in sub-normal fares coupled with the overall increase in scale have led to substantial increases, and against the abolition of shift workers&apos; tickets.   Thequestion of the adjustment of bus stages has been referred to the CentralConsultative Committee,
&quot; The question of shift workers1 tickets is for the reasons given above notI considered proper for the Minister to refer to them.   We may be pressed to-,, refer to the Consultative Committee individual adjustments in other sub-normaljfy^res e. g. those between Southend and London where abnormally&quot;low fares have long been in operation, or even the adjustment of sub-normal fares as a whole,but any large scale modification of the adjustments made by the Commissionin this respect would be likely materially to affect their revenue and consequentlyto re-open the Scheme as a whole.9. Outside London possible causes of complaint are:-(a) The increase in season ticket rates consequent upon theintroduction of new stales.(b) The substitution for&apos; workmen&apos;s tickets of early morning ticketsat a higher rate. 1(c) The withdrawal of shift workers&apos; tickets.(d) The bringing up to standard of sub-normal fares.We may be pressed to refer some of these matters to the Central consultative committee.   We cannot do so however unless and until the Commission have actually exercised the discretion given to them by the Scheme.Ill,   ConclusionlO. In general, any increases in charges however fully they may bejustified by unavoidable increases in costs are bound to be unpopular andto attract criticism of those by whom they have been authorised/ It is thepurpose of the Transport Act that such increases should not become apolitical issue in which Ministers are involved, and it therefore preservesthe traditional machinery of the Tribunal.   There is much to be said for this principle and departure from it would require most careful consideration.-UGreat George Street, S.W.1.17th MARCH, 1952.
