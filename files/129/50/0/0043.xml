&quot;(THIS^OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 93 COPY NO.   ^728TH MARCH, 1952CABINETECONOMIC AID TO YUGOSLAVIA IN 1952-53Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAfter the Yugoslav break with the Cominform in 1948, His Majesty!sGovernment decided, in view of the vital political and strategic importance ofthe continued existence of an independent Yugoslavia outside the Soviet orbit,to adopt the policy known as &quot;keeping Tito afloat&quot;, i. e. of preventing Yugoslaviafrom collapsing from economic stress.   Between December, 1949, and april, 1951, we made available to Yugoslavia  23 millions in the form of medium and short-term credits,  while the United States Government contributed on an even larger scale.   Early in 1951, we established a small Economic Mission withadvisory functions at Belgrade under Sir F. Mudie, a former Governor ofthe Punjab.   In view of the continued deterioration in the Yugoslav balance ofpayments, a tripartite Conference was held in London in April, 1951, and agreeda plan, later approved by Governments, under which grants totalling $ 120 millionsare being given to Yugoslavia in the period 1st July, 1951, to 30th June, 1952.The United States are contributing 65%, the United Kingdom 23% (nearly  10millions), and the French 12%.2. The Yugoslav Government were informed that it was essential for themto satisfy the three Governments that they were taking measures calculated to balance their payments in the shortest possible time;  and that grant aid wasnot intended to cover Yugoslav capital imports.   They accepted these conditions.3. The Yugoslav economy has not broken down, and Tito is, if anything,slightly stronger than last year.   The short-term aim of the aid programme has there fore been achieved.   But the results of the plan have been disappointing onthe economic side.   The Yugoslav Government have only made minor modifications in their excessive investment programme, and have adopted an experimental and highly dubious new economic plan.   There is no sign that the yugoslav balance of payments position is improving.4. Our proposals for the Washington Conference.    Our Economic mission in Belgrade therefore proposed last autumn that we should put to the Frenchand United States Governments a plan which would enable Yugoslavia to pay herway at an early date (say, 1954-1955), and should suggest to them that, if we wereto continue to give Yugoslavia tripartite aid, we should insist that the latter should adopt the necessary measures.   As a result of an exchange of minutesbetween the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself in December, 1951, a delegation under Sir F. Mudie went to Washington at the end of February fortripartite talks.   Their instructions were that we were ready to contemplatefurther grant aid up to a limit of approximately  9 millions in 1952-53 but on condition that subsequent aid was on a diminishing scale ending in 1955, andthat the three Powers should insist on the Yugoslav investment programme beingradically curtailed.
r% In view of the United States attitude at the Conference it was clearH&amp;at these conditions could not be fulfilled.   We therefore put forwardtentatively a looser plan of co-operation which would preserve the tripartitefacade;  but indicated that, in view of our serious balance of payments positionand the Americans&apos; inability to accept a plan which would enable Yugoslaviato pay her way soon, we could not agree to contribute more than  2 millions - 3 millions in 1952-53, including both grants and loans.6. United States Counter-Proposal.      The Americans then made a counter-proposal for a total grant of $95 millions, of which they would contribute $75 millions, the United Kingdom $11.2 millions ( 4 millions)and the French $8. 8 millions.   In addition, they would require an assurance that the United Kingdom would contribute  ll- millions -  Zj millions to anInternational Bank loan.    This, together with provision for funding Yugoslavia^debts to the United Kingdom and grants to cover payments for compensation which Yugoslavia pays to British nationalised interests, would amount to totalaid by this country of nrt less than  6 -  6^ millions in 1952-53.7, The courses now open to us are:-(a) To accept the United States proposal.(b) To withdraw from the Conference and break up the tripartite facade.(c) To propose a compromise under which we would contribute  4 millions in all (though I would favour giving Sir F. Mudie discretion to raise this to 4&quot;! millions if absolutely necessary).8, The United States proposal would entail a total cost of  6 -  6-1 millions.,I would not wish to propose to my colleagues that we should go beyond the 4f millions after attempting first to agree on  4 millions.   But it must be clearly recognised that there is a very real risk that these United states proposals are not a bargaining offer and that they will accept nothing less.This is Sir F. Mudie&apos;s view, supported by the Embassy in Washington.9. Consequences of a Breakdown of the Conference.      There are strong arguments in favour of continuing the tripartite scheme of economic aid.Without foreign aid the Yugoslav Government can neither preserve their independence of the Cominform nor build up their military and economic strength to the point of becoming effective allies of the Western Powers.They attach great political importance to British participation in any scheme of aid, as also do the United States and French Governments.   Furthermore, the breakdown of the tripartite programme would be interpreted in Russia, the satellites and elsewhere, as a sign of weakness and basic disagreement in theWest on the Yugoslav issue.   It seems probable that if the tripartite frontbreaks down, the French Government will make no grants or loans whatever.On the other hand, the United States Government are likely to increase thelevel of their grant from f) 75, millions to the 2*95 millions which the three powers were to make available under their proposals, withdrawing the money fromother M. S.A. countries.   The Yugoslav Government, though they would greatlydislike accepting aid from the United States alone, would no doubt be forcedto do so by their economic position.10. There is the further consideration that Yugoslavis is a potential non-dollar source of raw materials, such as maize, timber and non-ferrous metals, forwhich there is an urgent demand in this country.   Our Economic Mission in belgrade is under instructions to seek to obtain the maximum possible advantage to us, in respect of these supplies, in return for our aid.   Proposals made by our representatives for obtaining contracts for such materials as a specificcondition of possible future aid, are at present under study.
Recommendation.      I should like, therefore, to recommend to mycolleagues that we should adopt course  (c) in paragraph 7 and inform theConference that, while we attach importance to the maintenance of tripartiteco-operation, in our present balance of payments position we cannot afford 6 -  61- millions in 1952-53.   We should state that the maximum british contribution for all purposes must be  4 millions, though I should like togive Sir F. Mudie discretion to go to  4^ millions, if absolutely necessary.This will entail a real risk that the Conference will not reach agreement, butI think that must be accepted.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,28TH MARCH, 1952.
