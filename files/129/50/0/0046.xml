(this^wocument is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)secret CABINET OFFICfc,   \  , RECORD COPY /*c. (52) 96 copy no.  ibAk31st MARCH, 1952.cabinet national ASSISTANCE.Memorandum by the Ministerof National Insurance.The Chancellor, in his Budget Speech, said that he had no doubt theNational Assistance Board would take note of his proposals on food subsidies and make appropriate recommendations for increased national assistance scales indue course.   The Board have now submitted provisional proposals to me.   If theyare approved they will be embodied in formal regulations which will require an Affirmative Resolution of each House of Parliament.   Once formal regulaticnshave been put forward by the Board their proposals cannot be altered withoutstating publicly the Government1 s reasons for differing from the Board.   Forthis reason it has been the practice for the Board to put forward provisionalpropospls as they are now doingi2.      As national assistance is the final protection against want, the Board&apos;sscales are necessarily related closely to the cost of living;  but as the generalindex contains a number of items such as rent (which is provided by the Boardseparately) and drink and tobacco (which can hardly enter much into theexpenditure of persons living on assistance) it has for some time been theBoard&apos;s practice to use a modified cost of living index figure based mainly on food, clothing, fuel and light.   The result has been that movements of theBoard&apos;s scales have tended to exceed what would be required by a strict comparisonwith movements in the ordinary cost of living index figure.3.       The scales were last altered in September 1951 when the main rates were fixed at 50s. for a married couple and 30s. for a single householder, towhich a rent allowance (normally the rent paid) would be added.   Using the modified index mentioned above, and taking account of the increases which theChancellor has stated will follow the reduction of food subsidies, the Boardconsider that the rate for a married couple should be increased by 9s. and the ratefor a single person by 5s.   There will be appropriate increases in other rates.If these increases are made, a single householder paying a rent of 12s.  6d. would get 47s.  6d. , a married couple with a rent of 15s. would get 74s.4. The need for Parliamentary approval, and the work involved inaltering some million and a half current allowances, make it necessary to planchanges in assistance rates well in advance of the date when they can bebrought, into operation^   To prevent the new rates being out of date when theystart to operate and to avoid frequent changes in rates, it is essential in fixingrates to anticipate further changes in the cost of living as far as may be.5.       If the proposals are accepted formal regulations will be submitted bythe Board forthwith and it is proposed to lay them before Parliament immediately before the recess and to put forward the necessary Affirmative Resolutionsas soon as possible after the recess.   If the regulations are approved by the
of April the new rates would be brought into operation as from 16th June.6.       Assistance is now being paid in about 1,500,000 cases, representingabout Z\ million persons.   In over two-thirds of the cases national insurance pensions or benefits are being supplemented.   The present cost of assistance is about  77-1 millions and these proposals will raise it to about  90 millions in a full year.   The gross extra cost of the proposals would be about  25 millionsbut half of that amount will be saved in cases where benefits are being supplemented by the increases in national insurance benefits and pensions which I amproposing in another papers7.       I ask my colleagues&apos; authority to inform the Board that their proposals are approved and to submit regulations to Parliament accordingly.o.p.Ministry of National Insurance, S.W.I.31st MARCH, 1952.
