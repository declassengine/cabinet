Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 625th March, 1952CABINETGOVERNMENT OFFICE ACCOMMODATIONMemorandum by the Minister of works the proposals in my memorandum (C. (52) 17) for securing further economies in the use of office space by Government Departments were approved in principle by the Cabinet on 5th February, 1952 (C.C. (52) 10th Conclusions, Minute 7). TheCabinet invited me to send my colleagues lists of premises which I thought their departments might surrender and to report progress in one month.2. I attach a statement showing the proposals I have made to Ministers.If these proposals and those I shall make to other Departments are carried out itshould be possible to derequisition about 500,000 square feet of accommodation and surrender 400,000 square feet of Crown or leased premises which can be usedfor accommodating other staff now in requisitioned space.3. I have dealt in the first instance with London Headquarters buildings wherethe greatest savings should be possible. I propose now to examine the position inScotland and in regional and other large provincial towns.4. It will take time to plan the many movements of staff involved and Ipropose to report progress to the Cabinet again in three months&apos; time.D. E.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,5th March, 1952.41958
