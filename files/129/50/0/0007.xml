C.(52) 571ST MARCH, 1952CABINETPUBLIC PRESENTATION OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF THEUTILITY SCHEMES FOR TEXTILES AND APPARELMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 30th January the Economic Policy Committee(E.A.(52) 3rd Meeting, Minute 1) approved in principle my proposal towithdraw the Utility Schemes for textiles^ clothing, bedding and footwear(but not for furniture) when the changes in Purchase Tax arrangementsrecommended by the Douglas Committee come into effect ( ^,(52) 17),In view of the wide public interest in this matter, I mentioned it in Cabineton 20th February and undertook to circulate a paper on the subject to theCabinet (C,C.(52) 20th Conclusions, Minute 4)e2. The most convenient mexnod of setting out my proposals is to circulate a draft of the statement which I propose to make, and thisforms Annex I to this paper.    This may need to be altered in detail asthe result of further discussions with trade interests which are pro-ceeding, but the alterations should not be substantial.    In order to avoiduncertainty for traders, it is clearly necessary that a statement shouldbe made as soon as possible after the Budget.     There will no doubt be a desire for an early debate;   it is possible that the subject could be dis-cussed in the course of the Budget debate.     If not, we shall, I think,have to envisage a debate as soon as possible thereafter.     The Ordersgiving effect to my decision will of course be subject to the negative resolution procedure.3. Before formulating my proposals, I have had discussions withrepresentatives of the industries mostly concerned and with other bodies.    A list of the organisations consulted is given in Annex II.4. In paragraph^ of the draft statement I refer   to the amendment,of the Merchandise Marks Act.      The necessary legislation, which Icontemplate will be introduced in the next session, has not yet beenapproved by the Home Affairs Committee,    But my proposals are in an advanced state of preparation and I do not think they will prove contro-ver-sial.   It will.greatly help in the presentation of the arrangements to succeed the Utility Schemes if I can mention this evidence of theGovernments intention to strengthen the existing law for protecting theconsumer, and I hope that my colleagues will accept my proposed reference to it.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,1ST MARCH, 1952.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy .Nio.,..-.
ANNEX draft STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT ON THEFUTURE OF THE UTILITY SCHEMESWith your permission, Mr, Speaker, I should like to make astatement about the future of the Utility Schemes for textiles and clothing, footwear, bedding and furniture,,    I am anxious that the house and all those traders who will be affected should be informed at theearliest possible moment of the Government&apos;s intentions with regard tothis matter.    It will be apparent from the observations of the DouglasCommittee that these schemes cannot be continued unchanged, particularlyin view of the decisions about Purchase Tax which my right hon. Friendannounced ^yesterday/.    I fully recognise the need for a proper and fulldebate on this subject.    The object of this statement is, however, to assistmanufacturers and traders by enabling them and the House to know assoon as possible after the Chancellors speech ^/yesterday/ what measures the Government are taking.2. The Utility Schemes were introduced some 11 years ago in timeof war to enable resources to be concentrated on the most economicalproduction of essentials, and to permit prices to be controlled as effectively as possible.    They played an extremely valuable part in our economy at that time and in the years that followed, and the Utility Markhas won much popularity among consumers.    While the Report of theDouglas Committee makes it apparent that this confidence was in manycases hardly justified by any real safeguards of quality provided by themajority of the present Utility Specifications, I am anxious that such safe-guards as do exist should where possible be preserved93. These Utility Specifications were for some goods - for instance,wool cloth and suits - from the first extremely loose and did not in them-selves provide any guarantee of quality.    For other goods they have by successive modifications been whittled away until in the majority of cases they provide little or no criterion of quality;  instances are the so-called
flexible specifications for cotton and rayon cloths which were introduced for very good reasons about a year ago on the recommendation of committees presided over by the then Parliamentary Secretary to theBoard of Trade,,    Now, however, in the words of the Douglas Report&quot;with the principal exception of furniture, where the Utility Scheme setsa minimum standard of construction, the only essential advantage of theUtility Schemes to consumers is exemption from Purchase Tax&quot;.Exemption will in future be accomplished by other means, as theChancellor of the Exchequer has explained,4. In these circumstances, I have decided that the right course isto v/ind up forthwith the Utility Schemes as they now exist, except forfurniture.    In this special case I propose to maintain the present UtilityScheme in being pending the further discussion with the industry andothers concerned, which will be necessary in the light of the DouglasCommittee^ view that if the changes they recommended in Purchase Taxarrangements were applied to furniture at least the present qualitystandards should be safeguarded.    In the case o  all other goods -textiles, clothing, gloves, bedding and footwear - I have today signedthree Orders, two of which bring the Utility Schemes to an end onMonday, 10th March, and the third of which will prevent the unauthoriseduse or abuse of the Utility Mark after that date.    It follows that theprices of goods other than furniture covered by the Utility Schemes will no longer be controlled.    As the Douglas Report points out, the controlhas become ineffective as the schemes have been modified.    In any casethese goods are not now scarce - indeed supplies are outrunningdemand - and ample supplies are available well below the statutorymaximum prices.    There is, therefore, in present conditions no need to retain price controls, but I shall continue to watch closely the prices at which goods of all these types are sold.
s A5. The real and ultimate safeguard of quality is, and must always be,the skill and thoroughness of British manufacturers and British workers,and    their knowledge that the reputation of British goods for soundquality and workmanship is too valuable an asset to be risked0     Never-theless, I recognise that there were, and still are, some elements in theUtility Schemes that are useful and ought to be developed.    I have had discussions in recent weeks with representatives of the trades most con-cerned about how this can be done.    It seemed to me - and I am glad tosay that the organisations I consulted generally agreed with me - that thebest method was to develop the use of standards under the authority ofthe British Standards Institution (B.S.I.), combined wherever possible with the registration of certification marks which would enable theconsumer to know which goods complied with the standards laid down.The B.S.I., with their independent position, their great experience of standards of all kinds in many different industries, and their thoroughlyrepresentative constitution, which gives a place not only to the technical and commercial experts but also to the ordinary consumer - theInstitution has an excellent Women1 s Advisory Committee - arepeculiarly well fitted for this task, and they have readily agreed toco-operate in working out schemes on these lines.6. I have received assurances from a number of trade bodiesthat they will at once proceed to devise with the B.S.I. a series ofBritish Standard specifications based on those Utility specificationswhich provide some guarantee of quality or performance for the con-sumer.    In particular, the cotton trade have told me that they proposewithin a few weeks to deal in this way with the most popular specificationsfor a wide range of cotton cloths and household textiles, covering about75 per cent of the trade in goods of these types.    For other cloths theyare arranging in conjunction with the B.S.I. to work out a system of.S.I. certification marks for cloths which comply with standards
approved by the Institution for such properties as colour fastness andshrink resistance.     Utility specifications for some kinds of lightclothing and children^ wear have already their corresponding british standards, and others, e. g. for mackintoshes, will be issued shortly.7. The British Rayon Federation have informed me that they willas a matter of urgency in collaboration with the B.S.I. devise british standards for certain standard tests for qualities such as shrinkage andcolour fastness, and will arrange for the marking of cloths which complywith these tests.    Wool cloth and garments present greater problems,as is evident from the lack of specifications in the Utility Schemes forthese goods, but the Wool Textile Delegation intend to proceed with thestandardisation of tests for rainproofing of gaberdines and with a systemof labelling to show the wool content of wool cloths.     They will also with the B.S.I. investigate the possibility of laying down other standardperformance tests for wool cloths.   All the organisations which I have consulted have agreed either to arrange forthwith or to consider urgently the registration and implementation of certification markschemes under the Trade Marks Act, to be applied to goods which complywith the standards laid down.    I propose to introduce next sessionlegislation to amend the Merchandise Marks Act so as to strengthen and make more effective the protection which these arrangements will give.In the longer term, many trade bodies have assured me that they willtackle the problem of improving and extending the standards which willbe issued without delay through the B.S.I., by working out performancecriteria and in other ways.    I am confident that with energetic action bythe trade bodies and by the B.S.I. there can be devised arrangements forquality marking which will enable the consumer to know much more aboutthe goods he or she buys.
8. There are considerable stocks of Utility goods in various stages of distribution, and these will of course continue to be availablefor some months while the arrangements I have outlined are being putinto effects9. Broadly, the effect of my proposal is to place on industryrather than on the Government the main responsibility for meetingthe desire of consumers for assurance about the quality of goods theyare offered.    It will remain the Governments task to stimulate and facilitate this work, but it can be more satisfactorily carried out bythe voluntary organisations of industry, and in particular the B.S.I.which exists for this purpose, than by a mass of statutory instruments.I shall welcome suggestions and assistance from all concerned, whichwill help us to make progress on these lines.    I entirely share the conviction of the Douglas Committee when they say that &quot;arrangements of this kind could give the consumer far more satisfactory assurances about quality than the present Utility Schemes provide&quot;.
