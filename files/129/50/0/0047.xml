(52) 97 U3rd April, 1952CABINETNEGLECT AND ILL-TREATMENT OF CHILDRENNote by the Prime minister asked the Home Secretary for a report on the neglect and ill-treatment ofchildren and whether this had increased since the War. My colleagues may be interested to see his reply.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, SW. 1,3rd April, 1952.
Prime Minister from Home Secretary : Minute of 25th March, 1952You asked me for a report on whether neglect and ill-treatment of childrenhad increased since the war and was always increasing.Convictions under the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, for neglect orill-treatment in 1938 and in each year since 1944 were:  1938       ..........	.........        944	(12)1944       ......	.........      .1,750	1945       .........	...      ...      1,670	1946       .........	...      ...      ...      1,068	(10)1947       ...      ...      ...	.......      ...      1,045	(28)1948       ...      ...      ...	...      .:.      1,040	(36)1949       .........	.&apos;........        907	(19)1950       .........	..........        974	(25)1951       ...      ......	...      ...      ...   . 1,076	(30)Note. Figures in parenthesis show cases dealt with in higher courts (1944and 1945 figures are not available).The increase in 1951 may be due partly to greater vigilance.In each of the four years to the end of February 1948-51, the National Societyfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Children investigated about 40,000 cases,classified 4,000 as involving ill-treatment (as distinct from neglect), and institutedsome 650 prosecutions.Shortly after I took office I satisfied myself that the maximum penalties were adequate. I arranged, however, that in all cases of deliberately or cruelly causinginjury the N.S.P.C.C. or the police, as the case might be, should consider takingproceedings under the Offences against the Person Act, 1861, which provides very heavy penalties, and that in cases taken under the Act of 1933 the prosecutionshould invite the magistrates&apos; court, in the more serious cases, to considercommitting to a higher court (which can sentence to imprisonment for two years)for trial. The Duke of Portland, as president of the N.S.P.C.C., wrote to The Timesapproving of my suggestions. The Lord Chief Justice said, when addressingmagistrates last January, that the law needed no alteration, and that cases ofbrutality should be dealt with under the Act of 1861.In 1950 a circular was sent jointly by the Home Office and the Ministries ofHealth and Education to local authorities urging them to see that all their servicesworked together to arrest the neglect of children in their own homes.The prominence given by the press to particular cases of ill-treatment ofchildren, and to the problem in general, tends to exaggerate the extent of the evil,but at the same time stirs the public conscience, which is a good thing.42055
