BRITISH BROADCASTING corporation memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilOn behalf of the Committee on the British Broadcasting Corporation,I submit for the decision of the Cabinet the following major issues of policytogether with the Committee&apos;s tentative conclusions upon them.The fundamental difference at present is between those, for whomLord Halifax and Lord Brand have spoken, who are satisfied with presentbroadcasting and television arrangements and those who object to the B, B. C.monopoly both on principle and because of the power which it confers on a few people to decide who and what the listeners and viewers shall hear and see, exceptin so far as stations on the Continent or in the Irish Republic may breach thismonopoly.   There is a further fear that the present system lends itself unduly towrongful interference by an unscrupulous government.It is generally accepted that on practical grounds the B.B. C, must bemaintained with all its present facilities and be the recognised national broad-casting system deriving its income both for sound and television from revenuesdetermined by Parliament and collected by the Postmaster-General.The Committee propose, however, that two changes should be made inthe present arrangements:-(1) A licence for television transmission should be given to at least oneprivate enterprise organisation.   (This will leave the position that the licensing authority may license private firms to operate Very High Frequency local stations but it must license a television station apart from the B.B.C.)Stations other than the B. B. C. should be prohibited from permitting directparty political broadcasts, although it would be illusory to suppose that political propaganda by indirect means could be entirely.prevented.(2)  The appointment of Governors of the B.B.C. should in future be removed from the political arena and entrusted to an, appointing committee consisting ofthe Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Archbishop of Canterbury,the Lord Chief Justice, and the President of the Court of Session.   It is also suggested that the Postmaster-General&apos;s powers of licensing should be exercisable only in accordance with the decisions of this body.I invite the Cabinet to apprqve these two proposals, which quite franklyhave been arrived at on the basis of political compromise within our own party.I am satisfied that by maintaining the B. B. C. in its present form and by admittingsome competition in television, we shall do no harm to the country and we shallsecure unity in our own party.   I do not think, however, that it will satisfy theOpposition.If the Cabinet approves of these two general principles I will withoutdelay submit to my colleagues in draft a White Paper embodying our detailed views which will not, I think, arouse any divergence of opinions.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1., W*1ST APRIL, 1952.CABINET office record copy copy NO.   Q VCABINETSECRETC.(52) 991ST APRIL, 1952
