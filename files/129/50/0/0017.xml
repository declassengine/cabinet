Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 671th March, 1952CABINETDEFERMENT OF CALL-UP OF EX-APPRENTICESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and power. The Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,to draw up and submit to them a limited scheme for deferring the call-up of ex-apprentices confined to a number of designated projects of the highest impor-tance and to a few selected occupations of the highest skill (C.C. (52) 10th Conclu-sions). After consultation with the Minister of Labour, the Service Ministers, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofSupply, I submit the scheme set out in the following paragraphs.Scope2. The &quot; designated projects of the highest importance &quot; and &quot; selected occupa-tions of the highest skill,&quot; to which it is suggested the scheme should be confined, are shown in the Appendix.The entries relating to particular projects are naturally intended to cover every-thing required for those projects-for example, the Canberra Bomber covers elec-tronic equipment required for this aircraft as well as the aircraft itself. On the otherhand, the scheme should apply only to main contractors and main sub-contractors(such as those responsible, for example, for propellers or under-carriages) and notto sub-contractors making small components. I have included the reconstruction of H.M.S. Victorious in the list provisionally, although it cannot in any case be com-pleted for about four years because (i) the Admiralty attach at least as much importance to this as to any of the other aircraft carriers in their programme, (ii)until work on this very big job has reached a more advanced stage, it is difficult tomake much progress with any other job of any size in Portsmouth Dockyard. Thenumber of men in question is only 100 a year at most and I understand that theAdmiralty are prepared in present circumstances to resist all requests from privateshipyards for deferment of their shipwrights.. The occupations are those requiring the highest skill in the particular projects.Period of Deferment3. Deferment, where granted, should be for a period of two years subject to review (for example, every six months) to ensure that the conditions were stillsatisfied.Conditions4. The conditions should be the same as those suggested in the Minister ofLabour&apos;s paper C. (51) 15, namely:  (1) no man should be compelled to accept deferment;(2) the Services should be allowed to take any of these ex-apprentices they require as tradesmen and whose skill they can fully use;(3) each individual case should be investigated by a Technical Officer of theMinistry of Labour in order to ensure that the ex-apprentice was, infact, employed on a designated project, and that his skill was being fullyused.4196368
A d ministration5. The scheme would be administered mainly by the Headquarters of theMinistry of Labour. The Admiralty and Ministry of Supply would provide theMinistry of Labour with a list of the firms to which the scheme applied, togetherwith identification particulars of the contracts and main sub-contracts which theyhad been given. These Departments would also notify the firms in question ofthe scheme-and its limits and the firms would let the Ministry of Labour knowat the appropriate time which ex-apprentices they wished deferred.Changes in the scheme. If changes become necessary, I recommend that the Ministry of labour should approve minor changes in agreement with the Admiralty or Ministry ofSupply, but any major change or alteration to the list of designated projects shouldbe submitted to Ministers.Advantages of the Scheme suggested7. The great advantage of this limited scheme is that, as it is restricted tospecified occupations and specific projects within the defence field, it is reasonable to hope that it can be prevented from spreading into a general scheme of deferment.Moreover, setting the definite term of two years to the period of deferment make sit plain to the general public from the start that these young men were not beinglet off national service altogether, but would, subject to medical fitness, be called upin two years&apos; time. The period can be explained and justified as the period over which the rearmament programme would involve the greatest pressure of work onhighly skilled men of these types.Exports8. At the Cabinefs suggestion I examined the possibility of making some con-cession to export industries as well as arms production. But, with the agreementof the President of the Board of Trade and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofSupply, I concluded that this would not be possible for the following reasons. Itwould hardly be possible to select a small list of defined export projects that clearlystand out as transcending all others in importance. Moreover, the grant of defer-ment of call-up, in order to accelerate the provision of Service equipment, represents a re-allocation of manpower between the Armed Forces and the equipment side ofthe defence programme in the interests of the programme as a whole. To grantdeferment to men due for call-up employed on export work would be an entirely different matter, and if this door were once opened it would, I think, be impossibleto prevent it from being pushed wider open.conclusion. I invite the Cabinet to approve the scheme outlined above, and to authorisethe Ministers concerned to put it into operation as quickly as possible.L.Great George Street, SWA,1th March, 1952.
