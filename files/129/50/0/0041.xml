(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)ONFIDENTIALC. (52) 91 COPY NO.   ^ ST28TH MARCH, 1952CABINETINTERNAL SECURITY IN ERITREAADDITIONAL MEASURES AGAINST SHIFTAMemorandum- by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in Eritrea there are brigands known as shifta.   They terrify the law-abiding natives.   Their crimes range from simple armed robbery to murderand the nastier forms of mutilation.   They work in bands.   The country suitsthem well.2. By the spring of 1951 shifta activities had virtually paralysed theAdministration.   The United Nations Commissioner, charged to execute theGeneral Assembly&apos;s decision to federate Eritrea with Ethiopia, appealed to us as the administering power.3. Security forces were increased to an annual cost of some  300,000and the late Government approved a plan for restoring order consisting of an amnesty and stern measures to suppress any further activities.   The latter were embodied in Proclamation 104.   They included power for the ChiefAdministrator to confirm death sentences, a power previously reserved to theSecretary of State.   It was recognised that the amnesty and Proclamation 104were complementary and that the plan was one which could not be repeated inthe foreseeable future.   The United Nations Commissioner was an advocate of theplan.4. Shifta crimes rapidly decreased and by November, 1951, werenegligible both in nature and number.   The United Nations Commissionerexpressed his gratification.   The Chief Administrator, however, warned me thatthe danger was suppressed, but not removed.   His view was that the slightestsign of weakness on his part or of inability to deal promptly with new shiftaactivities would create a situation which might in a few weeks put the countryback to where it was before the   &apos;Amnesty - Proclamation 104&apos; scheme was launched.   He felt himself chiefly hampered in his ability to hold the situationwithin the capacity of his already very costly forces:-(a) by lack of powers to force persons with unlawful tendencies to livewithin village areas and so be subject to the authority of village headmen -the traditional form of loca,l government;(b) by lack of powers to punish persons who withheld information from thesecurity forces.5. Accordingly he sought power :-(a) to destroy temporary shelters (known as dembies) wherever he is satisfiedthat they have been or are being used for unlawful purposes; the intention is that this action shall only be taken outside village areas.
(b)  to make it an offence to withhold information and to extend the existing and traditional system of collective fines to such offences.6. There has been a gradual increase in shifta outrages:  three times as many (21) in the first 19 days of March as there were at the lowest pointreached in the month of November, 1951. But, more significant, the size ofbands has increased from two or three to at least one band of 16 shifta.7. We are bound by a resolution of the General Assembly to co-operate in the federation scheme and to complete it by 15th September, 1952.   If we are successful Eritrea will cease to cost us money.   Our administration and our troops will be withdrawn.   The United Nations Commissioner is beginning to doubt whether the scheme is a practicable one.   He may even wish to go backto the United Nations for further instructions.   If shifta activities again assumesignificant proportions, he may seize it as an excuse for doing so,   In any event a quiet and orderly country is an essential of any plan which will allow usto shed our responsibilities.8. The powers now sought may seem objectionable to those who do not know the Eritrean shifta and the circumstances in which they operate;  but thepowers granted by my predecessor did not excite criticism.9. A more likely cause of criticism is a failure to maintain law andorder, which is our primary duty as administering power, and particularly if such failure results in complaints from the United Nations Commissioner.Moreover it seems unreasonable to limit the efficacy of such costly forces bydepriving them of a weapon which their commander deems necessary andwhich, if granted, reduces the risk of having, at still greater cost, to increasethem.10. I recommend that the Chief Administrator be given the additional powers summarised in paragraph 5.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,28TH MARCH, 1952.-2-
