On the 17th July, 1917, King George V issued a proclamationdeclaring that His House and Family should thenceforth be styled and knownas the House and Family of Windsor, and relinquishing the use of all Germantitles and dignities.    Attention is drawn to the wording of that proclamation(see Annex II),    Those who were to bear the name of Windsor were expressed to be &quot;all the descendants in the male line of Queen Victoria who are subjects of these Realms, other than female descendants who may marry or who mayhave married&quot;.20 The Queen is a descendant of Queen Victoria in the male line, but she is a female descendant who has married, and Her children and otherdescendants are not descended from Queen Victoria in the male linee    it follows that, as far as that proclamation goes, neither The Queen norPrince Charles nor Princess Anne bore the name  of Windsor before Heraccession.3. I think that Princess Elizabeth did not cease to be of the House and family of Windsor when She married.    In my draft The Queen declares thatHer House and Family shall continue to be styled and known as the house and Family of Windsor.
4. It is arguable at least that after The Queen&apos;s accession the nameto be borne by Her children and other descendants would not be Windsor.This could not have been the intention of King George V in 1917, but the draftsman of the proclamation did not provide expressly for the event ofthe Sovereign being a Queen.5. The substance of my draft is therefore that The Queen is carryingout the intention of Her Father and Grandfather, and that the reason whyShe had to take action is that She is a Queen and not a King, and that, asfar as bearing the name of Windsor is concerned, the proclamation of1917 does not fit the case of Her descendants.    My draft accordinglyrecites that The Queen has determined that Her descendants shall bear the name of Windsor, without specifying how soon after Her accessionShe took this course.6. The draft does not say expressly that The Queen herself is tobear the name of Windsor,    It is not clear that a Queen need have anysurname herself.    It seems enough that She should be of the House and family of Windsor and that Her descendants should bear the name of Windsor.7. The third recital omits the words &quot;in the male line11 which appear in the proclamation of 1917.    The reason is that Princess Anneis not descended from The Queen in the male line.    Yet it seems right that until she marries she should bear the name of Windsor, in so faras she needs any surname at all;  and so with any other daughters who may be born hereafter.    The omission of the words &quot;in the male line&quot;makes it necessary to insert the words &quot;and their descendants&quot; afterthe words &quot;other than female descendants who may marry&quot;e    Otherwise,the children of (say) Princess Anne would have been given the name of Windsor instead of their father&apos;s family name.
