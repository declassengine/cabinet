(T-HIS^^GUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA-JESTY&apos;S-GOVERNMENT)secret.(52) 81. COPY NO.     y j21st MARCH, 1952.CABINETBAMANGWATO AFFAIRS - SERETSE KHAMAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations.In accordance with the Cabinet decision (C.C.(52) 31st Conclusions,Minute 4), I have reconsidered the wording of the alternative draft statements which accompanied my paper C. (52) 76.   I annex revised drafts - A and B.2,     The second statement B would be issued without alteration, ifrefusal by Seretse to abdicate makes its use necessary.3.     But statement A may have to be varied to accord with the preciseoutcome of discussions with him and with any suggestions which he mayadvance about its language.   If Seretse should by any chance make voluntaryabdication conditional on the insertion in this statement of some mention of the vital importance to the tribe, or to the Bechuanaland Africans generally,of not alienating South African opinion, or the delicacy of relations betweenthe Territories and their neighbours, I would ensure that any reference tothese considerations is put in Seretse&apos;s mouth and not attributed to her majesty&apos;s Government.4.     The Governor of Jamaica has now telegraphed reporting thathis Executive Council has agreed to the offer of a post in the Jamaican service to Seretse and that I can tell Seretse that the Governor and his ExecutiveCouncil would welcome his appointment to that Colony.5,     I am accordingly arranging to see Seretse and his wife onMonday, 24th March.I.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.21st MARCH, 1952.
Revised Statement for issue if Seretse agrees to abdicate,(subject to adaptation to accord with precise outcome of discussions with Seretse).Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given earnest and prolongedconsideration to the succession to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribein the Bechuanaland Protectorate and the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations has discussed at length with Seretse Khama the latter&apos;s future.2.     Seretse Khama has now decided to renounce his claim to the chieftainship of the tribe.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that thisdecision, which is evidence of Seretse Khama&apos;s self abnegation and regard for his people&apos;s interests, will make for the ultimate happiness and well-being of the Bamangwato and of the other tribes of the Bechuanaland Protectorate.3.        Her Majesty&apos;s Government have assured Seretse Khama that theywill at the earliest possible date end the temporary expedient of directrule by European officers and restore the tribal system of administration.Seretse Khama&apos;s own renunciation of claim to the chieftainship, coupled withTshekedi Khama&apos;s similar renunciation, opens the way for the designationof some other suitable candidate for this office.4.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government, being concerned for the future of seretse Khama and his wife, are glad to be able to announce that theJamaica Government have offered him a Government post and that he has accepted it.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government hope that this will affordSeretse Khama full scope to perform useful service.
APPENDIX BRevised statement for issue if Seretse should refuse to abdicate.1.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful and prolongedconsideration to the succession to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribein the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Seretse Khama&apos;s claim to be recognised as chief.2.     The White Paper issued by the previous Administration inMarch, 1950 (Cmd. 7913), which withheld recognition from Seretse Khamaas chief, promised review of the position in five years.   It also providedthat both Seretse and his uncle Tshekedi Khama should remain outside the bamangwato Reserve, tl at the functions of the Native Authority should be vested in the District Commissioner, and that a system of councils shouldbe established which would progressively assume responsibility for theadministration of the tribe.   Tshekedi Khama has voluntarily renounced allclaim to the chieftainship both for himself and his children.3.     The principal reasons cited in the White Paper in support of theprevious Administration^ decisions were as follows.   In accordance withthe custom of his tribe Seretse, as chief-designate, should have consultedhis people when he comtemplated choice of a consort.   His failure to doso betokened irresponsibility in a potential ruler and by his precipitatemarriage he was unmindful of the interests of his tribe and of his public duty.The tendency in the Bamangwato tribe to disputes about the succe ssionwould be aggravated by uncertainty as to their future attitude towards thechildren of the marriage.   For these reasons Seretse Khama&apos;s recognitionwould not make for the unity and well-being of the tribe.4.     The White Paper also recorded that both in the High commission territories and in other parts of Southern Africa, there was among prominentAfricans a considerable weight of opinion opposed to recognition of Seretseas chief.5.     In the White Paper Her Majesty&apos;s Governments predecessorsstated that they were aware that a strong body of European opinion in southern Africa would be opposed to recognition, though they made it clearthat in their opinion there were quite separate good and sufficient grounds for their decision.6.     It is true that a considerable proportion of the tribespeople have on occasion demonstrated their readiness to acclaim Seretse as chief.   But, as pointed out in the White Paper of 1950, &quot;H.M.G. have a wide responsibilityfor the well-being and good government of the Protectorate as a whole andof the other High Commission Territories.   In particular they have in thisrespect a duty in matters of disputed successions that they must discharge.The opinion of the Tribal assembly can only be one of the factors contributing to their decision&quot;.7.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government agree with the reasons adduced bytheir predecessors in withholding recognition from Seretse.   But the promise to review this decision in five years and the indeterminate and unreual characterof the temporary arrangements contemplated, which conflicted gravely withcustomary tribal procedure, have not proved satisfactory or conducive to thewell-being and happiness of the tribe.   The hopes expressed in the White paper of 1950 have not been fulfilled, namely that the arrangements set out in itwould lead to the disappearance of the tendencies to disruption which
threatened the unity and well-being of the tribe *   It is now clear that affectionfor traditional institutions is so strdng that settled conditions and satisfactoryadministration will not be restored to the Bamangwato until they again havea recognised chief.   It has become essential therefore to bring to an end the uncertainty arising from the limited duration of the decision announced in the White Paper, and to terminate as soon as possible the temporary expedient of direct rule by European officers.   Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave accordingly been obliged to review the position without further delay.8.     By his disregard for tribal usage and his neglect of the wider considerations on which depend the ultimate well-being and happiness of his people Seretse Khama made it impracticable for Her Maj-.esty&apos;s Governmentspredecessors to accord him recognition as chief.   But the interests of the bamangwato demand that there should be a chief and Her Majesty&apos;s Government,having reviewed the situation, have decided that their predecessors1 refusal to recognise Seretse must be confirmed and made permanent and final,and that the tribe should be invited to put forward in due course a candidateother than Seretse or Tshekedi.   They have also decided that good governmentand the well-being of the Reserve require that Seretse Khama should absenthimself from the Protectorate until an alternative chief has been securelyestablished with his own native administration .9.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government are naturally concerned for the futureof Seretse Khama and his wife.   They are glad therefore to be able to announce that the Jamaica Government have offered him a Government postin that Colony, which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have strongly urgedhim to accept as affording opportunity of useful service in an alternai ivesphere.
