We do not yet know whether the Egyptians v/ill acceptthe underlined passage.&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the RoyalEgyptian Government have decided to enter into negotiations in orderto.settle the differences between the two countries on the basis ofthe withdrawal of British forces and the substitution of alternative arrangements for the defence of Egypt to those at present subsisting.The two Governments would enter into conversations for the purposeof working out the ways and means of giving effect to the foregoingparagraph.The two Governments agree to discuss the question of the Sudan onthe following basis :-Both Governments agree that the Sudanese shall have the rightfreely to decide their future status.   The Egyptian Government havingdeclared that His Majesty King Farouk holds the title of King ofEgypt and the Sudan, Her Majesty&apos;s Government reaffirm thatthey would not oppose the unity of Egypt and the Sudan under theEgyptian crown if such were the freely expressed desire of the sudanese people. &quot;2.       In addition to the foregoing, it is suggested that we should record, either in a letter or by a recorded statement in the minutes of the first meeting, our understanding that as regards defence, we are resuming negotiations on thebasis that the Egyptian Government are in fact prepared to accept the militaryconsequences involved in their determined intention to defend the Canal Zone, andthus to play their part in the defence of the Middle East.3.       The Egyptians may also wish to place on record in the same fashion somegloss upon the third paragraph of the formula (see above) to the effect that their willingness to accept the right of the Sudanese to choose their own status is withoutprejudice to the right of the King of Egypt to the title of King of the Sudan during the interim period.   It might be possible for us to agree to something on these lines asa statement of the Egyptian point of view, if the Egyptian Government insisted.Foreign Office, S.W.I. A.E.31st MARCH, 1952.
