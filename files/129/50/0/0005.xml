secret. (52) 5528r/z February, 1952THE ROYAL STYLE AND TITLESMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the Prime Minister invited me to consider (in consultation with the Lord privy seal, the Home Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland) whether any change should now be proposed in the form of the RoyalStyle and Titles. We have considered this question, and I now submit our conclu-sions and recommendations for consideration by the Cabinet.2.   The present Style and Title of the new Sovereign is &quot; Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland,and the British Dominions beyond the Seas Queen, Defender of the Faith.&quot;This form is statutory. It cannot be varied save by a Royal Proclamation authorised by specific Act of Parliament. And the second paragraph of the preamble to theStatute of Westminster, 1931, points to legislation, not only by the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom, but also by the Parliaments of all the other independent membersof the Commonwealth except India.3.   The present form of Title is unsatisfactory in various respects.  Thus -(i) The reference to &quot; Ireland &quot; has been inappropriate since .1949, when Eirerenounced both her recognition of the Crown and her membership ofthe Commonwealth.(ii) Now that all the self-governing members of the Commonwealth (saveIndia) separately owe allegiance to the Crown it is arguable that theUnited Kingdom should not be the only Commonwealth countrymentioned by name in the Title. This is strongly felt in some of theother Commonwealth countries.(iii) Canada in particular objects to the phrase &quot; British Dominions beyondthe Seas.&quot; She is proud to be part of &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s dominions &quot;: but she objects to a phrase which might seem to imply that the Canadianpeople are subordinated to the people of the United Kingdom. Thisimplication is even more clear in the Latin version, of this part of the title &quot; terrarum qua? in ditione sunt Britannica.&quot;(iv) The Title takes no account of the constitutional fact that in 1949 India,although she became a sovereign independent republic and renouncedher allegiance to the Crown, remained a full member of the Common-wealth and recognised the King as the symbol of the free association ofits peoples. Now that the Crown is accepted as the link between all themembers of a Commonwealth which includes a republic, it would be appropriate that the Royal Title should&apos;include some reference to theposition of the Sovereign as Head of the Commonwealth.4. In ordinary times we could perhaps have been excused from taking any initiative to remedy these defects: the inaccuracy in respect of Ireland has goneon uncorrected since 1949 without occasioning much comment or criticism. But,with the accession of a new Sovereign and the approach of Her Coronation, these points are bound to attract public attention indeed, public discussion of some ofthem has already begun and the Government have been asked, by Question in theHouse of Commons, whether they intend to propose any chang&quot;e. Moreover, inview of the language used in the Accession Proclamation, other Commonwealth41922Copy No. 6 8CABINETPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1952
Governments. will doubtless ask whether any change in the Royal Title is now contemplated. Australia has already asked this question. South Africa is showinginterest in it. And Canada will certainly wish that a change should now be made.In these circumstances we have come to the conclusion that consultations must now be held with other Commonwealth Governments, with a view to reaching agreement on such changes in the Title as will bring it into accord with the present state of the constitutional relations between the constituent parts of theCommonwealth.5. Some of the defects summarised in paragraph 3 above could be remedied byminor amendments of wording within the framework of the existing Title. But itis clear from esqfry consultations that/f any change is to be made, many of the other commonwealth Governments will not be content with any new form which fails to meet their wish that their own country should be mentioned by name in the Title.If we are to preserve a common Title which can be used in all parts of the Common-wealth, this wish could only be met by enumerating in the Title all the countrieswhich owe allegiance to the Crown. This course is open to three main objections.First, such a Title would be unduly cumbrous. Secondly, it would involve a statutory change of the Title, by simultaneous legislation in every Commonwealthcapital, on every subsequent change in the composition of the Commonwealth,e.g., when any of its dependent parts acquired independence within the Common-wealth. Thirdly, it would emphasise the fact that India, alone of the independent members of the Commonwealth, does not owe allegiance to the Crown.The only other form of universal Title which would overcome the constitutional difficulties would be one in which no part of the Commonwealth was mentioned by name. This would involve recourse to a very general form of words, such as&quot; Queen of this Realm and all Her other Realms and Territories &quot; which, thoughappropriate for an Accession Proclamation made in various Commonwealthcapitals, would hardly serve as a formal Title for international purposes. Moreover,though it would meet the objection that the United Kingdom should not be theonly Commonwealth country to be mentioned in the Title, it would not satisfy thoseCommonwealth Governments which desire that their own country should be somentioned.6. We believe that this desire will be strongly pressed. Canada, we know,attaches very great importance to it; and her lead is likely to be followed by others.We have, therefore, felt obliged to consider an alternative solution by which eachCommonwealth country would use for its own purposes -a Title in which it wasitself mentioned by name but the other parts of the Commonwealth were described in a generic phrase. Under this system the Title used in the United Kingdom and colonies would describe the Sovereign as Queen &quot; of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland and of all other Her Realms and Territories,&quot; the title used in Canada would describe Her as Queen &quot; of Canada and of all otherHer Realms and Territories,&quot; and so on.A tentative proposal on these lines was put forward at the Meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers which was held in April 1949 to consider the consequences of the impending constitutional changes in India. The suggestion had originally been made informally by Canada; the alternative forms for use in the various parts of the Commonwealth were worked out and put before the Meeting bythe United Kingdom representatives. The discussion then held was short andinconclusive. The principle of a variable Title of this kind proved acceptable tothe representatives of Canada, South Africa and Pakistan and, if it had met withgeneral agreement, would also have been accepted by the United Kingdom repre-sentatives. The Prime Minister of New Zealand expressed a strong preference for retaining the existing Title and did.not favour any solution which failed to namethe United Kingdom in the Title to be used in New Zealand. The Prime Ministerof Australia expressed no view. It was agreed that no decision need be taken atthe Meeting, but that, in the light of this preliminary discussion, commonwealth governments could consider the matter further and communicate their views tothe United Kingdom Government in due course. In the event no furtherexpression of views was conveyed to London by any of the other commonwealth governments.7. The abandonment of a Title common to all parts of the commonwealth would doubtless be represented as a further weakening of Commonwealth unity and in many parts of the Commonwealth some people would on those ^roundsregard it as a regrettable innovation.   We ourselves regret the necessity for
* proposing the alternative of a Title differing in form in different parts of theCommonwealth. We have, however, been forced to the conclusion that there isno other practicable means of gratifying the reasonable desire of many other commonwealth countries that the United Kingdom should no longer be the only-Commonwealth country which is mentioned by name in the Royal Title. And we feel bound to point out that this alternative involves no new constitutional change:it does no more than bring the Title into accord with the current constitutional facts of the Commonwealth relationship.8. If the principle of a variable Title is accepted by the Cabinet, we recommendthat the form for use in the United Kingdom and Colonies should be as follows:  *&quot; Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of all other Her Realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.&quot;The forms for use in other parts of the Commonwealth are set out in the appendix to this memorandum.The phrases &quot; by the Grace of God &quot; and &quot;Defender of the Faith &quot; are more appropriate for use in this country than in some other parts of the Commonwealth;and we think it inevitable that other Commonwealth countries should be left todecide in their discretion whether these phrases should be included in the Titleadopted for use in their countries. It is, however, important that the commonelement in the Titles used in the various parts of the Commonwealth should beplain to see; and we hope that, in the consultations with other commonwealth governments, the need will be stressed for limiting the local variations as narrowlyas possible.summary.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows:  (i) The present form of the Royal Title is manifestly inaccurate in respect ofIreland and in other ways fails to reflect the current constitutional rela-tions between the various parts of the Commonwealth. Some changeought to be made in the Title before Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation.(ii) No new form of Title will be acceptable to all the other commonwealth governments unless it meets the desire of some that their country should be mentioned in it by name.(iii) If that desire is to be met, there is no practicable alternative but to adopta form of Title which permits an element of local variation, so that each Commonwealth country can use for its own purposes a Title inwhich it is itself mentioned by name, but the other parts of the Common-wealth are described in a generic phrase.(iv) If this principle is accepted, the forms of Title which we would prefer arethose set out in the Appendix to this memorandum.(v) The other Commonwealth countries must be left to decide in their discretion whether they should include, in the Title adopted for use intheir countries, the phrases &quot; by the Grace of God &quot; and &quot; Defenderof the Faith.&quot; It should, however, be strongly urged upon other commonwealth Governments that the local variations should not be such as to obscure the common element in the Title.(vi) If the Cabinet approve the proposals outlined above, the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations should initiate consultations withother Commonwealth Governments with a view to securing their agree-ment to these changes and the adoption of a common plan for intro-ducing corresponding, and preferably simultaneous, legislation on thissubject in the various Commonwealth capitals.10. After this report was completed the Commonwealth Relations Officeheard informally from the Acting High Commissioner for Canada in London thatthe Canadian Government have now raised this question with the Governmentsof Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon. Basing themselves on the form of Accession Proclamation used in London, Canberra and Wellingtonon the accession of the new Sovereign, the Canadians are suggesting that, as analternative to the formula discussed in 1949, the Title for use in all Commonwealth
countries which owe allegiance to the Crown might be: &quot; Elizabeth the Second,Queen of this Realm and of all Her other Realms and Territories, Head of theCommonwealth.&quot; They contemplate that it would be left to the decision of each government whether the phrases &quot; by the Grace of God &quot; and &quot; Defender of theFaith &quot; should be included in the Title.As stated in the second part of paragraph 5 above, we considered a solution on these lines but rejected it, mainly on the ground that a form of words with nogeographical content at all would hardly serve as a formal Title for internationalpurposes. The Canadians themselves are evidently aware of this difficulty; for,in their communication to the other Commonwealth Governments, they have notedthat it will be necessary for some purposes for example, in Treaties in the Headsof State form or in Commissions of Appointment of Ambassadors and Ministers to include in the Title a specific mention of the country concerned. Theycontemplate that this need would be met, whenever necessary, by varying the Titleso as to read &quot; Queen of this Realm of (Canada). . . .&quot;The Royal Title is used only on formal occasions or in formal instruments.A formal Title without any geographical content comes very near to being acontradiction in terms. If a general form of Title were adopted on the under-standing that each country was at liberty to insert a geographical reference wheneverthis was thought necessary, we believe that the geographical reference would inpractice be included more often than not. If so, there is much to be said for facingthis fact from the Outset and adopting the solution suggested in paragraph 8 above.Therefore, in spite of the initiative which has since been taken by the canadian government, we adhere to the recommendations set out in the preceding paragraphs of this report and summarised in paragraph 9 above.SIMONDS.Lord Chancellors Office, S.W. 1,2%th February, 1952.APPENDIXVariations of the New Form of Title Suggested in Paragraph 8United Kingdom and ColoniesElizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland and of all other Her Realms and Territories Queen,Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.CanadaElizabeth the Second (by the Grace of God) of Canada and of all other HerRealms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender of the Faith).AustraliaElizabeth the Second (by the Grace of God) of Australia and of all other HerRealms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender of the Faith).New ZealandElizabeth the Second (by the Grace of God) of New Zealand and of all otherHer Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender ofthe Faith).South AfricaElizabeth the Second (by the Grace of God) of South Africa and of all otherHer Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender ofthe Faith).PakistanElizabeth the Second (by the Grace of God) of Pakistan and of all otherHer Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender ofthe Faith).CeylonElizabeth the Second (by the Grace of God) of Ceylon and of all otherHer Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender ofthe Faith).
