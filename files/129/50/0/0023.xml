LOO 4(THISiDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER- BRITANNIC -MA J-ESTY?S- GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 73 COPY NO.11TH MARCH, 1952CABINETLIBYA:  EVACUATION OF TOWNS BY H.M. forces memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am seriously concerned about the question of accommodationoccupied by our troops in the main towns in Libya,   My recommendations areas follows :-recommendations i recommend thatthe policy, set out in the Annex to this memorandum, of removing troops from the towns, should be reaffirmed;an immediate start should be made to carry out this policy inBenghazi, however inconvenient it may be temporarily(see paragraph 10 below);in addition to (b) above, the necessary planning for further action should be set in train at once, and the policy, including theconstruction of the cantonment, should be carried out accordinglywithout avoidable delay and at a rate which the Libyans cannot reasonably criticise (see paragraph 11 below);the necessary financial and other provisions should be made.ArgumentSince 1947 the Amir of Cyrenaica, now King of Libya8 has been pressing us to move away from the towns.   Principles governing the location of troops in Cyrenaica, agreed by all concerned, were incorporated in a paper C0D.C0(49) 4 of the 21st July, 1949 (see Annex).   Major troop concentrations were to be stationed as far as possible from the main centres of population, except in cases individually and specially agreed, and wewere to retain in the towns only small bodies of troops whose duties inconnection with the maintenance of the garrison as a whole necessitatedtheir presence there;  these were to be kept to an essential minimum,4. Little was done, however, in 1949-51 to carry out this policy, thoughplans were made and a site has been obtained for a cantonment in the JebeL, onwhich the King of Libya and the Cyrenaican administration set their hopes,5. In 1951, the Libyan Prime Minister pressed us strongly to exectfteas far as possible by the end of the year our plan to accommodate forcesoutside the towns, save in a limited number of cases where the nature oftheir duties rendered this impracticable0   We. ultimately undertook, in thetemporary military agreement, on which we depend for the facilities we nowenjoy in Libya, to do our best to complete this plan as quickly as the physicaldifficulties could be overcome. ----1-(a)(b)(c)(d)
6. Accordingly the. principles described In paragraph 3 above were applied to Tripolitania and approval was given for a plan to evacuateTripoli town, which is gradually being carried into effect and with whichthe Libyans are at present reasonably satisfied.   The outstanding difficultyin Tripoli is that of living accommodation occupied by army families, andwe and the Americans have been asked to reduce the number of families in the town.   A short term solution is being sought in the formation of ajoint committee to control new arrivals and allocate available accommodation^7B In Cyrenaica, however, comparatively little has been done; eventhe plan for the cantonment, which offers no immediate solution but atleast holds out hopes tothe Cyrenaicans, is, I understand, still in the meltingpot and no construction has been started.   With Libyan independence, localrequirements for government offices and official residences have increased and there is growing resentment at the shortage of living accommodationgenerally in Benghazi and other towns due to the presence of British troops.The King of Libya and the Cyrenaican administration have pressed evenmore urgently for the removal of troops and the release of accommodation,H, M. Minister in Libya has reported that feeling among officials and people is running unpleasantly high.   The King has particularly stressed the needfor prompt action, pointing out the irritation which is being caused andsaying that he remembers that the real cause of our troubles in Egypt was ourretention of troops in the main towns.   Finally, the Libyan Prime Ministerduring his visit to London early in February, raised the matter with me and asked for early action.8. The War Office, whilst agreeing once again to give up as muchaccommodation in Cyrenaican towns as possible as soon as money canbe made available for building elsewhere and so far as engineer potentialpermits, have said that they have neither money nor potential to carryout any projects for the reprovision of accommodation in the financialyear   1952-53.   Although I understand their difficulties, I am satisfiedthat we cannot afford to let matters stand thus.   I also understand theirreluctance to leave buildings on the rehabilitation of which they have spent money, but I have to put wider considerations before my colleagues.It is on an independent Libyan Government that we have to depend forthe strategic facilities which are so important to us in Libya.   unless there is tangible  evidence in the immediate future of progress inevacuating buildings in the main towns, particularly Benghazi, requiredfor Libyan purposes, we shall lose Libyan goodwill, seriously jeopardiseour chances of negotiating satisfactory long-term military facilities and generally build up for ourselves an atmosphere similar to that which arose in Egypt.   Unless we can solve urgently the problem of accommodation in the towns it will be of little use planning installations for new units in libya, to which I gather priority is now being given.   The first LibyanParliament, in which the matter will no doubt be ventilated, is due tomeet in mid-March, so we have little time to spare.9.    ConclusionsIt has been argued that we cannot afford in these days to spendmoney on rehousing our troops unless we have first got a firm assurance(in the form of a long-term Military Agreement) that we can stay in Libya;but since we had to await the result of the Libyan elections, we may not now be able to begin negotiating such an Agreement until April or to conclude it until say August at the earliest.   I therefore consider that, inthe present state of the world and particularly the Middle East, we cannot afford not to spend this money or to risk not getting the kind of Agreementwe need.
lO. As regards the immediate objective of releasing buildings inBenghazi (see paragraph (b) of my recommendations), I suggest that adead line date of the 15th April should be set.   Every effort should, i feel, be made within this time to concentrate the troops in fewerbuildings, preferably in the barracks on the outskirts of the town, to erecttemporary hutments or even if necessary to put units for the time beingunder canvas.11. The planning of this is of course not entirely my concern, butit does appear to me that the present process, involving reference toLondon and Fayid, is unlikely to achieve the necessary results in thetime available.   In the special circumstances I venture to suggest thatwe should consider setting up at once a Military Accommodation board in Benghazi (with representatives at a suitable level of the War Office,the Treasury, the Foreign Office and General Headquarters, Middle EastLand Forces) empowered to decide on the spot which buildings are to be evacuated by April 15th and to carry out their decisions locally.   Wecould then inform the Libyan Government officially of the progress made.We could consider later how long it would be necessary to keep this board in being for further execution of the policy.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.11th MARCH, 1952.
