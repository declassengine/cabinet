FISCAL, MEASURES TO CONTROL INVESTMENT INPLANT AND MACHINERYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in Part II of the Confidential Annex to my memorandum of the19th January on &quot;The Economic Situation&quot; (C0(52) 8), I reported that? of thevarious fiscal restrictions upon investment in plant and machinery whichhad been considered,, the only practicable one appeared to be the suspension of the Income Tax Depreciation Allowances on new purchases of plant and machinery for a period of several years.2. The Cabinet were reluctant to accept this proposal, mainly on theground that its effects would be indiscriminate as between essential and less-essential investment.   It was suggested that every effort should be madeto devise an alternative method of securing the desired result,30 Further consideration has, I fear, only confirmed my initialconclusion;  and since it is now more urgent than ever to devise some meansof curtailing domestic investment in plant and machinery, I am proposing toinclude in my Budget a measure to suspend the Depreciation Allowances.4, This measure will follow logically upon the suspension (made inthe last Budget) of the initial allowances of 40% when plant is first bought.What I shall now propose is that the annual allowances, normally grantedwhile plant is in use, should be similarly suspended.   In each case, the suspension will be in respect of the allowances which would otherwise begiven for expenditiare incurred on or after the 6th April, 1952B   In the caseof plant acquired before that date, the annual allowances will continue duringthe period of suspension.   The proposal would, therefore, operate at themost desirable point, i. e. to restrict new investment in plant and machineryfor a period05. The effect of the propo,sal will simply be to postpone the allowanceswhich would otherwise be granted annually to enable the capital cost of the plant and machinery to be set off against profits.   At the end of the period of suspension the deferred allowances will start to operate again, at the rateappropriate to the normal life of the plant.   Thus if a firm acquire,after the 6th April, some plant having a normal life of 15 years, they will receive no allowances on that plant for the period of suspension, but at theend of that period will receive the appropriate annual allowances over 15 years^Where the plant is scrapped or sold before the end of that period of 15 years,the undrawn allowances, less any proceeds of sale, will be granted as a&quot;balancing&quot; allowance.   Thus the purchaser will not have been robbed of anything;  but he will have had to finance the capital cost of new plant from hisown resources during the period of suspension, and-this should act as adisincentive to new outlay after the 6th April, 1952 - particularly wheremarginal plant is concerned.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..Mr.?...c.

6. The initial allowances are suspended indefinitely.   It is forconsideration whether the annual allowances should not be similarlytreated.   But their suspension is likely to be more strongly criticised by industry than the suspension of the initial allowances, mainly on theground that it will, compel industry to pay tax on more than its true profits,properly computed on recognised principles of accountancy.   There is,therefore, a strong case for suspending the annual allowances for adefinite and stated period, which might be three years. &apos; This I propose.7. I greatly regret having to take this step, particularly in view of itsindiscriminate effects.   But the need to curtail domestic investment is now more urgent than ever, and I can see no other fiscal means of doing so whichis not open to insuperable objection.R.A. B.Treasury Chambers,, S.
