(THIS. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S* GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL,COPY NO.C.(52) 90.28th MARCH, 1952.CABINETTHE FRENCH POLITICAL situation note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I attach for the information of my colleagues an interestingaccount of the French political situation which I have received from.M. Ambassador at Paris.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.I.28th MARCH, 1952.
It is improbable that we shall see a strong French Government intKe ea-rly future.   It is also unlikely that De Gaulle will come into power as theRally of the French People,(R.P.F.), far from growing, shows signs of splitting.Government presided over by De Gaulle in person would certainly be &quot;strong&quot;,but it would almost certainly split France and arouse internal convulsions.On the other hand, the Communists are also in no state to take over.   Itis largely because the two revolutionary parties, the Gaullists and the Communis,are at present weak that the constitutional parties in the middle indulge inthese recurrent weak governments.   They are no longer afraid of hangingseparately.As a result of the last elections there are roughly six blocs in theAssembly of a hundred votes each.   The Communists and the R.P.F. are on the two extremes, of whom the first vote steadily against the Government andthe second have no compunction in doing so when it suits their book.   This leavesthe Socialists, the Popular Republic Movement (M.R.P.), the Radicals and theIndependents and Peasants, with a total of four hundred votes in the middle onwhich a Government majority has to be based.   If the four hundred could combineunder a strong leader they would have a comfortable majority.   But there isno Poincare to do this and the four middle blocs are split over both the clericalissue and social and economic policy.   Governments have thus to get along asbest they can, often depending on abstentions for a majority at all and usingone combination on certain issues and another on others.   It is possible that up to half the Gaullists may shortly split off as there is growing impatiencewith De Gaulle&apos;s &quot;politique du pire&quot; and join the majority groups.   Thiswould strengthen the Centre Right half of the majority but any Government would still require the votes of the M.R.P. or a large part of them for a firm majority.The M.R.P. are a Catholic Labour Party and are unhappy when separated from the Socialists.The troublesome questions are finance and foreign affairs.   Though thesituation is very grave, I think France will contrive to wobble through financiallywithout any very heroic measures, at any rate for the time being.   In foreignaffairs, while there is now no serious opposition to the policy of the AtlanticPact, the fate of the European Defence Community is in the balance.   Unfortunatelyopposition has developed to Schuman personally, largely because of hisGerman policies but also because of his North African policies which are regarded by the Right Wing as too weak.   He is not a popular or inspiring speaker.This does not apply to Bidault and Pleven who stand for much the same policies.The Socialists are basically opposed to German rearmament and say that they are against the present European Army Plan because it isnot sufficiently supra-national, but that they would swallow it if Great Britainparticipated.   But there is now some indication that the new British proposalsfor the Council of Europe may influence them favourably.   The R.P.F.oppose the abolition of the French Army and only agree to German rearmamenton condition that a European Confederation is formed first.   When the principleof a European Army was considered by the Assembly before the Lisbon Conference,86 Socialists voted for the Government and 20 against.   On this occasion therewere 52 adverse votes from the parties who normally support the Government.When the Treaty itself comes to be ratified, the Socialist position will therefore be crucial.   To give the Government a reasonably satisfactory majority,theSocialists must Vote, for, ratification; to get a bare majority it would be
menough for the Socialists and most of the 52 dissidents from other parties,with possibly a few Gaullists, to abstain;   if all the Socialists vote againstratification, the Treaty will almost certainly be rejected.Obviously the more positive form Great Britain&apos;s association with theEuropean Defence Community can take, the more likely the Assembly is to approve.   There is no question that in all French parties except the communists and the diehard section of the R.P.F. the anxiety for the closestassociation with Great Britain as a safeguard against German tendencies isuppermost.British Embassy.Paris.25th MARCH, 1952.
