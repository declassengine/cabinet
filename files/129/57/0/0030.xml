CABINETCOMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE -THE COLLECTIVE APPROACHMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.During the course of our discussions at the commonwealth economic Conference an issue has arisen upon which I think it is essentialto obtain the advice of the Cabinet.2. The plan has in general been well received by all members ofthe Sterling Area and, subject to an understanding on this issue, there is noreason why it should not be possible to draw up agreed conclusions and a communique at the end of the Conference which, while reserving the decisionto take at some future date a positive step towards convertibility, yet indicatesthe general agreement of the Commonwealth countries that we should adopt adefinite course of action leading towards a system of multilateral trade and payments,,3. The difficulty which has arisen concerns the interpretation ofthe United Kingdom proposal that an integral part of the scheme should be that the sterling Area countries should maintain fixed rates with sterling after sterlinghas become convertible at a flexible rate.   The position is set out in paragraphs10 and 11 of C.E.C.(52) 5 (Annex B).   The delegations who would see difficultyin undertaking at this date to maintain a de facto link with sterling are those ofIndia, Pakistan and Ceylon.   It was clear from discussions at the Committee ofFinance Ministers over which the Chancellor of the Exchequer presided thatthere was a possibility of reaching an impasse   on this question.   subsequent discussions with the Finance Ministers of India, Pakistan and Ceylon revealedhowever that their difficulties were fundamentally political, and that, to use theexpression of the Indian Finance Minister in the course of the Conference meeting&apos;on Friday afternoon, there was a 95 per cent likelihood of India linking hercurrency with sterling,,   This appears to be the view of the other two delegationsas well in respect of their currencies,4. In the afternoon meeting on Friday the Chancellor of theExchequer accordingly made a statement indicating that it would be consonantwith membership of the Sterling Area for currencies to keep in step withsterling, and it was hoped it would so be decided by all concerned.   In summing up the discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear that if any country were to decide to link with the dollar a new situation would be created.He has explained in private conversation with the Finance Ministers concerned that if one or more countries were to decide to link with the dollar this wouldhave the result either that we should abandon the plan or that the country orcountries concerned would leave the Sterling Area,The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.............................................TOP SECRET Copy No........C,(52) 4306th DECEMBER, 1952.
5, It is quite clear that the countries   concerned do not wish toleave the Sterling Area and yet do not wish to make a final decision on thisquestion at the present time.   Indeed it would appear that the Indian andPakistani Delegations at any rate are under instructions not to make a finaldecision until they can assess nearer the time what the circumstances are going to be if and when the plan is brought into operation.6. Neither I nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer feels that thingscan be left as they are.   We must be quite clear about the implications and make our views known before the Conference concludes.   Further, while I thinkit is possible to start the preliminary consultations with the United States andother Governments on the basis of the present position, we cannot be committed to enter on serious negotiations on the basis of the plan unlessthe Indians, Pakistanis and Ceylonese decide to remain attached to sterling.I accordingly propose to make a statement on the lines of the attached draft(Annex A) at our next meeting on Monday afternoon, subject to any amendments which my colleagues may have to suggest.   It will be noted that this statementdeals in particular with the anxiety of the Prime Minister of Australiaas to what should be the content of our approach to the United states authorities in the event of there being uncertainty on this matter.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.6th DECEMBER, 1952.
ANNEX ADRAFT STATEMENT1. Over the weekend the United Kingdom Delegation have had anopportunity of considering the difficulties which have been felt by certaindelegations in making a decision now to link their currencies with sterling,if the plan comes into operation.   We fully recomise and understand the anxieties which are felt by these delegations in taking a decision of this character now.   Nevertheless it is clear from what has been said round this table that an unsatisfactory position may well develop unless the situationis further clarified before we all depart.2. First of all I must make clear that it is the view of the UnitedKingdom Delegation that, if under the plan a Commonwealth member of the sterling Area decides to link its currency with the dollar, a situation would arise in which other members of the Area might well consider that country&apos;policy inconsistent with full membership of the Area.   We should then haveto consider whether it would be possible to proceed with the plan at all,given that a Commonwealth member or members would not be participating in it.   I welcome the statement made by the Indian Finance Minister thatthere is a 95 per cent probability that India will decide to link her currencywith sterling.   I can quite see the force of his arguments that a certain degreepf judgment should be exercised by members of the Area both as to their ownattitude to the plan and as to any particular action which they may see fit toadopt.3, At the same time there is a very real difficulty on our side.We must be clear in any approach which is made to the United States and to theinternational organisations that it is made for the Commonwealth sterling area as a whole.   Any ambiguity in our approach might well influence theattitude of the Governments and the organisations concerned to our plan andmight affect the extent of credit we were able to obtain.4, In making the preliminary approaches, therefore, we should explain that this is a plan which has been evolved at the commonwealth economic Conference but that it is a condition of its inception and successthat other countries and organisations should play their part.   The membersof the C cmmonv/ealth are therefore reserving their final decisions on theproposal until they have received a firm indication oi cue attitude of otherGovernments.   In order that the approach may have substance and preserveits integrity, we should however make it on the supposition that all membersof the Commonwealth Sterling Area will in the event agree to keep their currencies in step with sterling.   If the other Governments and organisations,and in particular the United States Government, are favourable in principle to the proposals, then it is evident that we cannot pursue the negotiationsfurther without know/ing the position of all the members of the sterling commonwealth on this fundamental issue.5,basis0I hope it can be agreed that we should go forward on that
PARAGRAPHS 10 and 11 of C.E.C.(52) 5.10. Certain Delegations would see difficulty in undertaking at this time to maintain this de facto  link with sterling and doubted whether it shouldbe regarded as an integral part of the plan.   They recognised that a decisionon this point must be taken before the convertibility operation was launched:  andwhen the time came they might feel it right to maintain this link.   But theseDelegations saw possible difficulty on two grounds.   In the first place therewas a political difficulty.   Their parities were expressed to I.M.F. in termsof gold, and it would be necessary to alter their currency legislation, which now expressed the unit of currency ia terms of gold, and to express it interms of sterling.   In the second place they feared commercial difficultiessince an important element in their total trade was conducted in dollars.   Itwas recognised that the objective was to achieve stability in the sterling/dollarrate and if this was secured there would be less difficulty in maintaining de factoparity with sterling.   But there v?. ight be fluctuations in the sterling/dollarrate which were quite unrelated to the economies of these countries.   TheseDelegations would therefore wish not to be precluded by prior commitmentunder the plan from maintaining a fixed rate between their currencies andthe dollar within the present margins.   This would require dollar resources tosupport the rate for their currencies;  but they considered that if their internaleconomies were in order (and the whole operation pre-supposed that allsterling area countries&apos; internal economies were on a sound basis) thereshould be no need to use dollars in support of their rate on any substantial scale.11. Other Delegations saw great difficulty in this proposal.   At the outset the convertibility operation would depend on countries outside the sterling area having confidence in the future of sterling and this confidencewould be seriously impaired if some sterling area countries appeared to have so little confidence in the future of sterling that they preferred to peg to the dollar.This lack of confidence might deter other countries from pegging their currencies to sterling and so deprive sterling of the strength which it wouldderive from the pegging to it of a large number of currencies.   In the second place it was impossible to judge to what extent it would be necessary to spend dollarsfrom the central reserves (which must in any case be conserved for the convertibility operation) to support the rate of any sterling area country whichpegged to the dollar.   Moreover such countries would be under considerable pressure to retain their dollar earnings to support their own currency in relationto the dollar,   I.M.F. could not be expected to provide special resources forthe convertibility operation if dollars were to be used for the quite differentoperation of maintaining in the case of some currencies a relatively narrowmargin round parity.   In the third place other countries of the sterling areawho were prepared to give full support to the convertibility operation by peggingtheir rate to sterling even though movements in the sterling/dollar rate might at times be to their own disadvantage could not justify this course if some members of the sterling area were standing aside to await developments.
