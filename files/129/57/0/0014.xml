Primed for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 3C. (52) 41419th November, 1952CABINETREPORT BY THE EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEEThe Committee were appointed by the Cabinet on 10th June (C.C. (52)58th Conclusions, Minute 4) with the following terms of reference and composition:  Terms of Reference&quot; To formulate and submit to the Cabinet practical plans wherebyeffective remedial measures could at once be applied to counter anytendency towards widespread unemployment.&quot;CompositionChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Chairman).Minister of Labour and National Service.Minister of Housing and Local Government.Paymaster-General.Minister of Supply.Subsequently the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of works were added to the Committee.2. The first meeting of the Committee was held on 20th October. On thebasis of (i) an assessment by the Minister of Labour and National Service of theprobable trends of unemployment up to March 1953;(ii) a review in the light of the present situation of the proposals for dealingwith widespread unemployment set out in the White Paper on Employ-ment Policy (Cmd. 6527) published in 1944 by&quot; the national government,we have reached the following general conclusions about the employment situationand about possible measures to deal with the level of unemployment which we expect to arise.Probable Trends of Unemployment3. Provided there is no recession in the United States, which appears unlikelyin the next twelve months, and provided there is no balance of payments crisis,which also now seems unlikely this year, unemployment though increasing duringthe next few months is unlikely to reach 500,000 (2-3 per cent.) by the end of 1952.There does not appear to be a substantial risk of general unemployment in theimmediate future but there will be problems of serious localised unemployment.This problem has already arisen in the cotton industry where, even if the presentrecovery continues, all the unemployed are unlikely to be absorbed. There is a problem of impending redundancy, in South Wales in the sheet steel and tinplateindustries. Some unemployment in some centres may be caused for a time byadjustments in the defence programme. More unemployment might arise in con-sumer goods industries if exports cannot be increased, since it is our general policynot to encourage a rise in home consumption where this would conflict with ourinvestment or balance of payments policies.Remedial Measures4. Most of the remedies for widespread unemployment proposed in theNational Government^ White Paper (Cmd. 6527) are not appropriate to the prob-lem of localised unemployment. In particular the frequently proposed remedy ofpublic works could be only of limited application in present circumstances as asolution to localised unemployment for the following reasons:  (i) While there are probably a number of works which could be put in handif necessary provided plans for them are made in advance most ofsuch works would probably take a long time to get started and mightnot reach their peak until employment had begun to recover.43245
(ii) Special construction such as factories, Government offices, &amp;c, whichmight be required, cannot be switched to the areas where unemployment has arisen.- (in) Road works, which can be localised, employ little labour none of itfemale at great cost. ...........(iv) Public works are often quite unsuitable for the type of people unemployed.(v) In any case, it is Government policy to try to curb local authority spendingand not to stimulate it.5. Localised unemployment must be dealt with in the light of the problemsof the industries most concerned and of local conditions. Where the unemploy-ment is due to&apos; structural changes leading to permanent contraction of the sufferingindustry, Distribution of Industry policy clearly has an important part to play.The problem is how to stimulate employment in the suffering area by government measures designed to help production, particularly production for export. such measures may also with advantage have a general application to United kingdom industry as a whole. Most of the possible measures, however, such as export bonusschemes, the freeing of private investment building or the selective adjustment of the defence programme, involve wide issues which are more appropriate to otherCommittees and could not properly be taken very far in the employment committees.Localised unemployment already existing6. Action is already in hand to deal with the unemployment already existing in certain industries and areas and proposals have been submitted to theEconomic Policy Committee by the President of the Board of Trade.Future work of the Employment Committee7. We conclude that, in the light of the above appreciation, the committee could most usefully act as a standing committee:  (i) To consider such special cases of prospective unemployment as might bereferred to them by the Cabinet or by other Committees, such as theEconomic Policy Committee.(ii) Which could watch carefully unemployment trends with a view to pro-posing practical remedies to ward off any serious or widespread unem-ployment which appeared to threaten.Summary of conclusions. (i) There appears to be little risk of widespread unemployment, at present.- (ii) Problems have already arisen and are likely to arise of serious localisedunemployment. Action is already in hand to deal with the localisedunemployment which has already appeared. Further decisions will benecessary in the light of possible developments in the motor car in-dustry, and as the result of possible defence cuts and other developmentsaffecting employment which cannot at this stage be accurately assessed.(iii) Except possibly in certain rare cases where plans should be prepared,public works cannot provide a major remedy for heavy localisedunemployment as it has arisen in 1952.(iv) The Committee should function as a standing committee:  -(a) to deal with such special cases of prospective unemployment as maybe referred to them by the Cabinet or by other Committees,such as the Economic Policy Committee ;(b) to watch unemployment trends carefully and to draw up practicalproposals to ward off any serious or widespread unemployment which appears to threaten.recommendation .   We invite our colleagues to endorse the conclusions in paragraph 8 above.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, W.C. 2,19th November, 1952.SWINTON.
