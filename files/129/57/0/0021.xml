(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential (52) 421 COPY NO,24th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETTHE PROVISION OF TELEVISION IN THE ABERDEEN area memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.There is only one television station in Scotland today.   This is situated between Edinburgh and Glasgow and admittedly provides a service for the densely populated area of central Scotland containing perhaps 70 percent of the country&apos;s population.   There is, however, no service available for 30per cent of the population and a much greater proportion of the area ofScotland.2, The present Government is committed to the provision of furthertelevision stations at Pontop Pike, Belfast, Aberdeen, the Isle of Wight andPlymouth.   On 22nd October, 1952, the Assistant Postmaster-General statedin the House that it had been decided to provide stations at Pontop Pike andat Belfast in time for the Coronation:  and that the British broadcasting corporation (B.B.C.) were &quot;to see to what extent makeshift arrangements could be made in.....fringe areas&quot;, including Aberdeen.   He has nowconcluded that the Aberdeen area should not be covered in this way, and thatno further extensions should be authorised.3. The Town Council of Aberdeen, the local members of Parliament andmany others have represented most strongly that if facilities can beprovided at Pontop Pike and at Belfast in time for the Coronation they shouldbe provided also at Aberdeen,   I very much hope that, notwithstanding thedifficulties to which the Postmaster-General refers, makeshift arrangementsfor a service to the Aberdeen area, with a population of about a quarter of amillion, can still be made,   According to my information this could be done with little or no capital expenditure.   If it is not done - and most certainlyif makeshift facilities are provided elsewhere - I assert most definitely that it will lead to a renewal of the usual boring outbursts in Scotland to theeffect that we are being ignored and so on.   In other words, it will merelygive a present of some more fuel to nationalist organisations and willirritate our own supporters who feel very strongly in the matter04. Private operators have informed Aberdeen Town Council that theyare prepared to supply the necessary equipment and to organise a serviceif the B.B.C will not:   but they must first obtain a licence from thePostmaster-General to permit them to do so.   I understand that theseoperators could not provide such a satisfactory service as the B0B0C0   But itcannot be said that they are unable to give a service at all.   And if the B,B.C.cannot themselves provide a temporary service, and if at the same time thePostmaster-General refuses to issue a licence to private operators, there
will be a further outcry against the Government on the ground that, inorder to preserve a monopoly to which many loyal supporters object,they are denying to Her Majesty&apos;s subjects - who in the Aberdeen area feelthey have a special relationship to the Royal Family - the opportunity toview the Coronation.J.S.Scottish Office, S.W.T,24th November, 1952.
