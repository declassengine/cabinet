Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. Q 7C. (52) 43711th December, 1952CABINETOFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Minister of defence on 19th November, 1952, I announced in the House of Lords the Govern-menfs decision not to give the benefit of the improvements in the 1950 retired pay and pensions code of the Services to those members of the Forces who retiredbefore 1st September of that year, when the new code came into effect.2. This decision has been the subject of much criticism and a motion hasnow been put down in the following terms:  &quot; That this House views with concern the refusal of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to recommend any increase in the retired pay of the officers ofHer Majesty&apos;s armed forces whose service ended before 1st September, 1950;recognises that the increased cost of living affects them equally with thosewho retired on or after that date; and, in view of the increases which havebeen awarded to others who have served the Crown, calls upon Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to ensure that the just claim of these officers, many of whomserved in both World Wars, are not ignored.&quot;Some 180 names, of which 105 are those of Government supporters, have alreadybeen put down in support of this motion.3. Lord Jeffreys has also put down a motion in the Lords for discussionimmediately after the Christmas Recess in the following terms:  &quot; To call attention to the grievance of officers who retired under theprovisions of the Royal Warrant and corresponding instruments of 1919, and whose retired pay, after being reduced on account of the fall in the cost of livingbetween 1924 and 1933, has not been correspondingly increased on accountof the subsequent great rise in the cost of living; also to call attention to the inadequacy of the rates of pension of the older classes of retired officers of the armed forces, and of officers&apos; widows; and to move for Papers.&quot;4. The Commons Motion will not be debated before Christmas, but thematter is almost certain to be raised in the Christmas Adjournment Debate, whenmy Parliamentary Secretary will have to reply on behalf of the Government.5. This reply can take one of two alternative lines. The first would be toreiterate the decision which was announced on 19th November and to explain the reasons for it. Such a reply will be very badly received by the House. a motion is then likely to be moved on a private member&apos;s day after the recess and pressed to a Division, when as a result of abstentions or otherwise it might becarried against the Government.6. The second course would be to explain the reasons for the decision, tosay that the problem bristles with difficulties, but to add that the Governmentrealises the strength of feeling in the House and in the country on this matter,and is considering whether anything can be done to help those officers whosepensions (based on the 1920 retired pay code) were stabilised in 1935.43361
I/. I -in. My service colleagues and I appreciate that if the second course is adoptedit will commit the Government to some concessions to the officers concerned,although not to the grant of the full terms of the 1950 code to those who retiredbefore it came into force.8. In these circumstances, I ask the Cabinet to decide which line of reply should be adopted by my Parliamentary Secretary in replying to the AdjournmentDebate on 19th December.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.T,11th December, 1952.
