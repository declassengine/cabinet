CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 7 0C. (52) 42427th November, 1952CABINETACCELERATED ORDERS FOR CLOTHING AND TEXTILESMemorandum by the Minister of supply for the information of my colleagues, I attach a chart showing the value oforders for clothing and textiles placed by the Ministry of Supply under the reliefscheme and the incidence of unemployment in these industries.2. The total value of accelerated orders to be placed under the relief schemewas fixed at  23 millions (C.C. (52) 58th Conclusions, Minute 4). To date orders placed total  20-1 millions, of which  18-3 millions was placed by the Ministry ofSupply and  1-8 millions by the Admiralty.3. Unemployment in the textiles and clothing industries has dropped froma peak of 183,000 in May to 67,000 in October, and short-time working has been considerably reduced. The orders placed by the Government were, of course, onlyone of the factors contributing to this improvement.4. In areas were there is now relatively little unemployment, textile firms are showing reluctance to tender for our contracts. On the other hand, the areas whereheavy unemployment still persists do not, for the most part, make goods of the typeswhich we still require. It will, therefore, probably not be possible to place morethan about  300,000 worth of further orders, making a total of about  20-5 millions.5. This is within the limits of  20 millions to  25 millions announced toParliament. Moreover, the figures of value do not fully reflect the increasedvolume of work provided, since prices have dropped considerably in the past sixmonths.6. In the circumstances I recommend that the relief scheme should now beregarded as completed.,   ;&apos; D. s.Ministry of Supply, W.C. 2,27th November, 1952.43279Printed for the Cabinet.
