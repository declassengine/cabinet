/Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 44115th December, 1952CABINETKOREA: PROCEEDINGS AT THE 7th SESSION OF THEGENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may wish to have some account of the proceedings at theGeneral Assembly in regard to Korea, with particular reference to the indian delegation^ resolution, which was the main subject of discussion during my visit.I am accordingly circulating this paper for the information of the Cabinet. Asummary of the principal events in the passage of the Indian resolution by theGeneral Assembly is given in the White Paper laid before Parliament on12th December (Cmd. 8716). The text of the Indian resolution as finally passedis given at Annex 11 in that Paper.Value of the Indian Resolution2. As we saw it, the Indian resolution deserved support for two reasons.First, it combined the original Indian proposal for a Repatriation commission with the principle set out in my speech of 11th November, namely, that force shouldnot be used to either detain prisoners of war or to repatriate them; that is to say,it preserved our principle of no forcible repatriation and at the same time madea determined effort to find a solution acceptable to the Communists. It thereforeseemed to offer a genuine, if rather remote, possibility of ending the Korean war.The subsequent reaction of the Soviet and Chinese Governments to the resolutiondisappointed this hope. Nevertheless the initial Chinese reaction was much lessviolent than the Russian, and this in itself seems to suggest that the Chinese Govern-ment, although not accepting the Indian proposals, may still be reluctant to severtheir close contacts with New Delhi about Korea a possibility which, given thehelpful and realistic line taken by the Indian Government over their resolution,may be thought to throw a faint ray of light on the otherwise gloomy Korean scene.3. Secondly, the Indian resolution represented the beginning of an alignmentof Asian opinion in a more positive sense on the side of the free world. This made it essential, in our view, to avoid snubbing the Indian initiative and thus in effectkicking India back to the top of the fence just when she showed signs of descendingon our side of it. (It was particularly encouraging to find that General Eisenhowerstrongly agreed with us on this point.) By eventually commanding the supportof all Delegations except those of Communist countries, the Indian resolutionbecame an important weapon with world opinion. From the point of view of publicity it seemed calculated to put the Communists on the defensive in Koreanmatters where they had had the initiative (e.g., bacteriological warfare, and theincidents in the Koje camps) for so long.4. Against this background, it is regrettable that agreement could not havebeen reached on the Indian resolution without prolonged and highly publiciseddifferences of view between the Delegation of the United States and those of almost all America&apos;s Allies, led by the United Kingdom and Canada. The moral effectof the free workfs ultimate agreement on the Indian resolution would have beenappreciably greater if such agreement had been achieved quickly and spontaneously,rather than belatedly and apparently only in response to the attacks ofM. Vyshinsky.
Attitude of the United States Delegation5. The responsibility for the difficult course which the discussions took lies with the United States Delegation. Both in strategy and in tactics their attitudetowards the Indian resolution was inept.6. Obsessed by the anxieties which General Clark and the Joint Chiefs ofStaff had felt about the proposal in its original form, Mr. Acheson and Mr. Grossseem to have developed an irrational dislike of any Indian proposal, even whenamended in an attempt to meet their views. Indeed, the Minister of State gainedthe impression from his discussion with them that Mr. Lovett and General Bradleywere themselves appreciably less rigid about the whole question than their Secretaryof State.7. The United States Delegation^ use of the press, as exemplified both inthe press conference of 18th November and the Associated Press message about Mr. Gross&apos;s call on me on 22nd November, was clumsy in the extreme. By thusgiving publicity to their own &quot; tough &quot; line and to a dramatised version of ourdisagreement with them, they evidently hoped to frighten the United Kingdomand Canadian Delegations into accepting their views. When this attempt failed,they themselves became alarmed at the extent of the press interest which they had created in our disagreement and did what they could to damp it down. The finaloutcome was unfortunate for them; they found themselves obliged to approvean amended version of the Indian resolution after having given so much publicity to the view that it was unacceptable as a basis.8. I had some sympathy for Mr. Acheson&apos;s personal position. Coming afterthe strain and bitterness of the unscrupulous attacks made on him over a periodof years, the shock of defeat in the presidential election and the conscious weaknesswhich is natural in members of an outgoing Administration seemed to have inducedin him a mild persecution complex. In representing the views of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff he felt it necessary to be more Royalist than the King. When it became clearthat we were not going to accept his view, his personal relations with the Ministerof State and myself, hitherto excellent, became temporarily troubled. At a private conversation with us both in our hotel on the evening of 19th NovemberMr. Acheson made an undignified and unjustified personal attack on Mr. SelwynLloyd, whose support of me throughout these difficult days was invaluable. Butfor the knowledge that Mr. Acheson had just come from a somewhat prolongedcocktail party in his own suite, I should have felt bound to take him up seriously.He must at this stage have realised that retreat was inevitable. General Eisen-hower and Mr. Dulles were avoiding committing themselves publicly or privately insupport of the United States Governments attitude, and approval of the Indianresolution was being freely voiced in the Republican press. Harmony in ourpersonal relations was restored before I left, but it was indeed sad to see thistemporary disintegration of character under the stress of events.The Part Played by Mr. Menon9. Conversely, Mr. Krishna Menon, the author of the Indian resolution,seemed to gain in stature during these discussions. His vanity remained unimpaired,and it was clear that he keenly enjoyed the publicity attendant on his key role in theproceedings.. His drafting still showed signs of the tortuous and obscurity-lovingturn of mind with which we became familiar during his term as High Commissionerhere. Nevertheless, he showed an unexpectedly statesmanlike attitude and con-siderable moral courage in his readiness to accept a series of concessions such thatultimately even the United States Delegation could support his draft. His speechintroducing his resolution concluded with a remarkable piece of eloquence which made a great impression on his hearers. Full credit for their patient and resource-ful handling of the private discussions with him must go to Mr. Pearson andMr. Selwyn Lloyd.Relations with the Soviet Delegation10. I had no opportunity during my visit for any useful private talk withthe Soviet representatives. Before my arrival, M. Gromyko had given the Ministerof State the impression that the Soviet Government might not prove intransigenton the principle of no forcible repatriation. M. Vyshinsky&apos;s speech on10th November seemed to nip any such hope in the bud. Nevertheless, thefollowing day.   M. Sobolev, one of the Soviet delegates, came up and made a
friendly comment on my own remarks about Korea in the general debate; in response to this approach I said that I was at M. Vyshinsky&apos;s disposal if he wishedto have a private talk. In fact, I had a few words with M. Vyshinsky on generaltopics at Sir Gladwyn Jebb&apos;s house, but, apart from that, no opportunity fora meeting arose, and, after hearing M. Vyshinsky&apos;s violent speech in the FirstCommittee on 24th November, I did not feel disposed to pursue the possibilityfurther.Commonwealth Co-operation11. I have narrated and commented on these proceedings at some lengthbecause, apart from the intrinsic importance of the subject, I think that they provide an encouraging example of Commonwealth co-operation. The basis of theCommonwealth front was a close Anglo-Canadian understanding and a determina-tion by both Delegations to stand up to the &quot; tough &quot; tactics adopted by the UnitedStates representatives. The Australian and New Zealand Delegations rallied to theviews of their United Kingdom and Canadian colleagues, not without some personalhesitation on the part of Sir Percy Spender, the head of the Australian Delegation,in whose mind Australia^ new relationship to the United States following theconclusion of the Anzus Pact,, was doubtless uppermost; indeed, I understandthat it was only on direct instructions from his Government that he aligned himself with us. What seemed to me particularly satisfactory was that the Indian Delega-tion should have been willing to let an initiative of theirs be adapted to conform with the views of the &quot; old Commonwealth &quot; countries, and that on this basis weshould have been able to make a concerted Commonwealth effort which gave an effective lead to the entire Assembly.A.
