Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 43610th December, 1952CABINETTHE CORONATION: AMNESTY FOR PRISONERSMemorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotlandThe question has been raised whether an amnesty, or some special remission of sentence, should be granted to prisoners on the occasion of the Coronation.2.   A proposal of this kind is open to the following objections:  (a) It may have been appropriate in the past, as a gesture of Royal Clemencyto those in prison as political opponents of the Royal House, but it isan anachronism in modern conditions, when those who would benefithave been convicted of offences against the community.(b) An act of clemency which benefits only those who happen to be in prisonon a particular day, and does not benefit those who completed theirsentences a few days earlier, or are sentenced a few days later, is illogicaland unfair in its application.(c) It cannot be extended to all persons in prison.   There are some prisoners,for example, men committed to prison in default of payment underwife maintenance orders, in whose case the Prerogative of Mercy doesnot apply. A special act of clemency would be a cause of grievanceto such prisoners, who could not benefit from it.(d) It is inconsistent with the regular system by which persons sentenced to imprisonment earn remission by good conduct and industry.(e) It is also inconsistent with the modern conception that some sentences arenot merely punitive, but are primarily of the nature of training. release from a Borstal institution, for example, depends chiefly on the boy&apos;s orgirl&apos;s response to training, not on completion of a prescribed period of detention. Yet it would be difficult to exclude those serving Borstalsentences from such a concession.(/) It would be inappropriate to choose the time of the Coronation to releaseprematurely on the community a number of thieves and other criminals.3. The last occasion on which special remission of sentence was granted wason the accession of King George V, when it ranged from one week for those witha month or less to serve up to 90 days for those serving five years or more. It ledto few expressions of gratitude from those who benefited from it, and grumblingfrom those who did not. No amnesty was granted at the accession or coronationof King Edward VII, King Edward VIII or King George VI, or on the occasion of the Jubilees of Queen Victoria and King George V.4. It is necessary to announce a decision soon, as delay will give rise to falsehopes, and may lead to unrest and trouble in prisons. Our colleagues will wishto know that we intend to follow what is now the established practice and to announce that we do not propose to recommend that any proposal for an amnestyshould be adopted.D.
