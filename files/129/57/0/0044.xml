confidential.(5Z) 444 COPY NO.17TH DECEMBER; 195ZCABINETMICELANDIC FISHERIES dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will remember that in my memorandum C. (52) 357 ofthe 23rd October, I described the origin of the Icelandic fisheries dispute andthe difficulties which would follow from its continuance.    They agreed that themost profitable step  would be to promote direct discussions between the fishinginterests of the two countries;   and I was invited to urge this course upon the icelandic Government.2.        I have since made several attempts to persuade the Icelandic Govern-ment to agree that such discussions should be held  or, alternatively, that, whenthe disputed fishing grounds are sufficiently restocked, the Permanent Commissionto be set up under the 1946 Overfishing Convention should be authorised to consider&apos;to what extent they should be re-opened to trawling.    However, the attitude ofthe Icelandic Government is, first, that their new territorial limits have been drawn in accordance with the principles laid down in December, 1951, by theInternational Court of Justice, in connexion with the Anglo-Norwegian disputeand that in no circumstances will they depart from what they consider to be theirlegal rights unless,successfully challenged before the Court;  and, secondly, thatthey are morally entitled to take this line because of the complete dependence of iceland!s economy on the fishing industry and the urgent necessity for conservingthe stocks of fish in the waters round Iceland.    In spite of this last argument, the icelandic Minister of Fisheries has now admitted that the Icelandic government propose to exclude trawlers permanently from the disputed areas (even when thegrounds have been restocked) and to confine fishing there to inshore Icelandicvessels, whose interests it is their purpose to promote.     Large quantities offish can be caught in the disputed area by these vessels and the British fisher-men believe that fish caught in this way will be loaded on to Icelandic trawlers and sold in Grimsby in competition with the British trawlers whose crews will thus lose a part of their livelihood.3. The ban on landings of Icelandic fish in this country at present depends on a decision by the wholesale fish merchants not to buy fish landed fromIcelandic vessels while the dispute remains unsolved.    This decision was takenin the face of a threat to strike by the Trawler Officers1 Guilds, who are the dominant factor in the dispute on the British side and are above all concerned at the threat to their livelihood referred to above.4.        The Icelandic Government, for their part, have carried out their intention, of which they gave Her Majesty&apos;s Government advance notice, of rais-ing the matter at the meeting of the Council for European Economic Co-operation in Paris on the 13th December, 1952.    In a moderately phrased but
uncompromising statement the Icelandic Minister of Fisheries gave the icelandic case as set out in paragraph 2 above and accused Pier Majesty&apos;sGovernment of violating the spirit of the Convention and of the Code of liberalisation by permitting private interests to frustrate the declaredintentions of those documents.    As I was acting as Chairman, I asked theEconomic Secretary of the Treasury to reply on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    Mr. Maudling pointed out that there was still an open generallicence for the import of Icelandic fish into the United Kingdom and that thedifficulties had been caused by the attitude of the Icelanders themselves8 whohad repeatedly been warned of the probable consequences.    Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarded the dispute as of a technical nature which could moresuita.bly be discussed in the Permanent Overfishing Commission and they would continue their efforts to reach a settlement with Iceland by this or any other appropriate method.5.        The present position is thus one of complete deadlock.     The icelandic government will not take the initiative in offering concessions which would lead to a lifting of the ban because:-(a) they are convinced that the legal rights of the caseare on their side;(b) they have taken up such an uncompromising publicposition that it would be hardly possible for themto do so without loss of face;(c) Her Majesty&apos;s Minister at Reykjavik reports thatall parties in Iceland are strongly opposed to making any concession.This being so, the Icelandic Government are more likely to continue to put pressure on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the removal of the ban,perhaps by means of appeals to the United Nations Organisation (U.N.O.)or to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) or by publiclychallenging Her Majesty&apos;s Government to refer the dispute to the Hague court.    They have already hinted broadly at this before the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E,EBC. ).    It would,however, be extremely difficult for Her Majesty&apos;s Government either to persuade or  tocoerce the British fishing interests concerned to lift the ban;  and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries is in any case reluctant to take such a course,since he considers that those interests have had some justification for theirattitude.6.       A prolongation of the dispute must nevertheless do harm to the realinterests of both countries.    The effects on the Icelandic economy will bemore severe than on the British.    But imports of Icelandic-caught fishnormally account for some 10 per cent of the total fish supplies of thiscountry during the period November - February; and the Ministry of Food isconcerned at the risk that as the result of bad weather or other unfavourablecircumstances, supplies of fish will not be maintained in January and february, 1953.    Moreover, we must expect retaliation against british exports to Iceland.    This has already begun and may become a substantialloss in relation to our total trade with that country.    Apart from thecommercial aspect, it is clearly undesirable that the United Kingdom should find itself engaged in what amounts to a trade war with Iceland, anotherN.A.T.O. power of considerable strategic importance.
!5)7.        I am unable to suggest a practical solution of the dispute which would at present be acceptable to both parties.    In these circumstance s9 Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot any longer avoid taking up a public position in regard to the merits of the dispute.    One possible course would be to refer it by agreementwith Iceland to the International Court.    I should however warn my colleagues that Her Majesty&apos;s Governments chances of securing a favourable judgment are considered slight, since, as the decision in taa Anglo-Norwegian case shows3the Court is hostile to the whole conception of the law of territorial waters as previously understood by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    It is conceivable that theCourt would support the British view that the base-line drawn across Faxa Bayis too extensive;  but it is very likely that it would uphold Iceland&apos;s claim to a four-mile limit as well.    This might not have far-reaching consequences if thefour-mile claim were upheld on historic grounds only, but there is a serious risk that the Court would, go further and uphold the claim on the general groundthat each state has the legal right to fix its own territorial water limits largelyat its own discretion.     This could not fail to encourage increases in territorialwater limits elsewhere.    It would, in particular, be a severe blow to theBritish deep-sea fishing industry if an unfavourable judgment in the dispute with Iceland resulted in similar restrictions being imposed off Greenland andthe Faroe Islands, or if the Soviet Union were moved to denounce the 1930 Anglo-Soviet Fishing Agreement, under which British vessels can fish up to within three miles of the Soviet coast.    Most of our fish, and above all the cheaperqualities, comes from these Northern waters and if such restrictions becomegeneral there, the loss would be very serious.8.        Further considerations are that it is unlikely that the Icelandic Govern-ment would agree to any temporary modification of their fishing restrictions,pending a decision of the Court and, in these circumstances, it would be extremely difficult to persuade the British fishing industry to lift their banimmediately.    At the same time it might be dangerous to refer the dispute to the International Court without some interim arrangement for the removalof the ban.    In the first place it might prejudice the Court against us if theban were not removed p-commanding the submission of the case and the decision of.he Court     Secondly, it might enable the Icelandic Government to bring forwarddamaging counter-claims on the basis of the Anglo-Icelandic Trade Agreementof 1933 and the alleged illegality of the ban.     They might also be able to obtain an order of the Court for the removal of the ban as an interim injunction.9.        A second course open to Her Majesty&apos;s Government is to refrain fromsubmitting the dispute to the International Court and to make a public declara-tion in support of the three-mile limit without prejudice to the question nowunder consideration by the Cabinet (C.C.(52) 74th Conclusions, Minute 5) -whether our own three-mile limit should be measured from low water markor from base-lines drawn from headland to headland.    This declarationcould be accompanied by support of the fishing industry in their stand, but itis open to the objections set out in paragraph 6 as well as to the fact thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government would be in a weak moral position in supportingactions which they had good reason to fear might be held to be illegal by theInternational Court.10.       A third course is for Her Majesty&apos;s Govesrnmant to bring pressure tobear on the fishing industry to lift the ban on grounds of public policy.    Thiswould need most careful handling.    The use of the Governments emergency powers to compel the trawler officers to put to sea would scarcely be feasibleand would be likely to create serious difficulties in the ports.     The pressure would have to be applied in the form of a firm and reasoned appeal on behalf
of Her lvfajesty&apos;s Government to the fishing interests, based both on the national interest and on the evident inability of the industry to achieve its purposesthrough economic pressure.11.       It will be seen, therefore, that there are three alternative courses ofaction open to Her Majesty^ Government:-(a) to refer the dispute to the International Court,   andto try to secure the removal of the ban on landingsof Icelandic fish pending a decision of the Court.This is open to the objections set out in paras. and 8;(b) to allow the dispute to continue but to make a public declaration in support of the three-mile limit andand of the stand taken by our fishing industry.This is open to the objections set out in paras. and 9 and is likely to involve difficulties in theHouse of Commons;(c)     to make a public declaration as under (b) but to accompany it with the exercise of pressure on the fishing industry to lift the ban on Icelandic landingsimmediately.    This would not be easy to achieve.A.E.Foreign Office, 8.W.I.17TH DECEMBER, 1952.
