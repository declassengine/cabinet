SAUDI ARABIAN FRONTIER dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs my colleagues will recall that I informed them in my memorandum C,(52) 383 of the 4th November that I intended tomake.an offer to King Ibn Saud to settle our frontier dispute by arbitration.    This offer was conditional on my receiving theconsent of the Sultan of Muscat to this course.2. The Sultan has now given his consent, albeit reluctantly,subject to his subsequent agreement to the terms of reference and the personalities of the arbitrators.    I have therefore decided to proceed with the offer.3. If Ibn Saud accepts the offer in principle, it will still benecessary to get mutual agreement on the arbitrators1 terms ofreference and on the personalities to be appointed.    This maywell be difficult.A.E.COPY NO,4tForeign Office, S. W. 1.21ST NOVEMBER, 1952.secret.(52) 41721ST NOVEMBER, 1952CABINET
