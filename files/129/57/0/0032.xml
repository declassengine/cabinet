Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 4329th December, 1952CABINETTOY COSHES AND OFFENSIVE WEAPONSMemorandum by the Home SecretaryThere has been much criticism in Parliament and in the Press about the saleof toy coshes, partly on the ground that the possession of such toys is likely to havea bad effect on the minds of children and partly on the ground that, if filled withlead or sand, they could be used as weapons by criminals. It has been suggested,for these reasons, that legislation should be introduced making it an offence to sellsuch toys.2. Last month the National Chamber of Trade issued a statement urgingshopkeepers to withhold from sale toy models of lethal weapons, and the NationalChamber of Toy Retailers, in a rather fuller statement given in the appendix, askedretailers to withdraw from sale toy coshes, knuckledusters and the like. the inquiries I have made from the police in different parts of the country show thatthese appeals have had a good effect, and that at any rate in the reputable shopsthe articles in question have been withdrawn from sale. Although it may still bepossible to buy these articles in some of the smaller shops, it is clear that the mischiefhas much diminished and that, with the falling off of sales, the manufacturers arehardly likely to make these articles in future in any large numbers. My own view is that this evil, which is already diminishing, could be reduced to negligible pro-portions if a statement were made in Parliament giving the Governments com-mendation to the action which the trade has taken.3. I have been considering what form legislation could take if it were feltthat it would be right to deal with this problem by a Bill,.and it seems to me thatit would be extraordinarily difficult to devise any definition of undesirable toyswhich would not prohibit the sale of toys which have long been accepted asunobjectionable and which, I am sure, we have all used in our time. For instance,a prohibition on the sale of toys which were imitations of offensive weapons would apply to toy police truncheons, water-pistols, cap-pistols and bows and arrows;and even a ban on the sale of imitations of offensive weapons for which there wasno ordinary legitimate use would apply to such toys as tomahawks. It would notbe possible to use in a statute the term &quot; cosh.&quot; This is a slang word which Iunderstand originally meant a policeman&apos;s truncheon, but is now used by thePress as a generic term coyering any instrument (other than a firearm) used by a criminal who attacks another citizen. In a case recently reported in the Press asbeing an attack by a &quot; cosh,&quot; the weapon used was a tennis racket.4. It seems to me that in a matter of this kind the prime responsibility rests with the parents, and that the State should interfere by proposing the creation of anew criminal offence only if there is clear evidence of a serious mischief whichcannot otherwise be dealt with. My information, however, is that the sale of theseundesirable toys has never been very large and that in many areas they have nowbeen withdrawn from sale as the result of the action taken by the trade itself to putits own house in order.5. The police have no evidence that any of these toy coshes have been con-verted for use as offensive weapons by actual criminals. There can, however, beno doubt that a good many criminals go about equipped with offensive weapons43347
and use them in the commission of crime. These weapons may have been purchasedat the shops (for instance, stilettos or knuckledusters); they may be home-made(for instance, a wooden bludgeon may have had a razor-blade inserted in it); or theymay be articles which are in ordinary legitimate use (for example, bicycle chainsor bottles). It will be seen that prohibition of the sale in shops of such articleswould not afford a practical solution, partly because many of these articles can behome-made, and partly because others have legitimate uses. Again, a prohibitionof the sale of, say, stilettos to young children, as has been proposed in some quarters,would be difficult to enforce and would be inconsistent with the traditional practiceof providing sheath knives as part of the uniform worn by boy scouts.6. I think, however, that there is a case for legislation which would make itan offence to be found in possession of an offensive weapon, without lawful reason,in a public place or a place to which the public have access. (It is already an offence under section 4 of the Public Order Act, 1936, to be present at a public meeting or at a public procession when in possession of an offensive weapon otherwise than inpursuance of any lawful authority.) I do not think that it would be right to givethe police special powers of arrest, unless they did not know the individual &apos;s addressand had reason for thinking that he might abscond, or special powers of search;but the existence of such a provision would have a considerable effect in terroremif criminally minded persons knew that the mere possession of an offensive weapon,if they were picked up by the police for example for some other offence, would of itself be an offence and would be likely to result in substantial punishment. i recognise that objection might be raised in Parliament to a proposal which would put the onus of proof on to the accused, and not on to the prosecution; but I thinkthat the proposal could be justified in the present state of crime.7.   I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree:  (i) that we should not introduce a Bill to prohibit the sale of toy coshes, butthat I should make a statement in Parliament commending the appealalready made to retailers by the relevant trade associations, and possiblyextending the appeal to manufacturers and wholesalers.(ii) that I should be authorised to have prepared a Bill making it an offence tobe found in possession without lawful reason of an offensive weaponin a public place or a place to which the public have access, and thatI should be authorised to state in Parliament that the possibility of introducing such legislation is being examined,(ii) that I be authorised to discuss the proposal with Mr. Chuter Ede in viewof an earlier informal discussion between the Prime Minister andMr. Attlee.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W.1,9th December, 1952.
APPENDIXStatement issued by the National Association of Toy Retailers on13th November, 1952&quot; In view of the great anxiety at present existing in the public mind regardingthe sale of certain articles (rubber coshes and similar items), the National Associa-tion of Toy Retailers feels it proper to make clear its views and to give the guidance and leadership that it should upon this matter.In the first place, the Association wishes to emphasise that in its considered opinion, coshes, knuckledusters and the like are quite unsuitable as toys, and thatit is certain that from every point of view that the sale of such objects is undesirable.The Association therefore advises retailers, whether members of the Association ornot, to withdraw these and similar articles from sale forthwith.The Association must again make it clear, however, that it cannot agree thatthe demand raised in certain quarters for the banning of any and every form ofwhat might be termed &apos; offensive weapons &apos; even bows and arrows is in any wayjustified.The Association is confident that although it is admittedly very hard to definethese things in legalistic, hard and fast terms, yet in practice it will be simple enoughto draw the line between the clearly undesirable toy, such as the rubber cosh, andthe clearly innocent bow and arrow, water pistol, cap pistol, or what have you.As to the demand for legislation, the Association does not believe that this is either practicable (in view of the difficulties of definition which would inevitablyarise) or desirable. This is surely a matter which can, should and must be left tothe good sense of the public and of the Trade.In conclusion, the Association would again bring to the urgent attention of toytraders throughout the country, its strong conviction that that class of so-calledtoys to which exception is properly being taken, are quite unsuitable as children&apos;splaythings, and ought not to be stocked or sold in the future.&quot;
