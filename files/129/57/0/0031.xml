This Will be made up as to  220 millions by du^ debt:       to E.P.U. and as to  130 millions by the gold we have paid iftto E^PTJi,1both of which we must recover before we get into balance&apos;.       &quot;&quot;v&apos; (&apos;v&apos;(b) If our very rough expectation is fulfilled in the first half of next ye&amp;rv&amp;ndwe earn a surplus of  100 millions in E.P.U., then our cumulative deficitwill be down to about  250. mUljons, our debt to the Union down to 180 millions and the gold we still have to recover down to  70 millions.Moreover, if we assume that we earn a further  100 millions of surplus,i.e.,  200 millions in all, from the end of this year, we should even then have acumulative deficit of  150 millions, of which  120 millions would be debt to theUnion, and  30 millions would be gold which we should still have to recover.In considering any pressures on us to liberalise our trade with Europe, wemust bear in mind that we are still  350&apos; millions away from balance with E.P.U.&quot;      : &quot;R. A. B.Tnemuxy ChamhevSrS.W.h8th December, 13521.
THE E.P.U. position the United Kingdom surplus with the E.P.U. in November amounted to 39 millions. As E.P.U. balances in one month are settled in the following month,the United Kingdom position vis-a-vis E.P.U. down to the end of December cannow be stated. This is shown in Table 1, which also gives a rough forecast of thecourse of the E.P.U. balance in the first half of next year. It will be seen that thetotal surplus of  87 millions in the fourth quarter will reduce the cumulative deficitfrom  437 millions at the end of September to  350 millions at the end of December.The division of the cumulative deficit between credit drawn by a debtor with a monthly deficit (or repaid by a debtor with a monthly surplus) and the corres-ponding gold payments are shown in columns 3 and 4.Table 1Composition of date Cumulative       cumulative Changedeficit deficit CreditCredit     Gold        repaid(1) (2) (3)        (4) (5)  million gold(6)Position in quota(7)f30th June, 1952     ...       392 227       164Actual   i 30th September, 1952       437 227       209[31st December, 1952       350 219       1318 repaid45   paid)   Beyond 1uota78 earned     5th tranche (70 : 30)Estimate/31st March, 1953\30th June, 1953293245200176936919 repaid 38 earned \ ... t,,,,,.i... t*n . cm24 repaid     24 earned/  4th tranche (50 : 50)2. The future course of balances withE.P.U. must necessarily be subject toa good deal,of uncertainty. The position at any stage in the debtors tranchesis shown in Table 2 (the creditors tranches are slightly different but these are unlikely to be of much interest to this country for &quot;some time). In this table theposition of each tranche is shown in columns 2 and 3. The position of thepayments are shown in column 4. ,&apos;   &apos;      &apos; Table 2.:Tranche(1)5th   .    &apos; ...4th&apos;3rd: v    ...2nd1st-1st half2nd halfComposition of eachUnited Kingdom trancheCredit Gold mn.

Two main conclusions emerge from this table, viz:(i) If things went as well as indicated in the estimates for the first half of nextyear, the United Kingdom would still owe E.P.U.  176 millions on30th June. Even at the transition from the third to the second tranche a position which could not possibly be reached for a considerable timeafterwards, the United Kingdom would still owe E.P.U.  121 millions.(ii) If things Went as well as this, the United Kingdom would nevertheless bein a position in which it would have to pay 30 per cent, or 40 per cent,gold for any deficits. This is not a prospect which can be lightlycontemplated.4. There is no reason to suppose that repayment of gold to the United King-dom on the scale indicated would endanger the solvency of the Union. The arrange-ments made for the extension of E.P.U. last summer were calculated to provide adequate cover for any temporary excess of out-payments over in-payments ofgold. At the same time, it must be recognised that the point may be reached whenindividual countries will feel obliged to take measures, e.g., import restrictions, toavoid having to pay gold into the Union.
