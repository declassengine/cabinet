THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT /Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1952^| SECRET Copy No.   2 3 ^|^fl     I (52) 449i9r/z December, 1952RECRUITMENT FOR BRIGADE OF GURKHAS IN MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsNegotiations with India and Nepal about arrangements for the continuedrecruitment of Gurkhas for the British Army are at a critical stage.Background2.  The Brigade of Gurkhas in the British Army was created after the transferof power in India. Previously Gurkhas had served in the Indian Army, but since1947 Gurkha Battalions have formed part of both the Indian and the British Armies.There are at present 8 Gurkha Battalions serving in Malaya out of the total Garrison^^fl of 23 Battalions.^^fl 3.  The maintenance of our Gurkha Battalions depends first on the willingnessof the Government of Nepal to allow the men to be recruited for service with us,and, secondly, on the willingness of the Government of India to allow them totravel across India to reach the coast. The traditional attitude of the IndianCongress Party has always been that our employment of Gurkhas in the IndianArmy amounted to the hiring of mercenaries to repress the progress of the peoplesof India and other Asian countries towards freedom, and in 1947 Mr. Nehru wasBVVj very reluctant to agree that we should have the necessary facilities for our Gurkharecruits to travel across India. He was, however, eventually persuaded to agree,thanks largely to discussions with Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery inJune 1947, when the then Chief of the Imperial General Staff was passing throughDelhi. Discussions were thereafter held between representatives of the Indian,Nepalese and United Kingdom Governments and an agreement was signed inKatmandu in November 1947, giving us the right to recruit Gurkhas and the rightof transit across India. This agreement contained no date of termination and noprovision for denunciation or review. ^^^J4. Our main administrative requirements are a Transit Camp at Calcutta ft^^Hand depots in or near Nepal at which the processes of selection and enlistment ofrecruits can be carried out. In 1947 the Government of Nepal were unwilling to ft^^Hagree to our establishing such depots in Nepal and the Indian Government agreed &amp;^^Hthat we could for the time being share with them the existing Indian Army Gurkhadepots in India pending the establishment of separate depots for British Army B^^HGurkhas.  Subsequently, two separate British Army Gurkha depots in Northern ^^^HIndia were established close to the Nepalese border, and we had hoped that, ^^^Halthough their siting in India was not covered by the terms of the tripartite agree- ft^^Hment, we would be able to remain in them on a long-term basis. ft^^HRecent A pproach from India ^^^H5. Last summer, however, strong pressure was brought to bear on the Indian ^^^HGovernment by all Opposition groups in the Indian Parliament to put an end to ^^^Hour recruitment of Gurkhas on Indian soil. As a result of this pressure-to which JL the Congress Party is particularly susceptible in view of its own traditional attitude ^^^H-the Indian Government sent an Aide-Memoire, of which a copy is attached, to the ^^^HUnited Kingdom and Nepalese Governments stating that they wished to terminate ^^^H43414
was precarious and fewer candidates would offer themselves for commissions inP^H Gurkha regiments. It would be impossible for us to devote to building of depotsat Nepal and of married quarters in Far East the money, effort and materialsrequired for the construction of adequate accommodation. Recruiting for GurkhaP^H Regiments would therefore be seriously impaired and grave damage would be done B^Hto morale of serving Gurkha troops. Our military advice is that Brigade of Gurkhaswould start to disintegrate quite soon after it became known that there was a fixedterm to our agreement with Nepal.   Proposal that arrangement should be of B^Hindefinite continuance subject to review at one years&apos; notice (paragraph 2 (2) of yourP^H telegram No. 1467) would not offer any more satisfactory prospect. 1 B^H3. For your own information, and not for communication to Indian authori-P^H                 ties at this stage, Chief of Imperial General Staff has stated that failing the achieve- B^Hment of above minimum requirement he can see no alternative to the disbandmentof our Gurkha Forces with all the repercussions in Malaya and Nepal which thatwould entail.4. We assume that objectionable features in Nepalese reply were insertedP^H at Indian instance and that the Nepalese will again seek Indian advice if we ask B^Hthem to revise their proposals.  To make any progress, therefore, we must carryP^H Nehru with us and be assured that he agrees that our counter-proposals are I B^Hreasonable and that he will be ready to advise the Nepalese to accept them.^^fl 5.  Please see Nehru as soon as possible and explain to him why the Nepalese 1proposals are impracticable. You should emphasise that we. have given carefulconsideration to the nature of the alternative arrangements we would wish toP^H suggest to the Nepalese and have reached conclusion described in paragraph 2 above. I B^H6. In the light of paragraph 3 above you will appreciate that it is of greatP^H importance that every possible effort should be made to secure our requirements. I B^HIf Nehru&apos;s reply is not satisfactory you must report back for further instructions.7. Following are further points which we would wish you to have in mind, | ^^flbut you have complete discretion as to how best to handle them in your approachH to Nehru -V^H &apos; (a) We wish it to be clear to Nehru that we need to be assured that he and we V^H, are in agreement before we put alternative proposals to the Nepaleseauthorities. If Nehru should adopt attitude that this is essentiallymatter for United Kingdom and Nepal you could mention that weare fully aware of great Indian influence in Nepal and that it is onlyrealistic to suppose that the Nepalese authorities will be most reluctantto adopt any proposals we may make to them unless they are satisfiedthat we and Nehru are in accord.P^H (b) Any impairment of Gurkha Brigade&apos;s efficiency will seriously hamper 1 ^^flcampaign against insurgents in Malaya, thus retarding Malayan con-stitutional progress (we understand from Garner&apos;s record of conversationP^H with Tyabji on 20th November that Indians are favourably impressed I B^Hby progress being made in Malaya).(c) Interference with recruitment of Gurkhas for British Army would haveP^H serious repercussions in Nepal, both political and economic, which in 1 B^Hthe long run India herself might well have difficulty in handling.\d) Agreement on these arrangements would facilitate the speedy relinquish-P^H ment by us of recruiting facilities in India.
