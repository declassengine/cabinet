confidential.(52)44717TH DECEMBER, 1952CABINETICELANDIC FISHERIES DISPUTENote by the Prime minister on balance it looks as though Her Majestyfs Government will haveto follow the course suggested in paragraph 11(a) of the Cabinet paper c.(52) 444, i. e. to refer the dispute to the International Court of justice and to try to secure the removal of the ban on landings of Icelandic fishpending a decision of the Court.2.      It will not be easy to persuade the British fishing industry to agreeto this.    On my instructions the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries havemade informal enquiries of the leaders of the trawler owners and skipperswith the following result.3.      The leaders of the trawler owners in Hull and Grimsby feel that thethree sections of the industry (i. e. including wholesalers) would have to meet together to decide on a common attitude to any such request from the Govern&quot;ment.    Subject to that, they believe that the body of owners would accept the reference of the dispute to the Hague Court and agree to make their facilitiesagain available to Icelandic trawlers, but only provided Iceland agreed to go back to the old limits while the Hague Court was deciding the dispute.The leaders of the skippers at Grimsby are of the same feeling andwould not rescind their decision to strike unless Iceland agreed to return tothe old limits;   it has not been possible in the short time available to obtain a considered expression of opinion from the Hull skippers.     If the worstcomes to the worst and the British trawlers&apos; skippers, etc. , will not lift theban pending the proceedings of the International Court unless the Icelandrestrictions are also in abeyance, this would be a disadvantage to us beforethe Court.    But its proceedings may well last a year, and Iceland would notrelish a year&apos;s ban.It is very remarkable that in the last two months, in spite of the ban,we have got normal supplies of fish;  though not perhaps of the best quality,,All these considerations must be weighed and balanced.W.S.C.10     Downing Street, S.W.I.COPY NO.17TH DECEMBER, 1952.
