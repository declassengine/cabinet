THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HER BRITANNIC  MA.!ESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1952SECRET Copy No. 7 5C. (52) 41217th November, 1952CABINETREPORT ON EXPORT OF ARMSMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI was invited (C.C. (52) 79th Conclusions, Minute 6) to consider, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, the problem of the right balance in the long termbetween exports of defence equipment and other engineering exports.2. This problem has become accentuated by the cut in the defence pro-gramme. It has two aspects (a) the short term and (b) the long term; I was asked to report on the long term, but it has been necessary to consider the short-term aspects of this matter to some extent since they lead inevitably to the longer-term considerations. I should add that this report is the outcome of discussions between officials of my Department, the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence, theMinistry of Supply and the Admiralty.3. In considering this problem it is necessary to have in mind that in presentcircumstances, there are advantages in the export of defence equipment, viz.:  (a) It enables specialised industrial war potential to be maintained at a higher level than would otherwise be possible.ib) It can secure early and substantial returns of foreign currency at a very high conversion value in terms of material used.ic) It mitigates serious waste of resources (i.e., waste of capacity built up,waste of work in progress and waste by frictional unemployment)consequent on reductions in the defence programme.id) It helps to build up the defences of the free world.   In particular, muchof the defence equipment is for the re-equipping of Commonwealthforces and the forces of allied countries and is therefore of considerablestrategic and diplomatic importance.ie) We need a rapid expansion in our exports if we are to achieve our balanceof payments objective. With buyers&apos; markets developing for many other types of goods we ought to make full use of our capacity to exportarms for which we can get full and early payment.4. It can be claimed that experience shows that the export of many types of military equipment is far from being of a peculiarly speculative nature and can,in fact, be good long-term business. On the air side in particular technical progress is so rapid that any air force which is to have any military value at all must re-equipat fairly frequent intervals. The export of military equipment is thus far from being a once for all transaction.5. There is, however, a danger that resources may be appropriated for theproduction of arms for export which could be more usefully diverted to betterlong-term propositions, e.g., building up production of capital goods for export.I am satisfied that our prospects in this direction are being jeopardised by out failure to offer delivery dates which compare favourably with those of competitorsin other countries. But this does not necessarily mean that there is any certainty that resources released from the production of defence equipment for export would,43224
in fact, be switched directly or indirectly to increase other engineering exports. Theproportion of our engineering production exported as defence equipment in thefirst six months of this year was not more than 2 per cent.; although some increaseseems possible, e.g:, if we are successful in securing more off-shore purchases, thereis room for a considerable increase without causing reason to believe that the long-term future of our engineering civil exports would be seriously affected. . A. clashmay arise on the best use of particular capacity, but this will fall to be consideredunder the procedure which was approved in principle by the Economic PolicyCommittee (E.A. (52) 28th Meeting, Conclusion 2) and now being worked out.6. There are, I consider, adequate safeguards against our devoting a disproportionately-disproportionately high amount of scarce resources to arms exports. The safeguardsare: -(i) We are dealing with capacity for arms production already built up and no fresh capital investment at Government expense is contemplated forthe production of arms for export.  If it were, it would be the subjectof special consideration by the Supply Departments, the Treasury, the-  Board of Trade and other Departments interested.(ii) The Ministry of Supply aim to place on the manufacturer the risk of continued production for export. This would ensure that it wasgoverned by normal commercial considerations which, in the case ofarms, usually demand prior firm orders whose acceptance has beenapproved.(hi) So far as any question arose of Government underwriting production foruncertain or speculative export orders, each case would be subject to close Treasury scrutiny and approval.(iv) In the particular case of tanks, a policy submission has been made to ministers by the Minister of Supply.(v) In the particular case of aircraft, the Ministry of Supply is fully alive tothe need for building up the production of promising types of civil aircraft, such as the Comet, and would bring to the consideration ofMinisters any circumstances in which production of military aircraft for export appeared likely to interfere with this objective.(vi) Generally, the Arms Export Policy Committee will keep the position underreview in the light of periodic reports from the Supply Departments.7. With these safeguards, I suggest that it is unnecessary to attempt to definein any detail a specific balance between production for export of arms and otherengineering products./P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.J.17 th November, 1952.
