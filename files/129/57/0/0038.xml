Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1952Copy No.CABINETREVISION OF WIDOWS&apos; PENSIONS SCHEME FOR THE forces memorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 18th November the Cabinet (C.C. (52) 98th Conclusions,Minute 2) invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself to review the proposals which I made in my paper (C. (52) 410) in the light of the views expressed .by the Cabinet.2. This we have done. Subject to certain undertakings the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, whilst still of opinion that it would be better if any future improve-ments could be on a contributory basis, has, in all the circumstances, agreed that: -(a) Service widows&apos; pensions should remain on a non-contributory basis;(b) the scheme should in future be extended to cover the very long service(i.e., 22 years or over) other rank;(c) the rates should be those proposed in my paper;(d) the means test should be abolished;(e) as a very exceptional concession the pensions currently in payment shouldbe raised to the new rates.3. We have also satisfactorily discussed certain other details with which I need not trouble my colleagues.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed me that before he couldrecommend to the Cabinet the acceptance of the applications of the new rates to existing widows, he would require a firm assurance on two points:  (a) that I and the Service Ministers would continue to resist any measure of retrospection in respect of retired pay for officers and other ranks wholeft the Services before 1st September, 1950;(b) that we would also regard the improved rates under 2 (c) above as a final settlement, notwithstanding the claim of the Officers&apos; Pensions Societythat the rates for &quot; ordinary &quot; widows should be raised to the &quot; attri-attributable &quot; level.5. As regards the assurance at (a) I informed the Chancellor of the exchequer that I and my Service colleagues had no intention of giving way to the claim thatthe improved retired pay and pensions codes of 1950 should be applied to thosewho retired before that date. I felt, however, bound to draw his attention to the pressure both in Parliament and in the press which was developing on this issue.This is dealt with in my paper C. C52) 437.6. As regards the assurance at (b) I informed the Chancellor of the exchequer that I and my Service colleagues regarded the improved rates as closing thepresent chapter of our discussions about the matter of these pensions. Weexplained that we could not say that all these pensions questions were now finally settled for years ahead, and in any case we could not bind our successors in office.confidential. (52) 43811th December, 195243362
But within these limits we were prepared to give the desired assurance under (b)and in particular in relation to the claim of the Officers&apos; Pensions Society that the;&apos; ordinary &quot; pension rates should be raised to the &quot; attributable &quot; level.7. I seek the authority of the Cabinet to. announce in Parliament next week the improvements referred to in paragraph 2 above.Ministry of Defence, S.W: 1,11th December, 1952.
