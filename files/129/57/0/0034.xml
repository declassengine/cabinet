Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952SECRETC. (52) 43410th December, 1952CABINETEUROPEAN DEFENCE COMMUNITY AND ALTERNATIVE PLANSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecent developments in France and Western Germany show that there is stillstrong opposition to the ratification of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)Treaty and Bonn Conventions. The difficulties in Bonn are mainly constitutional.They centre upon whether certain articles conflict with the Basic Law, drafted when there was no question of German rearmament. If so, a two-thirds majority of the&apos; Bundestag would be required, whereas Dr. Adenauer can only rely upon the simple majority (about 220-165) which has just passed the second reading. All this is entirely dependent upon the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court and thereis little, if anything, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government can do to help. In Paris thedifficulties are more fundamental and the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the United States Government may be important in overcoming them.2. I have been considering what our policy should be, and my colleagues maylike to see the attached memorandum. Part I considers whether there is any further action that Her Majesty&apos;s Government could take to improve the prospects of ratification. Part II suggests an alternative plan to secure a German contributionto the defence of Western Europe to be put forward only if the E.D.C. plan fails.It is on very general lines and will require further study.3. The recommendations of Part I, with which the Chiefs of Staff are in agree-ment, are:  (a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to give their full support to&apos; the plan for establishing a European Defence Community and should do all in their power to encourage early ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty,as the quickest method of securing a German contribution to defence and the one which still seems politically the most feasible for all con-cerned. We should actively discourage any suggestion that alternativeplans might be considered.(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should, if necessary, reaffirm that this countrycannot join the community nor merge any part of its forces in theCommunity. Her Majesty&apos;s Government should also refrain from entering into any commitment to maintain any fixed quantity of british forces on the Continent for a specified number of years.(c) Her Majesty&apos;s Government may, however, be able to ease the French pathby adopting at the appropriate moment the courses outlined in para-graph 7 of the Memorandum. These are designed to assure the membersof the E.D.C. of our support in peace as effectively as the UnitedKingdom-E.D.C. Treaty assures them of our aid in war.I hope my colleagues will approve these recommendations and will in their public statements express confidence that the Bonn and Paris Agreements will be ratified.4. Part II of the Memorandum makes the following recommendations:  (a) If-perhaps the most likely case the French Assembly ratifies the E.D.C.Treaty subject to conditions which would not materially alter its pro-visions, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should firmly maintain their present policy so long as there is a prospect of a successful outcome of thefurther negotiations which must then take place between the E.D.C.countries.Copy No.     /
(b) If the French Assembly ratifies the Treaty subject to conditions whichwould involve its complete re-negotiation or indefinite delay, or if itrejects the Treaty, Her Majesty&apos;s Government, after prior consultationwith the United States Government, should put forward a plan for aGerman contribution to Western defence through the North atlantic treaty Organisation; the essence of this plan would be accession byGermany to the North Atlantic Treaty, the extension of the duration of the North Atlantic Treaty, and development of the N.A.T.O. structureso as to provide a measure of control over German rearmament.(c) If the federal movement in Europe collapses as a consequence of the failureof the E.D.C. plan, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should take the initiative in developing the existing organisations for intergovernmental co-opera-tion in Europe.The Chiefs of Staff are studying the military implications of Germany&apos;s admission to N.A.T.O.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,10 th December, 1952.ANNEXEuropean Defence Community and Alternative PlansPart I. Policy towards the European Defence CommunityNeed for a German Contribution to DefenceThere can be no question of going back on the decision that an early german contribution to defence is necessary for the security of the West. The quickestmethod of obtaining this in present circumstances and the one which still seemspolitically the most feasible for all concerned is by means of the European defence community. We have already done our best to ensure the success of the E.D.C.We cannot undertake further commitments unless these are shared by the U-S.A.Our best and safest contribution can be made in the N.A.T.O. framework and weshould do nothing which might have the effect of diminishing United States interestin N.A.T.O.Overcoming Difficulties in Germany and above all in France2. Although there are still difficulties in Germany the main opposition tothe E.D.C. lies in France, the country which gave birth to the scheme. It will notnecessarily be best overcome by further major concessions, which would in effectreopen the whole difficult negotiation of the Bonn and Paris Agreements. Indeed,it might well prove that the very suggestion that the United Kingdom was preparedto consider any fundamental change in its position would be seized upon as a furtherexcuse for prolonged discussion and delay. It might also result in a renewal of american pressure upon us and put us back in the very awkward position of ayear ago from which our policies, culminating in the Eden proposals, have sohappily rescued us. Probably the best hope of French ratification lies in a com-bination of (a) strong United States pressure, coupled with (b) practical aid in Indo-China and North Africa and perhaps N.A.T.O. and (c) blandishments from the newUnited States Administration. These possibilities are discussed in Part II, para-graph 8. While both will be needed, the American stick may well prove moreefficacious than the carrot. In other words, the French are more likely to take thehurdle of the E.D.C. when they are really faced with the need for a decision and see that the available alternatives are even less attractive. We should do all inour power to dissuade the French from putting off that decision, thereby delayingGerman rearmament. We should therefore join with the Americans in pressing for early ratification of the Agreements.3. In order to promote a more robust attitude in France and incidentallyto strengthen the position of the German Federal Government, which has had some
difficulty in persuading the Bundestag to face up to its responsibilities before christmas, we should therefore continue to use every opportunity in public and in private to express our confidence that the Bonn and Paris Agreements will be ratified. The Secretary of State&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on 6th November and the Prime Ministers Guildhall speech on 10th November havealready had a very good effect. The moral should be driven home in furtherMinisterial statements and in our general publicity. Where suitable opportunitiesarise, we should continue to bring home to the French that without the E.D.C.we can see no means of securing a German contribution to defence short of Germanmembership of N.A.T.O. Equally, we must continually re-emphasise that theneutralisation of Germany would be totally unacceptable and that, while the build-up of German forces on our side is being delayed, a strong but hostile german army already exists and is growing steadily in Eastern Germany.4. Subject, however, to the above overriding considerations there are certainsteps which Her Majesty&apos;s Government could take to ease the French path. Theseare discussed below.Our Inability to Join the E.D.C. or to Accept a Permanent Commitment5. It is not in our interest to join the E.D.C. We have consistently refusedto do so for political and military reasons and now our economic position make sit impossible for us to undertake a permanent and firm commitment of forces inEurope. Nor would the idea, once its real implications were understood, be accept-able politically either to the British public or to the Commonwealth. Our refusal to join the E.D.C. in no way implies our intention to withdraw from our presentcontinental commitments. We shall continue to contribute to the defence of western Europe and the size of our contribution will be unaffected whether we join the E.D.C. or remain outside.6. It might be argued that, if it is militarily so important to secure the ratifica-tion of the E.D.C. Treaty, we should be prepared to commit permanently to theEuropean theatre the minimum force necessary and to link our air defences inparticular with those of the E.D.C. But in practice these concessions would be bothdangerous and difficult for us, whilst the maximum we could safely do would notbe likely in the long run to satisfy the needs of the E.D.C. countries. We shouldhave taken the first step on a slippery slope, to which there might be no end. Theright policy remains to make our contribution to European defence in the N.A.T.O.framework. Any commitment of ground or air forces to the E.D.C. would resultin a loss of flexibility in our plans for defence both militarily and economically.Lines of Action Recommended for Strengthening United Kingdom Links with theE.D.C.7. We should, however, examine further ways of showing our determination to establish close association with the E.D.C. The following lines of action are open to us:  id) We could press on with the military talks about collaboration between our forces and those of the E.D.C., which were initiated by Lord Alexander^visit to Paris last May. The Chiefs of Staff are now examining proposals submitted on a personal basis to Air Vice-Marshal Merer by GeneralStehlin, French Air Force Representative with the E.D.C. steering committee and member of M. Pleven&apos;s staff. It is in our own interestto secure an efficient practical relationship, and we have already acceptedthe idea that within the N.A.T.O. framework some E.D.C. forces shouldbe under our command and some of our forces under E.D.C. command,provided those forces are given logistic support through their own linesof commiunication. The physical juxtaposition of our forces and theEuropean defence forces in Germany will in any case necessitate arrange-ments of this kind.(b) We could express our willingness to attend meetings of the Council ofMinisters of the E.D.C. when invited. This would be in accordance withthe Eden proposals. It would enable us to ensure the smooth workingof any arrangements entered into under (a). At the same time, it wouldgive us an additional chance of keeping an eye on the state of german rearmament and on the development of Franco-German relations. Wehave in fact already offered M. Schuman to do this, although it seemsfrom Paris telegram No. 445 Saving that M. Pleven is not aware of it.
(c) Similarly, we could send observers to the E.D.C. Assembly.(d) We could appoint a delegation to the Board of Commissioners following the precedent of our Delegation to the High Authority of the european coal and Steel Community, for the same reasons as in (b). although we would not expect our representatives to attend meetings of the Board,a joint committee might be set up on the lines of the one now established at Luxembourg.Conclusions of Part I8. Part II of this memorandum discusses the alternative plans which might beput forward if all hope of ratification of the present E.D.C. plan has to be abandoned. The conclusions of Part I are that we cannot accept membership of theE.D.C., that we have already given such concrete support as we can through theU.K./E.D.C. Treaty, the Tripartite Declaration and our European policy as awhole, and that the most that we can now offer in addition are the proposals in theprevious paragraph. It will be seen that they do not involve any real sacrifices onour part. Indeed, they would all bring us positive benefit. We should press on with the military talks mentioned in (a). The other proposals should not, however,be pursued before ratification of the agreements by the Federal GermanGovernment. Thereafter, we could produce them either as our answer to any official approach by the French Government to secure further concessions from us,or, in the absence of such an approach, at the moment best calculated to help Frenchratification.Part 11. Alternative Plans if the E.D.C. FailsPossible Causes of FailureThe direct cause of a failure of the E.D.C. plan is likely to be an adversedecision by the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany or the rejection of theTreaty by the French Assembly. In the former case we should know where west and before the end of 1952 and it is unlikely that this particular difficulty couldbe overcome until the Federal elections next summer; the necessary action on thepart of the three occupying powers is being considered separately in consultationwith Sir I. Kirkpatrick. In the later case, we should be obliged to plan a german contribution to defence in another form.Conditional French Ratification2. There is a distinct possibility that the French Assembly, not wishing to take full responsibility for the breakdown of the movement towards supranationalism,might approve the Treaty subject to conditions which will make further negotiationsnecessary.   Such conditions may involve:  (a) Further help in Indo-China. This would be mainly a matter for theUnited States.(b) Amendment of the Treaty without materially altering its provisions. Although in this event we should not be directly involved, we woulddeplore the delay which would necessarily result. Claims for amend-ment by one party maybe expected to provoke counter-claims from other parties, and there is the further danger that the Bonn conventions wouldalso need to be amended in order to be consistent with the revised E.D.C.Treaty. We and the Americans should do what we could to speed upthe negotiations and impress upon the parties, notably the French, theneed for quick decisions. In case the prospect of successful revisionswere to fade, we should have an alternative plan ready to produce.(c) Linking the E.D.C. with the European Political Authority (E.P.A.). Thiswould only raise a problem if the Assembly were to make the entry into force of the E.D.C. Treaty dependent upon the prior or simultaneousestablishment of the E.P.A. Such a condition would mean indefinitedelay in the entry into force of the E.D.C. Treaty. It is true that thead hoc Assembly is due to submit by .10th March its report on its studyabout the E.P.A., but the six Governments will then have to discuss
this report, negotiate and sign a Treaty establishing the E.P.A. and submit it for parliamentary ratification. This process, on the mostoptimistic forecast, will take many months. If therefore the FrenchAssembly were to make such a condition it would probably be necessaryfor Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government toindicate immediately to the French Government that they could not accept this indefinite delay in obtaining a German defence contribution.Thus, here again, we should have an alternative plan ready to produce.(d) United Kingdom participation in the E.D.C. in its present form. This wecould only reject for reasons given above and, if this were to sound the death knell of the present plan, we should again be in a position ,to propose an alternative.(e) Revision of the Treaty so as to provide for a looser defence communitywhich the United Kingdom could enter as a full member. There are signs that this course is gaining support in some French political circles.It has been mentioned recently by the French Minister in London; ithas been canvassed by General Bethouart in Figaro; and it wouldprobably appeal to M. Mollet and his supporters. But in fact it is anillusion or even a device for further delay. Either membership of theCommunity will involve surrender of national control over British forces and their commitment on the Continent in fixed numbers for a fixed period this we cannot undertake for the reasons given above or theobligations would be no greater than those of N.A.T.O. In that case it would be far better to adopt a N.A.T.O. solution which has the immense advantage of bringing in the United States of America as well.Nor it is likely that the present coalition Government in Germany would accept such a compromise because they would be losing the prospectof European federation without gaining full equality and membership of N.A.T.O. The German Socialists would oppose it on the samegrounds as they oppose the E.D.C.No Half-way House between E.D.C. and German Admission to N.A.T.O.3. It follows that apart from the measures listed under paragraph 7 in Part I,which would presumably have been tried and rejected before the final breakdown of the existing treaties, there is no major variant of the present agreements whichcould safely be contemplated by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In other words,there is no half-way house between the E.D.C. arrangements, with the modifica-tions suggested in Part I, and full German membership of N.A.T.O. It is vital tothe success of the whole enterprise, i.e., to secure an early German contributionto the defence of the West, that the French should be brought up against thishard fact.German Admission to N.A.T.O. the only Feasible Alternative4. We must therefore be prepared to produce as the only feasible alternative to the E.D.C. a plan which stands a chance of being acceptable to all parties, forthe admission of Germany to N.A.T.O. This is the solution which, in the eventof the rejection of the E.D.C., both the Americans and the Germans are likely to advocate. Although we have felt for a long time that Germany would be moretightly bound to the West in N.A.T.O. than in the E.D.C., we have not relishedthe idea of German membership of N.A.T.O. because:  A. Objections to this Course(a) we doubted v/hether the Germans yet had a sufficient sense of responsibility and whether the country was yet sufficiently stable and reliable;(b) we were uncertain of Soviet reactions;(c) Germany&apos;s claims not only to the reunification of the East Zone with theFederal Republic but also to some or all of her former territories beyondthe Oder-Neisse line would make her the only territorially unsatisfiedmember of N.A.T.O. and might thus modify its essentially defensivecharacter;(d) above all we have seen in the E.D.C. and similar Six-Power Europeanorganisations the best hope of ending the Franco-German quarrel.German membership of N.A.T.O. would not do this and might indeed in certain circumstances have the reverse effect.
B. Replies to these Objections5. In the circumstances now envisaged, however, we should probably feelthat the reply to (a) would be that Germany&apos;s re-education had gone as far as wecould take it on the basis of our present relationships, and that in any case therisk had to be taken sooner or later. As for (b), it would be advisable to ask fora further appreciation from our Embassy at Moscow; the Soviet Governmenthave, however, taken the signature of the E.D.C. Treaty by the Federal Govern-ment sufficiently quietly to encourage us to think that the promotion of Germanyto N.A.T.O. would not impose an excessive strain on East-West relations.(c) presents a very real problem. The short answer is, however, that germany will be held back much more safely within N.A.T.O. than within the E.D.C., inwhich she might become the dominant influence. But with a view to reassuringFrench public opinion and to disarming Soviet propaganda, it would be advisable to try to obtain from the Federal Government a formal reaffirmation of public statements they have made to the effect that any frontier adjustments could onlybe contemplated by peaceful means. In reply to (d), it must be admitted that theparticular pattern of relationships which the European Coal and Steel Communityhas set might not survive the breakdown of the E.D.C. and Franco-Germanco-operation would have to be developed by other means, i.e., through the inter-governmental organisations.Strengthening N.A.T.O.6. It is likely that British opinion would understand the need to admitGermany to N.A.T.O. especially if the occasion could be used to remodel andrevitalise the North Atlantic Treaty. The occasion would be of such importance that we could reasonably press the United States to make a further step forward,although it would be rash to count upon this. We should like to see the Treatyextended beyond its present limit, which is 1969; this would come as a welcomereassurance to most European countries, as committing the United States to europe for a longer period than at present. We should also like to see a closerintegration of the forces at SACEUR&apos;s disposal, not only to improve efficiency butto provide a firmer control over the German contribution. The greater the inte-gration of forces in Europe, the less the danger of independent action by one partof them, which is the constant fear of the French. Any steps towards a more fully integrated Atlantic army in Europe acceptable to the Americans would be acceptable to us within the limits imposed by our economic situation. We are working on a plan for discussion with the Chiefs of Staff which would involve:  (a) strengthening the powers of SACEUR and extending the principle ofinternational headquarters staffs to a lower level than at present; and(b) the appointment of a N.A.T.O. defence commissioner responsible fordrawing up and executing, after approval by the North Atlantic Council,plans for armaments, equipment and infrastructure.The exposed geographical situation of Western Germany might once more, as inthe E.D.C. Treaty, provide the pretext for preventing the manufacture in the federal republic of certain types of arms without violation of the principles of non-discrimination against Germany and equality of rights and obligations as between all members of N.A.T.O.Helping the French to Accept German Admission to N.A.T.O.7. The following arguments could be advanced in an attempt to persuade theFrench that a plan for German membership of N.A.T.O. on these lines might bring them solid advantages:  A. Removal of French doubts(a) Germany could not swamp N.A.T.O. as she might the E.D.C.;lb) the French army would not have to disappear;(c) French troops in Germany would not be placed in a position inferior toBritish and American troops;(d) the risk of Germany seceding would be less.B. Positive measures of assistance8.   But the French will probably need more than such arguments to overcometheir doubts.   We should therefore consider how far they can be given further
practical military and economic assistance, and what could be done to show under-standing of the French point of view, and greater public recognition of her positionas a world power.   Particular methods which might be considered are:  (a) a study of means to help the French in Indo-China;(b) support for, or at least a more sympathetic understanding of, French policyin North Africa;(c) friendly gestures by the United States Government and ourselves.   TheGermans under Dr. Adenauer&apos;s influence are in a reasonable mood atpresent and would probably not take strong objection to some declara-tion by the United States Administration showing an understanding ofFrench difficulties, fears and interests, provided that it was couched in general terms and was not too obviously directed against Germany;(d) possible extension of the competence of the Standing Group to includeglobal strategy. The French have persistently advocated this, no doubtbecause it would automatically imply recognition of France as a power with world-wide interests and would bring Indo-China more to the fore-front of the strategic picture. This is perhaps a long-term aim, but theidea of a tripartite superstructure to co-ordinate strategy in the N.A.T.O.area, the future M.E.D.O. area, the ANZUS area, and in South-east asia is attractive and logical. It would not appeal at present to theUnited States Government, but could be put to them as part of the price to be paid for the strengthening of the West by the admission of Germanyinto N.A.T.O. We should, however, realise that an equally logicalcorollary of this would be later German and possibly also Japanesedemands, probably supported by the Americans, to a seat on this smallboard of directors, when, as is only too likely, their effective contributionto the club exceeds that of France.Strengthening of European Organisations9. On the assumption that the German contribution to defence is to beachieved within N.A.T.O., we should then need to consider the future of the variousEuropean organisations. Indeed, a new initiative in this field might be necessaryto compensate for the loss of morale caused by the collapse or weakening of thefederal or confederal movement in Europe. The Council of Europe might perhaps be able to play a more useful role and become a real centre for intergovernmentaldiscussion. In the present state of Europe we should stand to gain from main-tenance of the existing distinction between the military alliance within N.A.T.O.and the wider politico-economic groupings of the Council of Europe and theO.E.E.C.Other Suggestions Considered10. In the course of this study the suggestion was also considered that it mightstrengthen the hands of the French Government if and when they are called uponto agree to German admission into N.A.T.O. if we were to offer them and our other allies in the Brussels Treaty membership of the Commonwealth. Apart fromthe probability that the French at least would not welcome such an offer, it couldonly be made if all members of the Commonwealth were agreeable. This is most unlikely and in any case such a suggestion would drive Germany away from theWest, so dividing N.A.T.O. and Western Europe and possibly leading to thedanger of direct understanding between Germany and the United States. Thesuggestion was also considered that we should make more of the Brussels Treatypartnership and machinery for the same purpose. This would be a less far-reachingand more practical course, but would have to be pursued cautiously in order to avoid the same dangers.27th November, 1952.
