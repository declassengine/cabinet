Printed for the Cabinet. November 1952SECRETC. (52) 42325th November, 1952.CABINETDECONTROL OF SWEETSMemorandum by the Minister of food control over sweets occupies the time of some 500 Civil Servants, nearly400 of whom could be saved almost at once, and at least 1,000 trade employees.Any shortage of sweets that still remains 1\ years after the end of the war is not enough to warrant our retaining a cumbrous and extravagant system for such a commodity.2. The public is taking up about 90 per cent, of the present ration of 6 oz.per week and even this level of buying depends on some interchange of couponsbetween individuals. Production is rather under 6 oz. and cannot be much increased until more materials (chiefly sugar) can be given to the industry.Undoubtedly there are some people whose demand is not being satisfied, butneither the industry nor my Department can gauge with any precision what mightbe needed to fill the gap. Even at present prices free demand might extend to the oz. per head per week which was the pre-war average, or possibly even exceedit, but there is ground for thinking that saturation point would be reached at a lower level.3. The abortive attempt at derationing in 1949 was coupled with retentionof price control, and at that time production was only about 4J oz. per head perweek. The average price of sweets has increased since then by about one-sixth.Stocks are also better. I believe that we should not be unduly concerned aboutsome further price increase if it were required to balance supply and demand inpresent circumstances. The trade is highly competitive and this should moderateany excessive price movements. Certainly price control should be ended withrationing.4. To raise the supply to a level which would safely meet demand at present prices would require annually some 30,000 to 50,000 tons of additional sugar, whichwould cost upwards of $4Jr million. I could not recommend extra dollar expendi-ture simply to remove the risk of an increase in the price of sweets; but I couldscrape together about 9,000 tons of sugar from various small savings on manufac-turing allocations this year, and perhaps a smaller quantity from next year&apos;s alloca-tion, as a &quot; once-for-all&quot; contribution towards meeting any initial rush to buy.This would temporarily replace some of the 19,000 tons of sugar which were taken from the industry&apos;s annual allocation as part of the import cuts of November 1951.But to go any further would expose us to criticism on the ground that this particular industry should not be favoured above others, and above the housewife, while sugaris still scarce.5. The best time to remove price control and stop rationing is shortly afterthe Christmas season, and I have in mind a date around the end of January orearly in February, but of course any announcement must be withheld until a day or two before we open the gates.6. There are some obvious risks in the operation, but I think they are worthtaking. I therefore ask my colleagues&apos; agreement to the abolition of rationing and price control of sweets early in the New Year.G. LL.-G.Ministry of Food, S.W.1,25th November, 1952.43274Copy No. s
