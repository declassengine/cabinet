COPY NO.     0 012th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETCORONATION:   TELEVISIONNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate for discussion by the Cabinettomorrow an extract from the Draft Second Report of the Coronation JointCommittee on still photographv, films and television of the Coronation Service.(Signed)  NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.12th November, 1952.In our first Report we made certain recommendations on this subject.   Inthe light of the United Kingdom Prime Minister&apos;s recent statement in the Houseof Commons we have now re-examined the waole problem.   We previouslyrecommended that television should be restricted to parts of the Service west of the Screen.   &quot;We have now agreed, having regard to the views expressed inParliament, to vary the recommendation.   Subject to approval a Pressannouncement might be made in the following terms:-&quot;The Earl Marshal announces that the problem of the use of television from Westminster Abbey during the Coronation Service hasbeen re-examined.The purpose of the scheme for permitting television only to the west of the Choir Screen was partly to ensure that it should be restricted to themore secular parts of theService.The Coronation Joint Committee have now recommended, and the coronation Commission have approved, the extension of television toparts of the Service east of the Screen.   It is therefore hoped to make arrangements for the Recognition, the Crowning and the Homage to beincluded.   The Anointing, the Communion Prayers and the Administrationof the Sacrament would be excluded.It is agreed that there should be no 1 close-up&apos; shots in the television programme.It is necessary to point out that, while it would be comparatively easy to arrange for still photography, cinematograph films and televisionseparately, there are substantial technical difficulties in providing for theinclusion of all three, as there is a limit to the camera positions which can bmade available.   This question and the lighting problem are being further examined. &quot;We also recommend that no television should be carried out from camerasmore or less on the level of the floor of the Sanctuary or Theatre.
