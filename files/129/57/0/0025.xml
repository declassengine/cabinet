Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. U is issued for the personal use of...............................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.4 0C. (52) 42528th November, 1952CABINETPAKISTAN   AND   THE   commonwealth memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations annex a memorandum on probable future constitutional developments in pakistan in so far as they bear on her relationship with the Commonwealth.2. The memorandum shows that while the present draft Pakistan constitution is understood to be in a form which would be appropriate for a State outside theCommonwealth, there is, in fact, little doubt that Pakistan will decide to followIndia&apos;s example and become a Republic within the Commonwealth. I myselfshould have liked to make recognition of loyalty to the Crown a sine qua non of membership of the Commonwealth. But I am afraid that that pass has been soldalready by the decisions of the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in .1949. So far, there-fore, as the United Kingdom are concerned, and subject to the views of other commonwealth Governments who would have to be consulted, it seems to me thatif Pakistan wants to be a Republic within the Commonwealth, she can be allowed toremain in it; or she can go out if she prefers.3. The memorandum also shows that there have recently been attempts tobring pressure to bear on us, and on the Australians, to modify our policies inmatters of concern, to Pakistan, by suggesting that otherwise Pakistan may decide to leave the Commonwealth. In my opinion we should not allow ourselves tobe moved by such pressures. We must in no circumstances give the impression of running after Pakistan to keep her within the Commonwealth. Our attitude shouldbe that we ourselves in the United Kingdom and other countries of the Common-wealth regard it as a privilege which carries with it great advantages to belong to this free association of nations, and that if any Member does not share this view and wishes to depart he is at liberty to do so.4. In view of the attempt which has already been made by the Pakistanis to influence the Australians in this way, it seems desirable that the opportunity of thepresence of Mr. Menzies in London should be taken to inform him of our viewson these issues. It would also seem desirable to speak similarly to Mr. St. Laurentand Mr. Holland in case they should be subjected to similar pressures by Pakistan.5. I do not recommend that we should take the initiative to raise the question with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, but if he himself should do so I would proposeto explain our attitude to him on the lines of the last sentence of paragraph 3 ofthis paper.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W, 1,28th November, 1952.43293
annex the Pakistan ConstitutionAfter India and Pakistan became independent Members of the Commonwealth,the Government of India Act remained in force in both countries as their interimconstitutions, until fresh constitutions could be drafted and put into operation.India lost no time in adopting a republican form of constitution and at the meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1949 it was agreed that she should be allowedto remain in the Commonwealth as a republic. At the same meeting the followingagreed minute was adopted:  -&quot; In answer to a question put by the Prime Minister of Pakistan whetheranother Member of the Commonwealth could continue Membership of theCommonwealth under conditions identical with those which had been accepted in respect of India, it was put on record as the opinion of the Meeting that,while it was not possible to bind future Meetings or Governments, it could belogically assumed that a future Meeting would accord the same treatment toany other Member as had been accorded to India by this Meeting.&quot;2. In Pakistan progress with constitution-making was much slower but by, theend of 1950 it became clear that she was likely to follow India&apos;s example and tobecome a Republic within the Commonwealth. At that time the then Prime Ministerof Pakistan, Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, assured the United Kingdom High Commis-sipner in Karachi that in that event other Commonwealth countries would be given  an opportunity to discuss the matter as required by the terms of the minute quoted in the preceding paragraph. The latest information (received from our HighCommissioner on a confidential basis) is that the new Constitution will not becompleted before 1954 and that in its present form it would be appropriate to are public either within or outside the Commonwealth.: 3. There have recently been one or two attempts to use this ambiguous stateof affairs to extract concessions from us on points of importance to Pakistan.Suggestions have been made to us that there was a real risk that the PakistanCabinet might shortly decide to sever the Commonwealth tie and that it was important to strengthen the hands of our friends in the Government by supplyingthem with concrete evidence of the advantages of remaining within the Common-wealth. Within the last few weeks approaches have been made to us on these lines in connection with Kashmir and with the supply of Centurion tanks. A similarapproach has also been made to the Australians in connection with Kashmir.4. These approaches are clearly a way of bringing pressure to bear on us.As a matter of tactics it would, I suggest, be a mistake to beg the Pakistanis toremain in the Commonwealth or to give them the impression that it is a vital necessity to us that they should do so. It is true that there are influential elements in Pakistan which would like to see her established on her own as an independentIslamic State, closely linked with Middle East Muslim States; but she must be far too conscious of the danger of India to run the risk of leaving the Commonwealth.Our assessment, therefore, is that Pakistan will remain in the Commonwealth, andwe have just learned confidentially that the Pakistan Cabinet, at a meeting on12th November, decided that the Prime Minister should proceed to the forth-coming Conference in London on that basis.5.   To sum up:v, (a) Though the new Pakistan Constitution is still very far from finality;;. and the question of Pakistani future relationship with theCommonwealth has not yet been finally settled, it seems safe toproceed on the assumption that she will follow India&apos;s exampleand become a Republic within the Commonwealth.(b) Should she elect to remain a Republic within the Commonwealth itwould be necessary for other Members to be consulted, but in viewof the decisions of the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in 1949 it wouldbe difficult to raise any objection to allowing her to do so.
