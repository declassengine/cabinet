(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (52) 404 COPY NO. 7^12th NOVEMBER,   1952.CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947:AMENDMENT OF FINANCIAL, PROVISIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Excheqtxer.I.    Transitional arrangements in our previous discussions on this subject the difficulties of unscramblingthe past were several times mentioned but never fully considered.   They havenow been considered, and I am in general agreement with the proposals of theMinister of Housing for meeting them;  but I feel obliged to draw my colleagues1attention to their prospective heavy cost in the financial year 1954-55.(I have already expressed my view on the long-term cost of the new scheme:  Ibelieve there is a considerable danger that it will turn out to be far greaterthan that of the existing arrangements.   Even if the limitation of compensation to 1947 values can be maintained, the maximum liability on this basis is about 350 millions, which is a very large sum, and in future there will be nodevelopment charge revenue to set against it.)2.   The alternative scheme which I proposed would also have involved alarge initial payment by the Exchequer to certain of the claimants on the 300 millions, but under my scheme development charge revenue would have continued to come in.93,   The draft White Paper (paragraph 51) mentions an initial cost of  25-30millions, but as the Minister of Housing comments in his paper (C. (52)399,paragraph 5) that is by no means the whole story:   compensation to be paid incases where planning permission has already been refused or revoked may wellbring the total payment in 1954 to  60 millions or more.   He proposes, it istrue, that the local authorities should contribute towards the cost of meetingclaims on land which they have already acquired under the 1947 Act.  But thissuggestion has not yet been put to the local authorities and we do not know whatview they will take of it.4.   As the Minister explains (C. (52) 399, paragraphs 3-4), it is proposed topay claims on the  300 millions in 1954 in certain cases where the relatedland has neither already been compulsorily acquired at less than full market value, nor already been refused permission for development, nor already been developed on payment of development charge.     These are the cases wherelandowners have sold their land at its existing use value, as they were stronglyexhorted to do by the last Government, and there is some moral obligationupon us to ensure that they do not suffer for having done so.   The purchasers ofsuch land, however, having bought at existing use value in the expectation that theywould eventually have to pay a development charge when they came to develop the land, will receive an uncovenanted benefit in the abolition of development
charge;  and the logical course would be that the Government should registera claim against the land, and on its eventual development collect a contribution from the developer to set against the payment now made.   So far as can beestimated, however, there is relatively little money in this, and arrangements on these lines would be highly awkward to administer,   I think we must regard the payments we shall make in this type of case as simply an inescapable partof the cost of transition from the old scheme to the new, and attempt norecovery of them.5,   A more important point is whether it is inevitable that we should pay claims on the  300 millions in all cases where development charge has alreadybeen paid.   It would be possible to take the view that though we are amendingtheAct for the future, the damage which has flowed from it in the past inthe shape of development charge must lie where it has fallen.   The case ofthe estate developer is a particularly difficult one.   He has paid development charge and it has been one of his costs of development.   But in the ordinary way that cost, along with others, has played its part in determining the pricehe has asked either on the sale of the houses he has built or by way of rentfor them.    The development charge has been passed on to the purchaser orleaseholder, the developer has been reimbursed, and it is arguable that thereis no need to present him in addition with his share of the compensation money.Moreover, in certain cases it is proposed (C, (52) 399, paragraph 2(3)) to paybalances of claims to developers who are not actually the holders of the claims,simply on the ground that they have paid development charges:   it is arguable that in these cases at least there is no real need to pay, because the claim isnot held,6.   The other view, to which on the whole I incline, is that the 1947 Actimposed a liability - development charge - and promised a benefit - paymentout of the  300 millions.    The two did not coincide in point of time, and wherethe liability has already befallen it is clearly equitable that the benefit should now be given.     The amount involved is estimated at about  6 millions;  butif by refusing to pay the claims in these cases we stimulated a public demand that development charges as such should be repaid, it would cost us 12-1 millions,II.    Future Permanent Arrangements7.    There is another observation which I must make about the future scheme.Paragraph 39 of the draft White Paper does not, in my view, contain anadequate assurance that the Exchequer will be protected against the automatichonouring of compensation claims arising from decisions made by local planning authorities.8,     Under the 1947 Act it was possible for the Exchequer to stand aside fromthe local authorities&apos; decisions:  their permissions to develop brought in revenue by way of development charge, and their refusals generally speakingcost nothing in compensation.    In future, refusals will cost Exchequer money and permissions will bring no Exchequer revenue.    In fairness to the taxpayerit is essential that there should be effective supervision by the centralGovernment of these local planning decisions, to ensure that permissionsare not unreasonably refused having regard to the cost of refusing.    I pointedthis out in our earlier discussions, and indeed regarded it as one of the maindisadvantages, from the point of view of planning policy, of the scheme whichit has been decided to adopt.
9.     It is quite wrong in principle (and this is a point which has recentlybeen particularly emphasised to me by the Conservative ParliamentaryParty&apos;s Finance Committee) to give local authorities a free hand in the spending of Exchequer money.     I must press for a much firmer public statement on this point than the reluctant phraseology of paragraph^! ofthe draft White Paper (&quot;it will be impossible for the Government to avoidsome scrutiny . ..     &quot;The Government do not ... intend to interfereunduly ., . &quot;, etc.) contains.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,12TH NOVEMBER , 1952.
