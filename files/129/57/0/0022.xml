MARRIED QUARTERS FOR THE UNITED STATES forces memorandum by the Secretary of State for AirI agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, if we can, we ought to help the Americans to provide married quarters for the United states air Forces (U.S.A.F.) in this country.    To do so would be in the interests ofdefence in the widest sense.    The considerations I advance below should,however, be taken into account before a decision, either in principle or as tothe details of any scheme, is taken02. It has been the policy, in my view a very wise policy, of the AirMinistry and the U.S.A.F. to introduce the U.S.A.F. to the United Kingdomquietly and with the least possible disturbance to British social andeconomic life.   It has been successful on the whole because airfields and installations tend in any event to be separate communities, generallysituated, for obvious reasons, well away from heavily populated districts.This natural isolation has been used by the U.S.A.F. to promote an activestation life, with entertainments and occupations easily obtainable &quot;on the site&quot;.   Thus the higher standard of living, better pay, and general trans-Atlantic way of life has not appeared by way of contrast to British habits and standards,3.    It is true that many married members of the U.S.A.F. hire houses and lodgings in the neighbourhood (sometimes of rather poor type and generally at very high rents).   But such hirings are individual, and do notdisplay any collectively higher standard of living.4. Furthermore, no new building resources, other than those connectedwith general airfield development, have been specifically allocated to marriedUnited States airmen.5. If we are now to go in for sizeable &quot;settlements&quot; of Americanfamilies (and it is estimated that a big American bomber base such as thatat Mildenhall might require about 500 houses) there will be a much heavierimpact on local British communities06, We could not fit 5,000 houses into the land already embracedby airfields occupied by the U.S.A.F.   It would be disagreeable to extend the boundaries of these airfields.   It would be infinitely harder to justifythe acquisition - possibly compulsory acquisition in some cases - of landseparated from the airfields.7. In my view the political and social difficulties will be more easilysolved to the extent that these houses are directly associated both in theirsiting and their social life with existing American-occupied airfields.   WhatCONFIDENTIALC,(52) 42224TH NOVEMBER, 1952CABINET(THk0ocument is the PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
ought to be avoided is the creation of American &quot;villages&quot; in physicaljuxtaposition to English communities, but living quite different and alienlives and with little or no chance of assimilation.8. I am concerned at what may be the reaction of the general public to a big housing programme for the U.S.A.F.    My particular concern,however, would be to see that the availability of married quarters for theU.S.A.F, in the United Kingdom were no greater than for the Royal Air Forcein a comparable situation overseas, say in Germany.   It would also be necessaryto see that there was broad equality between house building for the U.S.A.F.and the R.A.F, in this country, both as to numbers and rate of building.9. The question of siting is all important.   In my view the types of land to be Used should be as follows, in order of priority:-(i) Land within the existing boundaries of airfields occupied bythe U.S.A.F.(ii) Land owned by the Air Ministry, or under Air Ministryrequisition, for example airfields not now in use for flying,(iii) Land to be acquired, not compulsorily, which is of little or no value to farming.(iv) Land in or near sizeable towns of some absorptive capacity,e.g. Warrington in Lancashire (near the American base atBurtonwood) or Hunstanton in Norfolk (near the Bomber base at Sculthorpe).I doubt whether quarters built on (i) could be financed, built and controlled by a private company of the kind envisaged in the paper by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.10.   ConclusionIf the Cabinet decide that we must help the Americans, I considerthat the next step should be to work out a siting plan, based on the abovepriorities, for a scheme of the size contemplated.   This could best become-ordinated by the Air Ministry, which is already in close touch with theU.S.A.F. authorities.   Until this has been done, and the implications(particularly of land acquisition) are known, no commitment should be enteredinto.It is for consideration whether, if an acceptable and workable scheme can be contrived, the appropriate co-ordinating Minister should not be theMinister of Housing and Local Government.D.L.D.Air Ministry, S.W.1,,24th November, 1952.
