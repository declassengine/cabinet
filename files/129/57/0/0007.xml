Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952SECRETC. (52) 40714th November, 1952CABINET:   KENYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies do not want to weary my colleagues by any further analysis of the situationin Kenya. I have already made a general review both in a broadcast which, wasextensively quoted in The Times, and in a speech in the House.2. The object of this paper, therefore, is to put down one or two things whichcannot be said in public. It is also concerned more with the immediate futurethan with the immediate past. I want to give some account of what is likely to happen, in order that my colleagues may endorse or, if they wish, may modifyany of the measures proposed, and to. ensure that some of these events will not come as a surprise. &apos;&apos;:, 3. It will in my opinion be possible to bring to trial upon criminal chargesmany of the leaders who haye&apos;now been arrested. Every precaution has beentaken to protect the witnesses&quot;in the meanwhile but I cannot be certain that theywill testify when they come to Court. I hope that some prosecutions will be started towards the end of this month or the beginning of next, and it may thenbe possible to release one or two of those arrested, not necessarily because they areinnocent but because they are insignificant&apos;.I have asked the Governor to work, if it is practicable, towards lifting theEmergency Regulations about the end of January. It will probably be necessary at that&apos; time to place the Kikuyu Reserves under some form of special adininistra-tion whilst allowing the rest of the Colony to revert to normal conditions andprocesses of law.It must be remembered that so far Mau Mau is almost entirely confined tothe Kikuyu tribe and most of the country is normal. At one or two points,however-where, for example, the Kikuyu tribe join the Embu some minorpenetration by Mau Mau of the Embu tribe has taken place, but this is only because in these marginal areas the demarcation between tribes is not clear cut. Again thereare about 15,000 Kikuyus in the north of Tanganyika, and they have been affected.Oath taking and one or two outrages have taken place and the Governor has nowarranged for the return to Kenya of some of the worst offenders. &quot;,4. The Kikuyu are not a warlike tribe, Their history was that they cultivatedland near the fringes of the bamboo forests, and, when the warlike Masai appeared,they fled to the forest. They are the most advanced tribe and give the best work,and, since they have not lived by the spear, they have had to live by their brains.From having their ears to the ground to listen for the approach of the Masai^ theyhave learned to have their ears to the ground to listen for any political, tremors andturn them to their advantage. They are sometimes said to be like the Irish in politics, without their humour, and like the Jews in commerce, without Leviticus.They are disliked and despised by nearly all the other tribes, particularly ;the Luoand the Masai. -5. Mr. Pant, the Indian Commissioner in Nairobi, is attributed by MuslimIndians with some sinister: activities and I could not myself acquit&quot; him of allimpropriety.  He was not in Kenya during my visit, but one,incident at that time43218 , - &quot; &apos;Copy No.
2certainly suggests that everything is not as it should be in his office. It was not,far from an unfriendly act on the part of his deputy to have arranged hospitality&apos;for Mr. Fenner Brockway in the house of an Indian lady when it was found thathis intended host had been arrested on a charge of being accessory before the factto murder.. 6. The Kenya African Union (K.A.U.). Evidence is being collected which appears deeply to implicate K.A.U. with Mau Mau, and when investigations are complete it is the intention to proscribe K.A.U. This will no doubt cause a stridentoutcry from the Left and probably from the Left in the House of Commons. TheOpposition will quote the statements of the new K.A.U. leaders which, I must admit,if taken at their face value, would appear to be responsible and even respectable.No reliance, however, can be placed upon these statements.K.A.U. is identified in the minds of the Kikuyu and of Africans in general with Mau Mau. They think it the motive force and believe that K.A.U. has suppliedthe leaders, the technique and the money which has so greatly expanded the MauMau movement. Amongst a primitive people it is necessary to destroy symbolsand names before building afresh. You cannot build new temples with old totempoles. I think that it is desirable that the Africans should have some political body to represent them, but it will be a hard task to see that such a body or bodies are formed and are led by experienced and sober-minded Africans. I dismiss themetaphor as inapposite in advance, but such leaders do not grow on every tree.7. The Schools. Kenyatta and his lieutenants created Githunguri, a sort ofcollege for saboteurs and a nursery of subversive teaching. This, in one way or another, we shall destroy or put to better purpose.There are a large number of schools started independently of Government bythe Kikuyu Independent Schools Association (K.I.S.A.), containing about 18,800pupils, and by one or two lesser bodies travelling the same road, notably the KenyaKoringa Education Association. The great majority of these schools have beenfostering subversive and Mau Mau ideas amongst the children of the Kikuyu tribeand through them their parents. They have been the most important instrumentin the hands of Kenyatta with which to stir up the present discontents. The inten-tion is to close down all these schools and to reconstitute them with a government grant and under. Government control. Again it is necessary to make a clean breakand not to allow the name K.I.S.A. to continue; There may be some shrill outcryfrom the Left.8. Many Africans have been detained and are being put through the Govern-ment sieve. At the end some hundreds will probably still be in detention withoutany great prospect that they can be brought to trial. They will prove mostly to beyoung men, the strange jetsam of the Kenya economic tide. Unless such anarrangement is found to conflict with our obligations under international conven-tions, these young men might be employed on road repair and soil conservation, atleast.for some months in the year. This could be said to represent some reparationfor the damage that they have caused and will at the same time bring a littlediscipline into the youth of Kenya, which they lack.9. Finally, the present condition of the Kikuyu is far quieter than wouldappear from reading the newspapers, but it is the quiet of a well-policed area ratherthan of a contented people. The scene varies strangely. When I left Nyeri on sunday, in the centre of the troubles and a few miles from where a chief washacked to pieces, the wife of the Provincial Commissioner who is the daughterof General Sir Sergison Brooke was screwing her rod together before trying the morning rise. On the other hand, in isolated farms something like a state of siegeis maintained at night and no one can but admire the courage of women left alone in these farm houses or think of what their feelings must be when they hear thedogs begin to bark at night.It is deeply disquieting to find that the Mau Mau movement has been growingduring the last two years and that so little of the information concerning it hasfiltered through to the Colonial Office. The Government machine in Nairobi was out of touch with many of its officers, even its senior officers, in the field, and sometimes information which told them what they did not want to know wasdiscarded. All this has changed and a constant flow of senior officers throughGovernment House is now customary. Both political and police intelligence, have proved defective.  Here, as elsewhere, they are being reorganised.
I have said frequently that the origin of Mau Mau is not economic, although,of course, its promoters have used economic grievances to add oil to the flames.The Mau Mau have gone both wider and deeper than I had expected to find.It would be idle to hazard a guess of how long it will take to extirpate it, but, ifI had to, I should put it at about a year. This is not to say that the country will -be in a state of danger or unrest during the whole of this time, but we cannot relax,at least in the Kikuyu Reserves, measures of closer administration or emergency regulations of some kind until we are sure that the poison has been drawn off fromthe bloodstream of Kenya&apos;s life. - i :;i:.dnioT have given some reasons already in public, but I would add that if themovement was economic in origin it would have appeared first in the Luo tribe,where land pressure is more intense, or in others where it is hardly less..       &apos; O.
