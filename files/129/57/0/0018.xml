confidential. (52) 418 COPY NOv22nd NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETEMBASSY PROPERTY AT KATMANDUMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,My colleagues may wish to know about the position which has arisen in Nepal owing to the omission at the time of the partition of India to reach anyunderstanding about the retention of our Embassy buildings in Katmandu.2. The Law Officers ruled that we have no claim to these buildings,and that their ownership devolves jointly on India and Pakistan,,   The late government decided to hand the buildings over to India, on the understandingthat this would be without prejudice to any claim for financial compensationby Pakistan.   An undertaking to this effect, subject to certain conditions whichhave now been substantially fulfilled, was given by Mr, Morrison to Mr0 Nehruin October, 1951c3, Prolonged negotiations having failed to produce any satisfactory alternative Embassy, we are now faced with having to spend between 100,000 and  200,000 on building a new Embassy, while H.M, ambassador and his staff have to move into unsatisfactory quarters meanwhile.   This heavyoutlay is regrettable, but I see no alternative, since Her Majesty&quot;sGovernment must continue to have diplomatic representation in Nepal,if only in the interests of Gurkha recruitment to which the Chiefs of Staffattach the greatest importance.A. ,E,Foreign Office, S,,W.l,22,5xd NOVEMBER, 1952.
