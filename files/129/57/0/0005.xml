THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY   OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 5C. (52) 40513th November, 1952.cabinet national INSURANCE MATERNITY benefits memorandum by Minister of National InsuranceAt their meeting on 7th November the Home Affairs Committee approvedmy proposals for a Bill dealing with maternity benefits, but felt that in view of their political importance they should be brought before the Cabinet (HA. (52) 29thMeeting, Minute 1.).2. The general effect of the proposals is to provide an extra  2,000,000 a year for maternity benefits. Their effect is shown in the following table. They representincreases, on the average, of 31 per cent, for housewives and 45 per cent, for employed women.Present BenefitsLump Sum Weekly Allowances      Total PaymentHousewives ...      ...      ...  4  la week for  84 weeksEmployed Women......  4 36s. a week for         27   8s.

The proposals give effect to recommendations made by the national insurance Advisory Committee for re-casting the maternity benefits under theNational Insurance Scheme in a report published as a Command Paper in the early part of the year. Their recommendations have been well received. They recom-mended several alterations in the qualifying conditions which, in themselves, wouldhave enabled certain improvements in benefit to be made. Since their report was published we have increased other benefits by about 25 per cent., and in my pro-posals the Committee&apos;s figures have been increased in the same ratio.4.   The Committee lay down three main principles in their report:  (i) As mothers confined at home incur more expense than those confined in national Health Service hospitals, they should receive a larger grant.(ii) The period during which an employed woman who gives up work to haveher baby can get her special weekly allowance before the birth is tooshort and should be increased by five weeks.(iii) The chief essential of a good system of maternity benefits is to provide as large a lump sum as possible before the child&apos;s birth; for the employedwoman&apos;s weekly allowance, on the other hand, the standard rate ofbenefit would be adequate.5. My proposals give effect to all these principles but the acceptance of thethird of them results in a decrease in the rate of the employed woman&apos;s allowancefrom 36s. to 32s. 6d. a week. This is, however, much more than made good by the big increases in the period for which it is granted and in the lump sum payable atthe time of the birth of the child.43214
26. The report of the Advisory Committee is a unanimous one arrived at after an expert study of the whole problem in the course of which evidence was taken from many interested persons and bodies. It is signed by Mr. Roberts, the TradesUnion Congress (T.U.C.) representative on it, who is also the Chairman of theT.U.C.&apos;s Social Insurance Sub-Committee and who speaks for the cotton industryin which many working mothers are employed. So long as we keep closely to theCommittee&apos;s recommendations we can therefore expect the T.U.C. to be satisfied.7. Demands for further increases, especially in the maternity grant (forhousewives) may be expected. They will have to be resisted because any further increases in maternity benefits would require another increase in national insurance contributions, which we cannot contemplate at this stage, and because of the presentneed for the utmost economy. It would be much more difficult to resist these demands if in our own proposals we had departed from the advice of the Committee.8. I ask for approval of my proposals accordingly and for permission toprepare and to publish a Bill giving effect to them.O. P.Ministry of National Insurance, W.C. 2,,.       13th November, 1952.
