(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)secret. (52) 420 COPY NO.22nd NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETTELEVISION development memorandum by the Postmaster General.As my colleagues are aware, there has for some time been constant pressure for the extension of the television service to new areas,   I felt thatsome extension, if it could be carried out at low cost, was desirable as partof the Coronation amenities, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed -with the greatest reluctance - to the opening of temporary stations in North east england and in Belfast at a cost to the British Broadcasting Corporation (B,,B.Co)originally estimated at  40,000 but which is now likely to be nearer  60,000.2. We are now getting additional pressure for extension of the service to other places, particularly Aberdeen, and as it is clearly undesirable for usto say we can do nothing at this stage and then give in later, I think we must cometo a clear decision now,3. In my view, if we go further than we have already done, there can beno question of giving television at just one more place - say Aberdeen.Portsmouth and Southampton have just as strong a claim, so has Plymouth.   TheEastern counties (including Norwich and Cambridge), the extreme South west of England, Cumberland, as well as the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islandsfollow very closely.   To give reliable service to any of these places wouldinvolve buying new equipment and the cost per station, including the linkconnecting it to the existing television system, would be at least  50,000,4. It might be possible by straining the resources of the 3,BoC0? thePost Office and the industry to the utmost to complete three more temporarystations, at Aberdeen, Isle of Wight (for Southampton and Portsmouth) andPlymouth, in time for the Coronation;  these are the locations of the remainingthree stations to be provided under the B,B.C&apos;s basic television plane   Thequestion is whether, if we are pressed for further extension of the service,we should agree to these three stations and risk even further pressure forstations in other equally important areas, or whether we should stand firmnow and say that we cannot go beyond the new stations recently authorised for north East England and Belfast,5, It seems to me that this depends solely on whether we are preparedto allow additional national resources to be diverted to public entertainment(by the B,B,CC;  by   the public buying television sets;  and by the industrymanufacturing television equipment and sets) at a time when important industrial investment &apos; is still severely restricted.   My own feeling is that any extension now wouid have to be for all three stations within the BsBaC*s basicplan and this would make it virtually impossible to resist pressure for further extension to other parts of the country.   Moreover, if the B.B.C, were allowed
to provide the three additional stations we should have pressure from commercial television interests to allow them to make a start and, if weyielded, this would mean yet further demands on our capital resources.6, On balance, I propose that we should stand firm in our presentsituation and refuse any further extensions beyond those now authorised for north East England and Belfast,7. I should perhaps add that, as a separate matter, I have been discussing with the B,B,C, the possibility of an experiment to improvereception - by means of a local &quot;booster&quot; - at Brighton, where there have beenconstant complaints that reception of pictures from the London station is cutoff by the Downs,   If this experiment proves successful, the B,BaC, may beable, after the Coronation, to deal with other &quot;pockets&quot; on similar lines,D,Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.2Znd NOVEMBER, 1952.
