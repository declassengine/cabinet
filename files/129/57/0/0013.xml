(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 41317th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETREVISION OF ORDINARY WIDOWS1 PENSIONS IN THE FORCES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I have just recently had put before me the Minister of Defence&apos;sproposals (C, (52) 410) for the revision and extension of the existing scheme of ordinary pensions for Forces&apos; widows and children.   As the Minister of Defencesays, these pensions are paid to the widows of officers and Warrant OfficersClass I but not to lower other ranks in cases where death is not attributable to service.   They are distinct from the attributable pensions administered by the Minister a  Pensions which are payable in cases where death is due to service and which apply to all ranks,2. I myself make some modest proposals for improvement inparagraph 5 below.National Insurance3. The Minister&apos;s proposals made at this time and date ignore the radical changes brought about by the introduction of National Insurance in whichthe Forces share and to which, of course, the State, as well as employers and employees, contributes.   In all other spheres it has been the policy of thepresent Government, as it was of the previous one, that any improvements in occupational pensions, including provision for widows, made to supplementNational Insurance must be on a manifestly contributory basis.   This principle was applied to the Civil Service who now have widows&apos; pensions on a contributory basis.   Those employed in the National Health Service bear the whole cost of anywidows&apos; pensions.   We are shortly to undertake legislation making provision on the same lines for the widows of local government servants.   A widows&apos;and dependants&apos; scheme for teachers, which was tentatively proposed but notpursued, would have been on a contributory basis, and the Minister of Educationalso hopes to legislate to increase the contributions which teachers pay for theirown pensions,   I find it difficult to see how we could agree to regard the forces as exempt from this general contributory principle.Widows&apos; Ordinary Pensions4. The Treasury had understood that the Service Departments had accepted this contributory principle and it was because of this that an announcement was made in Pailiament that a contributory scheme would be introduced and thedetails of such a scheme worked out,   I fully realise the difficulties of a contributory scheme when applied to the Services, but it does not give theServices a right to claim that what the State would have provided on a contributory basis should be made available for improvements and extensions on a non-contributory basis.COPY NO.
5. For the sake of clarity, I state my views on the details of theMinister&apos;s proposals.(a) Future widows of entitled classes      I should be willing to consider verymodest improvements of the existing scheme as applied to future widows,broadly on the basis that the new rates would consolidate thepresent basic rates and pensions increase.(b) Extensions to lower other ranks  Any extensions on a non-contributory basis beyond the classes already entitled to them seem to me entirelyinconsistent with the contributory principle I have already stated.(c) Conditions    In my view the Forces widows&apos; ordinary pension schemeconstitutes a historical survival.   It was charitable in origin - i. e.designed to relieve hardship, however relative the hardship - and itseems to me a straining of the purposes of th . scheme to regard thesepensions as earned by service.   Indeed if we did so we should find itdifficult logically to refuse their extension to other ranks not nowentitled to them.   But such an extension, as I have said, would be inconsistent with the contributory principle.   It follows that, in my view, the means test should be retained,   I would, however, be quite prepared to consider altering the present means test levels in order tomake them more in accordance with present conditions^   They are not intended to be tests of penury but of the absence of affluence.(d) Gratuities    &quot;Widows already receive post mortem benefits in the formof continuance of marriage allowance plus the husband&apos;s allotment (orin the case of officers a proportion of the husband&apos;s pay) for a periodof thirteen weeks after death. These post mortem allowances rangein value from a minimum of  58 for the widow of a private to  184for the widow of a Lieutenant Colonel,   The provision of gratuitiesin those cases where a pension is also drawn seems to me to constitute a double payment;  but I would be prepared to consider a scheme forgiving widows, in those cases where no ordinary or attributablepension is admissible, a proportion of the gratuity, if any, which the husband would have drawn if he had boen invalided at the date of his death,(e) Attributable Pensions    At present the &quot;attributable&quot; widow does not receive an ordinary widow&apos;s pension and she is debarred under theoverlapping benefits regulations from receiving National Insurance inaddition.   The &quot;ordinary&quot; widow is eligible for National Insurance inaddition to her ordinary widow&apos;s pension,   This already results in some slight degree in the &quot;ordinary&quot; widow getting more than the &quot;attributable&quot;widow.   This position is sufficiently embarrassing as it is.   If weincreased the rates to the extent proposed, the &quot;ordinary&quot;widow would get,all ranks up to and including Major General, much more than the&quot;attributable&quot; widow.   This would be an impossibly embarrassing position.   It is, presumably, to avoid this that the Minister of Defenceproposes to pay half the ordinary pension in addition to theattributable pension.   While this device would certainly avoid thisembarrassment, it seems to me quite unacceptable.   The detailed figures(for a widow with one child) are in the Annex to this paper.(f) Existing Scheme The rates of the existing scheme cannot, in my view,be improved retrospectively except, possibly, for the widows of those who retired on or after 1st September, 1950, when the present retired pay
and pension rates came into effect.   Widows of those who retiredbefore that date will, of course, be eligible for pensions increase underthe Service instruments corresponding to the Pensions Increase Acts1944=52.conclusion.     In short, I consider that we must take account of the advent ofNational Insurance.   If the Minister of Defence wants more time in which to consider the modifications or improvements I propose, then questionersin both Houses should be told that the matter is still under review.   would it not be possible to reconsider a form of contributory scheme for theServices ?R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.17th November, 1952.
