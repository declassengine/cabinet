THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENT.     Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy&apos; No.C. (52) 410 .14th November, 1952. ! .CABINETREVISION   OF   WIDOWS&apos;   PENSION   SCHEME   FOR.   THE   forces memorandum by the Minister of defence i ask my colleagues to approve a revision and extension of the existing scheme of pensions for the widows and children of members of the Armed forces who make the Service a career. (I am not directly concerned in this paper withawards where death is attributable to service, which are the responsibility of theMinister of Pensions.)2. The main features of the existing scheme of &quot; ordinary &quot; pensions, which date from the Nineteenth Century or even earlier, are now open to criticism on thefollowing grounds:  (a) Though minor additions. have been made under Pensions Increase to compensate for &quot; hardship,&quot; the basic rates have not been revised since1920, and they are now out of balance, with all other rates of service pay and pension, which were revised in 1945 and again in 1950.(Particulars of the current rates are given in the annex. It will beseen that the widow of a Major without dependant, for example, draws 118 a year, including pensions increase.) .       , ,(b) The conditions governing award are also out of date.   Discussions withthe Treasury suggest that it will be possible to reach agreement oilamendments which are acceptable to the Service Departments, except on one point. All awards are at present subject to a means test andthe Treasury are unwilling to agree to its removal. But it is preciselythis condition which is most repugnant to public opinion and has led tomost criticism.(c) The scheme applies to all regular officers, but, below commissioned rank,only to Warrant Officers, Class I in the Army and Warrant Officers inthe Royal Air Force. All other ranks and ratings are excluded,regardless of type of engagement and length of service. This is whollyout of tune with current policy and opinion, and is particularly un-fortunate at a time when we are making every effort to persuade; mento stay in the Forces until their fifties.3. The revision of the scheme was discussed in 1947 and certain proposalsfor minor adjustments were made as a result, but before these could be considered,the Government of the day decided that the widows&apos; pension scheme in the CivilService and certain other superannuation and widows&apos; pensions schemes in whichthe State has an interest should be Eased on the contributory principle. . In thecase of the Civil Service, for example, half the cost is borne by the State and halfby the individual. .4. It was then decided to see whether a satisfactory contributory scheme could be devised for the Armed Forces; and two alternative schemes were worked out with the assistance of the Government Actuary. There are, however, special difficulties in applying the contributory principle to the Services which do notapply in any other branch of the public service. In many cases the initial engage-ment is short, and even where an individual has extended or re-engaged, his service43219 S7,
may be terminated at various points. Moreover, even a normal career is con-siderably shorter than the career in most civilian professions. In consequence, inorder to make the scheme self-supporting, even with a 50 per cent, contribution from public funds, it was necessary to provide relatively high rates of contribu-tioh and to stipulate that contributions must continue even after retirement ordischarge. Service opinion was canvassed on the two schemes, and it is clear fromthe reports received from Commanders-in-Chief, that, while Service opinion is strongly in favour of adequate provision being made for widows and dependent children, there is no possibility of a scheme on a contributory basis being acceptable to the Services.5. It is, in my view, quite impossible to devise a contributory scheme whichwould be actuarially sound and acceptable to the Services. It is equally impossibleto leave matters as they are. An injustice has already been done by not revising the rates and conditions as part of the post-war settlement, and there is now strong feeling on both sides of the House that improvements are essential. I have recentlybeen pressed by a deputation representing all parties, and there have been persistentQuestions over a long period which have received only temporising answers..&apos; 6.   I must therefore ask the Cabinet to approve , \ . (a), a revision of the scheme to provide for some improvements in the existingi rates;(b) the extension of the scheme to cover long service men in the ranks of w.O.II (Army), Flight Sergeant (R.A.F.) and Chief Petty Officer (Navy)and below; and(c) the removal of the objectionable conditions of award, including the means test.Details of a scheme are given in the Annex. It will be seen that the Major&apos;s widow,to whom reference is made in paragraph 2 (a), would receive  140 per annum insteadof  118. The scheme also provides for the payment of gratuities to the widows ofofficers and long service men dying while in the Service.7. I am well aware of one of the main objections which the Chancellor maysee tq my proposals, on which we have already exchanged views. The Treasuryfear, considerable embarrassment in extending the scope, and improving the rates,of the current non-contributory Forces&apos; scheme, having regard to the post-warschemes introduced for various classes of Government and other employees on a contributory basis. But the Services have enjoyed their ordinary widows&apos; and dependants&apos; pension scheme on a non-contributory basis since the latter part oflast century, and this is now quite firmly established as part of their conditions ofservice. In these circumstances I think the Chancellor may over-estimate thepossible repercussions on other classes of employees of my present proposals for theForces.8. In view of the regrettable delay which has occurred, I think that it wouldbe reasonable that the new scheme of pensions and gratuities should apply at least to the widows and children of personnel placed on the retired list or dischargedon pension on or after 1st September, 1950, i.e., the date when the present rates of pay, retired pay and Service pension were introduced. I also propose that widowswhose husbands&apos; service terminated before September 1950 (including existingwidows) should have the benefit of the new rates of pension with effect from thatdate, and that in their case too, the objectionable conditions of award should be withdrawn. (If the principle of retrospection for existing widows, &amp;c, is accepted,there are points of detail which will require discussion with the Treasury.)9. There is one other point to which I should refer. The scheme provides thatthe widow of a long-service member of the forces whose husband&apos;s death is attribut-able to the conditions of service should qualify for one-half of the pension payable under the scheme in addition to the attributable pension to which she is entitledfrom the Ministry of Pensions. This latter is, of course, the same, rank for rank,for the regular, the volunteer and the national service man, and it is, in my view,desirable that the widow of the regular should receive some addition in recognitionof her husband&apos;s service. I understand that the Minister of Pensions sees noobjection.
\Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,14th November, 1952.4321910. I estimate that my proposals will cost ultimately about  1 million a yearmore than the existing scheme, but this figure will not be reached for many years.The cost to the State of a contributory scheme would have been comparable.. the extra cost initially will be of the order of  160,000 per annum though the cost inthe first year will be higher if the scheme is given retrospective effect from 1st September, 1950.       &quot; , .11.   I accordingly ask the Cabinet:   &apos;** i(i) To approve in principle the introduction, for existing personnel of theForces and future entrants, of a scheme of &quot; ordinary &quot; pensions for widows and children on the lines of the existing scheme, but withmoderate increases in basic rates, abolition of anomalous conditions likethose governing awards under the present scheme, and the extension of provision to cover all ranks of long service.(ii) To agree that a statement should be made in the near future on behalf ofthe Government announcing decisions as under (i) above, and at thesame time indicating that similar improvements will be made in therates of award and conditions of issue for existing pensioners.A.

Conditions of service for the widows of Officers and Warrant Officers, Class I, the same periodof service that is required to enable the husbands to attain a service retired payor pension entitlement. (Normally, Officers 20 years, Warrant Officers, Class I,22 years:  shorter periods if invalided or dying whilst serving.)For the widows of other ranks, the periods would be as stated in A (2) above.
C. Adjustment where Pension on &quot;Attributable&quot; Scale is PayableIf pension on the &quot; attributable &quot; scale is payable by the Ministry of Pensions,pensions at half the above rates would be allowed in addition.D. Gratuities to the Widows of Officers and Men who Die while ServingWidows of regular Officers and men dying in the Service would receivegratuities equal to the amount of terminal grant for which the husband wouldhave been eligible had he been invalided at the date when he died. These wouldbe payable whether or not the widow received a pension (either on the&quot; attributable &quot; scale or on the &quot; ordinary &quot; scale); on this basis rates would be:  (a) In the case of Officers&apos; widows from  500 (when the Officer died after10 years&apos; service) to  1,000 (when the Officer died after 20 or more years&apos; service);(b) In the case of W.Os., I, widows from  164 (when the W.O. died after12 years&apos; service) to  600 (when the W.O. died after 37 years&apos; service);(c) In the case of other ranks&apos; widows from  100 (in the case of a private dyingafter 12 years&apos; service) to  545 (in the case of a W.O. II dying after37 years&apos; service). No widows in this group qualify for &quot; ordinary &quot;pension at present, but they may qualify for an &quot; attributable &quot; pension.Under the new proposals some would qualify for half &quot; ordinary &quot;pension as well. If they did not qualify for either &quot; attributable &quot; or&quot; ordinary &quot; pension, it is proposed that the minimum gratuity payableshould be  150.In cases where the husband died with less than 10 years&apos; service (Officers) or12 years&apos; service (other ranks) the widows would receive gratuities of  250 (Officers)or  50 (other ranks), in addition to &quot; attributable &quot; pension, if admissible.
