CONFIDENTIAL &apos; Copy No.C. (52) 45122nd December, 1952CABINETPENSIONS FOR BOARD MEMBERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power the Cabinet agreed in principle that service of full-time members of the Boards of nationalised industries should be pensionable, and invited us to circulate a Reportexplaining the conditions and methods by which this principle might be put intoeffect (C.C. (52) 79th Conclusions, Minute 8).2.   We propose that this principle should be put into effect as follows:  (a) that Board members recruited from the staff of the industry concerned should (as at present) remain pensionable under the staff scheme;(b) that those recruited from other sources should be pensionable on the sameor similar terms as those of the staff scheme, so far as it is practicable to do so;(c) that (b) should be subject to certain variations in special circumstances.Main features of the Staff Pension Schemes3. The staff schemes are not uniform but (except for the Airways Corpora-tions&apos; Scheme) they provide broadly comparable benefits, including widows&apos; andchildren&apos;s pensions. Pensions are proportionate to salary and length of service(see examples in the Annex). No pension is paid until at least ten years havebeen served. The schemes are all contributory, the&apos; empioyee&apos;s contributions varyingin different schemes from between 4 per cent, to 6 per cent, of salary, the employercontributing about twice the amount contributed by the employee.Suitability of the terms of the Staff Schemes4. The majority of full-time Board members have been recruited from thestaff of the industry controlled by the Board and have remained pensionable underthe staff pension scheme of that industry. Subject, to the qualification made inparagraph 6 below, we think that the conditions of these schemes are suitable for board members. We can moreover defend giving Board members the same terms as the staff. More generous terms might be criticised: in particular, since pensions are not appropriate for short-term service, we consider that it is important tomaintain for Board members the condition, common to all the staff schemes exceptthat of the Airways Corporations, that a pension is not granted for less than tenyears&apos; service. We consider that if a member&apos;s service is terminated after less than ten years, whether at the wish of the Minister, by voluntary resignation or onaccount of ill-health, he. should get only, the benefit the staff schemes normallyprovide in such circumstances, namely, a refund of his contributions or a gratuity.5. Under the Statutes regulating these schemes the member who comes from outside the industry cannot be brought into the staff scheme itself. For such members benefits will have to be paid out of Board revenues. There is no diffi-culty about this. The payment of contributions involves, however, one slightcomplication. Since they are not payable under any formal scheme they will notattract income tax relief and we propose that the amount of contribution shall be43420Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952
reduced in these cases to produce approximately the same net contribution as is paid by those acually in the scheme.6. There is one respect, however, in which the staff schemes seem to us not entirely suitable for Board members. We refer to the provision in most of them under which the pensionable salary is limited to  4,000. We.think that this limit is inappropriate for Board members recruited from outside the industry who are on the whole unlikely to have very long service. We propose that the limit shouldbe  5,000.We would not, however, wish to introduce a new discrepancy of treatment between Board members; and as we have already said (in paragraph 4 above) togive Board members more generous terms than the staff might be open to criticism.It follows, therefore, that in our view the limit should also be revised for board members recruited from within the industry and for the staff.The introduction of a  5,000 limit for the members not actually in the staffscheme presents no difficulties at all. But to do the same for the members actually in the staff scheme, and of course for the staff themselves, would require amend-merit of the staff schemes.We understand that there are no technical or other difficulties about making such amendments. On general grounds it would, however, be desirable to post-pone the amendment of the schemes pending the report of the Tucker Committeeon the law relating to superannuation funds.  We accept this.Variations in Special Cases7. Under existing arrangements a Board member who has been recruited froma pensionable post not in the industry controlled by the Board may have made upto him by the Board, when he leaves the Board, the difference between the pension which had accrued from his former employment when he joined the Board andthe pension he would have earned had he remained in his former employment.For this benefit he pays the Board the contributions he would have paid under hisformer pension scheme. We think that this is a reasonable arrangement, subjectto the salary on which pension is based not exceeding the salary as a Board member;and we propose that existing and future members recruited from such employment should be given the option of this arrangement or of the staff scheme.8. The conditions of the staff scheme may be unsuitable for some members or possible members.  In particular (a) A Board member may put in ten years and not be reappointed. It may be unfair to ask him to wait till 65 (the pensionable age under the StaffScheme) before drawing his pension. We propose that there should bediscretion to allow such persons to draw their pension at an earlier age.(b) Some persons whose services are required may be unwilling to serve underthe standard conditions. In such cases we should not rule out themaking of pension arrangements based on insurance policies to be handed over at the end of the appointment, provided that the employees&apos; contributions are not less and the employers&apos; contributionsare not greater than those paid in the normal cases.9. The principles set out in paragraphs 2-8 above can be applied without difficulty to the general run of the Boards of the nationalised industries. Theposition in the Airways Corporations, however, presents special features (some ofwhich are referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4) and, though the general principles setout above are no less appropriate to the Corporations than to the other nationalised industries, their application to the Airways Corporations may call for special consideration.Application to other Public Boards&quot;10. The above principles are based on consideration of the nationalised industries, but they should clearly be applied to other public boards (e.g., theColonial Development Corporation) and we propose accordingly.11. We invite our colleagues to agree that full-time service on a public board should be pensionable on the basis set out in this paper.R. A. B.L.22nd December, 1952. &apos;     &apos;
ANNEXExamples of Pensions earned by Board service. A Chairman of an Area Electricity Board who serves for ten years on a salary of  4,000 would get a pension of 10/80ths and a lump sum of 30/80ths ofretiring salary, viz., pension of  500 and lump sum of  1,500. During service hewould contribute something less than the contribution rate in the staff scheme(5 per cent.) because of the absence of tax relief on contributions. If the memberalso contributed for family benefits, the widow&apos;s pension would be one-third ofhis pension, i.e.,  166 per annum.2. A member of the National Coal Board who serves for fifteen years on a salary of  5,000 would get a pension of  937 and a lump sum of  2,812. If the member also contributed for family benefits, the widow&apos;s pension would be one-third of his pension, i.e.,  312 per annum.3. A member of an Area Gas Board who serves for fifteen years on a salary of  3,000 would get a pension of  725 and his widow would get a pension of  362.
