GOVERNMENT POLICY ON LEASEHOLD PROPERTIN ENGLAND AND WALESPart I introduction. In February, 1948, the Lord Chancellor appointed a Committee under lord Uthwatt (succeeded, on his death in April, 1949, by the Rt. Hon.Lord Justice Jenkins) to consider and report on various matters affectingleasehold property in England and Wales, and in particular:  (1) Leasehold Enfranchisement;(2) Security of tenure for tenants of business premises :(3) Control of rents for business premises;(4) Restrictions on the rights of landlords to impose and enforce cove-nants to repair :(5) Compensation to tenants for improvements on the termination of theirtenancies.2. In March, 1949, the Committee presented an Interim Report (Cmd.7706) recommending temporary legislation on the tenure and rents of busi-ness premises. On this Report, which was not unanimous, the Governmentof the day took no action.3. In June, 1950, the Committee presented their Final Report (Cmd. 7982)*,which again was not unanimous. Eight members of the Committee recom-mehded against any form of Leasehold Enfranchisement. The other two members (Mr. as he then was Ungoed-Thomas, and Mr. Leslie Hale)recommended a limited scheme of Leasehold Enfranchisement. The Com-mittee were unanimous in recommending security of tenure under the rent restriction Acts for certain classes of residential tenant not protected by those Acts. All members of the Committee proposed improved security of tenure for business tenants, subject to a reservation by Mr. Selwyn Lloydin favour of introducing a temporary scheme before deciding on the linesof permanent legislation ; but the two members above-named differed fromthe rest of their colleagues as to the form which the proposals should take.On the other subjects dealt with in the Report, the recommendations werein general unanimous, and a Supplementary Report signed by half the Com-mittee proposed a modified form of security of tenure for tenants of resi-dential premises outside the limits of rateable value prescribed in the rent restriction Acts (i.e.  100 per annum in London and  75 per annum else-where in England and Wales).4. The Labour Government did not put forward any permanent legislation as a result of this Report. Instead, they passed through Parliament the leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Act, 19511. which, very briefly,did two things. First, it extended until Midsummer 1953 on existing terms and conditions any long lease (i.e. for more than 21 years) due to expirebefore that date of a house occupied by the long lessee or his family ; and,second, it gave to tenants of shops (but not of other business premises)a right to apply to the County Court for a renewal, not exceeding one year at a time, of a shop tenancy (whether long or short) due to expire beforeMidsummer, 1953. The Government of the day explained that they werenot in a position to announce their proposals for permanent legislation, whichwould take some time to prepare, and that the purpose of the temporary Act* References to Majority and Minority Reports are to those in the Final Report. -t 14 &amp; 15 Geo. 6. c. 38.
^was to give interim protection to the cases which most needed it and hold^he position open until permanent legislation could be introduced.5. The Government have carefully reviewed the problems dealt with inthe Report of the Leasehold Committee in the light of the position created by the late Governments temporary legislation, and this Paper summarises the views of the Government and the lines of the legislation which they propose to present to Parliament in due course.Part II Leasehold Enfranchisement6. Leasehold Enfranchisement is the general term used to describe various proposals, canvassed from time to time during the past 70 years, for giving a leaseholder the right to acquire compulsorily the freehold interest in his property if and when he chooses, irrespective of the landlords wishes, on terms governed by statute.7. In the working out of any such proposal, two fundamental questionsarise at the outset :  (1) The market value of the landlords interest includes the capital valueof his right to the ground rent and also the capital value of his right tothe reversion of the property. Is the compensation paid by the lease-holder to the landlord to be related to the market value of what the landlord gives up, or is it to exclude so much of that value as is attributable to the landlords reversionary rights?(2) Is the right to enfranchise to be limited to those who live or workin their leasehold properties, or is it to extend also to a leaseholder whodoes not himself occupy the property but sub-lets it i.e. who has invested in the property as a source of income?The answers given by advocates of Leasehold Enfranchisement vary widely.The Minority of the Leasehold Committee gave their answers in favourof the first alternative* in each case. But it is fair to say that many advocates of the principle contemplate that leaseholders should be enabled to obtain their freeholds at a price which, even if it does not ignore altogether thevalue of the reversion, would be substantially less than the market priceof the interest being acquiredf. There are also some who see no reasonto limit the right of enfranchisement so as to exclude the lessee-investor.8. As regards the (irst question, it would be harsh indeed on the landlordto require him not only to submit to the compulsory acquisition of his property by his lessee, but also to accept a price much less than his interest is worth. It is to be remembered that both landlords&apos; interests and lease-holders&apos; interests in leasehold property are, quite legitimately, bought andsold every day at prices which reflect their market worth and take accountof the rights attached to them. Accordingly, where a long lease has been running for many years, it is commonly found (though not, of course, always)that the present landlord is neither the original landlord nor his successorby inheritance, but has bought the interest on the faith of the reversionaryrights attached thereto and at a price reflecting those rights ; and, similarly,that the present leaseholder is neither the original leaseholder nor his successorby inheritance, but has bought the interest for the remainder of the termin. the knowledge that the property would thereafter revert to the landlord,and at a price reflecting that fact. Moreover, the values of interests in lease-hold property, as they exist under the present law, have been the basis notonly of sales and purchases by individuals, but also of investment by trustees,of mortgages, and of many other arrangements entered into in good faith.* Minority Report, paras. 88-98 and 106-111.t Majority Report, paras. 61-62 and Minority Report, para. 67.317554 A 2
In short, the leasehold system has created values which cannot now be,merely destroyed without all the practical complications which are bound tfjfollow large-scale confiscation.9. As regards the second question, if any leaseholder is to be granted a statutory right to enlarge his interest so as to include the freehold, the lease-holder who occupies the property as his house clearly has a greater claimto such a right than the leaseholder who (like the landlord) is concerned inthe property only as a subject of investment.10. In the Governments view, therefore (leaving aside for the moment the question whether any right of compulsory Enfranchisement is in principlejustifiable), the answers given by the Minority of the Leasehold Committeeto the two fundamental questions mentioned in paragraph 7 above were right;and accordingly the Government have examined the arguments in favour ofLeasehold Enfranchisement in the light of the particular scheme* suggestedby the Minority.11. The Minority scheme would give a right of compulsory Enfranchise-ment only to occupying ground lessees of residential property, the purposebeing to enable a long leaseholder, and only a long leaseholder, to enfranchisein respect of his own home, and only of his own home. Thus, the rightwould not extend to any occupier on a short lease, to any leaseholder whodoes not occupy the property but sublets it, or to any leaseholder of business premises not occupied by him as his home. Furthermore, the right wouldnot be extended even to an occupying residential ground lessee if he boughtthe lease during the last 10 years of its term. It was proposed that the price to be paid to the landlord by the leaseholder on enfranchisement should bethe market value of the landlords interest in the property, including of course the value currently attributable to his right of reversion. That value variesaccording to the length of time the lease has still to run. In the early yearsof a long ground lease it approximates to the capital value of the ground rent.Where there are about 25 years left to run, it has generally begun to be very considerably affected by the prospect of the reversion, and it continues to appreciate thereafter until, when the reversion is imminent, it approximatesto the freehold value of the house with vacant possession. The authors ofthe scheme were, however, at the same time proposing certain measures(dealt with in Part III below) to give security of tenure to an occupyingground lessee on the expiry of the ground lease, and they noted that, if those proposals were enacted, the market value of the landlords interestwould be diminished, since the reversion would be not to vacant possessionof the house, but to possession subject to the presence of a sitting tenantprotected under the Rent Restriction Acts.12. The Majority of the Leasehold Committee were opposed to the intro-duction in any form of Leasehold Enfranchisement, their opposition being based mainly on grounds of principle, such as the rights of property, thesanctity of the original contract, and the undesirability of providing by statute for compulsory acquisition of property by private individuals without regardto the public interest.!13. As regards the sanctity of the original contract, the Majority! andMinority? of the Committee found themselves at variance on the questionwhether building leases granted in the past, and particularly the large numbersgranted during the industrial expansion of the middle of the last century,could be regarded as just contracts negotiated by the parties from a position* Minority Report, paras. 88-120.     t Majority Report, paras. 69-103.t Majority Report, paras. 83-86.       g Minority Report, paras. 38-40, 69.
5\pf equality. Some people consider that those building leases wereEssentially an unjust arrangement extorted by landlords with a monopoly,or near-monopoly, of &apos; the available building land, which they were unwilling to sell freehold; and that, although the landlord undoubtedlyhas a right in law to the reversion of the house on the expiry of the groundlease, he has little or none in equity. (Hence the proposition favoured by many advocates of Leasehold Enfranchisement that the compensation forthe ground landlord should be based merely on the capitalised value of theground rent.) (A variation of this argument is based on the view that,whether or not the original lease was freely negotiated, the present value of theproperty depends essentially on the labour and ingenuity of the original lesseeand his successors who have erected, improved, and maintained the buildingson the site, and who have, jointly with other occupiers, contributed to thegrowth of thriving business and residential communities. It is regarded asunjust that the ground landlord, who has contributed nothing save the land,should, on the expiry of the ground lease, be entitled to the return of all this enhanced value.14. Much could be said against these arguments. For instance, it maybe retorted that the ground landlord in mid-Victorian times by no meansalways held a monopoly or near-monopoly of the available land ; in manycases, the tenant preferred to pay a low rent and erect a house to his own requirements, knowing that it would revert eventually to the ground landlord,rather than pay a rack rent for one built by the landlord. Moreover, theground landlord was not merely providing the building lessee with the landfor 99 years : he was also providing him with the development rights forthat period ; and by charging only a small ground rent, not open to reviewwith changing values, he was providing them on very favourable terms. Itwas an essential part of that bargain that the reversion should fall to the landlord at the end of the term. The landlord having performed his part ofthe bargain, the leaseholder should perform his.15. But however all this may be, it is important to stress that, in relationto most forms of Leasehold Enfranchisement which are nowadays advocated,including that advocated by the Minority of the Leasehold Committee, thequestion whether the ground lease is in essence just or unjust is neither herenor there and nothing turns on it at all. For, if building leases negotiated80 or 90 years ago were in general unjust, there is no reason why the rightof enfranchisement should not be extended to all classes of leaseholderunder them, including those who are investors rather than occupiers andthose whose property is used for business purposes. Nor would it be rightto include in the landlords compensation any element representing the rever-commisionary value of the property. Moreover, it cannot be said, even by thosewho think that mid-19th century building leases were in general unjust, thatground leases granted in recent times by, for instance, large estate develop-ment companies were unconscionable bargains extorted by monopolists fromhouse-hunters who had no alternative ; nor yet that such landlords have con-tributed nothing in action to the development of the community. On thecontrary, they attracted their clientele, in competition with municipal housingschemes and facilities for private building, from among people who preferred to live or; these particular housing estates because of the amenities theyoffered. Accordingly, any enfranchisement scheme which is limited tooccupying residential leaseholders, which recognises in its compensation pro-visions the landlords legal right to the reversion, or which extends to modernas well as to Victorian ground leases (and &apos;he scheme proposed by the minority of the Leasehold Committee contains all these features) can derivelittle or no support from an argument that Victorian ground leases were an
injustice imposed by monopolists.   And that argument becomes even morevgunreal when it is remembered that even in the case of Victorian grouncilleases the parties at present concerned very often have no connection at allwith the original parties to the lease.   The matter must clearly be con-sidered on other grounds than this.16. On the other issues of principle discussed in the Leasehold Com-mittee&apos;s Report, more than one view is no doubt possible. There is doubtlessa very natural and widespread desire by occupiers to own their homes,and with this desire the Government, as they have shown in other connec-tions, have great sympathy. It may be conceded that an occupying groundlessee has a greater interest in his home than has an ordinary rack-renttenant, since it is he and his predecessors in title, not the ground landlord,who have had to build and maintain the house. Whether, and (if so) at whatpoint and in what circumstances, this special interest may be held to give to the occupying ground lessee a right (denied to the occupying rack-renttenant) to enlarge his proprietorial interest by compulsorily acquiring the freehold against his landlords wishes, are no doubt more controversialquestions, and the Government are very far from conceding that occupyingground lessees possess such a right as a matter of principle. Their examina-tion of the scheme proposed by the Minority of the Leasehold Committeehas, however, led them to the conclusion that the practical difficulties of application, quite apart from any objections of principle, are likely to prove fatal to the devising of any workable and worthwhile scheme. Themain difficulties in the Minority&apos;s scheme may be summarised as follows.Cost to the Tenant17. The cost of enfranchisement would often be so high that only thewealthier tenants would take advantage of the scheme. At one end of thescale there may be cited a typical South Wales miner&apos;s terrace cottagewith a ground rent of 13s. per annum and a rateable value of  7, whoserack-rent letting value is  26 per annum, including rates and repairs, and whose freehold vacant possession value would now be  300. At the otherend of the scale, take a small terrace house in Belgravia with two rooms on each of four floors, ground rent  41, rateable value  70, letting value  170excluding rates and internal repairs, vacant possession value  7,000. Underthe present law (i.e. no security of tenure for the siting tenant at the endof the lease) the present value of the landlords interest in these houses wouldrespectively be  35 and  3,290 if there are 25 years unexpired,  90 and 4,770 if there are 10 years unexpired, and  210 and  6,700 if there is onlyone year unexpired. If the Security of Tenure provisions referred to inPart III were enacted, these three pairs of figures would become :  35 and 1,850:  75 and  2,150:  140 and  2,725: and these are the figures onwhich compensation would be based undeir the scheme* proposed by the minority of the Leasehold Committee. (These are of course only specimenfigures, representative but subject to wide variation in particular cases.) Thus,although the projected Security of Tenure provisions have considerable effect,the reduction would be more significant in the more expensive type of house, and the resulting figures would remain fairly high.18. In addition to the compensation to the landlord, the other costsfalling on the enfranchiser might be considerable in many cases. Theywould include ordinary conveyancing costs (including stamp duty), costs ofany special legal advice or enquiries, and costs of surveyors advice. Tothese there would be added, in disputed cases, the costs of legal proceedingsso far as they were not recovered from the other party.* Minority Report, paras. 106-111.
A pportionment&apos; 19. If the object of the scheme is to enable an occupier to enfranchisein respect of his own home, he must clearly be neither empowered norcompelled to enfranchise in respect of more than his home. But a groundlease often covers more than one house. If the lessee lives in one and letsoff the others at rack rents, his right should extend only to the one house.If he lets off the others at ground rents, his own right should be similarlylimited, but each sub-lessee must also be entitled to enfranchise in respect ofhis home (as against both the head lessee and the ground landlord). Inall these cases apportionment is necessary, and the pattern of tenure is often much more complex than this. A really scientific formula for appor-tionment, always operating fairly, seems impossible to devise. Every casewill present its own special problems. Values may have shifted and changed since the fixing of the rent to be apportioned: some land may be vacant:services such as roads and sewers may have been provided by the lessee:improved sub-ground-rents may have been obtained: and so on. The only practicable course would be to prescribe some rough-and-ready arithmeticalformula (based, for instance, on site areas or rateable values) and to accept as inevitable the very rough justice which would result.20. This is a very awkward problem, and it can only be avoided if lease-holders who happen to be part of a complicated pattern of tenure are tobe excluded on that account from the right to enfranchise, or, alternatively,if they are to be compelled, as the price of enfranchising their home, to buy the freehold of other houses which they do not occupy. Each of these courses seems very unfair.Exclusion of Late Purchasers21. It would be necessary, as the Minority Report itself recognises,* to exclude from the right of enfranchisement the tenant who purchased onlythe &quot; fag-end &quot; of a long lease. This is not merely to prevent speculation(which could be largely prevented by imposing a minimum period of occupa-tion as a qualification for enfranchisement). The main justification is thatthe man who buys (say) the last 7 years of a lease paying a premium plus a ground rent has really acquired no greater occupational interest than theman who takes a 7-year lease of a house at a rack-rent. Actuarially, and allowing for differences in repairing covenants, he has paid the same sum for the same thing. And he has no greater moral right than the rack-renttenant to enlarge his proprietorial interest compulsorily as against hislandlord.22. It would also seem fair to make a transitional provision protecting fromenfranchisement those landlords who bought before the legislation but within(say) 15 years of the reversion. They will have paid in good faith a sub-stantial sum on account of the reversion and there is therefore a strongpresumption that they bought mainly for the sake of the right to use thepremises on the expiry of the lease, either for their personal occupation or as a perfectly legitimate investment.23. Each of these exclusions seems perfectly fair in itself. The firstdifficulty about them is that they prescribe qualifying periods which can onlybe arbitrary, and any dividing line would be difficult to defend. The second and more serious difficulty is the apparent anomalies which would be created.The first exclusion is quite fair as between different tenants, but it wouldmean that as between two similarly placed Landlords one would be exposed to enfranchisement and the other immune, merely because of the different* Minority Report, para 97.
histories of their tenants. Conversely, the second exclusion is quite fair askbetween different landlords, but it would mean that as between two similarly!?placed tenants one would be able to enfranchise and the other would not,merely because of the different histories of their landlords.Large Estates24. A great deal of leasehold property is comprised in estates consistingof several, often very many, houses. These may be the subject of many different leases, but all with a common ground landlord. This creates anumber of serious difficulties, of which three may be mentioned:  (a) Amenity Covenants. The amenities of the estate are often protected by covenants in the leases. These may be negative (e.g., restrictive ofuser) or positive (e.g., a covenant by the landlord to provide certainamenities and by the tenant to maintain them). It would be an intoler-able injustice to his neighbours if an enfranchising leaseholder were able, on acquiring the freehold, to extinguish any covenants previouslysubsisting between him and his landlord which were taken for thebenefit of the neighbourhood as a whole. His conveyance ought to contain provisions to ensure that he continued to meet the obligationspreviously met by him and his landlord. If the surrounding propertywere to be properly protected, the statute would have to make such provisions compulsory. This raises a number of technical difficulties and a good deal of elaboration would be necessary.(b) Severance of the Estate. Where a landlords interest covers a numberof properties even if his estate consists merely of a single row ofterrace houses it is of course worth much more than the sum of the values of the individual houses. The value of the estate, so long as itretains its integrity, is enormously enhanced by the prospect that whenthe leases expire the property will fall as a whole into the landlordsvacant possession for re-letting or redevelopment. If a single unit passesout of the landlords control, all (or nearly all) this special value dis-appears ; and no landlord would willingly sell his interest in that unit inthe market without getting a price which took account of that fact. Itwould therefore be very unjust if the landlord were not compensated forthis severance on enfranchisement. But the cost to the tenant on anestate of any size would be quite prohibitive, at any rate if he were thefirst tenant on the estate to enfranchise. The second and subsequentenfranchisers could do so much more cheaply. There would thus be an element of fortuitousness and inequity (a) as between tenants of identicalhouses on the same estate enfranchising at different times, and also(b) as between tenants of identical houses on estates of different sizesenfranchising at the same time.(c) Public Interest. Severance of the estate would often be contrary to thepublic interest as well as the landlords, since it would inhibit desirablereconstruction or redevelopment when the leases fall in. This point could be partly (but only partly) met if enfranchisement were barred incases where it could be shown to be contrary to the public interest that is, where reconstruction or redevelopment of the property as awhole at the end of the leases was clearly desirable on grounds ofgood planning. The administration of this provision would probably have to be entrusted to the Local Planning Authority (with an appeal*o the Minister) rather than to a judicial Tribunal. In some cases,particularly where the lease was about to expire, it would be clear enoughthat in the public interest redevelopment was required and enfranchise-ment should be forbidden.   But this exclusion would affect precisely
those leaseholders who are most anxious to enfranchise, and at precisely the point of time when they are most anxious to do so. It might well be felt by them and by others that a scheme which enabled these cases to be excluded on the grounds of public interest was not worth while.On the other hand, it is most unlikely that enfranchisement could inpractice be prevented in all cases where it would in fact turn out tohave been contrary to the public interest, particularly when the enfranchisement-enfranchisement is proposed to take place many years before the end ofthe lease.Publicly-Owned Estates25. It would, in the Government^ view, be necessary to exclude fromthe scheme leasehold property held by public authorities, such as the Com-missioners of Crown Lands, the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, NewTown Development Corporations, and Local Authorities.26. The function of the Commissioners of Crown Lands is to administerreal property. To expose them to enfranchisement would present themwith constant difficulties in finding other land in which to invest, and mightwell reduce their contribution to the Budget revenue. Much the same considerations apply to the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster.27. New Town Development Corporations and local planning authorities(as respects &quot; blitzed &quot; and &quot; blighted &quot; areas) carry out their development by means of the leasehold system. Their activities would be severelyhampered if they were exposed to enfranchisement. And indeed it wouldin general be absurd to give a right of compulsory enfranchisement againsta public authority which itself has rights of compulsory acquisition againstthe potential enfranchises28. The exclusion of all this property would make a very considerable reduction in the scope of the soheme, and thus strengthen the argument that it would not be worth while. But it would also cause some discontent,because leaseholders on public estates would often (be slow to see why theyshould be denied a right to enfranchise which tenants on private estatesenjoyed.Conclusion29. There would no doubt be many other difficulties of detail, and thenecessary legislation would be exceedingly complex, while in the end a lesseeseeking to exercise his statutory right of enfranchisement would find the costs no less and the obstacles in his path hardly fewer than if he sought to negotiate the purchase by agreement. It is therefore necessary to considerwhether, quite apart from questions of principle, legislation on the lines proposed by the Minority would meet any really pressing need.30. There is, of course, nothing in the present law to prevent lesseesfrom enfranchising their leases by voluntary arrangement with their land-lords. There are some landlords in particular, estate companies and otherlandlords of large estates who are unwilling to allow any enfranchisementbecause they wish to preserve the integrity of the estate, both for com-rnercial reasons and for the protection of their other lessees. But thereare many landlords who have no objection to selling the freehold to theirlessees at what they regard as a suitable price. The difficulty generallyarises because the leaseholder is unable, or unwilling, to meet the landlordsprice, either because he objects to paying anything for the reversion, or because he cannot afford it.   If the right given to him by statute is to17554
enfranchise at a price representing the value of the landlords interest includ-ing the reversion, the difficulty remains substantially as before ; and if th(Jleaseholders difficulty is merely that he has not sufficient capital, it is worthpointing out that he can often obtain a loan from his Local Authority forthe purchase of the freehold under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts orunder the Housing Acts.31. The conclusion reached by the Government is that the cost to the lessee, and the various exclusions necessary in order to prevent (which theyonly partially do) the dangers and inequalities which might result fromthe scheme, would in practice limit the number of enfranchisements to something well below what would justify so complex and controversial ameasure. Much litigation would result, and probably some damage to thepublic interest, and in the end the little that would be achieved would beon terms which would satisfy scarcely anyone.32. It would be possible, no doubt, to achieve greater simplicity by ignor-ing these difficulties and making no attempt either to be fair to the landlordor to safeguard the interests of the rest of the community. But, obviously,an indiscriminate and confiscatory scheme (as distinct from that favoured by the Labour members of the Leasehold Committee) would avoid someof the practical difficulties only at the cost of increasing the objectionsof principle. The damage which such a scheme would do to private andpublic interests would have to be carefully assessed, and it would haveto be clearly shown that important countervailing benefits would be obtained by the scheme, and could not be obtained in any other way, before anysuch method of approach could be responsibly defended. The government consider that it would be quite indefensible.33. In the Governments view, the main practical need for long leaseholdersthe expiry of whose leases is in sight, is for security of tenure rather than for freehold ownership, and more good can be done by protecting the rightof occupation than by giving a new right of ownership. The proposalswhich follow are directed to that end, and, if they are enacted, it seemshighly probable that the number of occupying leaseholders who would retain a strong feeling in favour of enfranchising their leases would be substantially diminished.Part III Security of Tenure for Residential Tenants34. Over 90 per cent, of the dwelling-houses in England and Wales are within the limits of rateable value mentioned in the Rent Restriction Acts( 100 in London and  75 elsewhere), and generally speaking all unfurnishedtenancies of these houses are protected by the Acts that is, the rents are controlled and the right of occupation is protected. But under Section 12 (7)of the Act of 1920,* the protection of the Rent Restriction Acts does not extend to a tenant if the rent due under his tenancy is less than two-thirds of the rateable value of the dwelling-house. Nearly all ground rents and improved ground rents are less than that figure, and accordingly the pro-tection of the Acts is usually not available to the occupying ground lesseeof a house on the expiry of his ground lease. The Leasehold Committeewere unanimous in proposing that this exclusion should be abolished theMajorityt because they thought it an unjustifiable anomaly, and the minority^ because, in addition, they considered its abolition a pre-requisite for their scheme of Leasehold Enfranchisement.* 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 17.    t Majority Report, paras. 107-109.J Minority Report, paras. 109-111.
. 35. The Government accept the proposal in the form that, where a. housevhich is within the statutory limits of rateable value is occupied by a tenantunder a tenancy originally granted for more than 21 years, the tenant shallhave security of tenure on the expiry of his tenancy even though the rentunder that tenancy is less than two-thirds of the rateable value. the landlord should, however, be able to prevent a statutory tenancy from arising,and obtain possession of the house on or after the natural expiry of theiong lease, if he is able to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that hereasonably requires possession for the purposes of a scheme of redevelopment,or that circumstances exist such as would entitle him to a possession order under the Rent Restriction Acts if a statutory tenancy were alreadysubsisting.36. The terms of an ordinary statutory tenancy under the Rent RestrictionActs are very different from those of a ground lease. In particular, a rentrelated to the value of occupation is charged and the tenant is not subjectto the onerous repairing covenants normal in a ground lease. Machinerymust be provided to enable a ground lease to be satisfactorily converted into a statutory tenancy. The machinery which the Government proposeis that, unless the tenant is willing to quit, the ground lease should becontinued after its natural date of expiry ; but that the landlord may,on giving suitable notice, either seek possession on statutory grounds or make proposals for the creation of a statutory tenancy. If the tenant hasnot fulfilled his contractual obligations to keep the house in proper repair,the landlords proposals would include proposals about the work necessaryto put the house in a reasonable state of repair. The repairs would becarried out by the landlord, who would be reimbursed either in a lump sum or in instalments by the tenant. The proposals would also cover the reasonable rent for the house as so repaired, and the covenants to be incurredrespectively by the landlord and the tenant in future. Either party wouldhave a right of appeal to a Tribunal in cases of dispute, on any point includedin the proposals. In the Governments view, the Tribunal should be theCounty Court, assisted as necessary by technical Assessors. The reasonablerent as fixed by agreement or by the Tribunal would be the standard rentfor the period of the statutory tenancy.37. The Leasehold Committee were also unanimous in proposing thatthe effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Knightsbridge Estates v.Deeley* should be reversed.! The effect of that judgment was that, wherea tenant at a rent less than two-thirds of the rateable value of the house hassublet to a sub-tenant who occupies the house, that sub-tenant, thoughprotected by the Rent Restriction Acts so long as the mesne tenancy lasts,loses that protection when the mesne tenancy expires. The proposal is thatthe occupying sub-tenant in such a case should, on the expiry of the mesnetenancy, become a direct statutory tenant of the head landlord. The Govern-ment accept this recommendation.38. The Government do not favour the proposal in the supplementary report signed by five members of the Leasehold Committee for a specialsecurity of tenure spheme for tenant-occupiers of houses outside the rate-able value limits of the Rent Restriction Acts.J As stated above, the vast majority of houses are within those limits, and, as regards the remainder,the Government are not aware that the absence of protection is causingsuch a degree of hardship as would justify the enactment of a new andnecessarily somewhat elaborate system of control.* (1950) 1.

Part IV Business Premises -39. Under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927,* a tenant of businefupremises (not including premises used for professional purposes, or premisesheld under a mining lease, or agricultural holdings) may claim from hislandlord compensation for goodwill if he quits the premises at the end ofthe tenancy. Goodwill for this purpose, however, means goodwill due tothe occupation of the premises for the purpose of the business by the tenantand his predecessors in title which increases the letting value of the premisesto a succeeding tenant. This is commonly referred to as &quot; adherent good-will &quot;. It represents, in effect, not the potential loss to the tenant if heleaves the premises, but the potential gain to the landlord on reletting themto someone else It is often very difficult for the tenant to establish theexistence of &quot; adherent goodwill&quot;, or, if he does so, to evaluate it; but, ifhe does establish the existence of &quot; adherent goodwill &apos;\ and further, showsthat compensation based thereon would not fully compensate him for theloss (a proposition much easier to establish), he may then, subject to certain conditions, obtain from the Tribunal a renewal of his tenancyf not exceeding14 years, and otherwise on such terms and conditions, including rent, as maybe prescribed by the Tribunal.40. The Leasehold Committee received much evidence^ to the effectthat the protection which the 1927 Act sought to afford to business tenantswas insufficient, and that, the conception of &quot; adherent goodwill&quot; beingexceedingly difficult to operate in practice, the structure built thereon hadnot worked out as well as was intended. Both the Majorityg and the minority[[ were therefore in favour of substantial amendment of the 1927 Act,so as to put security of tenure first and compensation second i.e. to makerenewal of the tenancy the tenanfs first claim and compensation for non-renewal a secondary recourse only. They also recommended that the scopeof the protection should be extended so as to include tenants of premisesused for professional purposes. They differed, however, as to the detailsof the scheme which should be enacted to carry out these proposals, and, as mentioned in paragraph 3 above, one member of the Committee thought itpremature to decide on a permanent scheme without preliminary experienceof a temporary one.^I41. Part II of the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1951,is confined in its scope to tenants of shops. It provides that they may applyto the County Court for a renewal, not exceeding a year at a time, of atenancy expiring during the period of the Acfs operation, a reasonable rentfor the renewal being fixed by the Court. Considerable use has been madeof this Act, but, since it is confined to shops and allows only for short-termrenewals, it is in no sense such an amendment of the 1927 Act as was contemplated by the Leasehold Committee.42. The Government accept the general proposition of the LeaseholdCommittee that improved security of tenure should be made available toall business tenants as a permanent measure, including tenants of premisesused for professional purposes. They also endorse the unanimous view ofthe Leasehold Committee that the conceptions of &quot; statutory tenant&quot; and&quot; standard rent&quot; which are the basis of the Rent Restriction Acts shouldnot be applied in relation to business premises, and that no attempt shouldbe made to control the rents charged on first Settings of business premises.*** 17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c. 36, Section 4.t Section 5 of the 1927 Act. t Majority Report, paras. 122-141.8 Majority Report, paras. 142-151.

g^But as regards detailed application they do not consider that either thefPcheme put forward by the Majority or that put forward by the Minoritywould be wholly satisfactory ; in their view a new approach is required.43. In the Governments opinion the landlord of business premises, when an existing tenancy comes to an end, should have the right to resume posses-sion himself if he requires the premises for the purpose of his own business or for the purpose of a scheme of redevelopment. If, hov/ever, he does not require the premises for himself for one of these purposes, he is entitled aslandlord to a fair contemporary market rent for the premises neither morenor less ; and if the sitting tenant is willing and-able to pay that rent andto enter into other reasonable terms of tenancy, then the sitting tenant has agreater right than any alternative tenant to the tenancy on those terms.Unless, therefore, he is in substantial breach of his covenants, or is otherwisean unsatisfactory tenant, or has declined an offer of suitable alternative accommodation, or has failed to exercise a reasonable contractual optionfor renewal of his tenancy, the sitting tenant ought to be entitled to obtain a renewed tenancy without proof of &quot;adherent goodwill&quot;! (By &quot;sittingtenant &quot; is meant a tenant who is in occupation. No special consideration is due at the end of his tenancy to a tenant who has sublet and does notoccupy ; in such a case, it is the occupying sub-tenant who should be ableto look for security of tenure.) In case of dispute, he should be able toapply accordingly to a Tribunal, who would be empowered to fix a reasonablecontemporary rent on a statutory formula and the other terms of the tenancy,as is done under the 1927 Act. The Tribunal under the 1927 Act is theCounty Court, but each case is usually first sent to one of a panel of referees. For the new legislation the Government propose that the tribunal should, as proposed in paragraph 36 above for the new legislation on occupy-ing ground lessees, be the County Court, cases being heard by the Judge,assisted as necessary by assessors. There would be provision whereby casesinvolving important amounts would be heard in the High Court instead ofthe County Court.44. Such a scheme would be in general conformity with the presentnormal practice of good landlords. The landlords&apos; legitimate interests wouldbe fully preserved, while the sitting tenant who wished to continue in thepremises could not be forced to outbid the fair market rent as the price of doing so. Nor could he be turned out in favour of a bidder prepared topay the landlord a big price for the superior interest with vacant possession.45. The statutory formula for the reasonable rent to be charged to thesitting tenant would have to provide for the exclusion of any value attri-attributable to a tenant&apos;s improvements and tenanfs goodwill. These reductions would, of course, do no damage io the landlord, since under the existing law, if the tenancy were not renewed, the landlord would have to pay compensation to the tenant on the basis of those values.46. There remains the question of the compensation which ought to bepaid to the tenant if, under the above scheme, he seeks but fails to get a renewal of his tenancy.47. Compensation for improvements is provided for in the 1927 Act.*The Leasehold Committee proposed various minor adjustments in the Act&apos;sprovisions about business improvements, and the Government in generalendorse their proposals.!48. Compensation for loss of goodwill is, however, a much more difficult question.    As mentioned above,! the basis of &quot; adherent goodwill&quot; has* Sections 1-3.      f Majority Report, paras. 287-300.I In para. 39.:
been proved in practice to be unsatisfactory. On the other hand, corny-,pensation based on disturbance or the totality of the loss which the tenarfc&apos;might conceivably attribute to his failure to obtain renewal (including removalexpenses and potential diminution of trading profits in alternative premises)would be very difficult to evaluate justly, would probably lead to muchuncertainty and litigation, and would sometimes be an inequitably onerousburden on the landlord.49. The Government consider that the tenant is entitled to compensationonly if his failure to obtain a renewal is in no way attributable to anythingdone or omitted to be done by himself. In other words, the right to com-pensation should be limited to those cases where the tenant has soughtrenewal but the landlord has succeeded in getting possession for the purposesof his own business or of redevelopment, and should not extend to caseswhere the tenant&apos;s failure to obtain renewal has been due to the fact that heis in breach of his covenants or is otherwise an unsatisfactory tenant, or has declined an offer of suitable alternative accommodation, or has failed toexercise a reasonable contractual option for renewal of his tenancy.50. As for the amount of the compensation, it is highly desirable to providea formula which is both simple and certain in its operation, so that both parties know that, when compensation becomes payable, there need be nodispute about the amount due under statute ; it is also an advantage if,when the lease is entered into, both parties know, at any rate within broadlimits, what is the probable order of iniquitude of any compensation whichmay become due on the expiry of the lease. These advantages are lackingin the scheme of the 1927 Act, and even if the formula is arbitrary and does not precisely match the merits of every individual case, the Govern-meht consider that these objections are outweighed by the fact that a simple formula would facilitate negotiations on the granting of the lease and prevent much dispute and litigation on its expiry. The government therefore propose that the compensation, where payable, should be a sumequal to the rateable value of the premises in question where the tenant hasbeen in occupation for not more than 14 years, and to a sum equal to twicethat value when the tenant has been in occupation for more than 14 years.51. Where, however, the tenanfs period of occupation is a short one,and the tenancy was entered into by both parties in the knowledge thatat its expiry the landlord would require possession either for his ownbusiness or for redevelopment, there is little case in equity for compensation to the tenant, and to provide a statutory right to compensation, with noexceptions and no power to contract out of it, might be an unnecessarycomplication, tending merely to inflate the rent asked by the landlord whengranting the tenancy. Provision should therefore be made for excluding thecompensation provisions of the scheme in such cases ; this could be done byprescribing in the Act, or by enabling the parties to prescribe by agreement,that no compensation should be payable if, on the expiry of the tenancy, thetenant had been in occupation for less than, say, five years. (The government agree with the Leasehold Committee* in thinking that there should be no power to contract out of the provisions regarding security of tenure.)52. The relevant provisions of the 1927 Act apply only where the tenantor his predecessors in title have been in occupation of the premises for thepurposes of the business for 5 years or more.f The Majority of the leasehold Committee thought that this qualification should be reduced to3 years.l The Government consider that in their scheme as outlined above,including as it does a power to contract out of compensation in the caseof short tenancies, no qualifying period is called for.* Majority Report, paras. 137-140.      f Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927 S.4(l).$ Majority Report, para. 177.
53. The Government reserve for further consideration the manner of theApplication of the scheme to cases where the landlord is a GovernmentJepartment or other public authority. Various other refinements of detailwould be necessary in the scheme, but it would remain more simple andmore certain in its operation than that of the 1927 Act. It would of coursealso supersede Part II of the temporary Act of 1951. The respective rightsof the parties would be clear, and could if necessary be established before theTribunal without undue trouble, dubiety or expense, because they would depend primarily on the facts of the case, not on the prior satisfaction of a formula or formulae whose application to the particular case would be amatter for legal argument, with results not always consonant with the realdeserts of the parties. Under such a scheme the parties would have everyincentive to settle by agreement on reasonable terms without going to theTribunal.Part V. Miscellaneous Matte.rsImprovements54. The Leasehold Committee&apos;s proposals for amending the existing lawabout business improvements are mentioned in paragraph 47 above. TheCommittee also recommend that provision should be made for compensation to be paid by the landlord to a residential tenant in respect of improvements(other than covenanted improvements) carried out by him during his tenancy(whether short or long).* The Government are not in favour of thisproposal, mainly because improvements carried out in residential premises are so largely a matter of taste and personal preference, and it is often verydifficult to assess what increase in the letting value of the premises is dueto them. Moreover, the landlord often means himself to live in the housewhen the tenancy expires: an improvement proposed by the tenant maybe one which the landlord is quite willing to allow but would not personallyprefer or could not personally afford. It would be hard on the landlordif, in such a case, he had to pay to the outgoing tenant compensation for something which he would himself as soon be without. The government recognise that in principle there is no reason why the landlord of residentialpremises (any more than the landlord of business premises) should be enabled to reap additional letting value which is due to improvements paid for bya tenant under a tenancy which has just expired. On the other hand, this does little harm to the late tenant, who put the improvement in for his ownenjoyment during his tenancy and would not have done so if he had not thought that that enjoyment was worth his while. Generally speaking,improvements to residential premises, as distinct from business premises, arenot dictated by any economic considerations or any attempt by the tenantto secure a financial return.Repairs55. The Leasehold Committees terms of reference directed them toconsider the desirability of further restrictions on the rights of landlordsto impose and enforce covenants to repair. The Committee found that,although certain hardship was suffered by leaseholders faced with majoroutlay on repairs towards the end of their leases hardship that is of courseaccentuated by the heavy cost of repairs at the present time it proceedednot so much from the nature of the covenants, or from the severity of theirenforcement by the landlords, as from the accumulated dilapidations resultingfrom the lessees&apos; ignorance or neglect of their contractual obligations duringthe earlier years of the term.t* Majority Report, paras. 280-286. f Majority Report, paras. 236-238 and 260-266.
56. The Committee, therefore, after careful examination of alternativemeasures, concentrated principally on measures for the removal of doubtfand uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the obligations imposed byleases where nothing specific has been said in the documents. To this endthey recommended the enactment of a code of standard covenants, includingrepairing covenants ; and proposed that this code should be deemed to beincluded in leases and tenancy agreements unless the parties agreed otherwisein specific terms. * This proposal was designed also to save trouble and expense in connexion with the conveyance. The Government accept thisrecommendation in principle, though the preparation of the code will requiremuch expert consideration, and the Government propose to seek appropriateadvice before presenting such a code to Parliament. It will also be necessaryto consider carefully what classes of tenancy are to be within the scope ofthe code.57. The Leasehold Committee also recommended the extension of the leasehold Property (Repairs) Act, 1.938,f so as to apply to all classes of premises, whether residential or business and irrespective of rateable value,and so as to be available to tenants under leases originally granted for termsof seven years or more, until the lease has less than three years to run.:f.58. The main effect of the Act is that when a tenant is faced with a heavy claim for dilapidations, he can claim the protection of the Act. the landlord can then proceed to his remedy (viz. damages or forfeiture of the lease) only with the consent of the County Court, which will not be givenunless one of a number of conditions is fulfilled. The Government agreethat the proposed extension of the Act&apos;s scope should prove of great value to a number of tenants who are hard-pressed by economic circumstances and ought to be enabled to have their cases considered by the Court particularly people of moderate means who are tenants of large houses(generally converted into several dwellings) outside the  100 limit of rateable value at present prescribed in the Act. The Government therefore favourthis recommendation in principle.Restrictive Covenants59. The model code described in paragraph 56 would include ah thecovenants customarily found in leases. Beyond this recommendation, the leasehold Committee made certain recommendations for the revision ofthe law relating to restrictive covenants. Under the present law, a covenantnot to assign or sublet without the landlords consent is construed as providing that such consent is not to be unreasonably withheld.? The LeaseholdCommittee proposed!! that an absolute covenant against assignment or sub-letting should be construed as a covenant not to assign or sublet withoutthe landlords consent ; this would attract the provision of the existing law that such consent is not to be unreasonably withheld. The government accept this recommendation in principle though care must be taken to safe-guard the control exercised in the interests of good housing policy and estate management.60. The Leasehold Committee also proposed that, covenants against changes of userfl without the landlords consent should be construed as providing that such consent is not to be unreasonably withheld (as is already the lawin the case of covenants about assignment and subletting and about the* Majority Report, paras. 266-273.J Majority Report, para. 246.II Majority Report, paras. 309-311.t 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 6. c. 34.S Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927 S. 19(1).If Majority Report, para. 312.
making of improvements*) ; and, further, that absolute covenants against:&quot;:&apos;le making of improvements and changes of user should be construed as-covenants not to act without the landlords consentf (such consent not to beunreasonably withheld).  The Government accept these proposals in principle.61. The Leasehold Committee made a number of other recommendations on miscellaneous matters in Chapters VI, VII and VIII of their final report. Some of them appear to the Government to be difficult to implementin legislative form, but they none of them raise any important issues ofprinciple, and the Government reserve their final view about them.62. The Government propose to prepare legislation on the general lines indicated in the above paragraphs, for presentation to Parliament at thefirst convenient opportunity. The opportunity is not likely to arise duringthe current Session, and the Government are therefore presenting to Parlia-ment a Bill extending for a further year, until Midoummcj^l954, the provisionsof the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1951.* Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927 S.19(2).t Majority Report, paras. 306 and 312. .(17554)   Wt, 1219-1931   12, 101, 98   12/52   O.L.
