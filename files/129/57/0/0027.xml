CONFIDENTIAL /--- ^C.(52) 427 COPY NO. -_ \2ND DECEMBER, 1952CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH ARGENTINANote by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate for consideration by my colleagues a Report by the overseas negotiations Committee on the trade negotiations with Argentina.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S0W.l.2ND DECEMBER, 1952.1.    On 18th November theCabinet agreed (C.C0(52) 95th ConclusionSf, Minute 5)that negotiations for an agreement with Argentina should be continued withthe aim of reaching a settlement involving as few as possible of the concessionsdemanded by the Argentines;    and that the decision made at the same time bythe Cabinet to reduce the meat ration to Is. 8d. from 30th November shouldbe used to induce a more reasonable attitude on the part of the argentine government.2. In the light of these decisions, H.Me Ambassador was told that heshould extract all possible value from the improved meat position and theannouncement of the new meat ration level.   He was authorised to make variousconcessions in negotiation (for example, on canned corned meat, coal andtinplate).   As regards credit, he was told that we were not prepared to agreeto any repurchase of dollars out of the ere dit.   Subject to this, he could offer a credit of more than  10 millions and if absolutely necessary go up to 20 millionsa3. The Ambassador now reports that in his view negotiations will breakdown, unless we make some further concession in regard to the repurchaseof dollars.   This is a point of principle for them, and they will not, he considers,be influenced by our meat position.   The details qf the Argentine request are discussed in paragraphs 6-13 below.   The consequences of a breakdown are discussed in paragraphs 14 et seq. below.4. The Ambassador is convinced that no purpose will be served byprolonging the negotiations on the present basis.   Unless we are prepared to wait indefinitely for an agreement, we must be prepared to agree on principles
cpin time to sign one before Christmas,   He points out that after the Christmasand New Year holidays, January is, in Argentina, practically a dead month and Argentine interest may evaporate.   Moreover, if there is continued delay,the danger of press leakage and hostile comments will increase..5, As regards questions other than credit, the difference between our negotiators and Argentines has been narrowed,,       For example, theArgentine pilot price for beef has come down to  169, 10s. Od. per ton;we have been aiming at an outside figure of  160,   We have not yet obtainedany firm promise of concessions for our less essential exports, butH.M. Ambassador considers that we might get some concession (at least on paper), if we can meet them on the repurchase of dollars.   The position on lessessentials is dealt with in paragraphs 17=19 below.The use of the credit for repurchase of dollars6. Under last year&apos;s Protocol the Argentines were given a credit of  20 millions which they did not in fact use.   This provision lapsed with the expiry of the Protocol itself on 23rd April, 1952.   Since then, the Argentineshave been short of sterling and they have sold us dollars to the extent of$39, 2 millions ( 14 millions) in order to pay for current purchases, largelyoil,.7. The Argentines have insisted on the right to repurchase thedollars which they have sold to us.   This is not a right which we normallyor automatically allow to countries which have bought sterling with dollars;but we were prepared, as a concession, to give this right to the Argentines,provided that the credit which we were also conceding to them was not tobe used for this purpose.   As stated in paragraph 8 of C. (52) 400, it wouldbe very difficult to justify lending sterling which would be immediatelyused to reduce our gold reserve,80 The Argentines have agreed not to make a direct use of the credit for this purpose.   But it was not enough to say that the credit shouldnot be used directly to finance the repurchase of dollars;  if that were theonly condition, there would be nothing to prevent the Argentines from first usingany temporary surpluses of sterling to repurchase dollars and subsequentlydrawing on the credit to meet expenditure which those surpluses could havebeen kept to meet.   We had to ensure that over the period of the new agreement as a whole they would not have secured any net repurchase of dollars except to the extent that over that period they had a genuine surplus.   We, therefore,devised a formula which included provision that they should sell back to usany dollars which they might have already repurchased, before they could drawon the credit,90 The Argentines have refused to accept this condition.   They have always attached great importance to the inclusion of reciprocal credit inany trade agreement.   They argue that the credit provision in last year&apos;sProtocol was for them a permanent new payments arrangement and ought tohave continued uninterrupted after 23rd April, 1952.   In that case, of course,they would not have needed to sell us dollars but could have drawn on the credit.   They therefore consider that they have a &quot;moral&quot; right to repurchasethe dollars and keep them, whatever credit they may subsequently receive from us.10. These arguments do not conform with the terms of the Protocol.Last year&apos;s credit provision lapsed with the Protocol itself;  and in the subsequent negotiations, having regard to the change in our financial positionand policies, our original aim was to avoid any repetition of the credit.
Moreover, if their inability to sell us the goods we needed since April, 1952, has left them short of sterling, it has at the same time forced us to make our purchases elsewhere for dollars.11. If we accept the present Argentine demand, it is clear that theywill ultimately be using the credit to retain the dollars repurchased before the credit is drawn upon:  this has the same effect as the direct use of the credit to repurchase dollars.   Already, by limiting imports, by running up commercialarrears, and by refusing any financial remittances, they are building up asterling balance in anticipation of the new Agreement.   And they themselvesestimate that they will have a surplus in the first half of 1953 and a deficit in the second half.   Either by artificial adjustments of their payments and receipts, or through seasonal variations, they can secure the repurchase of dollars without having a genuine surplus, i. ee at the expense of the credit.There would be no practicable safeguards against this012. It is true that, if and when they repay the credit, the position will be the same as if the dollars had been repurchased out of a genuine surplus -a facility which we have already agreed to grant to the Argentines.   But (a) the credit does not have to be repaid till the end of 1954, and (b) as stated inparagraph 11(a) of C.(52) 400, there is a real risk that the Argentines will notin fact be able to repay it.   The burden and the risk are all on our side, and indeed if the Argentine argument were put forward honestly there is no reason why they should not accept our own formula.13. We must recognise, therefore, that if we concede this demand,we shall be faced with a prospect of the very early loss of S&apos;39 millions fromthe reserves, and this loss will be financed (indirectly but none the less really)out of the sterling which we shall ourselves be creating to lend to the Argentines,,The effect of a breakdown on our meat supplies14. If we were to break off negotiations with the Argentines on therepurchase of dollars (which our Ambassador advises would lead to a serious deterioration in relations) we should have to be prepared to face a situationin which no meat would be shipped from Argentina indefinitely - in fact (ashappened in 1950/51) until such time as we decided to resume negotiations0   TheMinistry of Food have stressed their view that in such circumstances we shouldalmost certainly end up by paying a much higher price for meat than if we avoid a break but the more immediate consequences of loss of Argentine supplies would be the reduction of the meat ration in the first half of next year,,   It was stated in the report of the Overseas Negotiations Committee attached toC. (52) 400 that without Argentine supplies it would be necessary at the end ofMarch to reduce the ration probably to Is. 6d.   Since then slaughterings ofhome killed cattle have declined to an extent which has necessitated reducingthe estimates of supplies in the last three months of the year by nearly30,000 tons.   On the best current estimates the Ministry could not safelyforecast a ration of more than Is, 4d. without Argentine supplies from thebeginning of April until the autumn, which having regard to the change in prices,would be little more than the ration level in the early months of 1951,   In thesecond half of 1953 ration levels would not be seriously affected but we shouldend the year with totally inadequate stocks for the maintenance of a reasonableration in the first half of 1954.15. In the light of our Ambassador&apos;s latest advice the Ministry ofFood take the view that abandonment of negotiations for a bulk purchase contract infavour of a system of spot buying for meat would provide no solution to theirproblem.   In different circumstances there might be some advantages to be derived from such a change;  but the Ministry have no doubt that if we now told the Argentines that we intended to make spot purchases of meat and abandon the
Efforts which we have been making throughout these negotiations to reach agreement on a bulk purchase, they would in fact get little or no meat at thetime when we most want it.   It is true that the Argentines are desperatelyshort of sterling and to withhold their meat would only accentuate their difficulties.   But they do earn sterling from the export of other commodities on past experience their own economic interests are no safe guide to theiractiors.   Our Ambassador advises that the Ministry would have to pay a much higher price for such small quantities as they might pick up.   (It should beborne in mind that the Argentine Government maintain a complete and rigidcontrol over all meat exports; there would be no scope for private traders tosell us meat without specific authority for each transaction from the argentine government),16. A breakdown in the negotiations would have wider implications.There have been welcome signs in the last twelve months that theArgentine Government have at last realised the necessity of putting their agricultural production on a sound economic basis;   if the first negotiations totake place between Argentina and her largest customer for primary producesince this change in the direction of her economic policy are to end in a deadlock there is a serious risk that the good results of the change will beundone and the expansion of Argentina&apos;s surpluses of agricultural produce for &apos;export will be halted.   This would be a serious blow to United Kingdom prospects of supplies of feeding stuffs as well as meat.Less Essentials17. In the last negotiations we secured only a vague statement of intention about Argentine import licences for our less essentials including such goods as textiles, motor cars, pottery, glassware and other consumer goods.   Therewas considerable criticism by industry of our having been content with this,18, In the present talks we have said that if the Argentines donot license our less essentials we wiLl cease to issue import licences for theirs,i. e, refuse to admit goods which we have always taken in spite of their unsatisfactorytreatment of our consumer goods.   We asked for a firm  5 millions worth of licences and we also sought to obtain concessions for our consumer goods inreturn for taking canned corned meat.19. Our negotiators think that if we meet the Argentines on the dollarrepurchase point the most we could expect is a promise of licences for  2-3 millions of our consumer goods.   This will look better than what we secured last timebut we must be under no illusion that the licences will necessarily be issued.   Solong as the Argentines need to buy goods necessary to their economy they will try to avoid spending their sterling on consumer goods.General Considerations20. There are even more general considerations v/Mch suggest thatwe should do our utmost to avoid a breakdown - the deterioration which wouldbe inevitable in political relationships, the possibility of a complete breakdown in economic relations with a virtual suspension of trade, which might drive the argentines to other markets, e. g. to the United States for coal, to Persia for oiland to Germany for manufactured g 5ods.    We should also get no satisfactionfor the claims of British utility companies and the pensions paid to Britishex-employees of the former British-owned Argentine railways would been dangered.
21. H.M. Ambassador advises that it will not be possible to secure an agreement unless we concede the Argentine demands on repurchase of dollars.   Without an Agreement, we shall not secure Argentine meat in anyadequate quantity (the possibility of arranging spot purchases of meat has been examined and it does not present an alternative).22. Ministers are. therefore asked to decide whether or not toauthorise H.M. Ambassador to accept the Argentine demand that they should,when drawing on the credit, be free to retain any dollars which they mayalready have repurchased.   This authority would be subject to any limit whichhe may be able to negotiate on the amount of dollars to which the concessionwill apply.
