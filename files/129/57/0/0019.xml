(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret, (52) 419 copy no^22nd NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETRELEASE OF ALAN NUNN MAY FROM PRISONMemorandum by the Home SecretaryDr. Alan Nunn May was convicted at theCentral Criminal Court on1st May, 1946, of communicating information contrary to the Official secrets act and was sentenced to ten years&apos; imprisonment.   Under the Prison Rules a prisoner may earn the remission of up to one-third of his sentence by good conduct and industry.   Nunn May&apos;s behaviour has been good and he has earnedthe maximum remission.   Provided he continues to behave well, he will becomedue for discharge on 29th December, 1952.   Discharge would be unconditional.2, It has been suggested that Nunn May&apos;s release will give rise to public anxiety in this country and to unfavourable comment in the United Statesand   in Canada and that it would therefore be right to withhold the remissionwhich he has earned and to detain him until his sentence expires in 1956.3, It is true that in law a prisoner could be detained until theexpiration of his sentence and could not claim damages for wrongful imprisonmentif he were so detained, but in practice if a prisoner does not forfeit any remissionby misconduct he is released automatically after he has served two thirds ofhis sentence without any reference to the Prison Commissioners or theSecretary of State.   The Prison Rules, which are statutory instruments submittedto Parliament, contemplate that a prisoner will be able to earn remission of up to one-third of his sentence by good conduct and industry, and a prisonernaturally assumes that, if he behaves well, he will be able to earn the normalremission and will only have to serve two-thirds of his sentence.   Indeed, a cardposted up in his cell informs him to this effect.   The terms of the PrisonRules are well known and the court, in fixing what it regarded as an appropriatesentence of ten years&apos; imprisonment, had in mind that Nunn May would, subjectto good conduct, be released after serving six years and eight months.   The factthat he will be due for discharge at the end of December was mentioned inthe Press some time ago and is therefore common knowledge.   To deprivehim at the last moment of the fruits of his good behaviour, when throughout hissentence he has been led to believe that he could earn the normal remission of sentence, would be open to criticism on the ground that it was arbitrary andunjust, and involved a gross breach of faith.   No comparable action has been takenin any case for at least forty years.4, I recognise that Nunn May&apos;s release must inevitably give cause for anxiety.   His information may no longer be up  to date, but his abilities remain,and when he is released, there will be no power under which he could be prevented from leaving this country and going to any other country which might wish to make use of his services,   He could not, however, in any event be detained beyond 30th April, 1956, and in my view the risks attendant on his
release are likely to be less if he is released in the normal course than ifthe exceptional course were taken of detaining him until the end of hissentence and then releasing him in an inevitably embittered state of mind0This is a judgment on the psychological probabilities based on the views which those who have seen him in prison have formed,   I am not technicallyqualified to assess how important his knowledge would be now or how much less important it would be in three years&apos; time,5,       No doubt Nunn May&apos;s release will receive much publicity in the press and it may be that it will be criticised in the United States and it isunfortunate that his release date should be reached at a time when we have some hope of persuading the Americans to exchange information aboutatomic secrets.   Under the United States federal law, however, any prisonerserving more than one year may be released on parole when he has reserved only one-third of his sentence.6.       For the reasons I have given, I do not consider that it would be right to deprive Nunn May of the remission of sentence which he hasearned by his good conduct, but I have thought it right to bring thematter to the notice of my colleagues.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.1,22nd NOVEMBER, 1952.
