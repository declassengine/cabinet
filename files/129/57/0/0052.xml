Printed for the Cabinet. December 1952SECRETC (52) 45223rd December, 1952CABINETMEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMONWEALTH:  THE sudan memorandum by Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate herewith a Paper, with which the Foreign Secretary and theColonial Secretary are in agreement, on the question of a possible application by theSudan to join the Commonwealth and whether preliminary soundings should betaken of other Commonwealth Governments as to their attitude towards such anapplication.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,23rd December, 1952.Copy No.At the meeting on 6th November (C.C. (52) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 4) theCabinet invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation with the foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary, to consider and report to the Cabinet on theproblems involved in admitting to full Commonwealth Membership colonial territories which might in future attain the status of &quot; independence within theCommonwealth.&quot; A paper on this subject is being prepared and will be submittedas soon as possible. The present paper is concerned with the question, which wasalso discussed at the Cabinet, of a possible application by the Sudan to join theCommonwealth, and whether preliminary soundings should be taken of other commonwealth Governments as to their attitude towards such an application.2. As to the likelihood of such an application, the majority of Sudanese are on the whole reasonably well-disposed towards us at present. There are, however,wide divergencies between different sections of Sudanese opinion. The rivalrybetween Sayed Abdel Rahman el Mahdi and Sayed Ali Mirghani, which is bothpersonal and religious, the difference in outlook between the relatively well-educated politicians of the towns and the backward tribesmen in more remoteareas, and the widely differing racial, religious, economic and cultural interests ofthe South as compared with those of the North, all make it difficult for the sudanese to agree among themselves on any controversial issue, such as their future status. It is probably true, however, that the majority of Sudanese, among those who are politically conscious, wish at present to be free from British tutelage.In so far as they are still ready to accept British help and advice, this may be attributed principally to the fear that, if that help and advice were suddenly with-drawn, the Sudan might fall under the domination of Egypt. The Sudan has reached a stage in its political history where it may be subject to strong influencesfrom several quarters, and future developments there are therefore almost impos-sible to predict. But it seems at the moment unlikely, though possible, that on the attainment of independence the Sudan will apply to become a Member of theBritish Commonwealth, unless it were our definite policy to take appropriate steps in order to bring about such an application.43428
3. From the point of view of our foreign relations there seems in fact to belittle advantage in trying to bring about such an application. Although on general grounds it is in our interest that the Sudan should remain on good terms with usafter independence has been achieved, it should be possible to ensure this by other means than fostering any inclination which there may be on the part of the Sudaneseto enter the British Commonwealth. The Sudan has no positive contribution tomake to the Commonwealth on the political side; admission to the Commonwealthmight, however, encourage the Sudanese to expect help from the United Kingdom.Certainly any encouragement now by us of the Sudanese to enter the Common-wealth would greatly complicate our relations with Egypt and might indeed spoilthe good effect of any agreement which we may reach with her. In the short run,it would certainly be bad for the Sudan, since it would inevitably deep&amp;n andconfirm the various cleavages in Sudanese opinion already referred to. Strate-gically there would be no advantage to us in having the Sudan in the Common-wealth, although we shall probably wish to obtain communications facilities in theSudan.4. On the economic side our main interest in the Sudan is in the purchase ofcotton. In order that we may be sure that this cotton is available to us forsterling, it is highly desirable that the Sudan should become a full member of the sterling area once it has its own independent currency. The entry of the Sudaneseinto the Commonwealth might help to ensure this. It is unlikely that entry intothe Commonwealth would bring preferential treatment to British exports to theSudan, since we could not offer preferential treatment to Sudanese exports to theUnited Kingdom. Generally speaking, almost all our requirements in the Sudanwould be met just as well by means of a Treaty and other suitable forms ofagreement.5. There is a contrary argument deriving from a feeling that it would be unwise and undesirable to disappoint the Sudanese if they showed themselves keento apply for Membership. This argument might outweigh others if in fact the sudanese do apply to become Members of the Commonwealth. In that event we might have to consider their application very seriously. But there does not appearto be any case, from the point of view of foreign policy, for our trying now todevelop the growth of such a desire in the Sudan, though we should of coursedo our best to foster friendly feelings towards us there, and we should also avoid any action which might be construed as closing the door now upon the possibilityof any future application by the Sudan for Membership of the BritishCommonwealth.6. From the point of view of Commonwealth relations, it is clear that if theSudan were to apply to join the Commonwealth she would be doing so in the capacity not of a dependent territory, but of a fully sovereign independent foreign country. This rules out the possibility that she would be prepared to consideradmission on any status lower than that of full Membership of the Commonwealth,with its essential attributes, namely, attendance at Prime Ministers&apos; meetings andparticipation in the process of consultation on matters of common concern. Itis, however, clear that the Sudan is both too immature and too weak to make any significant or responsible contribution to the higher counsels of the Commonwealth.Moreover, she could not be admitted without prior consultation with all the existing members, of whom South Africa, at any rate under her present Government, wouldcertainly not agree. Finally, an application from the Sudan for admission to full membership would inevitably raise the whole question of the admission to a similarstatus of the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other Colonial territories at or near a com-parable stage of development. It would be clearly undesirable to embark on discussions with other Commonwealth Governments on issues of such a complex and controversial character, fraught as they are with difficulties and dangers tothe whole structure of the Commonwealth, without preparation and before we ourselves have evolved a considered policy on the matter.7. There are, however, other considerations, to which the Colonial Office attach importance and which must be taken into account. We have frequently repeated that our aim for the Colonial Territories is &quot; self-government within the Common-Wealth.&quot; Although latterly at any rate, care has been taken to point out that thisis not necessarily the same as full Membership of the Commonwealth, the effect has been to arouse in the larger Colonial territories an expectation of ultimateadmission to full Membership and, if this is denied, some of them may choose to
part company with us rather than accept indefinitely an inferior status. Thedecisions already taken regarding Ceylon, India and Pakistan imply that we have turned our back on the conception of a Commonwealth of Nations deriving its strength and inspiration from homogeneity in race, culture, religion and tradition.These new Members were all formerly dependencies of the United Kingdom; itis the United Kingdom which sponsored their admission to Membership, and hassecured the acceptance by the other Members of a loosely knit Commonwealth ofa new character. The United Kingdom at least cannot refuse to take the same line with other dependencies which reach the stage of independence. Although theSudan is not strictly a British dependency, yet if that territory, having reached the stage of choice, elects to remain outside, this might well weaken the forces in theGold Coast and Nigeria, at present in the ascendant, which see the independentfuture of those territories as lying within the Commonwealth. Any rebuff to aSudanese application for admission or even any indications that an applicationwould be unwelcome would certainly do so. On the other hand, the concession of full Commonwealth Membership to a quasi-foreign State could hardly fail to stimulate demands for a similar concession to such territories as the Gold coast and Nigeria.8. The Colonial Office recognise that it would be undesirable, for the reasons give above, to embark on discussions with other Commonwealth governments on this issue at the moment. Meanwhile, however, they consider that, while itwould be unwise to encourage the Sudanese to seek Membership of the Common-wealth unless and until there is firm ground for supposing that an application ifmade would be favourably considered, yet at the same time it is important that nothing should be said or done which would tend to discourage those elements in theSudan who are in favour of Commonwealth Membership.9. Our conclusion therefore is that it would be unwise to raise the questionof the possible admission of the Sudan as a full and independent Member of theCommonwealth with other Commonwealth Governments at the momentbecause:  (a) to do so would raise the whole issue of the admission of Colonies such asthe Gold Coast to full Membership before we have had time to evolvea considered policy on the matter;(b) there are special reasons for not encouraging a condominium territory suchas the Sudan to apply to be a Member of the Commonwealth which arenot applicable in the case of territories already inside the Common-wealth; the Sudan would therefore be a bad case upon which to starta discussion of all the principles involved in admission to Membership;(c) the question does not become actual until the Sudan in fact applies for membership. She may never do so, and meanwhile it is sufficientmerely to maintain a non-committal attitude to any hypotheticalenquiries that may be received on the subject, care being taken so toexpress replies that such an attitude is not misinterpreted as implying that we wish to discourage her.
