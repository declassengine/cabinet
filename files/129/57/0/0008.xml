THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY  OF HER  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.g gC. (52) 40813th November, 1952CABINETHOUSING PROGRAMME FOR 1954Memorandum by the Minister of works in his paper (C. (52) 396) the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentasks for approval for a programme of 300,000 houses in .1954. My colleagues may wish to have some estimate of the capacity of the building industry iruthat year.2. The two factors of importance are the productivity of the labour force andthe supply of materials. In .1952 the rate of new construction has improvedsubstantially, e.g., we are using 9 per cent, more cement and 10 per cent, morebricks, than in 1951 but we are still a long way from the pre-war output per man.I am confident the rate of improvement can be maintained over the next two yearsand will take care of more houses and more industrial building provided (a) the volume of work in prospect is maintained;- (b) the supply of materials continues to increase in step with the larger volumeof new work.3. An important consideration is the amount of resources required for defence building. I have no accurate information but I believe that the peak ofdefence building will have been reached by 1954 when there will be some falling off, making room for an expansion in other directions.4. The supply of materials is itself a function of the volume of contractscoming forward. Demand creates the supply. The building industry is flexible and capable of substituting one kind of load-bearing material for another. If,therefore, two or three of the basic building materials have the capacity to expandtheir output they will do so if they get the orders, and they will provide the materials for more houses and more factories.5. I am confident that the brick and cement industries are in this positionand will continue the remarkable expansion achieved in 1952. There will be morebuilding steel in 1953 than in 1952 and the new steel-saving techniques will resultin a greater volume of building for a given tonnage of steel. This improvementin use should continue in 1954.6. Timber is difficult because it has to be imported. But the Minister of housing and I believe we can progressively reduce the amount of timber requiredfor new construction.7. If we had already regained the pre-war rate of productivity, I wouldhesitate to say that we could further increase the present rate and by doing so take300,000 houses in our stride, as well as additional industrial work which it is agreed should be done. But in fact there is still much ground to be made up before we reach even the pre-war rate of productivity.8. I therefore submit that the Minister of Housing&apos;s proposal for 300,000houses in 1954 is within the capacity of the industry.D. E.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,13th November, 1952.43217
