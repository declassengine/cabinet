6. Ne 'ertheles, aJthot gh the discussio.1s under Dr. Grahams regi Jroduced
no results, both parties said that they would be ready 'or furtl er discussto 1s Our
objectives have ther.efore ben =-
(a) To do a vve can to make such further discL ss ons pos ible.
(b) To narrO\\T sti further the issues outstanding.
(c) To bring it hon1e to both parties that th l,tbours of the Securi..) Council
ha 'e gone far to bridge the gap nd t 1  t \Ve now look to then1 to ge
together to reach agreen1ent.
cl) At the san1e tine tc go orne \ 'ay to n1ee the d 1nan s of P Kist an ( ho
has been verj p tient) for a defLnite lead by the ecurity Council.
7. 'ith these object1ves i11 1nind a Resolution (CO]))' attached) jointly
spo11Sored by oursel 'es and the Americans \\'as tabled in the Securit) Council on
6th ove1nber. J1e esolution urges the parties to enter i11to negotiations between
the1nselves to resolve the r 1naining d1fficulties; and (as a fran1e\vork tor these 
negotiations) .. reon1Ir1ends f)r. Grahan1's bracket figures. suggesting that specific
figures \lithjn the hr cket should be reached in the light of his forn1ula
(paragraph 2 above).
8. 1 his Resolution con a ins implicit criticism of India s s and on the foo\ving
tv.'o points:-
(a) The top figure for forces on the Indian side in Dr. Graha 11"s brackets i
18,000, \Vhereas India is in istent on 21,000.
(b) India's claim that there shoula be no troop-- of the character of forces
on the Pakistan ide is not 111et.
9. As to a) we do not regard this s1na diffe ence of figures as of vital
importance or as so1nething on rhich in the last resot t \\'e could take a firm stand
on princi])le. Indeed we do not suppose that Paki ta would n1ake it a breakingpoint
if there vvas otherwise 1 prospect of agreen1en1.
10. (b is the point on which lndi 1 is reaHy ' Jlnerable. VI i.e there is scope
for argun1ent about number, there can be no ba is fo a S'-'tt,lement whjch does not
recognise that the cease-tire ne n1ust be n1aintain d un bot 1 s des and that there
can be no one-sided aJteration of the star! s ql o in t tis respect I 1dia i. tn fact.
arguing that the security of he State is the only relevant factor for eter n1ining the
nature of the forces on the _kistan side. As the Pak stan1s .trgt=., due \V i_ lt mt st
also be given to the requiren1e 1t of the nJaintenlt1Ce of t..- e cease-ure lin and the
freedon1 of the J::&gt;lebtscite (t both of ''hich India 1s fu) comn1"tted n pre' 1ous
United Nations Resolutions). he United .lngdom Delegate 1as n1a e it clear that
in our vie' these requir..,Jnerts cannot he Inet un es Pakistan s oertn:rted tore ain
a reasonable nun1ber of tree ps on her ide of the .. e se-fire 1e.
 . The Resolution go s a long v ay towaras 111 eting Pak1s an's den1a1 d for
a cle r lectd fron1 the Securit ' Council. She has, h we\ er expr ed strong doubts
as to the possib1Iity of getting an) dtscussions going Ut1less the ecurity Council'
represent itive takes charge. o tnPet this have ag eed t ar if al"istan presses
this poin we should be re d_ to an end the Resolu ion n a sense \vhich would
put the respons"bility for arr lngi 1g tne t ngs bet\ een tl e p r ies ... lear y on
r. Grahan1.
12. The Indau.., have 1 eactecJ sharply to the. . t .. :sn1 of thetr ctttitude implie i
in the Resolution and explicit in the speeches of the nited Kingdom and U 1ited
States delegates. On 8th Decen1ber !lrs. Pandtt announced to the Security
Council that the Resolution was u.1acc p able to Iudta. She reiterqted the ndian
clain1 that be firure o 21 ,00)  ras an h absolute and iri educ blt: n1:ni1num  and that
there could be no artned forces on the Pakistan sid . We had e 'I ected his.. l ich

13. The next tage in the Security Cou c 1 vil1 be a statement by Pakistan

on the basis of our present policy as agreed \"rith the A1nericans t e Resolutior V\ i 1
