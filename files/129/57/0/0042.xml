Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 44215th December, 1952CABINETLEASES IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the Cabinet, on 7th October, 1952 (C. (52) 84th Conclusions, Minute 3) invited me to submit to the Home Affairs Committee the draft of a White Paper setting outthe Governments proposals for permanent legislation on leases in Scotland. TheHome Affairs Committee approved the draft on 5th December and invited me tosubmit it to the Cabinet (HA. (52) 31st Meeting, Item 5). The draft, in proof form,is circulated herewith.2. The draft White Paper states that the Government accept the unanimousrecommendations of the Committee which, under the Chairmanship of LordGuthrie, a Judge of the Court of Session, inquired into certain questions concerningproperty held on lease in Scotland, and reported in July 1952. As indicated in thedraft, the problems presented by ground leases in Scotland are quite different fromthe problems of leasehold in England and Wales, and it follows that differentsolutions are required.3.   Briefly, the White Paper proposes (1) that certain lessees who hold their homes under ground leases should havea right to a feu title on the terms explained in the White Paper. It is pointed out that Scottish landlords have generally been willing to grant a lessee a feu title on generous terms when the lease of his home expires,and that the legislation which the Government propose would givestatutory effect to a normal and familiar process;(2) that occupying sub-tenants of ground lessees should get security of tenurewhen the ground lease expires; and(3) that no action should be taken in the case of shops and business premises,other than that already taken in the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act,1949.4. I shall be glad to have authority to present the White Paper to Parliamentsimultaneously with the presentation of the &quot; standstill &quot; Bill extending for a further period the temporary Acts dealing with leased property in Scotland and Englandand Wales, and to proceed with the preparation of a Bill, to be introduced next session, giving effect to the proposals in the White Paper.J.

LEASES IN SCOTLANDIntroduction1. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration certain aspectsof the law affecting property held on lease in Scotland which were the subjectof a recent Report by the Scottish Leases Committee1 under the chairmanship of Lord Guthrie. The Government have decided to accept the Committee&apos;srecommendations, which were unanimous. These recommendations, and theGovernments proposals for giving legislative effect to them, are explained below.2. There have been several inquiries in the last few years in connection withproperty held on lease in Scotland. In 1947, a Committee was appointed to inquire into the tenure of shops, their terms of reference being later expanded to cover business premises. Under the chairmanship, first of Principal T. M.Taylor of Aberdeen University, and later of Lord Guthrie, a Judge of the Courtof Session, the Committee submitted three Reports in the period betweenNovember, 1947, and November, 1949.3. Tn their First Report,2 published in December, 1947, dealing with shoptenancies, the Committee concluded that the evidence did not justify any recommendation for immediate protective legislation, but that the position should be watched.4. The Committee were reconvened in November, 1948, and were asked toconsider, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, whether the con-elusions of their First Report needed modification, and whether tenants of premises used for business, trade or professional purposes, should be givensecurity of tenure, and whether the rents of such premises should be controlled.The Committee&apos;s Second Report,3 made on 17th December, 1948, became thebasis of the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act, 1949,4 which provides, briefly,that a tenant of shop premises may apply to the sheriff for a renewal of histenancy within twenty-one days after the receipt by him of a notice to remove,and that the sheriff may renew the tenancy for the maximum period of one yearand that further renewals may be granted thereafter. The sheriff is also em-powered, if he JSinks it reasonable, to dismiss the application. The Actalso provides that, in certain specified circumstances, the sheriff shall not grantrenewal of the tenancy. In their Final Report,5 made on 14th November, 1949,the Committee were unanimous in recommending that the Tenancy of ShopsAct should be continued in operation until 1955, and that there should be no scheme of rent control for business premises ; by a majority they recommendedthat the provisions of the Act should not be extended to premises other thanshops. In view of the first recommendation^the Tenancy of Shops Act has been included in successive Expiring Laws Continuance Acts.5. On 9th February, 1951, the Scottish Leases Committee, under the chair-manship of Lord Guthrie, was appointed to inquire into the position in Scotlandof (a) a lessee of land holding under a lease by virtue of which buildings hadbeen erected thereon ; and (b) the occupying tenant (other than such a lessee)of residential or other premises. Pending the Committee&apos;s Report, the LongLeases (Temporary Provisions) (Scotland) Act, 1951,&quot; was passed, giving tem-porary protection to persons occupying property under leases granted for not less than 31 years duration, and due to terminate within two years front10th May, 1951, if immediately before the date of termination the tenant, or amember of his family, was living in the property or a part of the property.1 Cmd. 8656  &quot;- Cmd. 7285  &apos; Cmd. 7603   * 12 &amp; 13 Geo. 6.

6. The Scottish Leases Committee submitted a unanimous Report in July,1952. They came to the conclusion that no action is required in the case of shops or other business premises, other than that which has already been takenin the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act, 1949. In the case of residential property they recommend action only in the case of occupying tenants ofhouses held on ground leases granted before 1914 for not less than 50 years,for whom they suggest a statutory right to have that lease converted into a feu.7. The Committee&apos;s recommendation with regard to ground leases grantedbefore 1914 relates to the main problem put before them in their terms ofreference. In Scotland almost all land is held on feu and the ground lease is an exceptional and abnormal arrangement. As the Committee say, the positionin Scotland in the matter of ground leases is completely different from thatobtaining in England and Wales. Before 1914, however, when the last majorrestriction on the granting of feus was removed by the Entail (Scotland) Act,of that year, some landlords were unable to dispose of land otherwise than byway of lease. The successors of these Scottish landlords have generally been willing, when the lessee&apos;s home is on the leased land and the lease falls in, to convert it into a feu on generous terms which take little or no account of thevalue of their reversionary right under the lease. There are cases, however,(e.g., where land is held by trustees) in which the landlord must exact the full value of his interest. The Scottish Leases Committee, therefore, propose that,for a period of five years after the enabling Act becomes law, all lessees whohold their homes under ground leases granted before 1914 for a period of notless than 50 years should have a right to a feu title on specified terms. TheCommittee limit their recommendation to cases in which the lease was grantedbefore 1914 because it can be safely assumed that in the great majority of those cases a feu would have been granted if this had been possible. In the relatively few cases in which ground leases have been entered into since 1914, however,they were entered into voluntarily by the&apos;parties and the Committee saw no justification for facilitating the conversion of such leases into feus.The Committee consider that the proposed right of conversion of lease intofeu should not be available to any lessee under a ground lease granted before1914 who purchased his interest in the lease after the passing of the Long Leases(Temporary Provisions) (Scotland) Act, 1951.8. The payment which the Committee propose should be made by the lessee to the landlord as a condition of the grant of a feu title would be basedon the value of the landlords reversionary interest calculated on the value ofthe property with vacant possession at the date of the enabling Act and alsothat of the tack duty payable under the lease, the resultant sum being deferredat 5 per cent, compound interest for the unexpired period of the lease but subjectto an assumption, where the actual unexpired period is less than 30 years, thatthe lease has 30 years still to run. Broadly this means that no lessee would haveto pay more than about one quarter of the value of the property held underthe lease ; where the lease has a longer period than 30 years to run the payment would be less. For example, in the case of a lease due to expire ten years afterthe passing of the enabling Act but deemed for conversion purposes to expire30 years after, the lessee would, if the total value of the property and the tackduty at the date of the Act was  1,000, have to pay to the landlord  231. this obligation might be liquidated by the payment of a capital sum of half this amount, and by the creation of a feu duty of  5. 15s. 6d. per annum, i.e., thefigure which, capitalised at 20 years purchase, would represent the balance ofthe payment due. In making this recommendation about the payment to bemade&apos;for the grant of a feu, the Committee had in view the generous terms on
which landlords have granted titles in similar circumstances without regard totheir legal rights so that legislation based on that recommendation will givestatutory form to a normal and familiar process.9. The Committee recommend that, while commercial premises generallyshould be excluded from these arrangements, a lessee who uses part of hisdwellinghouse as a shop or office, or for business, trade or professional purposes(other than as licensed premises), should be able to obtain a feu title. Where,however, a lessee&apos;s dwelling house, and also other premises, have been erectedon ]eased land, the statutory right of conversion would be confined to thedwellinghouse. The statutory right of conversion would also apply to manses,or other houses occupied by a minister or lay missionary of any religiousdenomination.10. The Committee consider it to be in the public interest that where the landlords part of a ground lease granted before 1914 has been acquired by aGovernment Department, local authority or development corporation underthe New Towns Act, they should be able to refuse to grant a feu ; and that a landlord who has acquired his interest within the last 15 years for personaloccupation, or for redevelopment of the land, should be able to apply to the sheriff for a declarator that the lessee is not entitled to a feu. Such a declaratorwould not, however, be granted unless it were shown that greater hardshipwould be caused to the landlord by the grant of a feu title than to the lesseeby the refusal of it.11. Because of their recommendations for enabling a feu title to be acquired by ground lessees who occupy their dwelling houses, the Committee do not-recommend that the protection of the Rent Restrictions Acts should be extendedto such ground lessees. They see no reason, however, why an occupationtenant, holding from a ground lessee, should cease to be protected by the rent restrictions Acts because the ground lease has expired and the land, and thehouse thereon, have reverted to the landlord.The Governments Proposals for Legislation12. The Government have decided to accept the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions ; and they propose to introduce as soon as possible a Scottish Bill to giveeffect to such of the recommendations as require legislative sanction. Theopportunity is not likely to arise during the current Session, and the Governmentare therefore presenting to Parliament a Bill extending for a further year, untilMay, 1954, the provisions of the Long Leases (Temporary Provisions) (Scotland)Act, 1951.published by her majesty s stationery officeTo be purchased from13a Castle Street, Edinburgh, 2 York House, Kingsway, london, w.c.24.23 Oxford Street, london, w.i i St. Andrew&apos;s Crescent, Cardiff39 King Street, Manchester, 2 Tower Lane, Bristol, i2 Edmund Street, Birmingham, 3 80 Chichester Street, belfast or from any Bookseller1952Price 3d net printed in Great Britain under the authority of HER MAJESTVS STATIONERY office by Scottish County Press, DalkeithWt.
