secret. (52) 44516th December, 1952CABINETPROPOSED FEDERATION  OF  SOUTHERN  RHODESIA, northern rhodesia AND NYASALANDCopy No.    c memorandum by the Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations and the Secretary of State for theColonies1. In June 1952 the Cabinet considered C. (52) 193 and approved the publica-tion of a Scheme for the Federation of Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland (Cmd. 8573) and the text of a statement made in both Houses ofParliament on 18th June (C.C. (52) 60th Conclusions, Minute 9).2. In August, the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs visited the three territories to gauge African opinion and convince it of the advantages of theScheme. In the latter purpose he achieved moderate success, but had not time toundo the harm that had been done by the opponents of the Scheme. He reportedthat at least 90 per cent, of the Africans knew and cared nothing about Federation.The vocal 10 per cent., however, were largely following the lead of the congress party in vehemently opposing the Scheme.3. In C. (52) 193 the two Secretaries of State undertook to consult the Cabinetfurther before next conferring with representatives of the other three Governmentsconcerned. We now accordingly seek approval to our proceeding on the lines proposed in the following paragraphs at the Conference which will open in london on 1st January, 1953.4. We are satisfied that the Scheme set out in Cmd. 8573 is basically sound and would work in the best interests of all the inhabitants of the Territories con-cerned. Our aim therefore will be to secure the acceptance of a Scheme on theselines. Certain amendments of detail may be necessary to secure acceptance by public opinion (particularly at the Southern Rhodesian referendum) of the scheme as a whole. The only contentious amendment for which we intend to press isone which will provide stronger safeguards against racial discrimination in the publicservice.5. For the rest, there are five points on which we would not agree to anychange of substance without further consulting our colleagues.   These are:  (a) A true Federation;(b) No change in relationship between the Territories and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment;(c) Adequate safeguards for African interests, including rights in land;(d) Reservation of constitutional amendments for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure,contentious amendments having also to be laid before Parliament;(e) The status of the Federal Government to approximate to that of the presentSouthern Rhodesian Government.6. Subject to this, we are convinced that the Scheme will bring economicopportunities which are urgently needed, and will establish conditions favourable to the progress of racial harmony in a mixed community, the example of whichmay spread elsewhere/here.   The crucial issue now to be decided is whether to proceedPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1952
with it in face of the fact that a reasonable measure of African acquiescence is unlikely to be forthcoming. We discuss this further in Appendix I, and conclude that the disadvantages of abandoning the Scheme would far outweigh those of proceeding with it. If we go ahead, there will probably be some immediate unrest,but it will be short-lived. We shall also be widely attacked and misrepresented inthis.country. But we have no doubt that if we postpone or abandon the Scheme,otherwise than through rejection by Southern Rhodesia, moderate African resist-ance to extremists will collapse, loss of confidence in the Government will be accelerated, racial tensions will get worse, and unrest will be delayed but not pre-vented. Southern Rhodesia, soured and isolated, will be drawn more and more into the orbit Of the Union. This is a decision which may be vital to the wholefuture of Africa.7. On Friday afternoon, 12th December, we received a deputation of theLabour Party introduced by Mr. Attlee. Mr. Attlee left most of the talking toMr. Griffiths. Mr. Griffiths said that Federation had been discussed by the LabourParty, the Trades Union Congress, and the International Federation of TradeUnions. All would oppose Federation strongly if it was imposed against the expressed wishes of the Africans, by which he clearly meant the vocal section.Mr. Griffiths also said that the Congress of Industrial Organisations in the UnitedStates would also declare their opposition at the instigation of their coloured mem-bers. We should doubt this. There would also be opposition in the United nations organisation, though, as Lord Salisbury pointed out, we had always held that.N.O. was not entitled to discuss matters of internal policy. Mr. Attlee did notadd much to the discussion. In spite of this premature declaration of oppositionwe are strongly in favour of going forward with the plan; but our colleagues shouldbe aware of what took place.8. We ask that this decision be taken now. For Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto go back on the Scheme after it had been accepted at the Southern Rhodesianreferendum would heighten all these unhappy consequences. Arrangements forthe referendum must be set in train immediately after the Conference (which inany case can hardly break up without a public announcement with regard to the holding of a referendum). The decision to go ahead must be taken before theConference breaks up. We therefore ask our colleagues to agree that we may giveconfidential assurances to the other Governments concerned at the Conferencein January that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to proceed with theScheme, provided it is accepted at the referendum in Southern Rhodesia and bythe legislatures of the other two Territories concerned, and that the Scheme towhich we agree contains the basic features listed in paragraph (5) above.9. If the Conference reaches agreement and a satisfactory Scheme emerges,a short enabling Bill would be introduced into Parliament after the SouthernRnodesian referendum to permit us to enact the Constitution by Order in Council,which would be subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.10. These matters are discussed in more detail in Appendix I. We seek theapproval of our colleagues to proceed on the lines proposed.S.SWINTON.O. L.16th December, 1952.
APPENDIX memorandum on Future Procedure Regarding Central African FederationIntroduction1. In Appendix II to C. (51) 11 of November 1951 an outline was given ofthe previous history of closer association of the Central Africa territories of SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Three questions were then dis-cussed namely, is closer association necessary? what form should it take? howshould we proceed?2. It was then argued that closer association was necessary, first for economic reasons. Not only had the three territories many common economic problems connected with railways, ports, man-power, hydro-electricity, &amp;c, but also speedyeconomic development of all three would be needed in the next 25 years in orderto improve the standard of living of a rapidly growing population. This could beachieved more readily by the three territories combined than if they continuedindependently to compete for the limited resources of capital and material available.Secondly, from the political point of view, it was urgently necessary to create astrong independent bloc inspired by British ideas and ideals which could resistideological and other penetration by Afrikaner nationalists from the Union.3. As regards the form which closer association should take, it was argued that the special responsibilities which Her Majesty&apos;s Government had to theinhabitants of the two Northern protectorates ruled out the possibility of amalga-mation; but that these responsibilities could be effectively discharged in a formof federation with proper safeguards for the African population. The paper didnOt discuss a weaker form of association (such as the East Africa High Commission)because this has rightly been rejected in the official report (Cmd. 8233) as beingunsuitable for three territories at such different stages of constitutional development as those of Central Africa.4. On procedure, the Cabinet was advised against immediate imposition ofany Scheme at that time, partly because the details of a suitable Scheme had yet to be discussed further with the other Governments concerned, but also because a further attempt had to be made to persuade African opinion in Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland to accept federation. The Cabinet accordingly decided that her majesty&apos;s Government should give a strong lead in favour of the principle of federation (which was done in a statement made in both Houses on 21st November)and, secondly, that the matter should then be discussed at a further conference withrepresentatives of the Governments concerned. This took place in April 1952 anddrew up the Draft Federal Scheme published as Cmd. 8573 which is attached tothis document as Appendix II. (A summary of its provisions is contained inparagraph 12 of its preface.)The Main Development since the April Conference&apos; &quot;5. The main developments which have taken place since the April Conferencehave been of two kinds. First, three Commissions were set up to investigate further the practical details of the Scheme set out in Cmd. 8573. These Commissions met in Central Africa in August and produced reports covering the judicial aspect(Cmd. 8671), the fiscal aspect (Cmd. 8672) and the civil service aspect (Cmd. 8673).They showed that&apos;the Scheme set out in Cmd. 8573 was practicable and could be implemented with little difficulty. It is unnecessary to trouble our colleagues withthe details of these reports, since these are of a very technical character and will,in&apos;any case, be considered further at the forthcoming Conference.6. The second main development was the attempt to win over publicopinion in Central Africa and elsewhere, and in particular African opinion, infavour of the Scheme. The difficulties of this task were intensified by the factthat the previous Government had adopted an attitude of studied neutrality to theproposals, which had made it impossible for the administration in the northern territories to impress on the Africans the advantages of Federation. As a result the field was left clear for the organisation of a vociferous African opposition inthe Northern territories under the auspices of the two African Congress bodies which are mainly, though not entirely, composed of the comparatively limited.;
African intelligentsia. In Northern Rhodesia, Congress was influenced and assisted by a local European Communist, (since deported). In Nyasaland the campaign wascontrolled and directed by Dr. Hastings Banda, a Nyasaland doctor of Africanbirth living in London. &apos;   &apos; - *7. As a result of these efforts African representatives from the northern territories refused to attend the Federation Conference in April 1952. After theConference, however, vigorous steps were taken by the. administrations of the twoNorthern territories to persuade Africans of the advantages of the Scheme. Theseattempts were reinforced by a visit from the Minister of State in August and september, in the course Of which he held a large number of meetings&apos; withAfrican organisations. He found that the majority of the African populationneither knew nor cared anything about Federation. Of those Who Were interested,the majority were under the influence of the Congress groups and, without havingstudied the details of the Scheme with its special features designed to safeguardtheir interests, they were determined to reject it. Reasons for this rejection werefrequently given which had no connection whatever with the Federation proposals,e.g^, the existence of an industrial colour bar on the Copper Belt. Furthermorethe Minister of State found that Africans who were willing to discuss the details ofthe Scheme in a constructive spirit were frequently prevented by the various formsof intimidation to which Africans are particularly susceptible.8. The majority of vocal African opinion in the&apos; two territories thereforehas undoubtedly expressed itself as being opposed to the proposals. On the other side, a vigorous opposition to the Scheme has grown up among some of the europeans, particularly in Southern Rhodesia. The grounds on which thisopposition is based are that the Scheme is too much concerned with safeguards forAfricans at the expense of efficient government. The campaign against Federationamongst Europeans in Southern Rhodesia has been effectively worked up byplaying upon these inter-racial fears, by misrepresenting certain features of theScheme and by appeals to the justifiable pride of the Southern Rhodesian settlersin their achievements, since they obtained a substantial measure of self-governmentin 1923.Future Procedure9. As was explained in paragraph 8 of C. (52) 193, our intention is that if afinally agreed Scheme can be produced at the next Conference, it will then besubmitted to a referendum of the Southern Rhodesian electorate and to debates inthe Legislatures of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland for ratification. At theforthcoming Conference therefore we shall have to give assurances confidentially tothe representatives of the other Governments concerned regarding Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s intentions, assuming that the referendum and the debates are successful. The crucial issue to be decided in this connection is whether we assure the other Governments that we will proceed with the Scheme in face of the fact thatwe can expect from the Africans little or no open support, a good deal of vocalOpposition, and at best a fair measure of tacit acquiescence.10. This question can only be decided in the light of the answers to four other questions;(a) Are we still satisfied that closer association is necessary?;    (b) Is the form proposed an effective one?(c) Does it adequately safeguard the rights and interests of all sections of thepopulation and provide for the discharge of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfsresponsibilities for the territories concerned?id) What would be the effects of proceeding or not proceeding with the present scheme?The Necessity for q Closer Association11-. This was argued in paragraphs .7 to 9 of Appendix.II of C. (51) 1.1 andthe arguments are summarised in paragraphs 1 to 4 above. In the twelve monthswhich have elapsed since that paper was produced nothing has occurred whichwould lead us to modify the view, that closer association between these territoriesis an urgent necessity. Indeed, the rapid growth of an aggressive Africannationalism during that period has increased the urgency of achieving a solution tothis problem.- In our view the answer lies in establishing a sufficiently large and
strong area capable of standing on its own legs, much less vulnerable both politically and economically than are the individual territories, and in which there could be,not domination by one race, but co-operation between races. If this can succeed,and so provide an object lesson of harmony in a mixed community, perhaps similarideas and practices will spread elsewhere.Effectiveness of the Form Proposed12. We are satisfied that the form of Federation which we propose wouldprovide a Central Government with effective powers to deal with the major economic problems of the area and act as a fpcus of loyalty which will offset the spread of other ideas from outside. .Safeguards13. We are satisfied that these safeguards provided in the Scheme are the most effective that can be devised for the interests of all sections of the community and,in the course of the negotiations that have yet to come, though we may agree to changes in form, we do not propose to agree to any changes in substance whichwill weaken the safeguards.   In particular we shall insist that:  (a) the Scheme is a true Federation (with the Federal and Territorial Govern-merits each independent of the other in their respective spheres) andthat those matters most closely affecting the day to day life of thepeople (especially native policy) remain the responsibility of the threeTerritorial Governments;(b) the relationship of the three existing Territorial Governments to her majesty&apos;s Government remains unaltered;(c) there are solid safeguards for African interests; and that, in particular, theConstitution contains provision for a special board or committee with power to ensure that any legislation differing in terms or in applicationbetween Europeans and Africans to the disadvantage of the latter, is referred to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom; and,to safeguard African rights in land, all land and land settlement questions are reserved to the Territorial Governments;(d) amendments to the Federal Constitution will be reserved for Her Majesty&apos;pleasure and there will be some device in the Constitution for givingParliament here an opportunity to discuss the matter if amendmentsare objected to either by a Territorial Legislature or by the bodyresponsible for safeguarding African interests;(e) the status of the Federal Government will be approximately that of theSouthern Rhodesian Government at present.Effects of a decision to proceed14. We have consulted Her Majesty&apos;s representatives in the various african territories on the political and security effect of a decision to proceed; and their advice may be briefly summarised as follows:  West Africa, Reports from the Governors show that the politically inactivemajority of Africans is not interested in the proposals. If the Scheme were imposed, however, the politically active minority would probably denounce her majesty&apos;s Government for acting in an &quot; imperialistic &quot; fashion and would allegethat the Scheme was being imposed on Africans at the dictates of the white settlers.We are further advised that even those Africans more sympathetic to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and its policies would be inclined to suspect our true motives and intentions and would probably feel that the Scheme was in some way panderingto &quot; Malanism.&quot; It is not considered there would be any effect oh the security situation unless the imposition of the Scheme lead to disorders among Africans in central Africa, in which case there is a possibility of sympathetic rioting.East Africa. The&quot; bulk of African opinion in East Africa is notinterested in what goes on outside its own area. But again the vociferous politicalminority would react unfavourably to any attempt to impose the Scheme. On theother hand the political effect of a decision to proceed would be to impress upon all sections of opinion the determination of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to carryout its stated intentions in cases where it genuinely considers its plans to be in thebest interests of the inhabitants and regardless of politically immature opposition.This would have a marked stabilising effect among all sections of the population.
A decision to abandon the Scheme would have the reverse effect and give markedencouragement to African nationalists and other extremists. As far as thesecurity situation is concerned, much would depend upon what happened in central africa itself.South Africa. In South Africa, a decision not to impose would be regardedas an act of deplorable weakness by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. On the otherhand the decision to impose in the face of the declared African opposition would lead to renewed clamour that African opinion should similarly be disregarded inthe case of the High Commission territories. We have a clear answer to this argument. The two cases are entirely different. Under the Federal Scheme, her majesty&apos;s Government retains an effective method of discharging its responsibilities to the Africans which it would not have in the case of a complete hand-over of theHigh Commission territories.Central Africa. A copy of the telegram from the Governor of northern rhodesia is attached at Appendix III. A copy of the report from the Governor of nyasaland is at Appendix IV. Briefly their views may be summarised as follows:First, there is a danger of organised resistance in some areas. This may takethe form of strikes in the Government and other services, non-co-operation and non-payment of taxes. A good deal will depend on the Scheme adopted being insubstantially the present form with the present safeguards for Africans. There isa very good chance, however, that if trouble comes it would be of short duration.Once it became clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of thetwo territories concerned did not intend to be intimidated by the Congress Partyagitators, respect for and a confidence in the Government would grow and the africans would be won over. In particular, the tribal chiefs are confidently expectedto draw the line at any form of disorder, particularly if the situation is firmlyhandled from the outset. On the other hand, if the Federation proposals areabandoned in the face of the Congress campaign, repercussions will be serious andmay well be disastrous. The Congress Party will gain greatly in prestige; theEuropean population will be much disheartened and race relations will rapidlydeteriorate. The eventual conflict which would result would be even greater than if federation were imposed and would create more lasting antagonism.Reactions in the United Kingdom15. The suggestion that it is not necessary to obtain the consent of the Africanshas caused marked opposition from the more emotional elements in public opinionhere which concern themselves with African affairs. Their most vocal expressionhas been through various missionary organisations of the Church of Scotland, the african Bureau and the Fabian Society. These elements are scarcely open toargument and it is suggested that the only way of convincing them is to implement the Scheme and to show that it works successfully and to nobody&apos;s detriment.Recommendation&apos; 16. We therefore recommend that a clear balance of advantage lies in pro-ceeding with the Scheme, and we ask our colleagues to endorse this proposal.Future Procedure in the United Kingdom Parliament17. If an agreed scheme emerges from the next Conference and is approvedby the referendum in Southern Rhodesia we would propose to introduce an enablingBill to provide for the setting up of the Federation by Order in Council. In viewof the interest which the matter will undoubtedly raise in Parliament, we feel it isonly polite to provide that the Order in Council should be laid and be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House. The oniy other matters of preliminary tacticsto be considered are as follows. First, we are anxious to try to avoid a debatebetween the publication of the final version of the Scheme after the next Conferenceand the referendum in Southern Rhodesia. Critics of the Scheme can do much tosecure its rejection in Southern Rhodesia by making extravagant statements intbe debate. Secondly, we may be under great pressure to insert the safeguards inthe enabling Bill and not in the Order in Council. This must be firmly resisted.To insert qualifications and safeguards into a Bill which does not contain the substantial provisions would be like trying to build a house from the roof down-wards. In any case, the constitution will be a balanced document agreed by allfour Governments, and Parliament can no more amend its details one-sidedlythan it can those of an international agreement presented to it for ratification.

PREFACEI. background the question of closer political association between SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland has been under con-sideration for many years. A Royal Commission under the chairman-ship of Lord Bledisloe, which reported in 1939,* concluded that thetime was not then ripe for amalgamation or (although they did notconsider such a solution in detail) for federation. The main reasonsfor the Commission^ conclusion were the differences in native policybetween Southern Rhodesia and the northern Territories, their differentstages of political and social development and the financial weakness of the northern Territories. The Commission recommended the estab-lishment of regular consultative machinery. This was set up, in theform of the Central African Council, in 1945, and it has done muchuseful work within the limits imposed by its constitution and itslack of executive powers.2. A growing consciousness of the limitations of purely consultativemachinery led, however, to the revival of the idea of closer politicalassociation and the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Rt.Hon. James Griffiths, M.P., stated in the House of Commons on the8th November, 1950, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decidedthat there should be a fresh examination of the problem of the closer association of the three Territories. He announced that a conferenceof officials of the three Central African Governments, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, and the. Central African council would accordingly meet early in 1951 to examine the problem and make recommendations. That conference took place in March, 1951,under the chairmanship of Mr. G. H. Baxter of the commonwealth relations Office, and its report was published in June, simultaneously-with a geographical, historical and economic survey J and a com-parative survey of native policy, g3. The officials&apos; report set out the need for closer association. they pointed out the economic interdependence of the three territories and the consequent importance of the integration of economic policyboth internally and in external economic relations. The Territories,for the time being relatively prosperous, were, individually, economic-ally vulnerable and would be much stronger as a single unit witha more broadly based economy. Such a unit would also be strongerfrom the standpoint of defence. Rail, trunk road and air communica-tions needed to be planned on a broader basis. The unification ofcertain public services (difficult if not impossible as things stood)would secure greater efficiency. The most efficient use, in the interestsof the people as a whole, of the capital resources of the wholeregion in finance, raw materials, power, labour and technical skillwould be promoted. A general quickening expansion of the economy of the area would bring with it advantages to all the inhabitants andin particular the possibility of the more rapid social advancement ofthe African population.  The need for action was urgent.4. The officials considered the obstacles to closer association notedby the Royal Commission and found that since that time they hadbeen materially reduced.   Certain differences in native policy between* Cmd. 5949.        t Cmd. 8233.        J Cmd. 8234.        8 Cmd. 8235.1
though important, they were felt to relate largely to method and timing:the ultimate objectives of all three Governments were broadly thesame, namely, the economic, social and political advancement ofthe Africans in partnership with the Europeans. The officials notedthat Southern Rhodesia spent more on certain services for Africansthan did Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland. They recognised theexistence and importance of African opposition in Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland, but believed that the judgment of African opinion wouldin the last resort turn on the form which a scheme of closer associationmight take. (Such a scheme is set forth in detail for the first timein the present paper.) They considered that with the growth of population, both European and African, since 1938, and with thematerial and political progress of the Territories, there should nowbe no difficulty in working effectively a scheme of closer association.Moreover, political advance in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland hadnarrowed the gap between the political institutions of Southern Rhodesiaon the one hand and the northern Territories on the other. Finally,the resources of the three Territories should now be fully adequate to support a scheme of closer association.5. The officials discussed various forms of closer association. Theynoted the view of those closely concerned with the work of theCentral African Council that an advisory body could by itself do nothing further of value to promote collaboration between the in-dividual Governments. They reviewed the idea of amalgamation(which had found favour for many years in Southern Rhodesia and elsewhere), and rejected it because, although it had many intrinsicmerits, it stood so little chance of general acceptance that, if only for that reason, it could not be recommended. They also rejected the idea of a &quot; League&quot;, whereby the three Governments woulddelegate certain functions to a body appointed by themselves, on thegrounds that it would be likely to produce friction and deadlock-and that it equally stood little chance of general acceptance. they then recommended a scheme, which they discussed at length, for a federation under which the central Government would have certain specified powers, the remainder being left with the territorial Govern-ments. The constitution that they recommended would include specialsafeguards for African interests.6. The officials&apos; report was commended as a basis for discussion byall four Governments to the careful consideration of public opinion,His Majesty&apos;s Government describing it as &quot; a constructive approach to the problem &quot;, and it was announced that no decision would betaken on their proposals until there had been full discussion and time for opinion to crystallise. The then Secretaries of State for commonwealth Relations and the Colonies (the Rt. Hon. P. C. Gordon-Walker, M.P., and the Rt. Hon. James Griffiths, M.P.) visited africa in August and September of 1951 to take part in discussions withrepresentatives of all communities. Their tour concluded with a Con-ference which met at Victoria Falls in September. The nature and conclusions of that Conference are set out in a communique issued on the 21st September, and reproduced as Annex II. It was con-templated that, after further discussion within each territory andexchanges of views between the four Governments, there should be afurther Conference in 1952.
r7. After the change of Government in the United Kingdom a state-mentH was made in Parliament on the 21st November, 1951, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were in full agreement with the victoria falls communique, and that they favoured a scheme of federation on the general lines recommended in the officials&apos; report. They believedthat such a scheme would be in the best interests of the Africanas well as the other inhabitants of the Territories. The statementspecifically endorsed the assurances set out in the Victoria Fallscommunique regarding African interests, and undertook to ensurethat they should be formally embodied in a federal constitution. HisMajesty&apos;s Government promised to further the discussions and con-consultations contemplated in the communique.8. As part of these consultations there were informal talks inLondon in January, 1952, with the Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. HisMajesty&apos;s Government reaffirmed at this time that they could not agree to the amalgamation of the three Territories. They made a formal statement to the other Governments concerned in the following terms : &quot; Southern Rhodesia is a self-governing colony. Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland are protectorates. If the three Territories were to be amal-gamated, they would all become merged in the new self-governing state.Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would thus lose their separate identity(which they would retain in a Federation); and this would mean that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have to disregard obligations which, by virtueof treaty and otherwise, they have assumed towards the two northern territories.   This they cannot do.&quot;9. After these talks it was announced that the Conference wouldbe reconvened in April, in London, to formulate a draft scheme of federation. It was announced in the House of Commons on the 4thMarch, 1952, that the detailed scheme to be prepared at the AprilConference would be published and that Her Majesty&apos;s government proposed to convene a further Conference, to be held later in 1952,to consider the detailed scheme before the question of ratificationor abandonment was finally put to the Governments concerned.II. THE APRIL CONFERENCE10. The reconvened Conference met at Lancaster House on the23rd April, 1952, under the joint chairmanship of the Most Hon. theMarquess of Salisbury (Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations)and the Rt. Hon. Oliver Lyttelton, M.P. (Secretary of State for theColonies). The Southern Rhodesian delegation was led by the PrimeMinister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Godfrey Huggins ; the Northern Rhodesiandelegation by the Governor, Sir Gilbert Rennie ; and the Nyasalanddelegation by the Governor, Sir Geoffrey Colby. The full membership of the various delegations is given in Annex I.11. The Secretary of State for the Colonies had invited the AfricanRepresentative Council of Northern Rhodesia and the African Pro-tectorate Council of Nyasaland to send representatives to London forinformal discussions with him and to take part in the Conference.These representatives duly came to London and had informal talksII Cmd. 8411.3
at the Colonial Office before the Conference opened. During thei-^discussions they declined the Secretary of State&apos;s invitation to attend the Conference as delegates, although he gave them assurances that by attending they would not be committing themselves in any way.The Nyasaland representatives then asked whether they might attendas observers, but when on the following day the Secretary of Stateagreed to this suggestion they withdrew it and declined to attendin any capacity. A similar invitation to attend as observers wasmade to the Northern Rhodesian representatives, who also declined.These African representatives remained in London during the Con-ference and had discussions with many interested individuals and groups. The day after the Conference closed the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies explained the findings of the Conference to them.The two African members of the Southern Rhodesian delegation onthe other hand attended the Conference and took an active part in theproceedings.III.  THE DRAFT FEDERAL SCHEME12. The scheme set forth in the present White Paper consists of detailed proposals which could if approved be translated into a con-stitutional instrument. The following is a summary of its main features: (i) The PreambleThe Preamble sets forth the main principles underlying the scheme.It draws attention to the desirability of the three Territories associatingfor common purposes while retaining their separate identities. Itreflects undertakings about the interests of Africans to which effect isgiven elsewhere in the scheme, and emphasises that these three Terri-tories are the rightful home of all their lawful inhabitants, whatever their origin.(ii) Chapter I.  The FederationThis Chapter proposes that the Federation shall be known as &quot; TheFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland &quot; and leaves it to the federal assembly to decide where the capital of the Federation is to be located.(iii) Chapter II.   The Federal LegislatureThis Chapter provides for the division of legislative powers betweenthe Federal and the Territorial Legislatures (which within their exclusivespheres are in no way subordinate to one another). It sets out anumber of subjects on which only the Federal Legislature may makelaws. It also specifies a number of other subjects with which both theFederal Legislature and the Territorial Legislatures may deal, pro-vided that in cases of inconsistency the Federal law will prevail. it also allows the Federal Legislature to delegate power to legislate onFederal subjects to the Territorial Legislatures, and (within certaindefined spheres) allows the Territorial Legislatures to delegate powerto the Federal Legislature. All subjects not specifically allotted tothe Federal Legislature remain the responsibility of the Territories, and care has been taken to ensure that the Territorial Legislatures retain control of those matters which most closely concern the daily life ofthe African population.
Part 3 of this Chapter provides that the Federal Assembly will con-sist of 35 members, of whom 17 will be from Southern Rhodesia, 11from Northern Rhodesia and 7 from Nyasaland. Of these 35 members,33 will be elected. There will be 9 members representing african interests ; and the scheme is designed to secure that at least 6 membersof the Federal Assembly (that is to say, 2 from each Territory)shall be Africans. The scheme also provides that the Federal assembly will elect a Speaker either from among its own members or from outside, but that, if a member of the Assembly is elected as Speaker,he will thereupon vacate his seat as a member of the Assembly.(iv) Chapter III.   Legislation and procedureThis Chapter makes provision for such matters as voting in theFederal Assembly and the assent to Bills. It also prescribes that the life of the Assembly will, unless it is dissolved earlier, be five years.(v) Chapter IV.  The ExecutiveThis Chapter provides that Her Majesty will be represented in theFederation by a Governor-General. It empowers the Governor-general to appoint a Prime Minister and other Ministers and assign appropriated departments to them. It lays down that, except in certain instances where the Governor-General acts in his discretion, he will be requiredto act in accordance with the advice of his Ministers.Provision is also made in this Chapter for the Federation to delegateexecutive authority to the Territories, and (within a defined sphere) forthe Territories to delegate similar authority to the Federation.(vi) Chapter V.  The African Affairs board the African Affairs Board, apart from the Chairman, will consistof a European and an African nominated by the Governor of each territory a total membership of seven. The Chairman and themembers of this Board will be independent of the Federal assembly and Executive, and the Chairman will be appointed by the Governor-General with the approval of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The Board&apos;spowers are designed to ensure that any Federal legislation which appears to the Board to differentiate either in terms or in operationbetween Europeans and Africans, to the disadvantage of the latter, willrequire to be referred to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In addition,the Board will be entitled to make representations to the federal government on any matters affecting African interests.(vii) Chapter VI.  finance the question of the finances of the Federation requires furtherexpert examination and is being referred to a Fiscal Commission, whoseterms of reference are set out in this Chapter. The Commission willbe required to investigate the financial consequences of setting upthe Federation and to make recommendations about revenue andexpenditure, borrowing powers and the transfer of assets and liabilitiesfrom the Territorial Governments to the Federation.(viii) Chapter VII.   The Federal Public service this Chapter is divided into two parts. The first part refers tothe setting up of a Civil Service Preparatory Commission which is towork out the details of how the Federal Public Service is to beestablished, including the arrangements for transfer to the federal public Service of some of the officers and other employees at presentserving in the Territorial Civil Services.5
mThe second part of this Chapter provides for the setting up of apermanent Public Service Commission which will recommend appoint-ments, promotions and transfers in the Federal Public Service once it is established.(ix) Chapter VIII. The Federal JudicatureThis Chapter provides for the establishment of a Federal SupremeCourt whose members will include at least three Judges who are not members of the High Courts of the three Territories. It is intended that this Court shall have original jurisdiction and also be the Courtof first appeal from the High Courts of the three Territories. Anumber of other matters connected with the establishment of theFederal Supreme Court will require further examination by a JudicialCommission, whose terms of reference are also given in this Chapter.(x) Chapter IX.   MiscellaneousThis Chapter deals with a number of matters not dealt with in otherparts of the scheme. Included among these are the provisions forthe amendment of the Constitution. These require that all amendmentsmust be carried by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the Federal Assembly and be reserved for the signification ofHer Majesty&apos;s pleasure. There is also provision that if a TerritorialLegislature or the African Affairs Board has objected to any Billto amend the Constitution Her Majesty&apos;s assent to the Bill can begiven only by Order in Council which would be laid in draft beforethe United Kingdom Parliament. The scheme makes it clear that power to amend the Constitution includes power to institute a second chamber if at any time that is thought desirable.CONCLUSION13. The scheme endeavours to safeguard the essential interests ofthe three Territories and all their inhabitants and to strike a fair balance between the need to create a Federation possessing, botheconomically and politically, adequate scope and strength for its workand the requirement that the Territories themselves shall continue to exist as vigorous entities, independent of the Federation within the sphere of government assigned to them.(Sgd.)

THE DRAFT FEDERAL SCHEMEPREAMBLEThe Preamble to the Constitution will contain recitals to the effectthat:  (a) the Colony of Southern Rhodesia is part of Her Majesty&apos;sdominions and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland are terri-tories under Her Majesty&apos;s protection ;(b) the said territories are the rightful home of aU lawful in-habitants thereof, whatever their origin ;(c) the association of the said territories in a Federation under her Majesty&apos;s sovereignty would conduce to the security,advancement and welfare of all their inhabitants ;(d) the Colony of Southern Rhodesia should continue to enjoyself-government as a member of such a Federation;(e) Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should continue, under thespecial protection of Her Majesty, to enjoy separate Govern-ments responsible among other matters for local and territorialpolitical advancement, so long as their respective peoples sodesire ; and(/) it is accordingly desirable that provision should be made forsuch a Federation under Her Majesty&apos;s sovereignty and forthe establishment of a Federal Government charged, to theextent of its functions, with promoting the security, advance-ment and welfare of all lawful inhabitants of the saidterritories.
THE FEDERATION1. There will be established a Federation comprising the territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.2. The Federation will be known as the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland.3. The seafcC) of the Federal Government will be at such place asmay be decided by a majority of the Federal Assembly.CHAPTER IITHE FEDERAL LEGISLATUREPART 1.   DIVISION OF LEGISLATIVE powers. The legislative power of the Federation will be vested in a federal legislature consisting of a Governor-General(2), representing her majesty, and a Federal Assembly.2. (1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (4) to (6) below, the Federal Legis-lature alone will be empowered to make laws on the matters set outin the First Part of the Federal Legislative List (which Part is referredto as &quot; the Exclusive List&quot;).(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, both the Federal Legisla-ture and (subject to any restrictions contained in their respective con-institutions) the Legislatures of the Territories will be empowered tomake laws on matters set out in the Second Part of the Federal Legisla-tive List (which Part is referred to as &quot; the Concurrent List&quot;), but inthe case of inconsistency between any Federal law and any Territoriallaw on any such subject the provisions of the Federal law will, to theextent of the inconsistency, prevail.(3) Exclusive power to make laws on matters not set out in either the Exclusive List or the Concurrent List will (subject to any restric-tions contained in their respective constitutions) reside in the respectiveTerritorial Legislatures.(4)00 The power of the Federal Legislature to make laws on any matter in the Exclusive List or the Concurrent List will include powerto make provision for the compulsory acquisition of land for Federalpurposes, but (a) in the case of Native Trust and Native Reserve Land as defined in the following Orders in Council (which secure the interestsof Africans in relation to land) all powers of the Federal Legis-lature and Government to acquire land or interests thereinwill be subject to the provisions of those Orders:  (i) The Northern Rhodesia (Crown Lands and native reserves) Orders in Council;(&apos;) A temporary seat for the Federal Government will be required in the firstinstance.(2) As the authority who is empowered to assent to Bills, the Governor-General is part of the Federal Legislature. He will not preside in, or belong to, the federal assembly.(3) This provision implements the assurances already given to safeguard Africanrights in land.
(ii) The Northern Rhodesia Crown Lands and native reserves (Tanganyika District) Orders in Council;(iii) The Northern Rhodesia (Native Trust Land) Orders inCouncil; and(iv) The  Nyasaland  Protectorate (African Trust Land)Orders in Council;or any Orders in Council amending or substituted for thoseOrders; and(b) in the case of land in Native Reserves and in the Native area and Special Native Area as defined in the following letters patent and Act of the Legislature of Southern Rhodesia (whichsecure the interests of Africans in relation to land) all powersof the Federal Legislature and Government to acquire land orinterests therein will be subject to the provisions of those letters and that Act:  (i) The Southern Rhodesia Constitution Letters Patent,1923 ; and(ii) The Land Apportionment Act, 1941 ;or any Letters Patent or any Act of the Legislature of SouthernRhodesia amending or substituted for those Letters Patent or that Act.(5) The Federal Legislature will not by reason only of the inclusion in the Exclusive List of the words &quot; External Affairs &quot;, in so far as suchwords relate to the implementation of treaties and agreements with othercountries, have power to make laws for any Territory with respect toany matter which is not in the Exclusive List or the Concurrent List.(6) In order to avoid congestion of business in the Federal Legis-lature at the commencement of the Federation, the Governor-general will be empowered to prescribe the dates on which the TerritorialLegislatures will cease to have power to legislate on any particularmatter in the Exclusive List; and until such dates are prescribed the subjects in the Exclusive List will be regarded as being in theConcurrent List.3.(1) (1) The Federal Legislature will have power to delegate by Delegation of federal law to the Legislature of a Territory authority (either general legislative or special) to legislate for such Territory with respect to any matter authonty.mentioned in the Exclusive List.(2) (a) In this sub-paragraph &quot; non-Federal matter &quot; means any matter not mentioned in the Exclusive List or the Concurrent List;&quot; Federal matter &quot; means a matter mentioned in the Exclusive List;and &quot; Concurrent matter &quot; means a matter mentioned in the ConcurrentList.(Jb) The Legislature of a Territory will, subject to the provi-sions of the constitution of the Territory, have power to delegate to theFederal Legislature authority (either general or special) to legislate for(4) These provisions enable either a Territorial or the Federal Legislature to delegate to the other. They have been inserted to give some flexibility to the working of theConstitution, but, in order to prevent weakening of the essential functions of theTerritorial Legislatures, the power of delegation by them has been limited and defined.
such Territory with respect to any non-Federal matter for the followingpurposes, that is to say (i) the creation and regulation of any corporate body or other authority to exercise functions in respect of more than oneTerritory ; or(ii) the establishment and regulation of schools for specialcategories of pupils ; or(iii) the regulation of veterinary research, animal health, andtsetse control and research, and the establishment of such services as may be necessary for that purpose.(c) The Legislature of a Territory will also, subject as afore-said, have power to delegate to the Federal Legislature authority to legislate for such Territory with respect to any non-Federal matter which, in the opinion of the Territorial Legislature, is ancillary to, orclosely related to, any Federal or Concurrent matter and should beprovided for in a Federal law which deals with such Federal matteror Concurrent matter: Provided that, when it so delegates authorityto legislate with respect to any non-Federal matter, a Territorial Legis-lature will be required to specify the Federal or Concurrent matter towhich, in its opinion, the non-Federal matter relates or is ancillary,and the Federal Legislature will not legislate with respect to such non-Federal matter except by a law which also deals with such Federal orConcurrent matter.(3) (a) Either Legislature will have power to revoke any legisla-tive authority which it has delegated to the other.(b) Any law by which legislative authority is delegated byone Legislature to the other will prescribe a period of notice whichmust be given before such authority is revoked ; and, except with theconcurrence of the other Legislature, the delegating Legislature willnot revoke the delegated authority except after giving the prescribednotice of its intention so to do.(4) When any legislative authority delegated by the federal legislature to a Territorial Legislature is revoked or spent, any law which has been enacted by the Territorial Legislature in pursuance ofthat authority will remain in force but will be subject to amendmentand repeal by the Federal Legislature.Likewise, when any legislative authority delegated by a TerritorialLegislature to the Federal Legislature is revoked or spent, any law which has been enacted by the Federal Legislature in pursuance ofthat authority will remain in force but will be subject to amendmentand repeal by the Territorial Legislature.(5) When authority to legislate with respect to any matter isdelegated by the Federal Legislature to a Territorial Legislature orvice versa, this will not preclude the delegating Legislature from itselfcontinuing to legislate with respect to such matter i.e. the federation and the Territory will (until the delegated authority is revoked or spent)have concurrent powers of legislation within the delegated field, withFederal law prevailing over Territorial law in case of inconsistency.

The power to make laws relating to trade unions and industrial Tradeconciliation will remain Territorial14); and the power of the Federal unions andLegislature to legislate on any matter in the Federal Legislative List goncUtotioawill not, therefore, include power to legislate on trade unions or indus-trial conciliation.4. The Federal Legislature will be empowered to make laws on Legislationmatters incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Con- ^J^pJ6stitution in the Federal Legislature or in the Government of the Federa-tion or in the Federal Judicature or in any officer or department of theFederation, including the appointment of persons for the execution ofsuch powers.A Territorial Legislature will similarly be empowered to make lawson matters incidental to the execution of any Territorial power.(10) One of the objects of including this item in the Concurrent List is to enable theFederal Government to provide uniform standards of recruitment and training for al!European Police Officers throughout the three Territories, while at the same timeleaving the Territorial Police Forces responsible to the Territorial Governments in theexecution of their duties.The Federal Government will also be empowered by this provision to providecertain common specialised police services, e.g. the C.I.D. and the Fingerprint Bureau,and to maintain a Police Force Central Reserve, members of which could be madeavailable to the Territorial Governments on loan or secondment on a contractual basis.In addition, the Federal Government will require to have its own law enforcementofficers of all ranks for a number of services which appear in the Federal LegislativeList, e.g. Customs and Immigration. If the Federal capital is declared to be &quot; extra-territorial &quot; it will also require police to maintain law and order in the area.(&quot;) One of the reasons for placing this item in the Concurrent List is that in theNorthern Territories a number of public health regulations are enacted and enforcedby the Native Authorities. As a general principle it is considered that regulations made under a Federal law should not apply to Native Authorities and it is thereforeintended that such regulations should be made under Territorial legislation.(&quot;) See Chapter II, Part 3, paragraphs 3 (1) (h), 13, 14 (5) and Chapter VIII.0s) See Chapter VI.C4) This is necsssary as an interim measure in view of the differences which exist atpresent between the Territories in the laws relating to trade unions and industrialconciliation. So far as Federal Government undertakings are concerned, the Confer-ence considered that an obligation should be placed on the Federal Government topromote the adoption in agreement with the three Territorial Governments of unifiedmachinery for industrial conciliation.

The 26 seats for Elected Members will be allocated as follows Southern Rhodesia 14 seats.Northern Rhodesia 8 seats.Nyasaland 4 seats.3. (1) Except for the first general election (and subject to the special provisions with regard to Nyasaland contained in paragraph 5 below),the Federal Legislature will be empowered, subject to sub-paragraph (3)below, to make provision for the election of Elected Members and inparticular for the following matters in relation to such members andtheir election (a) qualifications and disqualifications for election ;(b) the circumstances in which such members will, vacate theirseats;(c) qualifications and disqualifications for registration as an electoror for voting at elections ;(d) the registration of electors ;(e) the holding of elections, direct or indirect;(f) the delimitation of electoral districts for the purpose of return-ing such members to the Federal Assembly and the allocation to any such district of seats in the Assembly ;(g) the definition and trial of offences relating to elections and theimposition of penalties therefor ; and(h) the determination by the Federal Supreme Court of any ques-tion which arises as to the right of any person to be or remainsuch a member.(2) In the exercise of the aforesaid powers the Federal Legislaturemay provide for different methods of election in different territories and also for different methods of election within the same Territory.
(3) (a)*l5) If the Speaker, or the Deputy Speaker on his behalf,certifies that any Bill of the Federal Legislature makes provision for (i) qualifications or disqualifications for election ; or(ii) the circumstances in which a member will vacate his seat;or(iii) qualifications or disqualifications for registration as anelector or for voting at elections ;then the Bill will require to be passed by a vote of two-thirds of all themembers of the Assembly and to be reserved for the signification of her majesty&apos;s pleasure.(b) The requirements of sub-paragraph (3) (a) above will notapply in respect of any provision which -(i) disqualifies a person for election or for registration as anelector or for voting at elections, by reason of his beingconcerned in any offence relating to elections ; or(ii) requires a person to vacate his seat upon conviction ofsuch an offence.4.(16) (1) For the first general election to the Federal Assembly, and thereafter until the Federal Legislature otherwise provides, the election of Elected Members, including the matters particularly referred to inparagraph 3 (1) above, will be governed (a) as regards Southern Rhodesia, by the law which is in force immediately before the commencement of the Federation inrespect of elections to the Southern Rhodesia LegislativeAssembly ; and(b) as regards Northern Rhodesia, by the law which is in force immediately before the commencement of the Federation inrespect of elections to the Northern Rhodesia LegislativeCouncil.(2) (a) To enable them to be used thus for Federal electionsthe electoral laws of Southern and Northern Rhodesia will require someadaptation. (In particular it will be necessary to delimit Federalelectoral districts, which will be fewer in number than the existingdistricts).

(2) If the Federal Assembly passes any Bill in respect ofwhich the Prime Minister has received a notice of objection or if the Prime Minister receives a notice of objection in respectof a Bill which has already been passed by the Assembly, thenotice of objection shall be laid before the Governor-Generalwhen the Bill is presented to him for assent and thereupon thefollowing provisions of this section shall have effect.(3) Save as is otherwise provided in subsection (4) of thissection the Governor-General shall not assent to the Bill butshall reserve it for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasureand shall send the notice of objection to a Secretary of Statetogether with the Bill.(4) The Governor-General in his discretion may assent tothe Bill-C&quot;)(a) if he is satisfied that it is not a differentiating measure;or(b) if he is satisfied, upon representations made to him bythe Prime Minister, that it is essential in the public interest that the Bill be brought into immediate operation;but, if he does so assent, the Governor-General shall forthwithsend to a Secretary of State the Bill to which he has assentedtogether with the notice of objection and a statement of his reasons for assenting.&quot;u u ^ ^^ &quot; 6.

GENERALIntroductory LA Fiscal Commission is being set up to investigate and report onNote- what financial arrangements should be made for a Federation of thethree Territories.  The terms of reference to be given to this commission are as follows:  &quot; (1) To assess the effect of the creation of a Federation ofSouthern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the public expenditure of the Federal area as a whole, and in particular toestimate, after taking account of the transfer of assets and liabilitiesinvolved, the net cost of (a) Federal services under the proposed Federation ;(b) the services remaining to be undertaken by the constituentGovernments ;bearing in mind the need for the maximum economy in administrationcompatible with the basic purposes of the proposed Federation.(2) In the light of (1) above, and in the light of the allocation of sources of revenue set out in Chapter VI of the Draft federal scheme, to undertake :an enquiry into the means whereby the revenues available, or to be made available, to the three con-stituent Governments and to the Federal Government under theproposed Federation should best be collected and distributed betweenthe Federal Government and the constituent Governments, havingregard on the one hand to the need to preserve to the constituentTerritories financial autonomy within the sphere of governmentassigned to them, and on the other hand to the importance of ensuring that the financial resources of the area comprised by theproposed Federation are applied for the benefit of the area as awhole.
(3) To consider, in particular, what form of taxation on incomeswould be best adapted to the needs of such a Federal system, bear-ing in mind the desirability of ensuring, so far as circumstances permit,a uniform practice throughout the Federal area as regards reliefs and allowances.(4) To consider, in the light of the fundamental importance of en-suring co-ordination of loan policies, what arrangements could mostsuitably be made between the Federal Government and the constituentGovernments as regards external and internal government borrowing.(5) To undertake an enquiry into the internal and external problemscreated by a decision to establish a Customs Union of the three Terri-tories constituting the proposed Federation and to consider the means by which these problems can best be solved in the interests of theFederal area.(6) To consider the steps which should be taken to bring theCustoms Union into full effect as expeditiously as possible andat any rate within a period of not more than two years fromthe decision to establish such a Union.(7) To submit recommendations on the above subjects to theGovernments of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, and to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.&quot;In the matter of income tax the Conference noted from a study ofother federal systems that it has in general been found best to arrangefor basic income tax to be assessed and collected on a federal basis.It took the view that so far as possible income tax law and administra-tion should be unified.  This would apply to all taxes on income.2. Until the Fiscal Commission has submitted its report it is notpossible to set out in detail what the financial arrangements for theFederation would be. They should however be on the following general pattern.3. As will be seen from the terms of reference the distribution of income tax between the Federation and the Territories will be oneof the matters on which the Fiscal Commission will make recom-mendations. In addition to any taxes on income which may be assigned to the Federation as a result of these recommendations andsubject to any overriding considerations to which the Fiscal commission may draw attention the Federation should have the followingrevenues : (a) The produce of Customs and Excise.(b) Postal, Telephones and Telecommunications revenues.(c) Fees for services rendered by the Federal Government andsuch other revenues as may accrue to the Federation in con-nection with any matter within the jurisdiction of theFederation.4. All revenues or other moneys raised or received by the Governmentof the Federation will form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to beappropriated for the purposes of the Federation in the manner pre-scribed by the Constitution and subject to the charges imposed thereby.
5. (a) The cost of the collection and management of the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund will form a first charge on the Fund.(b) The Constitution will also charge upon the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund the emoluments of the Governor-General, the chief justice and other Judges of the Federal Supreme Court and the Chair-man and other members of the African Affairs Board.Audit. 6. AH such costs, charges and expenses will be reviewed and auditedin such manner as may be laid down by Federal law.Appropria-       7. Money will be withdrawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fundtions. oniy un(jer appropriation made by law but provision will be made onthe usual lines whereby, in advance of parliamentary appropriation,money can in certain circumstances be made available to meet un-foreseen expenditure and to cover any period, not exceeding four months, between the end of a financial year and the passing of the appropriation Act for the following year.Charges onConsolidatedRevenueFund.PART 2.   BORROWING1. The Fiscal Commission is being directed (cf. terms of reference(4)) to consider, in the light of the fundamental importance of ensuringco-ordination of loan policies, what arrangements could most suitablybe made between the Federal Government and the Territorial Govern-ments as regards external and internal government borrowing. Itappears that such co-ordination could best be achieved by the establish-ment of a Loans Council for the Federation on the model of theLoan Council of Australia which has executive powers over certain aspects of governmental borrowing. This Council would be repre-sentative of the Federal Government and the three Territorial Govern-ments. It is envisaged that it would deal solely with government borrowing outside the Federal area by the three Territorial Govern-ments and by the Federal Government.2. No final arrangements can be proposed for external and internalborrowing by the Federal Government and the Territorial Governmentsuntil the Fiscal Commission has reported on this matter, particularly as the question of loans is to some extent connected with the questionof revenues.PART 3.   TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESIn the course of its deliberations the Fiscal Commission will consider what assets and liabilities it will be necessary or desirable to transfer from the Territories to the Federation and the terms on which suchtransfers should take place.
THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICEPART 1.   CIVIL SERVICE PREPARATORY COMMISSIONIn order to work out the details of how the Federal Public service is to be established a Commission of Enquiry, to be known as theCivil Service Preparatory Commission, is being set up with the follow-ing terms of reference:  &quot; (1) In the light of the provisions of the Draft Federal Scheme,and in particular of the provisions of Part 2 of Chapter VII, tomake recommendations concerning the establishment of a federal public Service&apos;34) and in particular for the following matters:  (i) initial arrangements for the transfer to the Federal PublicService of those functions which are to be transferred fromTerritorial to Federal control;(ii) organisation and structure of the Federal Public Service ;(iii) terms and conditions of service of officers and other employeesappointed to the Federal Public Service ;(iv) arrangements for the transfer to the Federal Public Serviceof those officers and other employees at present serving inthe Territories who will be required to staff Federal services ;(In making recommendations on this subject the Prepara-tory Commission shall have regard to the need for preservation-tion of existing rights and avenues of advancement of such officers and employees.)(v) arrangements which should govern the grant of the right to retire on abolition-of-office terms to officers and other employees who are at present staffing such services of theTerritorial Governments as are to be transferred to theFederal Government and who elect not to accept appoint-ment in the Federal Public Service.(2) To consider what steps should be taken to work towardsuniformity in terms and conditions of service between the federal public Service and the Territorial Public Services in order toencourage interchangeability of staff between these four services.&quot;PART 2.

(1) There will be a Public Service Commission^ to advise &quot;meGovernor-General in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by paragraph 2 above.(2) (a) The Public Service Commission will consist of such persons as the Governor-General may appoint, one of whom theGovernor-General will nominate as Chairman of the Commission.(b) No person will be appointed as or will remain a memberof the Public Service Commission if he is a member of the federal legislature or of any Territorial Legislature.4. (1) In the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 2 abovethe Governor-General will act after consultation with the Public service commission.(2) -The Public Service Commission will have such other functions as may be assigned to it by law or regulations enacted in pursuanceof paragraph 6 below.5. The Governor-General may delegate to any person or authority in the Federation any of the powers conferred on him by paragraph above. The Governor-General may delegate any such power subjectto such limitations and conditions as he may think fit, and in particularmay require the person or authority to whom the power is delegated to exercise such power with the advice of the Public Service Corn-mission and may prescribe whether or not such person is to act inaccordance with the advice of the Public Service Commission.6. (1) The Federal Legislature will be empowered to make laws forgiving effect to the foregoing provisions of this Part and in particular for the following matters:  (a) additional functions of the Public Service Commission ;(b) appointment of temporary members of the Commission (includ-ing a temporary Chairman) ;(c) tenure of office and other terms of service of members (includ-ing temporary members) of the Commission ;id) organisation of work of the Commission and the manner inwhich it shall perform its functions ;(e) staff of the Commission and their terms of service ;(/) delegation to any member of the Commission of any of theCommission^ functions.(2) Until the Federal Legislature makes provision for the matters referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, the Governor-General maymake provision for such matters by regulations. Such regulations willbe subject to revocation and amendment by Federal law.7. The conditions of service, including pensions, gratuities and otherlike benefits, of public officers (and their widows, children, dependantsand personal representatives) which might be affected by the establish-ment of the Federation, will be preserved. This will also apply toformer public officers who, although retired or transferred elsewhere,are entitled to such benefits.(3!) The Public Service Commission would be a continuing body quite distinct fromthe Preparatory Commission referred to in Part 1 of this Chapter.
THE FEDERAL JUDICATURE1. (1) The Federal Supreme Court will consist of a President, and Federalsuch other judges as the Governor-General may appoint, one of whom ^^tmemay be designated Vice-President.(2) A judge will not be removed from office except by theGovernor-General on an address from the Federal Assembly prayingfor such removal on the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity orinfirmity of mind or body.(3) The judges will receive such remuneration as may be pre-scribed by Federal law but the remuneration of a judge will not be diminished during his tenure of office.2. If, in proceedings in any other court in the Federation, any ques- Jurisdictiontion arises as to the interpretation of the Constitution, the court will Jn constitu-have power to refer such question directly to the Federal Supreme ^&quot;fersCourt.3. The Federal Supreme Court will have original jurisdiction in pro- Originalceedings between Territorial Governments or between the Federal jurisdiction.Government and  any Territorial  Government, and in  such othermatters(3G) as may be prescribed.4. The Federal Supreme Court will have jurisdiction to hear and Appellatedetermine- jur.sdict.on.(a) appeals from its own original side, in so far as such appealsare provided for by Federal law ;(b) appeals from Territorial Courts in matters arising under Terri-torial law, in so far as such appeals are provided for byTerritorial law ; and(c) appeals from Territorial Courts in matters arising underFederal law, in so far as such appeals are provided for byTerritorial or Federal law.5. Subject to the preceding paragraphs of this Chapter, jurisdiction in civil and criminal proceedings arising under Federal law will, unless it is otherwise provided by Federal law, vest in and be exercised byTerritorial Courts as if the Federal law in question were a Territoriallaw,6. The establishment of the Federal Judicature is largely a tech-nical matter which will have to be studied and reported on later bya Judicial Commission. The terms of reference of this commission will be as follows:  &quot; To consider in the light of the proposals in the Draft federal scheme, particularly Chapter VIII thereof: (i) the constitution of the Federal Supreme Court, whose members shall include at least three judges who are not members of the High Courts of the three Territories ;C36) These other matters should be comparatively few. Whether any of them need to be described in the Constitution itself cannot be decided until the Judicial Corn-mission has reported see paragraph 6 below.
(ii) the jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court, original Hi?appellate ;(iii) appeals from the Federal Supreme Court;(iv) the legislative authority of the Legislatures of the federation and the Territories respectively in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court;(v) the making of Rules of Court for the Federal Supreme Courtincluding rules regulating the procedure in questions regard-ing membership of the Federal Assembly which come beforethe Court under Chapter II, Part 3, of the Draft federal scheme;and to make recommendations.&quot;CHAPTER IXMISCELLANEOUS1. At the commencement of the Federation there will be in existencea number of Territorial laws relating to matters which will under theConstitution become Federal matters. The Federal Legislature willhave to make provision for such laws to be construed in a manner which conforms to the provisions of the Constitution (e.g. by the sub-stitution of references to Federal authorities for references to Territorialauthorities). It may, however, be necessary to make some such pro-visions before the Constitution comes fully into operation. TheGovernor-General will, therefore, be empowered in his discretion tomake formal adaptations in Territorial laws for this purpose at anytime before the first meeting of the Executive Council.2. To preserve the rights reserved under the Lewanika: concessionsthe Constitution will contain a provision similar to section 41 of theNorthern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1924, which reads as follows:  &quot; 41. (1) It shall not be lawful for any purpose whatever, except with the consent of the Chief of the Barotse and with the approvalof the Secretary of State, to alienate from the Chief and peopleof the Barotse the territory reserved from prospecting by virtue ofthe concessions from Lewanika to the British South Africa Company,dated the 17th day of October, 1900, and the 11th day of August,1909.(2) All rights reserved to or for the benefit of natives bythe aforesaid concessions as approved by the Secretary of State shall continue to have full force and effect.&quot;3. A person who sits or votes in the Federal Assembly knowing or having reasonable grounds for knowing that he is not entitled so todo will be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds for everyday on which he so sits or votes. The penalty will be recoverableby action in the Federal Supreme Court at the suit of the Attorney-General of the Federation.4. To reduce the risk of litigation on constitutional questions wherethe Federal Legislature and all three Territorial Legislatures are agreed,the Constitution will contain a section on the following lines:  
1?&quot; (1) If the Federal Assembly by resolution directs that any federal law shall be laid upon the table of each Territorial Legislature,such law shall be so laid as soon as is practicable thereafter:Provided that no resolution shall be passed in pursuance of this subsection later than one month after the date of enactment of thelaw to which it relates.(2) At any time within a period of six months after a federal law has been laid on the table of a Territorial Legislature in pur-suance of subsection (1) of this section (which period is hereinafter referred to as &quot; the prescribed period&quot;) such Legislature may by resolution declare that it is not satisfied that the law relates onlyto Federal matters.(3) If-(a) a Federal law has been laid on the table of each TerritorialLegislature in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section ;and(b) no Territorial Legislature has, within the prescribed period,made in respect of that law such a declaration as is referredto in subsection (2) of this section,then (except in any proceedings which have already been commenced)the validity of that law shall not be questioned in any court on theground that the law relates to matters other than Federal matters.(4) (a) In this section the expression &quot; Federal matters &quot; used inrelation to a Federal law means matters with respect to which theFederal Legislature had authority to legislate at the time when suchlaw was enacted.(b) For the purposes of this section the date of enactment ofa law shall be the date on which such law is assented to.&quot;5. (1) The provisions of the Constitution will be subject to amend- Amendmentment by Federal law : Provided that a Bill for the amendment of the of constitution (hereinafter referred to as a &quot; constitutional Bill &quot;)-        Constitution.(a) will require to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the Federal Assembly excluding the Speaker;and(b) will not be assented to by the Governor-General but will be reserved by him for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure.(2) Her Majesty&apos;s assent to a constitutional Bill will be requiredto be signified by Order in Council (a) if any Territorial Legislature by resolution objects to the bill or to any provision thereof within sixty days after the bill has been passed by the Federal Assembly ; or(b) if, under Chapter V, a notice of objection to the Bill by the african Affairs Board is laid before the Governor-General atthe time when the Bill is presented to him for the Royal assent.(3) No draft of an Order in Council signifying Her Majesty&apos;assent to a constitutional Bill will be presented to Her Majesty unless (a) a copy of the draft has been laid before both Houses ofParliament; and
(b) neither House has, within a period of forty days beginning with the day on which the copy of the draft is laid before it,resolved that the draft should not be presented to Her Majesty.(4) Her Majesty&apos;s assent to a constitutional Bill will, when it isnot required to be signified by Order in Council, be signified through a Secretary of State,(S7) but will not be so signified sooner than sixty-five days after the Bill has been passed by the Federal Assembly unlesswithin that time the Legislatures of all three Territories have passedresolutions to the effect that they do not propose to object to the bill or to any provision thereof under sub-paragraph (2) (a) above.(5) The power to amend the Constitution by Federal law will include power to establish and constitute a second chamber of theFederal Legislature and to prescribe its functions and generally to make such amendments of the Constitution as may be considered necessary or expedient in consequence of the establishment of such second chamber.C37) This is the normal way of signifying the Royal assent to a Bill which has been reserved. &quot; &quot;U-if-Ci

ANNEX IIFINAL COMMUNIQUE OF THE VICTORIA FALLSCONFERENCE ON THE CLOSER ASSOCIATION OFTHE CENTRAL AFRICAN territories the Victoria Falls Conference issued the following communique after its finalmeeting on Friday, September 21st, 1951: 1. The present Conference was convened by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland for the purposeof discussing the question of Closer Association of the British territories in central africa.2. The Conference opened at Victoria Falls on Tuesday, 18th September, andwas of a representative character. In the case of Southern Rhodesia the representativesincluded the Prime Minister and other Ministers and leaders of the Opposition parties in Parliament. In the case of Northern Rhodesia the delegation consisted of theGovernor and official and unofficial members of the Legislative Council, includingAfricans. Nyasaland was represented by the Governor, senior officials and leadingunofficial persons, European and African. The United Kingdom delegationconsisted of the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and for Commonwealth Relations,accompanied by some of their chief advisers.3. The Conference had before it the Report prepared last March by a numberof senior official advisers of the four Governments concerned. The authors of that report had been requested &quot; to examine the problem in all its aspects and considerwhether it is possible in the light of this examination for them to formulate proposalsfor a further advance to be made in the closer association of the three Central african territories which they could recommend to the Governments of these territories and to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom &quot;. Their work waspurely exploratory and did not commit any of the participating Governments to theadoption of any proposals that they might formulate.4. The Report of the London Conference of officials was unanimous on all points. Its main recommendation was that closer association between the three territories ought to be brought about and that the need for this is urgent. Itrecommended further that this should be done not by amalgamation of the territories, but on a federal basis; and put forward in some detail a schemeframed to take particular account of the special features of the Central Africansituation, including the self-governing status of Southern Rhodesia, and designedto provide substantial safeguards for the interests of Africans. Moreover, those matters most closely affecting the life of Africans would under the proposals in theReport come within the territorial and not within the federal sphere; and withinthe territorial sphere the Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland Governments would remain responsible as at present to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.5. In announcing the present Conference it has from the outset been made clearthat there was no intention of reaching decisions at it binding on any Government.It was realised that such a conference might disclose points of difference with regardto the principle of federation as well as to the proposals made in the Report to bring it into being. This has proved to be the case. It has become evident that further discussion within each territory and exchanges of views between the four governments will be necessary, and the Conference has therefore adjourned. Itis hoped that the position can be sufficiently clarified to enable the Conference toreassemble in London about the middle of next year.6. On the main question of federation, as so far presented and examined, theConference, with the exception of the African representatives, showed itself favourable to the principle of federation. The representatives of African interests in northern rhodesia explained that Africans would be willing to consider the question of federation on the basis of the Report of the London Conference of officials afterthe policy of partnership in Northern Rhodesia had been defined and, as so defined,put into progressive operation.
7. There was general agreement in the Conference that economic and poftiilalpartnership between Europeans and Africans is the only policy under whichfederation could be brought about in the conditions of Central Africa, and it was recognised that any scheme of closer association would have to give full effect to that principle.8. The Conference was gravely concerned at the dangers which would flow fromany weakening or dilution of the British connection and British traditions and principles in the three territories and agreed that they should so be strengthenedas to ensure that they should continue to prevail.9. The Conference recognised the advantages which if an acceptable scheme with adequate safeguards for all could be agreed upon would arise from the commonhandling of problems that transcend territorial boundaries, such as communications,research, defence, higher education, and the planning of economic development.10. It has however been made clear at the Conference that one of the mainobstacles to the general acceptance of federation rests in the apprehensions felt byAfricans in the two northern territories that federation might impair their positionand prospects in the respective territories.11. The Conference agreed that in any further consideration of proposals for federation: (i) The protectorate status of the two northern territories would be accepted and preserved. This therefore excludes any consideration now or in thefuture of amalgamation of the three territories unless a majority of theinhabitants of all three territories desired it.(ii) Land and land-settlement questions in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandmust remain, as at present (subject to the ultimate authority of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom), the responsibility of theterritorial Government and Legislature in each territory and not of anyfederal authority. The land rights of the African people in northern rhodesia and Nyasaland must remain secured in accordance with theexisting Orders in Council on the subject.(iii) The political advancement of the peoples of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, both in local and territorial government, must remain as atpresent (subject to the ultimate authority of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom) the responsibility of the Government andLegislature of each territory, and not of any federal authority.12. It was further agreed that if any form of closer association is eventually decided on all these rights should be enshrined as an integral part of the constitution.13. The Conference did not reach the stage of discussing the constitution and powers of the Federal Parliament, but the Southern Rhodesian delegation intimated that there were certain points in the Report as written with which they do not agreeand which should be discussed with all concerned before the resumed conference is held. These points would not weaken the powers of the territorial legislaturesreferred to in paragraph 11 above.14. The Conference understood that other delegations might also have reservationson points in the Report as written.(S/52)   (17I70r)   Wt. 1099-1618   K4   10/52   DA&apos;.PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN
APPENDIX IIINORTHERN RHODESIASir G. Rennie to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  (Received,9th December,1952; repeated to Governor of Nyasaland No. 301)Immediate(PersonalNo. 84. Secret) 9th December, 1952.Your telegram personal No. 85.   Federation.Following for Gorell Barnes:  It is exceedingly difficult to predict the effect on the political and security situation. Reactions throughout the greater part of the rural areas are unlikely to be serious but, in some areas, Congress leaders may well persuade the majorityof Africans to take part in non-co-operation and withdrawal of labour from government and other employment. No disturbances expected in Barotselandwhere no strong feelings on Federation exist, but if there are important changes(disadvantageous to Africans) in the scheme, reaction of Barotse Native authority will almost certainly be adverse. There may well be trouble in parts of the SerenjeDistrict and in the Northern Province, where much will depend on the attitudeof Chitimukulu, who is in alliance with the Congress in strong opposition to federation, but has hitherto not favoured violence. There is danger of someorganised resistance by Congress branches, with the probability of incidents, andthe possibility of disturbances, in Winamwanga Reserve and Chinsali Area,Northern Province. The same applies to the thickly populated Luapula Valley.Along the line of rail, much will depend in Livingstone on the attitude of the paramount Chief of Barotseland, who despises Congress and is known to dislikeviolence, though his influence is probably less than it was, and his dislike of criticismwould make it unlikely that he would take a firm line. In the European farmingareas along the line of rail, not much trouble beyond a possible general strike maybe expected, though in the Mazabuka District, which is a stronghold of the Congress,there might well be some tearing down of fences and other damage to property.There may be ugly demonstrations in the line of rail towns. On the Copperbelt,there is every chance of a passive resistance campaign developing, with the possi-bility of isolated incidents of violence. Should the present safeguards in the schemebe weakened, we may look to disquiet, more bitter opposition by Africans, andaccusations of breach of faith. There are rumours of Congress secret plans, andone report has it that Congress plans as follows:  \i) strikes on the Copperbelt and the line of rail;(ii) propaganda to all chiefs to spread the news and prevent labour goingto the mines;(iii) Congress may adopt Mau Mau tactics wherever they have a local branch;and(iv) there is another plan which is secret and only known by the parent body in Lusaka, and the Committee Members in Lusaka and the Copperbelt,Undue importance should not be attached to the last two points, but theyserve to indicate the difficulty of predicting the course of events if the decision is taken to proceed. Provided that there are no important changes in the scheme,and that the safeguards are really effective my present view is that there should beno lasting bitterness or long drawn out strife or violence on the part of agitators.But the future will depend upon whether the scheme implemented in good faith,and whether Africans reap any benefits or the reverse. Firm action by the Govern-ment might discredit Congress leaders. If Federation is not imposed, Congress will consider that they have won a great victory and demands by European politiciansfor a greater measure of self-government will increase racial tension and strengthen the influence of Congress, with the possibility of an eventual conflict as great as iiFederation had been imposed, and more difficult to deal with.
Appendix IVNYASALANDAppreciation of the Effect on the Political and Security Situation in the protectorate of a Decision to Proceed with Central African FederationAssumptions(a) That the federal scheme is on the general lines of the draft scheme in command 8573, but possibly with important changes of detail;(b) that the majority at any rate of vocal African opinion in Central Africa is against the scheme; but(c) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom genuinely considers the scheme to be in the best interests of Central Africa includingAfricans.The Political Situation : December, 19521. The political situation has deteriorated during the past six weeks and hasnow reached a stage at which it has definite security implications. This deteriorationis likely to continue as the federation issue works up to a climax. The cause of thisdeterioration is the campaign of racial jealousy and distrust now being undertaken by the Nyasaland African Congress.2. So long as the Government gave no positive lead in the federation issue,Congress had the field to itself and was able to impose its views on Africans byfomenting fear and distrust of Southern Rhodesia and its European inhabitants.Those few Africans who spoke in favour of federation or who wished to learn moreabout it were quickly and effectively silenced by Congress members, often by threatsand intimidation.3. As soon as the Government began to give a positive lead with regard to federation, and took steps to explain its advantages to the mass of Africans, andespecially after the Minister of State&apos;s tour, there were signs of a swing to more moderate views. Congress, noticing these, immediately and vigorously extendedits campaign to include the direct promotion of racial jealousy and distrust of localEuropeans, both official and unofficial, and to undermine confidence in the Pro-vincial Administration and the Nyasaland Government.4. Africans who speak in favour of federation or wish to discuss it, and evenmore so those who enter into discussions on the subject with Europeans are nowbranded as traitors, in the pay of either the Government or the Capricorn AfricaSociety, Who are prepared to sell their country and their people to the Europeans.These accusations are made regardless of the status of the person concerned andChiefs would not be immune from them. In addition, Congress has now increased its representation in the villages to a point where the vocal elements are sometimesunruly and are always in a position to smother and overcome any individualsinclined to more moderate views. It may be assumed that Congress has nowrepresentatives in all the main villages and particularly in those around NativeAuthority Headquarters, and that these representatives are carrying on constantpropaganda to cause jealousy and distrust and to undermine confidence in theEuropean. (It is significant that one District reports that Africans, in talk among themselves, now allude not to &quot;Government officers&quot; but to &quot;whites&quot;). the african Civil Servants&apos; Association, of course, faithfully rides the Congress line.Position of the Native Authorities5. The effect of all this, coupled with events in Kenya, has been thoroughlyto frighten the Chiefs, most of whom are consequently subordinating themselves to congress dictation. One or two are still standing aloof; but most are adopting the role of figureheads voicing the opinion of the vocal elements, and some have come out openly as Congress supporters; this last faction is growing. It will be recalled that in the early stages many Chiefs ventured the opinion that it was a-mistake to invite African opinion, and that if Her Majesty&apos;s Government thoughtfederation would be a. good thing it should be imposed without discussion. While alarge number probably still adhere to this view and would probably accept federation
if it came (if only because the decision would bring relief from the doubts anduncertainties of their present position), most are afraid to say so, or in fact to say anything which might antagonise Congress. Their position can easily be under-mined by the Congress organisation in their villages, and they fear they would getno support from other Chiefs.6. A significant feature of the present situation is the ease and speed withwhich Chiefs and others who oppose Congress can now be brought to book. Itwould seem that fear of federation cannot be divorced, from fear of Congress.As a result of the Congress campaign a growing disrespect towards Europeans and government officials has become noticeable, even among the Chiefs, and thisshows signs of spreading.External influences7. Events in Kenya are being closely watched by Africans and there have been an increasing number of expressions of sympathy towards Mau Mau, and of talk of something similar to Mau Mau being started in Nyasaland if federation is imposed. There has also been talk of replacing J. R. N. Chinyama, the President-General of Congress, as he is not militant enough in his leadership. HastingsBanda is maintaining his spate of exhortation and incitement towards the goalof African self-government and is responsible more than any single other person for the present situation.8. The Nyasaland African Congress has been offered three seats on the Eastand Central African Anti-Federation League, the headquarters of which are inNairobi. It is not yet known whether this offer has been accepted but it is clearthat external influences are affecting the political situation in Nyasaland to a greaterdegree than ever before.Short-term prospects . It would seem that the situation is likely to boil up at about the time of theLondon Conference, and thereafter to work up to a climax coinciding with the finaldecision on federation.If federation comes about10. It is improbable that Congress, having worked up political feeling to ahigh pitch and having assured Africans that they have only to say &quot; No &quot; in orderto avert federation, will accept the imposition of federation without some sort ofdemonstration. This might take the form of strikes in Government or other services; walk-outs; and possibly non-co-operation by the Chiefs (NativeAuthorities). This last, if it amounted to widespread passive resistance, non-payment of Native Tax, etc., would be very embarrassing, for the Chiefs wouldbe upheld in the eyes of their people by local Congressmen and in the rural areasat least administration would be made very difficult.11. There is a good deal of loose talk among Africans about the Mau Mauactivities, and the possibility of a movement on these lines in Nyasaland cannot be excluded.12. If federation comes about, trouble is likely to be precipitated, but there isa good chance that it might be of short duration. Once it becomes apparent thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government and the Nyasaland Government do not intend to beintimidated by Congress, they are likely to regain and command respect and con-fidence from the waverers, and the Chiefs may well draw the line at militant dis-orders, particularly if the situation is firmly handled from the start. (It must beremembered that the Chiefs&apos; salaries would be jeopardised by an open break with government.)If Federation does not Come About13. On the other hand, the situation is not likely to be greatly improved bya rejection of federation. The Congress campaign of distrust of Europeans and ofthe Government is likely to continue with a view to launching the Congress alterna-tive to federation, which is self-government under African domination within 5 years. Latest Police reports indicate that Congress meetings are now going under-ground, which may portend mischief.
14. It is likely that Congress now feel almost strong enough to launch theircampaign for self-government. A rejection of federation will be claimed and accepted as a demonstration of their power and the support which they can com-mand from external sources, and this is likely to win them many new adherents.Though the Chiefs have stated that they intend to free themselves from Congressdomination when the federation issue has been disposed of, there is little chance that they will have the will or the power to do so, except perhaps in the case ofrejection of federation by Southern Rhodesia.15. In the case of rejection other than by Southern Rhodesia any resistance to Congress is likely to collapse, and while there would probably be some breathing space while Congress win the Chiefs over to the idea of self-government underAfrican domination, trouble would be delayed rather than averted. Loss of con-fidence in the Nyasaland Government and its officials would be accelerated, and thegeneral political situation would deteriorate instead of improving.Conclusions16. African opposition to federation is largely of artificial creation, and it is extremely difficult to distinguish between fear of federation and fear of the Nyasa-land African Congress. To the average African who thinks about these things,the alternatives seem to be (a) the acceptance of federation with all that he has beenmade to fear from it, or (b) self-government by Nyasaland Africans in 5 years.17. Ruling out the possibility of the latter alternative, trouble is likely to occur in any case within the foreseeable future and the sooner it comes the lesstime there will be for outside influence to direct it. Moreover, if it came on thefederation issue, and federation proved in the end to be to Africans&apos; visible benefit,Congress would lose considerable face.18. Any estimate of the nature and extent of possible trouble must at thisstage be largely conjectural. See paragraph 10 above. If trouble occurred, and ifan &quot; incident&quot; occurred at the outset of such a nature that it could be firmlydealt with, the chances are that opposition would crumble. See paragraph 12 above.19. The more quickly the federation issue can be disposed of, one way or another, the better; for Congress is finding the cloak of opposition to the federa-tion proposals, fear of Southern Rhodesia, and distrust of the Government, a most useful one under which to foment inter-racial distrust and hatred and to attainAfrican unity to support an all-out campaign for African self-government.
