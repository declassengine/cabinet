CONFIDENTIAL COPY NO  ^&quot;5C.(52) 45324TH DECEMBER, 1952CABINETLIFE PEERSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate a memorandum sent tohim by Lord Simon about his Life Peers Bill.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I.24TH DECEMBER, 1952LIFE PEERS bill. The Bill proposes to authorise the creation of a limited number of life peers who would be members of the House of Lords - not more than tenin any ^ ear.    Experience shows that people who are well qualified tocontribute to Lords  Debates refuse a peerage because they do not want to involve their children.2. The proposal that there should be life peers is a feature of manyrecent schemes for Lords reform.    We already have Lords of Appeal for life,and the ecclesiastical members of the House do not transmit their member-ship to their eldest son.3. The Prime Minister would make good use of the power to advise thecreation of life peers.    At the same time the creation of hereditary peers would go on in proper cases.4. The powers of the House of Lords, as limited by the Parliament Acts,would continue, and the relation between the two Chambers would beunaffected.    All the Bill does is to enable a new element to be added in the composition of the House.5. Wider schemes of Lords reform have no chance of being adopted bygeneral consent.    The taking away of legislative power from somehereditary peers would be bitterly opposed.    To judge from what Jowittsaid in a recent debate, Labour would clamour, in any three-party conference, for the ending of all hereditary peerages, and the effort at lords reform by conference would be likely to end in confusion and disillusionment.6. In any case, if the merits of the creation of life peers is recognised,why not authorise their creation now?    If the House is given a fair opportunityof a free vote on Second Reading, and the Conservative Whips are not put onagainst it, I am confident that the Second Reading would be carried.I hope, therefore, that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet will decide that the Bill should be given a fair run,
