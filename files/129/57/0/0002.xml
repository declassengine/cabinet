THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF  HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. ^0C. (52) 40212th November, 1952CABINETVOLTA RIVER ALUMINIUM scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theChancellor of the Duchy of LancasterWe propose to arrange for the publication, if possible before the Common-wealth Conference, of the annexed White Paper announcing that the Governmentare favourable in principle to participation in the Volta River Aluminium schemeand that a Preparatory Commission will be set up at once to complete thepreparatory work.2. The proposals are summarised at the beginning of the White Paper.Briefly, the scheme will involve capital expenditure on hydro-electric and other works provisionally estimated at about  100 millions initially and about  144millions ultimately. All the estimates are tentative and at present costs, but as willbe seen from the table in paragraph 12 the share of the United Kingdom Govern-ment is expected to be of the order of  43 millions initially: it might rise to about! 57 millions ultimately. The initial expenditure will be spread over a period of, say,seven years. On completion of the first stage of development, 80,000 tons of aluminium a year will be produced, and 210,000 tons will be the ultimate annualcapacity, which it is hoped to attain within twenty years at most from first produc-tion: at least 75 per cent, of the output has to be offered to the United Kingdom.3. The justification for the United Kingdom Government investment is theneed for an aluminium smelter in the Sterling Area to meet the growing require-rnents of the United Kingdom industry and to reduce our dependence on dollarsupplies. The scheme will also make a major contribution to the economic and social progress of the Gold Coast, and will further our policy of encouraging thedevelopment of the resources of the Commonwealth.4. The best technical advice has been taken in preparing the scheme. the aluminium companies and the consultants employed by the two Governments^ Sir William Halcrow and Partners (the consulting engineers to the Gold coast government) and Cooper Brothers and Company (the chartered accountants whohave been advising us on the financial aspects) agree that it is technically and economically sound at present levels of costs. With a scheme of this size undertropical conditions, it is essential that before final commitments are undertakenevery precaution shall be taken. Hence the proposal to set up a Preparatory Com-mission at once to follow, up the work which has been done already and to examinethe problems in greater detail. The cost of the Preparatory Commission, which isnot expected to exceed  400,000, will be shared equally by the two Governments,but it will be a charge on the hydro-electric project if it is decided to go ahead, andin that event they will be reimbursed.5. Formally, none of the parties will have to commit themselves until thePreparatory Commission has reported perhaps eighteen months or two yearshence but our colleagues should recognise that it will be difficult for us to with-draw later unless there is an unfavourable report from the Preparatory commissioner some change in the circumstances which justifies withdrawal or delay.43208
6. We must therefore face the political and other risks which are bound to arise from this scheme. We have done what we can to lessen these risks. Provisionshave been included in the scheme notably a guarantee by the aluminium com-panies which should ensure that the power project will fully service the Governmentloan which will greatly reduce the risk of loss to the United Kingdom taxpayer.The Gold Coast Government at their own request have been, given the right toan equity interest in the smelter company and will have a substantial direct stake inthe success of the scheme. The participation of the aluminium producers should ensure that the smelter is managed efficiently, and their readiness to invest so much money in it is evidence of their confidence in the scheme. Nevertheless, there are some factors which cannot be foreseen. The scheme may, for instance, been dangered by future inflation in the Gold Coast, or by bad faith on the part ofa future Gold Coast Government. The risks inherent in Colonial Developmentcannot be avoided. We have taken every possible precaution against them, and,if after taking such precautions we are not prepared to face risks of this kind, weshould abdicate our position as a Colonial Power.7. We ask our colleagues to agree to the publication of the White Paper andthe early appointment of the Preparatory Commission.O. L.SWINTON.12th November, 1952.

VOLTA RIVER ALUMINIUM SCHEMESUMMARY OF PROPOSALS(i) This White Paper sets out a scheme under which the United KingdomGovernment, the Gold Coast Government, and the Canadian and UnitedKingdom aluminium producers would develop large scale aluminium productionin the Gold Coast. Under the scheme the resources of water power and bauxitein the Gold Coast would be developed to the mutual advantage of the twocountries and aluminium produced at an ultimate rate of 210,000 tons a year.The total capital expenditure would be about  100 million initially, risingultimately to  144 million.  It would be shared among the different parties.(ii) The successful completion of the scheme would guarantee the UnitedKingdom industry additional Sterling Area supplies of aluminium at competitiveprices to meet rapidly growing requirements for which it would be unwise to rely on other sources.(iii) The Gold Coast would be enabled to develop further its mineral wealth,and to create a new source of power of great potential benefit to its future social and economic progress.(iv) In principle Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom favourparticipation in the scheme, which would further their policy of encouraging the development of the resources of the Commonwealth as well as contributing to the raw material needs of the United Kingdom.(v) They believe the scheme to be soundly conceived but its magnitude is such that it should not be embarked upon without every practicable assurance that itcan be carried through to a successful conclusion. They, therefore, propose,with the agreement of the Gold Coast Government and the aluminium producers,that a Preparatory Commission shall be set up at once to follow up the workwhich has been done already and to examine in greater detail the chief problems which would have to be overcome. The Preparatory Commission would be under instructions to report with all practicable speed so that final decisions could be taken as soon as possible.(vi) The cost of the Preparatory Commission would ultimately be borne onthe scheme, but it will be shared between the United Kingdom and Gold CoastGovernments in the first place. A Supplementary Estimate covering the costto the Exchequer in the financial year 1952-53 will be submitted to parliament in due course.
United Kingdom Requirements of Aluminium1. In less than half a century aluminium has established itself as a majornon-ferrous metal, and, as will be seen from Appendix I, there is every reasonto expect that the demand will continue to grow rapidly. The scale of theincrease which informed opinion expects is illustrated by the recent estimateof the Materials Policy Commission appointed by the President of the UnitedStates (the &quot; Paley Commission &quot;) that the consumption of aluminium in theUnited States and the rest of the world in 1975 might be between four and five times the consumption in 1950. The Aluminium Industry Council (therepresentative body of the various sections of the United Kingdom aluminiumindustry) considers that, on a conservative estimate, United Kingdom require-ments will increase at an average rate of 5 per cent, a year over the period1950-1960, and on the assumption that this rate of increase would be maintainedover the full twenty-five years United Kingdom industry would require about three times as much aluminium by 1975 as was consumed in 1951, whenconsumption amounted to 316,000 tons (203,000 tons virgin metal, 113,000 tonssecondary metal). There is bound to be a wide margin of error in estimates of the future demand for a commodity like aluminium, but these figuresindicate the scale of the potential demand for a metal which on any reasonableview will be of growing importance in the national economy. The fabricatingindustry in the United Kingdom has already in recent years considerablyexpanded its capacity which now is about 500,000 tons a year.Need for a new Sterling Area Aluminium Smelter2. It is not too soon to be looking ahead to the sixties and seventies. Itnecessarily takes a long time to provide the hydro-electric and other capacityinvolved by a major scheme of new development. For the reasons given inAppendix I, it is impossible to rely for the full additional needs of the UnitedKingdom upon existing sources of aluminium. At present the United Kingdomobtains more than four-fifths of its virgin aluminium from dollar sources,and it is important that additional supplies should come as far as possible fromthe Sterling Area.3. With existing processes there is little, if any, scope for further developmentof aluminium production in the United Kingdom itself, and careful examinationof the possible alternatives elsewhere in the Sterling Area, in which theco-operation of Aluminium Limited of Canada and the British AluminiumCompany has been of the greatest assistance, has led to the conclusion thatthe most promising site is on the Volta River in the Gold Coast. This doesnot of course mean that it may not prove necessary to develop further capacityelsewhere in the Sterling Area or that there may not even now be scope forsmaller schemes.The Volta River Aluminium scheme. The possibilities of the Volta River as a source of hydro-electric powerhave long been recognised, but the heavy capital expenditure on the damand the public works would not be justified unless there were adequate industrialoutlets for the large quantities of power produced. With its heavy demand forpower an aluminium smelter is particularly well suited for this purpose, andfrom the point of view of aluminium production the site has several advantages in addition to its water power. Transport costs should be much smaller than is the case with most major smelters, which rely on distant sources for their chief raw material bauxite. Known reserves in the Gold Coast of bauxiteexceed 200 million tons. The proposed site for the smelter is near the coast(30-40 miles).
5. As long ago as 1924 the Gold Coast Government considered thepossibilities of aluminium production on the Volta River. Commercialinvestigations started in 1938; they were interrupted by the war but led in1945 to the formation of a company, West African Aluminium Limited, tocarry the scheme forward. In 1947 Aluminium Limited acquired extensivebauxite concessions and in 1949 secured an interest in West African AluminiumLimited. The Gold Coast Government appointed Sir William Halcrow andPartners in 1949 to investigate the potential value of the Volta River to the economy of the Gold Coast, and in August 1951 the firm submitted a favourablereport on the prospects of developing hydro-electric power for aluminiumproduction. With the encouragement of the United Kingdom Governmentthe practicability of aluminium production in the area was also examined bya Joint Mission of Aluminium Limited and the British Aluminium Company,which reported favourably on the prospects in January 1951.6. It became clear that the scale of the capital investment and the scopeof the project, involving as it did major public works as well as the hydro-electric scheme and the aluminium smelter, were such that substantialGovernment financial participation would be essential.7. Exploratory discussions accordingly took place in London in October-November 1951 and in London and Accra in May-June 1952 between repre-sentatives of the United Kingdom Government, the Gold Coast Government,Aluminium Limited and the British Aluminium Company. The purpose wasto consider the conditions under which the two Governments and the aluminiumcompanies might jointly participate in a scheme for aluminium production inthe Gold Coast. Those who took part made it clear that they could not committheir Governments and Boards.8. In these discussions, in which Sir William Halcrow and Partners andCooper Brothers and Company (the chartered accountants engaged to advise the United Kingdom Government on the scheme) also took part, agreement was reached upon the technical and economic feasibility of the project, and upon arrangements for joint participation which could be recommended to theGovernments and Boards concerned.9. The scheme as it now stands in the light of these discussions is described in detail in Appendix II which also contains the present estimates of costs,all of which are based on 1952 prices and costs. A map will be found onpage   .10. Broadly speaking the scheme falls into three parts: (a) The construction of a power station at Ajena about seventy milesfrom the mouth of the Volta River, involving the creation of a reservoirwith an area of 2,000 square miles. This would ultimately have a con-tinuous generating capacity of 564,000 KW. and would, it is provisionallyestimated, cost  54 million but the full capacity would not be installedat the outset and it is estimated that the cost of the initial stage wouldbe  45-5 million. Power should begin to become available from five to seven years nfter work begins. By far the greater part would be usedfor aluminium production but power would also be available for otherconsumers.(b) The erection of an aluminium smelter in the vicinity of Kpong, 12miles from Ajena. This would have an initial capacity of 80,000 tonsand an ultimate capacity of 210,000 tons of aluminium a year; it wouldbe hoped to attain the full capacity within at most twenty years fromopening the smelter. The bauxite deposits at Mpraeso and Yenahin would317379 A 2
be developed to supply the smelter. The cost of a plant and ancillaryworks to produce 80,000 tons a year is estimated to be  29 million. Thefull development, to 210,000 tons annual capacity, is estimated to cost 64 million. Aluminium production would begin as soon as the powerproject was in operation.(c) Extensive public works at an estimated cost of about  26 million would be required. They would include new port facilities, railway and road developments, and housing, schools, and other amenities. Of this,some  11 million would be for a new port. The Gold Coast Governmenthave decided that a new port at Tema is required in any case for thegeneral needs of the territory, and preliminary work is already in hand.The total cost would, therefore, on present estimates be of the order of 100 million for aluminium production at the initial rate of 80,000 tons a yearand  144 million at the maximum rate. As, however, is explained in Appendix IIthe risk of exceeding the estimates by a substantial margin is not one whichcan be removed from a scheme of this nature.Division of Responsibilities11. The conception behind the scheme is of a partnership in which privateenterprise would be primarily responsible for aluminium production and thetwo Governments for the hydro-electric scheme and the public works and services. The proposed division of responsibilities is set out below, but,as explained in Appendix II and in paragraph 18, there would be arrangementsfor co-ordinating progress upon the scheme as a whole.(a) The Gold Coast Government would be responsible for financingand carrying out the public works, i.e. port, railways, roads and townshipsat the dam site and port.(b) The United Kingdom Government would have the major respon-sibility for financing the power project but the Gold Coast Governmentwould contribute to the cost as far as their resources permitted. they expect to be able to provide at least  8 million. A public authority, the&quot; Volta River Authority &quot;, would be created to undertake the constructionof the dam and hydro-electric works. On completion the power under-taking would be taken over by an autonomous board, the &quot; Volta electricity board &quot;. The Authority and the Board would be responsible to the gold coast Government, but their Chairmen would be appointed jointly bythe two Governments, subject to the detailed provisions in Appendix III,where the proposed constitution and scope of these bodies is set out.The Authority and the Board would also contain a nominee of theUnited Kingdom Treasury and, at least throughout the constructionperiod, a representative of the aluminium interests.(c) The development and operation of the aluminium smelter and thebauxite mines together with the new towns at the smelter and mineswould be the responsibility of a company (the &quot; smelter company&quot;) the equity in which would be provided by the aluminium companies exceptfor a minority holding in Gold Coast hands. It is, however, proposedthat the United Kingdom Government should provide about a fifth ofthe initial capital and should be prepared, if called upon, also to provideup to half the cost of expanding the capacity from 80,000 to 120,000 tons;these contributions would be on a suitable non-equity basis. The financial arrangements in connection with the smelter company are dealt within detail in Appendix II. It is not contemplated that it would be necessaryfor the United Kingdom Government to make any contribution to theexpansion of the smelter after a capacity of 120,000 tons had been reached.
12. It is not possible to say precisely how the cost would be distributed between the different parties. This would depend not only upon the finalestimates for the scheme as a whole but upon the extent to which in practice the Gold Coast Government and the aluminium companies provided more thanthe minimum sums envisaged under the scheme in its present form. the detailed basis of the distribution of costs between the parties is given inAppendix II but the following table summarises the capital expenditure likelyto be involved for each of the parties if the United Kingdom Government hadto make the maximum contribution at present envisaged.ESTIMATES OF COSTSCapacity in tons	80,000	120,000	210,000Port, Rail, Road and other Public Works Gold Coast Government     ......

On the present provisional estimates the maximum expenditure by theUnited Kingdom Government would therefore be  56-8 million; and  43-3 million at most would have to be found by the United Kingdom Governmentto launch the scheme with the initial capacity of 80,000 tons of aluminiuma year.Proposed Terms of United Kingdom Government Investment14. The United Kingdom investment in the power project would be safe-guarded in a number of ways. It would take the form of a loan to the VoltaRiver Authority and subsequently the Volta Electricity Board -which would berepayable over eighty years. This would be secured on the assets, and therewould be a power contract for sixty years under which, in broad terms (seeparagraph 22 of Appendix II), the smelter company would undertake to payat least the Board&apos;s operating costs (including interest) plus the cost of providing517379 A 3
for renewals and amortisation. This contract would be guaranteed by the aluminium companies and the Gold Coast Government in proportion to theirrespective holdings in the equity of the smelter company until production at210,000 tons a year had been successfully maintained for five years. So longas any part of the loan was outstanding the Chairman of the Board would bejointly appointed by the two Governments. The exact terms of United KingdomGovernment capital assistance to the smelter company up to the 80,000 and120,000 ton stages have been left open for decision in the light of the circum-stances at the time, but it would not take the form of an equity investment.15. The United Kingdom would be the natural market for most of the gold coast metal, but the smelter company would be under an obligation for thirty years from initial production to offer buyers in the United Kingdom not lessthan 75 per cent, of the metal produced. The option would be in terms ensuring that in normal circumstances the price would not compare unfavourably withNorth American prices. As a result of the scheme United Kingdom consumersshould be able to count on at least 60,000 tons a year of additional sterling area aluminium in the early days of the smelter on present expectations by1960 or soon after and on a minimum of 157,500 tons a year when the full capacity of 210,000 tons is being worked.Position of the Gold Coast Government and the aluminium companies16. The scheme prepared in the London and Accra discussions has beenconsidered by the Gold Coast Government and by the Boards of the twoaluminium companies. The Gold Coast Government favour it in principle and are in agreement with the financial and other details as at present envisaged.The Board of Aluminium Limited have signified their general agreement tothe scheme. The Board of the British Aluminium Company are also in generalagreement, subject to their ability at the time to make suitable arrangements to finance their participation.Views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom17. Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are favourable inprinciple to participation in the scheme, which would further their policyof encouraging the development of the resources of the Commonwealth as wellas contributing to the raw material needs of the United Kingdom. they believe that it is soundly conceived and that its successful completion would bring substantial benefits to the two countries and would justify the heavy capital investment on the part of the United Kingdom Exchequer.18. All the parties are, however, conscious of the difficulties which are inherent in a scheme of this magnitude undertaken under tropical conditionsin a territory whose economy is developing rapidly in other directions. It isin particular important to make sure that the large labour force for the powerproject can be recruited, fed, housed and maintained, that the port, rail and road developments are carried out according to programme, that waste andextravagance are avoided, and that the scheme once launched is not dislocatedbecause of other claims upon resources. One of the chief tasks of the VoltaRiver Authority would be to synchronise work upon the different aspectsof the scheme and to secure the necessary priorities so that it might be completedwith maximum efficiency and in accordance with an agreed time-table. TheGold Coast Government have stated that they would be ready, whenever theoccasion arose, to defer or rephase other parts of their development programme which seemed likely to conflict with the scheme in the demands on the resources available of men, transport and materials.
19. Careful preliminary examination has shown no reason for thinking thatthe difficulties are insuperable, but in the discussions at Accra in June 1952it was agreed that there was a good deal more preparatory work to be done before the parties could be expected to commit themselves finally. As recom-mended in the Accra discussions, Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom and the Gold Coast Government propose, therefore, to establish a Preparatory Commission with the following duties:  .(i) In conjunction with the Gold Coast Government to determine the phasing of the project with other Gold Coast Government development projects in the light of the available resources of the Gold Coast economy,including the adequacy of the Government services.(ii) To take part in the determination of the constitution and powers ofthe Volta River Authority.(iii) To continue the development of the necessary preparatory work with the assistance of such staff as the aluminium companies can make available.(iv) To take part in the preparation of a Master Agreement.(Further details of the proposed Preparatory Commission are given inAppendix IV.)20. The Preparatory Commission will be appointed as soon as possible and will be instructed to proceed with its work with all practicable speed.It will be appointed by the Gold Coast Government, but the SpecialCommissioner will be chosen with the concurrence of the United KingdomGovernment. The full cost of the Commission will be borne by the Volta RiverAuthority if it is decided to proceed with the scheme, but Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have agreed meanwhile to share the cost with the Gold coast government. A Supplementary Estimate for the financial year 1952-53will be presented in due course. It is difficult to forecast the total cost of theCommission or how long it will take to finish its work, but it is not expectedto cost more than  400,000, of which  200,000 would fall on the UnitedKingdom Exchequer. Arrangements will be made jointly with the Gold coast government for the proper control of this expenditure.21. If in the light of the Preparatory Commission^ work it is decided toproceed with the scheme, a further report will be made to Parliament, and legislation will be proposed to obtain the necessary financial powers.
APPENDIXUNITED KINGDOM REQUIREMENTS OF ALUMINIUMWorld Requirements and production. The problem of extracting aluminium from its ores on a commercial scale wasnot solved until 1886. At first its development as an industrial metal was slow, butthe turning point in its history came with the first world war. Since then and moreparticularly during and since the second world war the consumption of aluminiumhas been growing rapidly and it has become one of the three or four metals in the widest use.2. The growth of world production is shown in the following table:TABLE a production(&apos;000 Long Tons)Year	U.S.A. &amp;	Europe (excl. UK.)

They are derived from a variety of sources, but, wh le, therefore, notstatistically precise, provide a reliable basis for tracing the development of production.3. There have been temporary setbacks, but it will be seen that the growth in production over the period as a whole has been spectacular. It is in particularnoteworthy that, while there was a substantial fall in output after the war, productionnearly reached the 1943 peak figure again by 1951 and may exceed it in 1952.This is in part attributable to rearmament, but it is mainly due to the developmentof new uses for aluminium and its use in substitution for other metals. An importantcontributory factor has been the relatively small increase in the price of aluminiumas compared with that of other metals. The price of aluminium in the United kingdom in 1939 was  94 a ton; it is now (October, 1952)  166 a ton. The United States priceof 20 cents a lb. is the same as in 1939. The rise in the United Kingdom price is due in large part to the depreciation of sterling in relation to the dollar.

Since the warthe proportion of secondary to virgin aluminium has been abnormally high because of liquidation-tion of Government stocks of secondary metal recovered mainly from crashed and obsoleteaircraft during and after the war. These stocks have now been exhausted and the industry will in future obtain secondary metal only from the normal recovery of scrap. The demandfor virgin aluminium will be correspondingly greater.5. It will be seen that whereas in the late twenties and early thirties the average annual consumption only slightly exceeded 20,000 tons, in 1946 consumption exceeded200,000 tons and had grown to 316,000 tons in 1951. Part of the recent increase is accounted for by rearmament, but on the other hand deliveries to fabricators havebeen subject to an allocation system, and with the co-operation of the industryarrangements have been in force since 1950 for the restriction of the less essential enduses. Broadly speaking the increase in the defence demand as a result of. rearmamentis thought to have been offset by the restrictions on the demand for other purposes.U.K. fabricating capacity6. Aluminium fabricating capacity in the United Kingdom is already in the region of 500,000 tons a year, and 100,000 tons of this capacity has been created in thepast three years. These figures disregard the capacity of fabricating plants held in reserve for emergency purposes.
Imports7. In 1951 United Kingdom imports of virgin aluminium totalled 176,000 tons.Of these Canada supplied about 172,000 tons or over 95 per cent at a cost in dollarsof over  18 million. Imports from Canada will be about 230,000 tons in 1952. UnitedKingdom home production is about 30,000 tons a year.Future Demand8. There is every reason to expect that the demand for aluminium will continueto increase rapidly throughout the world. There may be setbacks but these should only be temporary interruptions to the upward trend.9. This view, which is shared by the aluminium producers and the fabricatorsin the main industrial countries, is based upon the enormous possibilities for the extended use of aluminium in engineering, shipbuilding, aircraft, transport, the electrical industry, building and other fields in which it is already accepted. the trend would be assisted by the continuance of the post-war price relationship betweenaluminium and other metals.10. The prospective demand for aluminium in the United States and the free world was recently examined by the Presidents Materials Policy Commission(&quot; Paley Commission &quot;). The Commission summed up its conclusions in its reportpublished in June, 1952, entitled &quot; Resources for Freedom &quot; (Volume II, pages 123and 134) as follows:United States&quot; aluminium has not yet found its &apos; normal&apos; relative place in the materialsdemand of the American economy. In almost all its uses it is in the processof winning markets away from competing materials, as already cited in thediscussions of the other non-ferrous metals. But markets gained from thenon-ferrous metals are unlikely to be quantitatively the most important causes of aluminium&apos;s future expansion, for substitutions even far in excess of thoseanticipated could be effected by less than a million tons of aluminium. Theymay of course, be highly valuable substitutions because of the specialized usesserved by the non-ferrous metals. In contrast, the possibilities of substitutingaluminum for steel and wood are almost unlimited. aluminium window framesand furniture, and aluminium in construction would by themselves account for a four- or five-fold expansion of United States aluminium demand fromits present level of 983,000 short tons. This fact frustrates any attempt atprecision in the estimate of aluminium demand. If there were no substitutionsat all in favour of aluminium, its demand would probably expand by 1975 to2 or 2i times its 1950 level.The projected substitutions of aluminium for other non-ferrous metals would add another 500,000 tons. To the resulting figure of 2\ to 3 million tons mustbe added an arbitrary allowance for the probable amount of aluminium that willsubstitute for steel and wood.We have chosen to project the 1975 United States demand for aluminumat 4-5 million (between 4 and 5 times the 1950 consumption) as indicating aplausible rate of growth. A figure much less than this would imply almostno incursions of aluminium into fields now held by other materials. A figuremuch greater, say 10 times the 1950 output, would be possible if aluminumwere assumed to take over more than a small part of the functions now performed by wood and steel. The policy implications of a ten-fold increase should thereforebe considered.The scrap ratio of aluminium has averaged less than 10 per cent in the UnitedStates in recent years. Since the projected rate of growth is considerably slower than that of the past, this ratio is expected to increase in the future. In Europe,where the growth of aluminium consumption from 1935-38 to 1948-49 was at about the rate projected for the United States, recent scrap ratios have beenaround 30 per cent, but these ratios were influenced by the presence of warscrap on the European market. An intermediate figure of around 20 per centis not implausible for the United States in 1975. This would make the projectedUnited States demand for new aluminium around 3-6 million tons, an increaseof about 300 per cent over the 1950 consumption of 920,000 short tons of newmetal.&quot;
Other Free Nations&quot;The rest of the free world consumed, in 1950, about 465,000 short tonsof new aluminium. The same forces expected to bring about the rapid expansionof United States aluminium consumption will also operate in the other freecountries. The prospective growth will certainly be large, but there is no sound basis for the choice of any particular figure. Abroad, as in the United States,aluminium is still growing into its place in the consumption pattern.Available data on scrap consumption in Europe reveal an abnormally highscrap ratio in 1950. Accordingly, foreign demand for new aluminium is expectedto rise at a rate somewhat faster than that expected for total consumption,that is, new aluminium plus scrap. The new aluminium demand of the rest ofthe free world is therefore projected to increase from its present level to about-4 million tons in 1975, a figure that represents a fivefold increase in total demand and a scrap ratio stabilized at the 20 per cent level projected for theUnited States.&quot;11. The future demand for aluminium in the United Kingdom is likely tobe governed by the same basic factors as in the United States and elsewhere,and growing world requirements will be reflected in the demand for UnitedKingdom exports of aluminium products. The Paley Commission were aware of the difficulties in projecting demand over a twenty-five year period, andtheir estimate was intended only as a broad indication of what might happen on certain hypotheses. Applied&apos; to the United Kingdom, their estimate for the rest ofthe free world would give total United Kingdom consumption at about 1 -3 million tons in 1975, of which 1 million tons would need to be met from virgin metal. Onthe alternative assumption which the Aluminium Industry Council regards asconservative, that the average annual rate of increase is 5 per cent., and taking 1950total consumption of 268,000 tons as the starting point (though consumption in1951 increased considerably above this) demand would exceed 430,000 tons in totalby 1960 and would be about 900,000 tons a year by 1975. Discounting these totalsby 20 per cent, for scrap the virgin metal requirements would be 340,000 tons in 1960and 720,000 tons in 1975.Future Supply Prospects12. There is no danger that the expansion of aluminium production will be restrictedbecause of shortage of bauxite. Known reserves of bauxite of good quality in countries of the free world are estimated to be of the order of 1,500 million tons (350 million tons metal content) and they are widely distributed. Nor is there any reason to thinkthat shortages of other raw materials will be a handicap to expansion.13. The chief difficulty is the heavy demand on electric power which the extractionprocesses make. Unless cheap power is already available in large quantities, any major new development of aluminium producing capacity involves at the same timethe large-scale development of power normally, as things are, hydro-electric power.This means in practice that large-scale expansion of aluminium production under present processes can only take place in connection with major power developments.14. About 30,000 tons of aluminium a year is produced by the British AluminiumCompany who use hydro-electricity from the Scottish Highlands. During the warnew capacity was set up in South Wales but the plants were uneconomic and have since been dismantled. Unless new processes are developed which reduce thedemand for electric power or enable coal to be used economically for aluminiumproduction it seems most unlikely, in view of the lack of potential hydro-electric power in the United Kingdom and the many claims upon the available power, that further large-scale production in the United Kingdom itself will be economic. Interestingpossibilities of new processes are under scientific investigation in this country and elsewhere, but it will be a long time before commercial development is a practical proposition.15. The United Kingdom will, therefore, have to import the additional metalit will require. Imports at least at the prssent rates are assured by the long-termarrangements with the aluminium Company of Canada.   Under these arrangements
the United Kingdom Government have, during and since the last war, lent or agreedto lend a total of Canadian $120 million in order to assist the company to expandits capacity. In return for these loans the United Kingdom Government secured a contract for the supply of 250,000 tons of virgin aluminium in each of the years1952 to 1955 and an option to take 250,000 tons a year thereafter until 1970. Thisoption has since been increased by 25,000 tons in each of the years 1957 to 1960.16. For import requirements above the current level it will be necessary to dependon the export surpluses of producing countries. Many countries are planningrelatively small increases in their aluminium-producing capacity to meet their own needs but while this will help to reduce their need to import virgin aluminiumit would be unsafe to assume that countries which are producing primarily in theinterests of their own fabricators will have virgin metal to export.17. The only large scale developments which are in prospect at present are inCanada and the United States. Since the war the aluminium Company of Canadahas increased its installed smelter capacity in the Province of Quebec from 450,000 tons to 500,000 tons a year. The company&apos;s Kitimat project in British Columbia willhave an initial capacity of 83,000 tons with operation starting in 1954, and a potentialcapacity of 500,000 tons a year. In the United States the present expansion programme will double the 1950 capacity of about 700,000 tons and capacity will exceed 1 -4 million tons when it is completed in 1954.18. If United States requirements increase as rapidly as the Paley Commissionenvisaged, capacity in the United States may wel- do no more than keep pace withthem. Even if it were wise to count on an export surplus from the United Statesbeing available to the United Kingdom in competition with other importing countries,additional dollar expenditure would be involved. The possibilities of further expansionof aluminium production in Canada have by no means been exhausted, but to meetthe additional requirements of the United Kingdom from Canada would similarlyadd very substantially to the dollar expenditure.19. In all these circumstances there is a strong case for developing new aluminiumproduction in the Sterling Area. The possibilities have been carefully examinedsince the war with the co-operation and advice of the British Aluminium company and Aluminium Limited. It was decided that the choice of a site probably lay betweenthe Gold Coast and North Borneo, and with the encouragement of the UnitedKingdom Government the two companies sent a Joint Mission to the two territories to report on the possibilities. The Joint Mission reported in January 1951 that whileboth sites were suitable for the development of aluminium production, the gold coast was preferable since bauxite was available in the territory and a larger production capacity could be attained from the greater potential hydro-electric power available.APPENDIX IITHE VOLTA RIVER ALUMINIUM scheme the Volta River1. The Volta River, the principal river of the Gold Coast, has a total length ofsome 1,000 miles from the head waters of the Black Volta to the sea. The drainagearea of the river system is approximately 150,000 square miles, of which 61,500 square miles (roughly 40 per cent.) lies within Gold Coast territory including the trust territory of Togoland, and 88,500 square miles lies outside the Gold Coast in french territory. The Black Volta rises in the French Ivory Coast and flows north-eastand then south to form the western boundary of the Gold Coast northern territories, and thence east to join the White Volta some 300 miles from the sea.Below this confluence there are two main tributaries, the Oti and the Afram. the map on page shows the general geography and the places mentioned subsequentlyin connection v/ith the scheme.
2. About 75 miles from its mouth at Ada the Volta passes through a low coastalrange, the Akwapim Hills, the country up river being flat. The gorge through the hills provides a possible site for a high dam which would pond the water up the Voltaand Afram to form a great lake. The only other site apparently suitable for a damon the river system is at Bui on the Black Volta 145 miles up stream from its confluencewith the White Volta; this site would provide much less power.History of the Scheme3. The possibility of developing hydro-electric power from the Voita has beenconsidered at various times during the last few decades. In 1924 the Gold coast government drew up and considered proposals for the construction of a dam atAjena in the- Akwapim Hills for generating power for the production of aluminium,and in 1938 Mr. Duncan Rose started a detailed survey and obtained certain conces-sions. The war interrupted this survey in 1939 but in 1945 a company West AfricanAluminium Limited was formed, with Mr. Rose as Chairman, to carry the schemeforward.   In 1949 Aluminium Limited of Canada acquired an interest in this company.In 1950 a joint mission of Aluminium Limited and the British Aluminium Companymade a further detailed study of the scheme prepared by West African AluminiumLimited and reported in January, 1951, that it was a sound engineering propositionand could produce aluminium at an economic cost.4. Meanwhile the Gold Coast Government had decided that the development of theVolta River Basin should be viewed as a whole and that a comprehensive investigation and report should be obtained before any further rights to develop the power under-taking were granted. Accordingly in October, 1949, they engaged Sir WilliamHalcrow and Partners to undertake a survey of all aspects of the Volta River develop-ment. The terms of reference covered hydro-electric power at Ajena and/or Bui,irrigation and drainage of lands in or near the catchment of the River Volta, navigationon the river, transport and port facilities.5. After a preliminary report dated 25th July, 1950, Sir William Halcrow andPartners submitted a final report on 15th August, 1951, which set out a scheme forthe development of the Volta Basin. So far as it related to aluminium productionthis report formed the basis for the subsequent discussions between representativesof the United Kingdom and the Gold Coast Governments, of Aluminium Limited,and of the British Aluminium Company which took place in October and November.1951 and in May, 1952, in London and in June, 1952, in Accra. The purpose ofthese discussions was to consider the conditions under which the two governments and the aluminium companies might jointly participate in a scheme for aluminiumproduction in the Gold Coast. Sir William Halcrow and Partners and CooperBrothers and Company, the chartered accountants engaged by the United KingdomGovernment as advisers on the financial aspects of the scheme, were represented.The discussions were exploratory in character. The representatives of the twoGovernments explained that they could not commit their Governments, and therepresentatives of the two aluminium companies that they could not commit theirBoards.   The following scheme resulted from these discussions.The scheme. The scheme now proposed envisages the construction of a dam and power station at Ajena in the gorge through the Akwapim Hills. This would raise thewater level to a maximum height of 260 feet above sea level and would create a lakewith an area of some 2,000 square miles as shown on the map. The geologists ofthe Gold Coast Government have agreed that the dam and reservoir proposed aregeologically sound. The exact extent of the reservoir will not be known until a detailed survey has been completed but it is known, that the water can be safely raised to this level. From records of the river flow which are available over a twenty year period it is estimated that the discharge could be regulated to give a continuous rateof 35,700 cubic feet of water per second. The draw down from the maximum level would be limited to 25 feet. By cutting through the, Senchi and Kpong rapids belowthe dam to lower the tail water level it is calculated that an output of 564,000 K.W. offirm electric power could be developed.
7. It has always been realised that any major development of the Volta Basinwould only be economic if an adequate demand could be found for the availablepower. Existing and estimated future demands for electric power in the Gold Coastare insufficient to justify the hydro-electric power without a heavy power consumerlike aluminium production as the main outlet. It is intended to set up an aluminiumsmelter in the vicinity of Kpong, some 12 miles from the dam site. After allowing50,000 K.W. for other users in the Gold Coast, the power available from the hydro-electric installation would be enough to produce 210,000 tons of aluminium a year.The smelter would draw its major raw material, bauxite, from reserves within theGold Coast. Deposits of bauxite at Mpraeso and Yenahin, which would be workedto supply the smelter, are estimated to exceed 200 million tons, sufficient for about200 years production at the maximum output of the smelter.Public Works8. The establishment of an aluminium industry of this size would necessitate theconstruction of a new port conveniently situated to serve its needs. Takoradi isthe only major port in the Gold Coast. Accra, next in size, has already reached thelimit of its capacity and is unsuitable for further development as a port. WhileTakoradi has recently been extended, it is already evident that a new major port is urgently required to meet the general needs of the expanding Gold Coast economy.Sir William Halcrow and Partners recommended that a new port to serve both thegeneral and the aluminium needs should be constructed at Tema about 20 miles east of Accra. The Gold Coast Government, after obtaining a second opinion, havedecided to proceed with the construction of a new port at Tema whether or not thescheme as a whole is undertaken; preliminary work is now in hand.9. In addition there would need to be a considerable development of communica-tions. Existing roads would need improvement and new main roads would have tobe built. It is expected, however, that the main burden of new traffic would fall onthe railways. The new port at Tema would have to be linked by rail to both Accraand the smelter at Kpong. The bauxite would also be moved by rail, and new linesfrom Yenahin to Kumasi and from Koforidua to Kpong would be required.10. The Gold Coast Government would be responsible for financing these publicworks and the townships which would come into being at the port and the dam site.The work would be carried out by the appropriate Gold Coast organisations, e.g., theGold Coast Railways Department, the Tema Development Corporation and thePublic Works Department.The Smelter and Mines11. The aluminium smelter and bauxite mines would be managed by privateenterprise, the aluminium companies and the Gold Coast Government sharing inthe provision of the equity capital. The smelter company would be responsiblefor the construction and operation of the smelter and the development and operationof the mines. The smelter company would also be responsible for constructingthe townships at the smelter and mines. The land required for the smelter wouldbe acquired by the Gold Coast Government and would be leased to the smeltercompany for a period of 80 years plus a period of not more than three years for theconstruction of the smelter.Production Programme12. It would be the intention of the aluminium companies to proceed to a smeltercapacity of 210,000 tons a year as rapidly as conditions permit. Their willingness,to participate is based on the conviction that the scheme would be capable of rapid expansion. In the first place, however, a capacity of 80,000 tons a year would beinstalled. The aluminium companies would be prepared at the request of the twoGovernments to commit themselves to expand the capacity to 120,000 tons a yearwithin a period of seven years from the date when power first became available unlessthe two Governments subsequently agreed to extend the period. The aluminiumcompanies would further be prepared at intervals of three years to consult withthe two Governments on ways and means of attaining the maximum capacity of210,000 tons.   If a capacity of 210,000 tons had not been reached within twenty
years from initial production, they would undertake to examine the position withthe two Governments. Failing agreement as to the feasibility of further expansionthe power not required for the existing and immediately projected capacity of thesmelter could be released to other users. In the event of others contracting for power for the production of aluminium the smelter company would make available to suchproducers the required quantities of bauxite on reasonable terms (to be settled by arbitration in default of agreement).13. The aluminium companies would undertake that as far as possible any technicaldiscoveries made or acquired by them or by their associated companies would bemade available to the Gold Coast smelter company on terms as favourable as those on which they were made available to any other associated company.Financing the Smelter Company14. The Gold Coast Government, Aluminium Limited and the British AluminiumCompany would provide the equity capital of the smelter company, AluminiumLimited contributing the major part. The Gold Coast Government, as trustees of Gold Coast nationals, would have the right to provide 10 per cent, of the equity capital as it was issued from time to time. After the smelter company had beenin production twenty-five years and upon the request of the Gold Coast Government,the smelter company would in addition undertake to offer for sale at a reasonable price to private Gold Coast nationals equity stock (either new stock or stock then in the hands of the aluminium companies) in an amount equal to the amount of equity stock previously transferred to private Gold Coast investors from the gold coast Governments original holdings. The aluminium companies attach importanceto private enterprise and are anxious that Gold Coast nationals should participate in the equity of the smelter, but realise that for some time it is unlikely that privateGold Coast funds will be available.15. All the capital attributable to the first 40,000 tons of annual capacity (includingworking capital) would be raised by the holders of the equity of the smelter company.One half of the capital attributable to the development of capacity from 40,000to 80,000 tons would be raised by the equity holders, and the other half would beprovided by the United Kingdom Government after the company&apos;s share hadbeen raised. The exact form of the United Kingdom Government capital assistanceto the smelter company has been left open for decision at the time but this capitalassistance would not take the form of an equity investment. Of the capital tobe raised by Aluminium Limited, not less than one half would be provided from canada, and Aluminium Limited would be entitled to raise the balance by the saleof Aluminium Limited equity securities in the Sterling market except to the extenthat a debenture issue on the Sterling market might be made in lieu.16. Up to half of the capital required for the expansion of the capacity of thesmelter from 80,000 to 120,000 tons a year would be provided by the United KingdomGovernment on a suitable non-equity basis if the equity interests in the smeltercompany so wished at the time. It is not contemplated that it would be necessaryfor the United Kingdom Government to make any contribution to the capitalrequired to expand the smelter capacity after 120,000 tons a year had been reached.Financing the Power Undertaking17. The United Kingdom and Gold Coast Governments would be jointly responsiblefor financing the hydro-electric power undertaking as a whole; the Gold coast government would be solely responsible for facilities for the distribution of powerto other users besides the smelter. The undertaking would be organised as a publicutility and the finance would be provided by loans fully secured on the assets. the loans, which would bear interest, would be amortised over a period of eighty years.The Gold Coast Government expect to provide at least  8 million towards the powerproject proper.18. It is proposed that a Volta River Authority and a Volta Electricity board should be set up by the Gold Coast Government. The responsibilities of these twobodies are described in greater detail in Appendix III. The Volta River authority would be responsible for the building of the dam and power station.  On completion
of the construction work the Volta Electricity Board would assume responsibilityfor the management of the power undertaking and also for the installation ofadditional generating units, transmission lines and extensions to the original works.19. Certain capita! and other expenditure would arise as a result of the creation ofthe reservoir on matters such as the resettlement of population, clearing and drainingmarginal lands, clearing navigational channels necessary for maintaining existingcommunications, and various compensation claims, together with the administrative costs involved. This expenditure would be a charge in the first instance on the powerscheme up to a limit of  3 million. Any expenditure on these items over this sum upto a maximum of  1 million would be shared equally between the Gold coast government and the Volta River Authority. The maximum aggregate charge on thepower project would be  3  million.21. The interest rate at which loans to the Volta River Authority for the powerproject would be made has an important bearing on the ultimate cost of power tothe smelter, and the aluminium companies have asked that the interest rate shouldbe determined before final commitments to proceed were taken. Two bases for theinterest charges have been considered. The charge might reflect changes in themoney market; as each instalment of the loan was advanced the rate for thatinstalment could be determined in the light of market conditions at the time.Alternatively a fixed rate for all the borrowings might be settled at the time Whenthe decision was made to proceed with the scheme; the Government or governments would then take the risks of any rise and receive the benefit of any fall in interest rates. The aluminium companies would be given the option of deciding whichmethod they preferred at the time commitments were undertaken. They have,however, also pointed out that they would be reluctant to see the project financedentirely by long-term borrowing at a time when interest rates were high, therebypreventing later conversion to a more favourable basis.The Power Contract22. The supply of power for the smelter would be governed by a contract underwhich the Volta Electricity Board would undertake to make power available to thesmelter up to an amount necessary for the production of aluminium at the rate of210,000 tons a year for sixty years from the date at which power was first available.The contract would recognise that other users in the Gold Coast would require up to50,000 K.W. of the power which would be available. The Gold Coast Government,Aluminium Limited and the British Aluminium Company would share, in the ratio of their respective holdings in the equity of the smelter company, an obligation tosecure that the Volta Electricity Board would receive payments amounting each yearto its out of pocket or operating costs (including interest) in respect of the power con-tracted for by, and made available to, the smelter company, plus the calculated amountneeded in the year to cover (a) the appropriate contributions to a renewals fund and(b) amortisation of the capital expenditure over 80 years. Provision would be madefor the extension of the amortisation period by agreement if there were unavoidabledelays in construction. In the initial stages these payments would be abated by theamount of sales to consumers other than the smelter company. The charges forpower so sold would be detailed in the power contract. At the time a smelter capacityof 120,000 tons a year was attained the Gold Coast Government would declare whatquantity of power (over that needed for an annual output of 210,000 tons of aluminium)it wished to reserve for public consumption and would from then on relieve the smeltercompany of the appropriate proportion of the cost of power production. Powernot so reserved by the Gold Coast Government would be available during the currency of the power contract to the company. The guarantee of the power contract by the participants in the equity of the smelter company would remain in force until thesmelter company had installed capacity for production of 210,000 tons of aluminiuma year and had profitably produced at substantially that rate for five years.Estimates of Cost23. It is at present estimated that the cost of public works to be undertaken bythe Gold Coast Government including port, roads, rail and townships would be 26,000,000, of which the port of Tema is estimated to cost  11,000,000.
The smelter company would require  29,000,000 to develop the bauxite mines,build towns at the mines and smelter, and construct and operate the smelter at anannual capacity of 80,000 tons. At capacities of 120,000 tons and 210,000 tons a year the corresponding figures would be  39,000,000 and  64,000,000 respectively. the table below shows how the cost would probably be divided among the different parties.The estimated cost of the power project, revised by Sir William Halcrow andPartners in June, 1952 to take into account rises in wages and salaries in the gold coast, is  41,500,000 for 80,000 tons smelter capacity; for 120,C00 tons  45,500,000;and for full development  49,500,000. There is margin of error of 15 per cent, up ordown on certain items of cost in civil engineering estimates of this kind, and formaximum safety 15 per cent, has therefore been added to these items in order toshow the estimated maximum cost. The estimated costs for the various stages ofthe power project then become for 80,000 tons  45,500,000; for 120,000 tons 49,500,000; and for full development  54,000,000, and these figures have been usedin the table below to show the estimated maximum cost to the United KingdomGovernment.ESTIMATES OF COSTCapacity in tons	80,000	120,000	210,000Port, Rail, Road and other Public Works Gold Coast Government     ......	  26,000,000	26,000,000	  26,000,000The Power Project United Kingdom Government Gold Coast Government     ...... t	37,500,000 8,000,000	41,500,000 8,000,000	46,000,000 8,000,000 	45,500,000	49,500,000	54,000,000The Aluminium Smelter United Kingdom Government Gold Coast Government and nationals Aluminium Companies       ......	5,800,000 2,300,000 20,900,000	10,800,000 2,800,000 25,400,000	10,800,000 5,300,000/10,600,000 47,900,000/42,600,000 	29,000,000	39,000,000	64,000,000Total      ......... 	100,500,000	114,500,000	144,000,000To be borne by:  United Kingdom Government Gold Coast Government and nationals Aluminium Companies       ......	43,300,000 36,300,000 20,900,000	52,300,000 36,800,000 25,400,000	56,800,000 39,300,000/44,600,000 47,900,000/42,600,000Total      ......... 	100,500,000	114,500,000	144,000,00024. These estimates are as firm as can be expected at a stage when detailed billsof quantities and contract drawings have still to be drawn up and competitive tendersobtained. They are not likely to be substantially different from any others whichbecome available before work on the scheme is actually put in hand, provided there isno general increase in the level of costs. It must be recognised, however, that the riskof exceeding the estimates even by a substantial margin is not one which can beremoved from a scheme of this kind.
Labour25. In the view of the Gold Coast Government there would be adequate reserves of manpower, not only for existing undertakings and the production of subsistenceand cash crops but also for the construction work entailed by the Volta project anddevelopments in other parts of the country. The Gold Coast Government are confident that with appropriate wages and conditions, adequate housing, feeding and medical arrangements, there would be no undue difficulty in attracting, recruiting and retaining the required labour force; and that arrangements could be made tothis end without dislocating prevailing wage levels.Timetable26. An agreed timetable would be drawn up and incorporated in a Master agreement in which the rights and obligations of the parties would be set out. The Gold coast government have stated that they would be ready, whenever occasion arose, to deferor rephase other parts of their development programme which seemed likely toconflict with the Volta River Aluminium Scheme in demands on the resources available.The Chairman of the Volta River Authority would have direct access to the PrimeMinister of the Gold Coast on such questions.Supplies of Aluminium to the United Kingdom27. In return for the United Kingdom Government investment in the scheme thesmelter company would be under an obligation for thirty years from initial production to offer to buyers in the United Kingdom at least 75 per cent, of the production at prices f.o.b. Gold Coast port not exceeding the Sterling equivalent of either the lowestNorth American domestic price (for ingot or pig) f.o.b. refinery or the Canadiandomestic price (for ingot or pig) f.o.b. refinery, at the choice of the aluminiumcompanies to be exercised before final commitments are accepted.28. This should cover all normal contingencies, but it is recognised that there might be exceptional circumstances in which the smelter company could not produceeconomically for sale at the ceiling price. The smelter company would have the rigTrtto ask for a revision of the price ceiling when in its opinion production for sale at the ceiling price would, as a result of factors beyond its control other than ordinary commercial risks, reduce its profits to an unreasonably low level. Causes beyondthe company&apos;s control might in this context include, for example, general increases in costs in the Sterling Area or the Gold Coast not offset by variations in exchange rates, and variations in exchange rates not offset by variations in costs. The UnitedKingdom Government and the smelter company would settle by agreement whetherand if so by what amount the ceiling price should be increased. Failing agreementwithin three months the question would at the request of either party be referred for settlement by arbitration in the light of all the relevant circumstances includingthe fact that the smelter company would be entitled to expect a reasonable profit.The revised ceiling price would apply for one year but the smelter company would be free to apply for revision of the ceiling price for the next year (and thereafter for any subsequent year), and any such application would also be dealt with by agreementor by arbitration. Pending settlement of a revised ceiling price the normal ceilingwould apply (a) unless the ceiling price had previously been revised for a period not then completed or (b) until the smelter company&apos;s application for revision had beenoutstanding for six months. In the latter event, no ceiling price would apply untilsettlement had been reached.
APPENDIX HITHE VOLTA RIVER AUTHORITY AND THE VOLTAELECTRICITY BOARD1. As part of the initial agreements the Gold Coast Government would undertaketo create a Volta River Authority and a Volta Electricity Board. In broad terms,the functions of these bodies would be as follows.Volta River Authority2. The Volta River Authority would be responsible for the co-ordination of allplanning and construction work arising out of the Volta River Scheme, includingthe building of:(i) the dam and power station, sub-stations and transmission lines;(ii) the aluminium smelter and alumina works;(iii) port and railway facilities;(iv) roads;(v) townships.In the performance of this co-ordinating work the Authority would consult thevarious Gold Coast Government Departments concerned Agriculture, Surveys,Health, etc. as well as the companies and others with a direct responsibility for thecompletion of the construction work. The objective would be to ensure the properintegration and smooth phasing of the various developments during the eight years or so likely to be required for the construction work on the power scheme and on the aluminium scheme in its initial stages.In so far as the Authority considered that such proper integration and smoothphasing was being jeopardised by competing demands for material, labour and servicesarising out of the development plans of the Gold Coast Government, the authority would be entitled to call upon the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast for assistance.3. The prime responsibility for these works would rest with the bodies financiallyresponsible e.g., the smelter company for the bauxite mines, the alumina works andaluminium smelter; the Gold Coast Railways Department for railway facilities; theTema Development Corporation for the town and port of Tema; the Gold CoastPublic Works Department for main roads; and the smelter company for townshipsat the smelter and bauxite mines and for service roads in their vicinity. In additionto its responsibility for co-ordinating the phasing of these various works, however,the Volta River Authority would also have prime responsibility for the building ofthe dam and power station and for certain ancillary work. It would thus, inter alia,place the contracts for the construction work at the dam and for the power plant andequipment and make arrangements for labour camps at the dam site and for other services there, including permanent housing to the extent it then appeared necessary,water, lighting, drainage, etc. It would also undertake the clearing of marginallands on the lake side, navigation channels and drainage cuts.4. The Authority would be responsible for the proper control of funds made available by the United Kingdom Government and the Gold Coast Government for the con-struction work. These funds, save to the extent that they were expressly chargeableagainst the revenues of the Gold Coast Government, would be in the form of loanssecured on the assets. The proceeds of the sale of power would be hypothecatedfor the service and amortisation of the loans.5. Until such time as the Volta Electricity Board was set up the Volta RiverAuthority would also be responsible for the preparation and signature of contracts for the supply of power and for any other agreements relating thereto. Such contracts and agreements would be assignable by the Authority to the Volta Electricity Board.
3i\Volta&apos;EIectricity Board6. The Volta Electricity Board would take over from the Volta River Authority allresponsibility (including the responsibility for financial control referred to in paragraph4 above) in respect of the dam and power undertaking when the construction work had been completed and power had first become available. It would also thereafter be responsible not only for the maintenance and repair of the plant but also for the procurement and installation of additional generating units, transmission lines andany other extensions to the original work. It would take the place of the VoltaRiver Authority in any power contracts and other agreements entered into by theAuthority and be responsible for entering into any new commitments for the saleof power.Constitution of the Authority and the Board7. Both bodies would be established by Gold Coast legislation. The Volta RiverAuthority would take over such commitments, records, etc., as might seem appropriatefrom the Preparatory Commission. It would also offer continued employment tosuch of the staff of the Preparatory Commission as it required.8. The appointment of Chairman of the Volta River Authority would be made bythe Gold Coast Government with the concurrence of the United Kingdom Govern-ment. Consideration would also have to be given to the appointment of a whole-timeDeputy Chairman or Chairmen in view of the magnitude of the responsibilities to beundertaken by the Authority. Their appointment would likewise be by the gold coast Government with the concurrence of the United Kingdom Government.9. The Chairman of the Volta Electricity Board would be a whole-time officerappointed by the Gold Coast Government. The appointment would be made withthe concurrence of the United Kingdom Government so long as substantial loansby the United Kingdom Government in respect of the power project were outstanding.The Board, as well as the Volta River Authority, would contain representatives ofthe Gold Coast Government and prominent persons in the territory, a nominee ofthe United Kingdom Treasury and, at least throughout the construction period, arepresentative of the aluminium interests.APPENDIX IVVOLTA RIVER PREPARATORY COMMISSIONTerms of reference . At the discussions between the United Kingdom Government and the Gold coast government and the two aluminium companies which were held in Accra in June1952, it was agreed that the next step to carry the project further should be toestablish a Preparatory Commission with which the aluminium interests would be associated.   The duties of the Preparatory Commission would be as follows: (i) In conjunction with the Gold Coast Government, to determine the phasing of the project with other Gold Coast Government development projects in thelight of the available resources of the Gold Coast economy, including the adequacy of the Government services.(ii) To take part in the determination of the constitution and powers of theVoJta River Authority.(iii) To continue the development of the necessary preparatory work withthe assistance of such staff as the aluminium companies could make available, andto employ such consultants as might be necessary for this purpose.(iv) To take part in the preparation of the Master Agrepment, and of an agreed timetable and estimates of cost of the project.
Constitution of the Commission2. It is proposed that the Commission should be under a Special Commissionerwho would work in close association with two Gold Coast Ministers, namely theMinister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce and Industry. He would beappointed by the Gold Coast Government with the concurrence of the UnitedKingdom Government. The appointment would be subject to notice on either side,the Gold Coast Government agreeing not to exercise their right of giving noticewithout the prior concurrence of the United Kingdom Government.Initial work of the Commission3. It would be the first duty of the Special Commissioner on proceeding to Accrato establish, in association with the two Gold Coast Ministers, adequate liaisonarrangements with the local representatives of the aluminium companies and withall the departments concerned of the Gold Coast Government.The existence of liaison machinery of this kind would not prejudice the rightof the Special Commissioner to have direct access to the Prime Minister of the gold coast.The Special Commissioner, in association with the two Gold Coast Ministers,would be required to submit progress reports to the Gold Coast and United kingdom governments, at regular and frequent intervals. These reports would also be transmitted through the United Kingdom Government to the aluminium companies.He would be required to submit his final report and recommendations with all reasonable despatch.Subordinate appointments4. Subordinate appointments as necessary would be made by the Gold coast government in consultation with the United Kingdom Government and the SpecialCommissioner.Finance5. The cost of the Commission would be met by the Gold Coast Government in thefirst instance, but half would be reimbursed by the United Kingdom Government.If it is decided to proceed with the power scheme the cost of the Commission, whichis not expected to exceed  400,000, will be borne by the scheme.A supplementary estimate on the Ministry of Materials Vote will be submittedto Parliament in due course for the United Kingdom share of the cost of theCommission in the financial year 1952-53.
