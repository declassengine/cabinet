2.2^1C ON FIDE N TIAL^C. (52) 454 COPY NO,29th DECEMBER, 1952.CABINETLIFE PEERSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council.It may be for the convenience of my colleagues if I send them anote of my views, as Leader of the House of Lords, on the memorandum by-Lord Simon which the Prime Minister has had circulated to the Cabinet(C. (52) 453).2. It is of course a persuasive document, as one would expect fromits author;  but it begs a good many questions.3. For one thing, it will do nothing to remedy those main admittedweaknesses of the existing composition of the House of Lords, which makeit at present so vulnerable.   The hereditary right to legislate will continueuntrammelled, even for those peers who never attend the House at all.The backwoodsmen will still, if they wish, be that.   This may well attractsome support from that considerable body of peers which does not normallyattend the House, but does not wish to be shorn of its hereditary privileges.But it will be deplored by all those who really do the work of their Lordships1House, and it will make the task of those who wish to buttress the powers and influence of the Second Chamber quite impossible.4. Secondly, Lord Simon seems to assume that, if t e Whips werenot put on, his Bill on Life Peerages, to which his memorandum refers,would be given a second reading in the Lords,   That is certainly not myimpression.   I consulted my Leaders&apos; Committee on the Bill before the Houserose, and it seemed clear that in that body ra which includes nearly all theleading Conservative Peers, both on the Front and Back Benches - there wasa considerable majority not so much against the proposals themselves -they were hardly discussed - but against bringing forward such a limitedscheme now, only a short time before we enter, as we are pledged to do,into comprehensive conversations with the Labour and Liberal Parties.5. Moreover, it is surely absurd to suggest, as Lord Simon does,that it would be possible for any government, on a great constitutional questionlike this, to take the Whips off and allow the House to vote without any official guidance at all.   The result would be absolute chaos, and would put the Conservative Party in the House of Lords and the Leader of the Househimself into an absolutely impossible position.   Indeed, he could in factcertainly not avoid having to give guidance both to his supporters before the debate and to the House during the debate;  and, if I were leading, I should, inview of what has already been said in the past, be obliged to advise againstproceeding with the Bill  at the present time.
^06. Furthermore,   apart from all other arguments against the course which Lord Simon suggests, he seems to assume that it would be possiblefor the Government to drop any attempt to get the Opposition parties into aconference on the subject with a view to getting a settlement by agreement.But we could not in fact do this.   We are pledged in our Election Manifestoto  make such an attempt, and many of us are also personally pledged.   Hemay indeed be absolutely right in saying that the Labour Party will refuseto play.   But, even so, the attempt must be made, if only to get the Liberals,who feel keenly on the subject, in with us.   If the conversations fail tomaterialise, or break down, I hope personally that we shall still go aheadon our own, as the Socialists did then they were in office, and reform theHouse whether on Lord Simon&apos;s lines or on others.   But we are absolutelypledged to try to get inter-party agreement first.   To pass a limited bill of this kind, only just before we make our wider attempt, must seriously prejudice these later discussions.   We should be told by those who areagainst any really far-reaching reform, that we must give the Simon plana chance before proceeding to anything wider;  and the opportunity foreffectively dealing with the problem of House of Lords Reform would once again have been thrown away.   That would surely be deplorable, and I hopethat my colleagues will not consider it.7. What I would recommend is that, when the Bill comes up forits Second Reading, I should, on behalf of the Government, say that, withoutprejudice to the proposals it contains, we cannot feel that the moment is appropriate for passing a limited Bill of this kind, on the very eve of thosewider discussions with the Opposition parties to which we are pledged.The Government will, however, be very ready to examine theseproposals, with others which might be put forward, in the inter-partydiscussions which we envisage,   I should then ask Lord Simon to withdraw his Bill.   I should hope that he would agree.   If he refused and took the matter to a division, I should vote it down at this stage.   That, I believe, would bethe only course consistent with our election pledges, and it would, I hope andthink, be satisfactory to the majority of peers.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.I.29th December, 1952.
