SECRET*mC. (52) 416 COPY NO^20th NOVEMIBER, 1952.CABINETJUDGES&apos; salaries memorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland.We have considered together the detailed method by which we can best carry out the decision of the Cabinet (C0 (52) 87th Conclusions, Minute 2)to improve the financial position of the judges by an exemption from taxation.We have arrived at an agreed conclusion,2. We have examined a number of possibilities and are satisfied thatan exemption from taxation on present judicial salaries cannot be devised to achieve both of two major objectives, viz. -(a) reasonable simplicity and(b) almost equal actual benefits to each judge regardless ofthe size of his judicial salary or of his private income.Any simple scheme is bound to confer a substantially greater benefit on the judges who have private means and on those who have the larger salaries;   and almost all of the judges in Scotland and Northern Ireland have smaller salariesthan those in England.3. We therefore propose that all judges should be paid in addition totheir salaries an allowance of  1,000 which should be free of all taxation.This is the only simple measure by which the same actual cash benefit can begiven to all.   It will leave entirely unaffected the present taxation on the salaries and private incomes of the judges.4. We attach a draft of the short Bill which will be needed for thispurpose and ask the approval of the Cabinet for it.Simonds,J.S020th November, 1952.
