CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.      gC. (52) 43911th December, 1952,    : ..... .1&quot;; I;.-     &apos;.&apos; .-    CABINETTHE CHARGE FOR SCHOOL MEALSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of education in view of the pressing need for economy we propose that the standard charge to parents for school dinners under the School Meals Service should be increased from the present figure of Id. to 9d. This increase need not cause hardship tothe poorer parents. In cases where the charge is at present wholly remitted on grounds of financial need the full remission would continue. In other cases theincrease of 2d. would be payable, though local authorities would be allowed inborderline cases to adjust the income scales governing partial remissions; of thecharge where hardship would be caused by requiring the full increase to be&apos;paid.2. The present charge to parents of Id. was fixed in April 1951. At thattime the average gross cost per meal in England and Wales was Is. 3d. (7d. f6ffood and 8d. for overheads) and in Scotland Is. 2\d. (Id. and l\d). Since thattime there have been several increases in the cost of food and nationally-negotiatedwage rates. In addition, there have been increases in the cost of fuel,, lightings petrol and the general maintenance of premises. As a result, the average gross cost permeal, in spite of the economies that have been made in the present year, has risenin England and Wales to a figure of Is. S\d. (%\d. for food and 9d. for overheads)and in Scotland to Is. 6d (9d. and 9d.).3. On the assumption that the demand remains unchanged, an increase inthe charge to parents from Id. to 9d. is estimated to reduce expenditure by some-thing of the order of  4^ millions in a full year,  4 millions for England and wales and, under the ll./80ths arrangement, million for Scotland. If the demanddrops, the saving would be higher because fewer meals will be served. Nearly thewhole of the reduction would accrue to the benefit of the Exchequer. This wouldbe particularly welcome from the Exchequer standpoint in view of the rising curveof expenditure in the education service that results from the continuing increasein the number of children in the schools.4. It has been the accepted practice hitherto that the charge to parents shouldnot substantially exceed the cost of food provided. Our proposals would not be inconsistent with this practice, inasmuch as in England and Wales the charge would exceed the present cost of food by about \d. and even this excess would be reduced or even removed if food prices rise; and in Scotland the cost of food is already 9d.5. An increase in the charge would be unpopular and would almost certainly lead to a drop in demand in the early stages. For England and Wales the Ministerof Education would expect that the demand would soon tend to recover. ForScotland past experience shows that there will be a gradual, but not complete,recovery after an interval.6, If the proposal to increase the charge by 2d. is agreed in principle it remains to be decided from what date the increased charge should operate. The Chancellorof the Exchequer considers that the date of introduction should be not later than the43366&amp;.&apos; Printed\fdr the Cabinet.  December 1952 .  ,
beginning of February in order to secure the? maximum ^practicable saving in thecurrent financial year as well as in 1953-54 and later, years. .!f this date were adopted the saving to the Exchequer in the current financial year would be of theOrder of  740,000,  650,000 for England and Wales and  90,000 for Scotland. TheMinister of Education would very much prefer not to make the change till theslimmer; but, if there must be some saving in the present financial year, she wouldbe ready to accept the beginning of March as the earliest possible date. She eon*siders that to impose an increased charge from the beginning of February wouldresult in many children failing to take the meals during one of the worst winter months and would be open to serious criticism on this account. She also feels that it would create a bad impression to make the announcement of an&apos; increasedcharge just before Christmas, as would be unavoidable if the change were to take effect as early as the beginning of February. The Secretary of State for Scotlandagrees with the Minister of Education. If the beginning of March were adopted the saving to the Exchequer in the current financial year would be of the order of 370,000,  325,000 for England and Wales and  45,000 for Scotland.7. We ask our colleagues to consider which of these two dates should beadopted.R. A. B.F. H.11th December, 1952.
