During a discussion of the agitation about Tito&apos;s visit to thiscountry, M. Massigli said that he  thought that he should in all loyaltytell me of a conversation which he had had som - time ago withDuke Gallaratti Scotti, former Italian Ambassador here.   referring to relations between Yugoslavia and the West, Gallaratti Scotti saidthat the Vatican was resolutely determined to do everything in its powerto prevent any improvement in relations between them.   The reasonfor this attitude was the fear felt by the Vatican that Titoism wouldspread to Italy.   When I expressed some astonishment at the Vaticantaking such an attitude, M. Massigli repeated his statement, and addedthat the trouble no doubt was that the Vatican felt that when Communismwas divorced from Moscow, it had an infinitely more attractive appealin Europe.   M. Massigli said he thought that this statement from thelate Italian Ambassador was all the more remarkable sinceGallaratti Scotti was himself, of course, a Catholic.A.E,Foreign Office, S.W.1.3rd December, 1952.
