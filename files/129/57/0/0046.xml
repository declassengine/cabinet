POST OFFICE;   EMPLOYMENT OF COLOURED workers memorandum by the Postmaster general  was invited by my colleagues (C.C.(52) 100th Conclusions, Minute 8) toreport on the employment of coloured workers by the Post Office.A small number of coloured people were employed before the last war;but in 1949 the Ministry of Labour, after consultation with the Colonial Office,indicated that the provision of employment for coloured British subjects fromthe Colonies was a problem on which they would value our help.Between 500 and 600 coloured people from the Commonwealth and empire are at present employed by the Department (mainly in the LondonPostal Region and the Savings Department).   Of these about 175 are permanent staff (some 75 employed on clerical work and the remainder as postmen,telephonists, etc.).These people come for the most part from India, Nigeria, the Gold coast and Sierra Leone;  Uganda and Mauritius;  the West Indies and British Guiana;Ceylon and Malaya.   Their employment has raised no serious difficulties.The two principal Post Office Trade Unions concerned raised noobjection to the employment of coloured people in basic grades.Coloured British subjects are eligible for appointments in the CivilService including the Post Office.   The number of coloured workers recruitedby the Post Office in the future will therefore depend on how many are putforward for such employment by the Ministry of Labour and National service which is the source through which adults are recruited for manipulative, etc.grades, and what proportion is suitable for employment.If it is felt that coloured workers should not be allowed to obtainemployment in this country, I should have thought that the proper coursewould be to deny them entry to the country.   The Post Office, alone among government Departments, could not discriminate against coloured Britishsubjects once they are here nor can I feel that the country would benefit in anyway by my discharging the     400 or so that are not established,,   They would theneither be unemployed or else be employed by others.I therefore submit that this is not purely a Post Office question at all.   Itraises the whole issue of (a) whether coloured subjects of the Commonwealth and empire should be admitted to the country from now on and (b) whether those whoare already here should be discharged not only by the Post Office, but by therest of the Civil Service, other nationalised industries and, indeed, if we are tobe logical, by private industry also.D.Post Office Headquarters, EBC.l.16th December, 1952.riOPY NO.CABINETACONFIDENTIALC.
