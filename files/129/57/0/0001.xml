(52) 40110th November, 1952CABINETDECONTROL OF FEEDING-STUFFS AND CEREALSMemorandum by the Home Secretary, Secretary of State for Scotland,Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and Minister of food the attached report by a Working Party of officials of the Agricultural Depart-ments, the Treasury and the Ministry of Food, recommends the removal of thesubsidy on feeding-stuffs next April and the ending of rationing at the time of the harvest, together with removal of price control and reversion to private trade inall feeding-stuffs and cereals.2. It is not practicable to end the rationing of feeding-stuffs without at thesame time creating a market in all cereals, including wheat and flour. The subsidy on flour would also have to be removed, but it would be possible to adjust the bread subsidy so as to lessen the effect upon the price of bread.3. These are far-reaching changes; but there are powerful reasons why theyshould not be delayed. The belief that feeding-stuffs rationing is no longer required is widespread among farmers, and causes criticism which must be damaging to theproduction campaign. Indeed, the combination of rationing, price control andsubsidy imposes upon the agricultural economy a rigidity which is in direct conflict with our policy of expansion and, above all, with the policy of expansion founded on greater self-sufficiency derived from better use of grass and increased productionof home-grown cereals. The announcement that control over cereals is to beremoved would provide an immediate stimulus to increased production.4. The change cannot be made without incurring some risks. Thus in thelong run increased home production should be fully adequate to meet any increased demands for cereals. But in the first season it might prove to be desirable toincrease imports in order to prevent prices rising too much.5. Timing is most important. To derive full benefit from the change, the farmer should have good notice of the end of rationing, so that he may reconsiderhis cropping programme. The trades concerned will also have many complexarrangements to make before they can resume responsibility for supply and dis-tribution. Decontrol at the time of next year&apos;s harvest would for these reasonsrequire announcement of a Government decision before the Christmas Recess.It is not necessary that a final decision should be taken immediately but we ask our colleagues to give general approval in principle to the proposals as outlined in thefirst paragraph and to authorise immediate consultation with farmers and with thetrades concerned.D.

DECONTROL OF FEEDING-STUFFS AND CEREALSReport by the Agricultural Policy Working PartyPresent system. The total United Kingdom consumption of feeding-stuffs in the form ofconcentrates (i.e., excluding grass, roots, &amp;c.) is estimated at roughly 10 million tons,of which A\ million tons represents feed grown and consumed on the farm. Thepresent rationing system for feeding-stuffs is designed to secure the equitable distribution over the year of the &quot; pool &quot; of 5  million tons.   This pool is fed:  (a) By small supplies of home grown grains sold off farms for feeding pur-poses; such sales are controlled, and farm to farm sales are prohibited.(b) From the by-products of our food-processing industries, the most important ,examples being wheat offals and oilcake.(c) By importation on Government account; we import sufficient quantities to make the pool up to 5\ million tons, after taking into accountsupplies becoming available as at (a) and (b).At present home agricultural production accounts for under 20 per cent, of the&quot; pool &quot; of 5-J million tons.2. The selection by the Ministry of Food of the types and grades of feeding-stuff which they import is necessarily somewhat arbitrary. But, subject to the limitsimposed by the availability of particular types, the system allows a considerableelement of choice. Thus, the livestock producer uses his ration document to make an order on the merchant, who can then place an order with the wholesaler or thecompounder, who is thus in turn enabled to order his supplies; and each of themcan choose which of a number of alternative products he buys. Ultimately, the documents return to the Ministry of Food much as cancelled cheques are returnedto the drawer. The whole system is linked to the size of the pool.3. Since in practice livestock producers choose to take 85 per cent, of theirrations in the form of compounds, in which individual types of feed lose theiridentity, it is impossible to isolate the treatment of particular types of feed withinthe rationing system.Defects of the System4.   The existing arrangements have been under serious criticism for some time.They have three main defects:  (a) The existing system is linked with a subsidy on feeding-stuffs which atpresent amounts to about  5 per ton, and in 1953-54 is estimated toaverage  4 per ton. The existence of this subsidy encourages live-stock producers to use imported feeding-stuffs. It must, therefore, tendto frustrate the campaign for increased production of coarse grains inthis country and for the more efficient use of grass. The removal ofthe subsidy and the creation of a free market in coarse grains wouldgive an economic stimulus to this campaign.(b) In the case of the individual pig or poultry producer, the ration entitlementis at present largely based on the stock on his holding in 1939. this basis has, of course, now become seriously out of date; moreover, thearrangement gives an undesirable rigidity to the pattern of the pig and poultry industries.(c) The system is tending to break down, in that cereals are being sold fromfarm to farm quite freely in contravention of the law. Although thereis evidence that the extent of such sales has been exaggerated, it doesseem probable that their number is growing, and they undoubtedly have a disturbing effect on the agricultural community. There is alsoa considerable transfer of coupons.Changing the System5. Because of the nature of the ration pool, it would be virtually impossibleto decontrol some only of the feeding-stuffs which enter into it. As explained above, the different types of feed lose their identity in the pool, and most producersdraw their rations in the form of compounds. Moreover, the main types of imported feed are indistinguishable from the home produced article.   The only
effective substitute for the present arrangements is, therefore, the restoration of a free market in all feeding-stuffs, including coarse grains (imported as well as homegrown). With the restoration of a free market the subsidy would have to go; itis at present injected by the Ministry of Food taking a loss on their TradingAccounts, and with decontrol they would cease to trade in feeding-stuffs.6. The decontrol of coarse grains would have to be accompanied by thedecontrol of wheat and flour. Otherwise the controlled and subsidised price ofhome-grown wheat would be so much out of line with the free price of feeding-stuffs that the amount supplied to the miller would be reduced, either by a fall inthe acreage or by the use of wheat to feed animals, and additional dollar imports would be necessary. The decontrol of wheat and flour would involve the removalof the existing subsidy on flour; but it would be possible to reduce the impact ofthis on the price of bread by increasing the bread subsidy. (These matters are nowunder examination between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofFood.)Imports7. Because of the balance of payments position, imports of cereals and feeding-stuffs must remain subject to some form of import restriction after decontrol, andthe Ministry of Food will have to administer it. The effect of decontrol on imports is discussed in the Appendix. In it we have first considered whether there is likelyto be such an increase in the demand for feeding-stuffs after decontrol as to createconsiderable pressure for increased imports. It is not likely that this will happen,since the home production of coarse grains will have been greatly stimulated bydecontrol and the removal of the subsidy, provided they are announced before theend of 1952. It will, however, be wise to decontrol at harvest time, when supplies are at their most plentiful; and it is important that the restraint on demand due to higher feeding-stuffs prices should be made fully effective by a suitable measure of under-recoupment at the next Annual Review.8. The Appendix also discusses the likelihood of decontrol increasing our needfor imported wheat. It will be necessary to ensure, so far as possible, that there isno falling off in sales of home-grown wheat for milling; this means both retaining the rule that 75 per cent, of home-grown wheat must be sold for human consumption and also requiring millers to take up all the home-grown wheat offered. If this is done, the only remaining factor likely to increase imports of wheat is the restorationof the millers&apos; freedom to vary extraction rates. We consider that the net effect ofthis on the balance of payment will not exceed  3 millions in dollars.Effect on the Annual Review9. We have indicated in paragraph 7 the importance of a suitable measure of under-recoupment of the increase in feeding-stuffs prices at the next annual review.It has been estimated that in 1953/54 the feeding-stuffs subsidy would cost the Ministry of Food  21 millions. Its removal will add about  19millions to farming costs, the balance of  2 millions being accounted forby supplies to domestic poultry keepers, &amp;c. Of the  19 millions, roughly 16 millions is attributable to Review products. About  3 millions of the 16 millions is attributable to eggs; and if, as we have recommended, theseare decontrolled next March, this proportion of the additional costs will not have tobe considered for recoupment because the egg producer will enjoy the benefit of aprice rise in a free market. Another  6^ millions can be attributed to pigs. Thepoint about under-recoupement is particularly important in this case; if dueattention is not paid to it, decontrol of feeding-stuffs may stimulate a greaterrate of increase in the pig population than can be supported, by anincreased home production of feeding-stuffs. Since the costs of production of pigs are so closely linked to the price of feeding-stuffs, it may be desirable to intro-duce an arrangement which relates the pig and feeding-stuffs prices. Of the remain-ing  6^ millions, million is attributable to beef and mutton; milk accounts forthe other  6 millions, and  4^ millions of this is attributable to winter milk.Guarantees under the Agriculture Act, 194710. At present the Ministry of Food is the Governments agent for carryingout the guarantees to home farmers under the Agriculture Act, 1947. There is a fixed buying price for home grown wheat.   The guarantee for home grown oats and
barley takes the form of a support price, and (apart from barley sold at relatively high uncontrolled prices for seed and malting) most barley sold into the feeding-stuffs pool is bought by merchants within a range of which the lower end is set bythe guaranteed minimum price and the upper end by the maximum price at whichthe merchant may sell. Even in a year in which the crop is large, the amount ofboth oats and barley offered to the Ministry of Food at the guaranteed minimum price is insignificant.11. It will take some time to work out the final arrangements for imple-menting the guarantees after decontrol. Some central body will be needed eitherto make deficiency payments or to operate a support price system (or possibly to combine both methods), and legislation may be required. The Ministry of food would, however, be prepared to continue, during a transitional period of (say)twelve months, to implement minimum prices for home grown barley and oats,provided those minimum prices were sufficiently low to be operative onlyoccasionally; and it should be possible to deal with wheat on a similar minimum price basis in this interim period.Timing12. Some time must elapse between the decision to decontrol feeding-stuffs and the actual end of the rationing system. The first step will be preliminary discussions with representatives of the farmers and the many trades concerned. Thedecision to decontrol will then be announced, and thereafter preparations for decon-trol extending over several months can begin.13. The announcement of the decision to decontrol should be made soon certainly before the Christmas Recess; otherwise the stimulus of the higher prices will not have its full effect on cropping programmes. For the reasons explained in paragraph 7, the most suitable time for decontrol itself would be during the 1953harvest.14. The removal of the subsidies should precede derationing; and there iseverything to be said for taking this step on 1st April. The farmers will know thatthe end of the feeding-stuffs subsidy is coming, and will expect account to be taken ofthis fact in the Annual Review. It is, moreover, clearly desirable that subsidychanges should be introduced at the time of the Budget.Conclusions15. We therefore recommend that Ministers should agree in principle to thedecontrol of feeding-stuffs and cereals, and authorise the immediate opening of discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Union and the trades concerned with a viewto an announcement before the Christmas Recess. The discussions will be in thehands of the Agricultural Departments and the Ministry of Food. We would not favour presenting the farmers&apos; representatives and the grain trade with a cut-and-dried scheme; but the main objectives should be the following:  (1) The removal of the subsidies on feeding-stuffs and flour, with necessary adjustments in the bread subsidy, in April at the time of the Budget.(2) The control of feeding-stuffs and cereals to end during the harvest; theMinistry of Food to continue to operate a prjtce support system for an interim period, until such time as permanent machinery for imple-menting the guarantees under the Agriculture Act, 1947, has been set up.10th November, 1952.
APPENDIXEffect of Decontrol on ImportsIntroductoryIn order to make up our total requirements, we have to buy both coarse grains and wheat in the non-sterling area; this will continue to be so throughout the foreseeable future, and, in the case of wheat at least, some of our supplies willcontinue to cost us dollars. It is, therefore, most important to know the probable effect of decontrol on imports.2. This is not to say that effect will necessarily be allowed to work itself out.Imports, though they will be returned to private hands, must remain controlled.The point is rather that, if the unrestricted demand for feeding-stuffs and cerealswere likely to create a strong pressure for substantial additional imports, that wouldbe a serious objection to decontrol.3. The effect of decontrol from this point of view falls to be considered intwo stages-first, the effect on the demand for imported feeding-stuffs, and, secondly,the effect on our imports of wheat.Demand for Feeding-stuffs4.   An increase in demand after decontrol might be caused for four reasons : -(a) Because of stocking up by farmers or the trade.(b) Because of increased use in the feeding of livestock.(c) Because of a rise in the livestock population.(d) Because of a relaxation of farmers&apos; efforts to become more self-sufficient.In considering the probabilities under each of these heads, an important factor isthe increase in price which will follow the removal of the subsidy.5. The fact that prices are higher will be a substantial disincentive to stockingup when rationing ends. It seems very likely that farmers and the trade will bothtend to hold lower stocks than at present.6. Similarly, the higher price will surely discourage any general tendency to increase the proportion of bought-in feeding-stuffs in animal feed. It is far more likely that, since the comparative economy of home-grown feeds (including grass)will be enhanced, their use will be encouraged; in particular, decontrol should givea considerable impetus to the campaign for more and better grass.7. As for the number of stock, any increase is bound to take some time.Farmers who make plans for an increase as soon as decontrol is announced willsimultaneously make their plans for feeding the increased number of mouths; andthe financial incentive will ensure that they do so, wherever possible, by growingmore feed themselves. The absence of restrictions on feeding-stuffs will thereforefeature in their plans mainly as an insurance, to be called on if their other arrangements fail.8. The financial incentive will, by the same token, intensify the efforts of the farming industry to achieve self-sufficiency rather than encourage them to relax.The results of the ploughing-up grant show what such an incentive can do; and inthe present case there will also be an incentive not to allow other tillage to revert to grass, so that the net effect should be the more substantial. Each farmer would,moreover, know that, in so far as his efforts to grow more feeding grain produced a crop in excess of his own requirements, he would be able to sell the residue ata very remunerative price.9. The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that the immediate effect of, derationing would not be a significant increase in the demand for imports. this conclusion is reinforced when one considers the present position under rationing.There is evidence that the rationing system is breaking down; there are undoubtedlyfarm to farm sales, and there is widespread transfer of coupons (in most caseswithout any money passing). Moreover, it would appear that a proportion of pigand poultry keepers who are entitled to a bonus issue of feedingstuffs do not botherto apply for it. This suggests that the unsatisfied demand for feeding-stuffs is smallin relation to the size of the ration pool.10. The rise in price of feeding-stuffs under decontrol will clearly be the major factor in keeping demand for imports down to present levels. It is, therefore, vital to reinforce its effect in every possible way. In particular, it is most important that
the price of livestock products should not be allowed to rise sufficiently to offset the increase in feeding costs. In other words, in the determination of these prices at the next Annual Review there should be a substantial under-recoupment of theincreased cost of feeding-stuffs. It is difficult at this stage to give any measure ofthe desirable degree of under-recoupment. We do not yet know the trend of netfarm income over the past year; and if, in the event, it proves to have been buoyant,it may be that we should aim to avoid even partial recoupment. But all we can say at present is that the degree of under-recoupment required is limited only by thefact that it must not be pressed to the point at which it threatens to underminefarming confidence.11. In the case of one product, under-recoupment will not be within the powerof the Government. Eggs are to be decontrolled next March, and it seems virtuallycertain that their free market price will more than offset the increased cost of feed.But even in this case there is a natural corrective; the consumer will not pay anunlimited price for eggs, and a fall in demand will operate to prevent excessive high cost production.12. It is difficult to quantify all this and to give a measure of the risk. Forexample, if the harvest of 1953 were bad, there might be increased pressure for additional imports of feeding-stuffs. Given an average harvest and substantialunder-recoupment of the increased cost of feed, it seems to us that there is little chance of the demand for imported feeding-stuffs in the first year of decontrolrising by more than a marginal amount say, 200,000 or 300,000 tons. If this were allowed to have its effect in increased imports, it would cost at most  10 millions in dollars; if it were not, the result would be a slight additional rise in price untildemand and supply were in balance.13. So far we have concentrated on the effect on imports in the short-term.In the longer term, it seems to us that the incentives we have discussed would operate to equate demand and supply with imports at their present level.Imports of Wheat14. Following decontrol, increased imports of wheat might result from one oftwo causes:  (a) With the removal of control over the millers there would be a fall inextraction rates and possibly a decrease in the use of home-growngrains in grists.(b) Theire might be a tendency for more wheat to be used for poultry-feed.15. We assume that after decontrol the national loaf, produced from flourof the present 80 per cent, extraction rate, would be retained; and that, althoughthe subsidy on flour would go, the national loaf would still be subsidised. Forthe rest, millers would be free to change their grists and vary extraction rates. Howfar they availed themselves of this freedom would depend upon public taste, whichmay be less inclined towards white flour than before the war. If the demand for white flour products (apart from the national loaf) proved to be as great as in pre-war years, it might be necessary to import additional wheat to the extent of400,000 tons. We would expect the actual figure to be a good deal less; and,whatever the figure, the same amount of extra wheat offal would become available as a feeding-stuff.16. We consider that steps should be taken to avoid any decrease in thequantity of wheat sold for milling. We therefore propose that the existing rule that 75 per cent, of home-grown wheat must be sold for human food should bemaintained. This cannot be fully enforced even now, and decontrol would makejt-s enforcement more difficult; but to remove it would create the impression thatthe Government was less interested in securing maximum sales to millers. TheGovernment must also retain sufficient control to enable it, if necessary, to requiremillers to take up home-grown wheat in preference to imports.17. Given effective arrangements for preventing any fall in sales of home-grown wheat for milling, the effect of decontrol on wheat imports will be limitedto that due to reduction of the extraction rate. We have estimated this at 400,000tons at the most, and there would be an offsetting reduction in imports of feeding-stuffs. On the assumption that the wheat would have to be bought at non-Inter-national Wheat Agreement prices, it might cost  7 per ton more than coarse grains.The effect on the balance of payments would therefore not be more than  3 millions in dollars.
