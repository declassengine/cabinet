CABINETTHE WAIVER clause in THE UNITED STATES LOAN agreement memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer^On 31st December next the second instalment is due of the interestand principal payable under the United States and Canadian Loan Agreements,The total amount due is approximately $180 millions but of this $110 millionsis interest.   As my colleagues know we are entitled in certain circumstances to ask that the interest part of the payment should be waived,2. We are entitled under the Agreement (Cmd. 67 0^) to ask for thiswaiver if in the first place two main conditions are fulfilled.   The first is thatwe consider it necessary, having regard in particular to the state of our gold and dollar reserves.   The second is broadly that the International monetary fund (I.M.F.) should certify that our current overseas income is not enoughto enable us to pay for the average volume of imports received in the years1936-1938.3, There is no doubt that these conditions are fulfilled this year.   Thefirst is a matter for our own judgment.   On the second the staff of the I.M.F.have made calculations from which it is clear that they can grant us the necessarycertificate.4. But there as  a third condition to be satisfied.   Section 6 of theAgreement provides that the waiver shall not be reqviested or granted, with theresult that payments due to the United States and Canada would be reduced,unless releases or payments from sterling balances accumulated by otherGovernments before the date of the Agreement are reduced in the same proportion,.The effect of the provision is that we cannot ask for the waiver this year, if thereleases from such sterling balances in 1952 are more than three-eighths of thereleases in 1951.5. There are a number of obscurities in the provisions of Section 6which we have discussed with the Americans in the past without reaching agreement.   In 1952, however, holders of sterling have run down their balancesso heavily that on any interpretation of the Section which can be devised its provisions are not satisfied.   We must therefore conclude that on a strictinterpretation of the Agreement as it stands we are not entitled to ask for the waiver this year.6, I should be most reluctant to accept this conclusion if I could see any escape from it.   In the first place, it cannot be disputed that on grounds of,need our claim for the waiver this year is very strong.   The calculations ofthe I.M.F. show this.   In the second place, I believe that since the Agreement wasSECRET /I    y*    JC(52) 433 COPY NO.10th DECEMBER, 1952.
Ifiegotiated it has become cleax- that the sterling balances provision is neither workable nor reasonable.   It is not workable because by no me&apos;ans allthe sterling balances are under our control.   The intention of Section 10 ofthe Agreement was that a comprehensive settlement covering all such balemc^would be reached with the holders.   But even if this had been done, we stillcould not carry out the undertaking implied in this Section, both for reasons of timing and for broader reasons of policy in which the Americans are as much concerned as we.   On timing, we cannot decide whether to claim the waiveruntil late in the year, but by then it is too late to revoke the releases whichhave been made from sterling balances.7. There is therefore in my view a strong case for a revision of theAgreement.   The procedure for securing such a revision is provided inSection 12 which lays it down that either Government shall be entitled to approach the other for a reconsideration of the provisions of the Agreement witha view to agreeing upon modifications for presentation to their respectivelegislatures.8, The questions which I ask my colleagues to consider are:-(i)      at what point should be put forward a formal request for a revision of the Agreement;(ii)      what action should we take about the payments due at the endof this year.9. I suggest that it would serve little purpose to make a formalrequest for revision to the present administration.   Mr, Snyder would, Ibelieve, have been reluctant at any time to recommend to Congress a revisionof the Agreement since he has always been apprehensive of criticism of hisfailure to secure the carrying out of the provisions relating to convertibilityand non-discrimination (Sections 8 and 9) and that relating to the treatmentof sterling balances (Section 10).   Least of all would he be prepared to enterinto discussions on this subject in the last few weeks of his administration,,10. Next year, however, we shall be entering upon far reachingdiscussions with the new United States Administration covering a wide range of economic questions.   We may be asking them to make available verylarge resources to support a new approach to multilateral trade and payments,,The pressure of events may well oblige them to consider in that context thewhole question of Europe&apos;s dollar indebtedness to the United States Governmentwhich is today a serious impediment to the flow of American private capital to Europe a   countries.   I suggest that that will be the time when we can bestraise the need for a revision of the United States Loan Agreement.11. Have we any alternative in the meantime but to make the paymentdue at the end of this month?   The position under Section 6 has been discussedinformally in the last few weeks with the United States Administrationbut there has been very little response.   I am prepared to pursue it withMr, Snyder in Paris next week, but I expect him to say that until proposals forthe revision of the Agreement have been submitted to Congress and to parliament and approved by them, the executive branch of the United States Government hasno power to depart from the provisions of the Agreement.   If that is so i submit that we have no option but to make the payment since to do otherwise wouldbe to default on our obligation.12.We should not, however, do this without making it very plain that we
Jbonsicier that in fairness and in equity we have a good claim to the waiver thisyear, that we shall raise this matter at a suitable moment with the new administration and that we hope that they will consider whether any new arrangements could be made retrospective so that the payment now made would be refunded.   We should not in my view count too much on this latterpossibility.   But it should certainly be explored.13. I also propose that in announcing our decision to make the paymentwe should explain to the public both here and in the United States the reasonsfor which we have felt obliged to make it.   It should be made clear that weconsider that we have a strong claim on grounds of need, that the I.M.F. &apos;experts who have examined the matter support that view and that we have only been debarred from maklag a request for the waiver because of the technical difficulties inherent in the provision relating to sterling balances.14. I therefore recommend:&quot;(i) that we should make the payments due to the United States and canada for the full service of the loans on 31st December nextbut should, at the same time, give notice informally of our intentionto ask at a later date for a revision of the Agreement;(ii) that when we announce that this payment is to be made, guidanceshould be given to the Press explaining the reasons for which wehave felt obliged to make it, and emphasising our view thaton grounds of need we would have been fully entitled to the waiver;(iii)         that a request for the revision of the United States Loan agreement should be made at the time of (though separate from) the widerapproach we shall be making to the new administration next year on questions of economic policy.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,10th December, 1952.
Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 43410th December, 1952CABINETEUROPEAN DEFENCE COMMUNITY AND ALTERNATIVE PLANSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecent developments in France and Western Germany show that there is stillstrong opposition to the ratification of the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)Treaty and Bonn Conventions. The difficulties in Bonn are mainly constitutional.They centre upon whether certain articles conflict with the Basic Law, drafted when there was no question of German rearmament. If so, a two-thirds majority of the&apos; Bundestag would be required, whereas Dr. Adenauer can only rely upon the simple majority (about 220-165) which has just passed the second reading. All this is entirely dependent upon the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court and thereis little, if anything, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government can do to help. In Paris thedifficulties are more fundamental and the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the United States Government may be important in overcoming them.2. I have been considering what our policy should be, and my colleagues maylike to see the attached memorandum. Part I considers whether there is any further action that Her Majesty&apos;s Government could take to improve the prospects of ratification. Part II suggests an alternative plan to secure a German contributionto the defence of Western Europe to be put forward only if the E.D.C. plan fails.It is on very general lines and will require further study.3. The recommendations of Part I, with which the Chiefs of Staff are in agree-ment, are:  (a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to give their full support to&apos; the plan for establishing a European Defence Community and should do all in their power to encourage early ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty,as the quickest method of securing a German contribution to defence and the one which still seems politically the most feasible for all con-cerned. We should actively discourage any suggestion that alternativeplans might be considered.(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should, if necessary, reaffirm that this countrycannot join the community nor merge any part of its forces in theCommunity. Her Majesty&apos;s Government should also refrain from entering into any commitment to maintain any fixed quantity of british forces on the Continent for a specified number of years.(c) Her Majesty&apos;s Government may, however, be able to ease the French pathby adopting at the appropriate moment the courses outlined in para-graph 7 of the Memorandum. These are designed to assure the membersof the E.D.C. of our support in peace as effectively as the UnitedKingdom-E.D.C. Treaty assures them of our aid in war.I hope my colleagues will approve these recommendations and will in their public statements express confidence that the Bonn and Paris Agreements will be ratified.4. Part II of the Memorandum makes the following recommendations:  (a) If perhaps the most likely case the French Assembly ratifies the E.D.C.Treaty subject to conditions which would not materially alter its pro-visions, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should firmly maintain their present policy so long as there is a prospect of a successful outcome of thefurther negotiations which must then take place between the E.D.C.countries.
