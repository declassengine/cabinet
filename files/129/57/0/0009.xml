HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y!S GOVERNMENT)SECRETC0(52) 409 COPY NO, if?.5TH NOVEMBER, 1952CABINETPARLIAMENTARY CONTROL OF DELEGATED legislation memorandum by the Lord Privy SealThere are indications that in the debate on the renewal of emergency powers which is due to take place in the House of Commons on 20th November theOpposition will press the Government on the question of improved machinery for control by Parliament of delegated legislation under those powers or possiblyover the whole field.    It is, therefore, necessary to consider what should be theGovernments attitude on this matter.Past History2. The 1945 Select Committee of the House of Commons on parliamentary procedure (on which I led on behalf of the then Opposition) recommended in their third Report x  that a Select Committee should be appointed in the next session to enquire into the delegation of legislative power and the procedure of the house in relation thereto, or preferably that the House of Lords should be invited to concur in the appointment of a Joint Committee for the purpose.    In a statement made on 17th March, 1947, the late Government stated that they considered &quot;thatsuch an enquiry would be premature so long as the scope and form of subordinate legislation are influenced by war-time powers and until experience has been gained of the working of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946&quot;.3. The question again became active in connection with the action of ourParty in March, 1951, in putting down large numbers of Prayers against statutory instruments and prolonging debate upon them.     Correspondence followed betweenthe Prime Ministers and the then Home Secretary, ending with a letter fromMr. Churchill to Mr. Chuter Ede, dated 5th June, 1951, which is reproduced inthe Annex to this memorandum.    The suggestion of a Committee of Enquiry wasnot pursued further before the change of Government occurred.Questions for Consideration4 . There appear to be four main questions for consideration:-(a)    Should the Government offer to institute an enquiry?There is undoubtedly a considerably body of opinion within the Conserva-tive Party which would favour such an enquiry.     We are on record in this sensein the Prime Minister&apos;s letter and in &quot;Britain Strong and Free&quot; we declared that&quot;Parliament should exercise much more rigorous control of all delegated legisla -tion&quot;.    Willingness to offer an enquiry would also do something to blunt the edge of Opposition criticism of the Government in next week&apos;s debates on the renewal of emergency powers.x Stationery Office Publication 189, page XII, paragraph 30.
5, There are arguments on the other side, however, which must be takenfully into account.     The possibilities of improving the present machinery ofParliamentary control have been exhaustively examined on more than one recentoccasion by officials who reached the conclusion that any radical change in theprocedure for dealing with delegated legislation would be likely to destroy or seriously impair the virtues of flexibility and speed which it possessed, compelParliament to spend unnecessary time over details or make impossible demands on the time of Ministers and Civil Servants.    It is, however, true that officialsare the servants of the Government of the day and must therefore take into   &apos;account the administrative convenience of the Executive.    What is really in issue is the degree of Parliaments control over the Executive over a very wide field.The Lord Chancellor expressed his view in a memorandum to the Home AffairsCommittee (H.A.(52) 95) dealing with Lord SamuePs recent Motion on the liberty of the Subject:-&quot;It is in fact almost certain that a new Select or JointCommittee either would fail to produce any proposals of substance or else would propose measures that would becrippling to the machinery of a Government of either party. &quot;(b) Should any enquiry be limited to questions of procedure or extended to cover the principles on which Parliament should confer power to make delegated legislation?6. The Prime Minister&apos;s letter implied that the Conservative Party favoursan enquiry covering principles as well as procedure and it might well be contended that the increase in the scope of Government action, by legislation and otherwise,which has taken place since 1932 would justify the holding of a fresh enquirycorresponding to that conducted by Lord Donoughmore&apos;s Committee on Ministers&apos;Powers.     On the other hand any such enquiry would be likely to take much timeand to divert attention of Ministers and officials from other more urgent tasksand, as the Lord Chancellor said, might well yield no practicable result.    Inpresent circumstances, therefore, it might be prudent if any enquiry were to be confined to questions of the procedure of Parliamentary control only.    If its scope were widened to cover principles, it might be found necessary to entrustit to a body composed on the lines of the Donoughmore Committee.(c) S hould any enquiry be confined to the House of Commons or cover both Houses ?7. This is an aspect of the problem upon which the Cabinet will wish to hear the views of the Commonwealth Secretary and the Lord Chancellor.    The PrimeMinisters letter may be read as implying a preference for a Joint Committee ofEnquiry into this matter and opinion in the House of Lords seems in any caselikely to favour extension of any enquiry to cover proceedings in that House.     Thequestion whether in these circumstances any enquiry should be a joint onepresents a dilemma.    On the one hand some of the proposals which any enquiry would have to consider involve actions by each House, as well as the problem of reconciling possible divergences of view between them upon particular Orders.This would open up the whole field of the powers of the House of Lords, and howfar it could or should be enabled to prevent executive action being taken bysubordinate legislation in cases where the House of Commons had given itsapproval.     On the other hand each House has always regarded its procedure as a domestic matter and the present arrangements of each House in respectof delegated legislation differ considerably.
SO(d)    Could any enquiry be confined to the field covered by emergency powers ?8. It seems possible that the Opposition may press for some form ofenquiry confined to the field covered by emergency powers rather than the wholefield of delegated legislation.    As to the ground which might be covered by anysuch limited enquiry there appear to be three possibilities:-(i)  that it should be concered with all aspects of emergency powers;(ii)  that it should cover the principles on which powers ofdelegated legislation conferred by emergencyenactments should be exercisedj(iii)  that it should be confined to questions of the procedure by which such delegated legislation should be approved by either House.9. I invite the views of the Cabinet upon the questions raised at (a) , (b),(c) and (d) above.     My own opinion is that a fresh enquiry into delegated legislation should be made and that, if it were, it could not legically be limitedto orders, etc. under emergency powers but would have to cover the whole fieldwith a view to finding out how Parliament can have a more effective control overthe Executive, and I am on the side of Parliament.     The problem in my view is really this:   in modern times Parliament has found it impossible by legislation to enact a whole host of detailed matters which have to have the authority of law,sometimes immediately (e. g. variation in the rations)j and so the system ofdelegating powers of enactment to the Executive has grown up.     The question now is how Parliament is to maintain ultimate control:   can it or should it similarlydelegate the scrutiny and the approval of such orders to some-one else and if soto whom, and how in necessary cases can it&apos; still have the final word?Re commendation10.        My recommendation is that the Government should now express its willingness to have an enquiry into the whole field of delegated legislation (notmerely that of delegation under emergency powers) and should invite theOpposition to a consultation before deciding finally how and by whom this shouldbe done.H.C.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S8W.l.15TH NOVEMBER, 1952.
ANNEXWesterham 93 Chartwell,Westerham,Kent.5th June, 1951.My dear Home Secretary,You will remember that it was agreed at the meeting inyour room at the House of Commons on 26th April that I shouldforward you in writing my views and those of my colleagues onPrayer Procedure, and I have been giving this matter carefulconsideration since then.The Select Committee on Procedure in 1946 took a greatdeal of evidence on this subject:  three days were spent in examin-ing Sir Charles MacAndrew, Doctor D. K. Allen and Doctor E.C.S. Wadeand most of the other witnesses were also asked questions aboutdelegated legislation.     The Committee finally reported:-&quot;A Select Committee should be appointed in thecoming session, or preferably that the House of lords should be invited to concur in the appointment of a jointCommittee to inquire into the delegation of legislativepower and the procedure of the House in relation thereto. &quot;This was not done, but it is still our view that for a long-termanswer to the questions raised by Prayers such a Committee isdesirable.Yours sincerely,(Signed) WINSTON S. churchill the Rt. Hon. J. Chuter Ede, M.P.
