ad 9 -51(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 41114th NOVEMBFR,. 1952.COPY NO.cabinet british TRANSPORT COMMISSION:   INCREASE IN charges memorandum by the Minister of Transport.I reported on 29th October (C.C.(52) 91st Conclusions, Minute 3)that the Commission had applied for my authority to increase by 5% their railfreight, dock and canal charges, and that I proposed to seek the advice of thepermanent members of the Transport Tribunal acting as a Consultative Committee,I have now received that advice and a copy is annexed.2, An increase of lQj/o in the above charges v/as made with mypredecessors authority on 31st December, 1951,   During 1952, increases weremade in London passenger fares and in rail passenger fares outside london with the authority of the Transport Tribunal, and in provincial bus fares withthe authority of the Licensing Authorities,   A memorandum submitted to me bythe Commission shows, however, that these have been counter-balanced by thefollowing increase in costs incurred during 1952, the effect of which in afull year is indicated. mJanuary -   Increase in coal prices 5.0February        -   Increases in steel prices 2. 5March -   Increase in fuel duty 5. 5October -   Increase in National Insurance 1.3October/November -  Estimated cost of new wage increases 18.0 32. 33. The Tribunal find that, unless charges are increased, the commission will incur a deficit of between  20 millions and  22 millions in a full year,and they advise that immediate measures be takento enable the Commission toobtain additional revenue of this order.4. The Tribune^ also say that an increase of 5% in railway, dock and canal charges would produce about  12 millions a year, and a further 2^ millions a year would be produced by a 5 Jo increase in road haulagerates which the Commission have power to make and which they would proposeto make at the same time.5, In the memorandum submitted to me, the Commission indicate their intention to apply to the Transport Tribunal for authority to increase london area fares to produce possibly  6 millions, and to apply to the licensing authorities for authority to increase provincial bus fares to produce some 1 million,   (The Commission do not think that the net yield from railway
passenger fares outside the London Area can be increased at this time.   Theyare considering whether to exercise their power to increase ordinary singlefares from lfd. to 2d a mile.)  The Tribunal do not, however, express any opinion as to the amount of additional revenue which may be obtained fromthese sources as the applications for authority to increase fares will be thesubject of future proceedings before theTribunal or the Licensing Authorities,The Tribunal have accordingly, in considering what advice they should tender,neglected the possibility that the Commission might at some future date obtain some further revenue from these two sources.6. The Tribunal therefore advise:-(a) that the only measures immediately available which would meet the position are an increase of l\% in railway, dock and canal charges, coupled with a similar and simultaneousincrease in the Commission^ road haulage rates;(b) that the additional revenue of  12 millions a year whichwould be produced by an increaseof 5% in railway, dock and canal charges is the minimum contribution which can berequired of these services.7. Although it will not meet the position fully and will leave a balance which may have to be found from passengers, I have decided to adoptthe lower figure of 5%, which is what the Commission have asked for.   Ipropose therefore to make a statement in the House, after Questions onWednesday, that I shall authorise a 5% increase in railway freight, dock and canal charges as from 1st December, and that theTribunal&apos;s memorandum of advice will be circulated with the official report.A.L-B.Ministry of Transport, W. 1.14th November, 1952.annex memorandum FOR THE MINISTER OF transport by THE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE transport tribunal ACTING AS A CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE1. By a letter dated the 29th October you asked for our advice ona request made by the British Transport Commission that they should beauthorised under section 82 of the Transport Act, 1947, to increase by 5%the railway, dock and canal freight rates and charges now in operation.   Theestimates in the memorandum submitted by the Commission, copies of which accompanied your letter, were directed to showing (1) that owing mainly to therecent wage increases the activities of the Commission as a whole would, ifthey were unable to increase their revenue, result in a full year in a deficit of about  21 millions and (2) that the particular increases in their charges for which authority was sought would in a full year produce about  12millions additional revenue.
2. It will be remembered that when our advice was sought inNovember 1951 upon a proposal of this kind we were nearing the end of a pro-longed public inquiry and that the advice we then gave was based on theconclusions we had formed as to the probable financial results of theCommission^ activities during 1952,   It seemed to us that our considerationof the Commission^ present memorandum would be assisted if the figurescontained in it were expanded in such a way as would enable us to compare theestimate we had made at the end of 1951 with the facts revealed by the actualworking of the Commission during 1952.We have accordingly obtained from the Commission a detailed analysis of the &quot;Estimate of financial results for a *future year&quot;1 attached totheir memorandum which has enabled us to compare this estimate with thatupon which the advice we gave on that occasion was based.3. The conclusions we have reached as a result of our examinationof the material available to us are as follow:-(1)  that if it had not been for the recent increases in wages the accounts of the Commission for 1952 would have shown a surplus of about l/  millions;(2)  that owing to these increases there will instead, if no correctivemeasures are taken, be a deficit of about i.Zj millions;(3)  that in a full year the effect of these increases alone will be toincrease the working expenses of the Commission by about  17, 8millions;(4)  that the recent issue of  120 millions of Transport Stock will resultin a full year in an addition to the &quot;Central Charges&quot; of theCommission of over  4 millions;(5)  that it would be imprudent to expect any increase in the volume of the traffic from which the revenues of the British Railways and the docks and Canals sections of the Commission^ undertakings are drawn;(6)  that because of the increase in their wage costs and in the cost ofservicing the Transport Stock, referred to in sub-paragraphs (3)and (4) above, the Commission^ activities will in a full year if their charges are not increased result in a deficit of between  20 millions and  22 millions,(7) that an increaseof 5% in the railway, dock and canal freight rates and charges would in a full year produce additional revenue of the orderof  12 millions;(8)  that such an increase in the revenue drawn from the British Railways,Docks and Canals would represent about 80% of so much of the increasein costs referred to in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) as could reasonably be regarded as chargeable against these sections of the Commissionsundertaking,4. We note from the Commission^ memorandum that if they are authorised to increase the railway, dock and canal freight rates and charges by5% they intend to increase road haulage rates simultaneously by the same percentage and that they hope thereby to obtain additional revenue of about 2-g millions per annum.
5. The only other services which contribute substantial sums to the commissions revenue are (l) the passenger services of British Railwaysand London Transport and (2) the Provincial and Scottish road passenger services.We do not think it would be right for us to discuss the possibilityof obtaining additional revenue from the first of these two groups of services,or that any such discussion, if justifiable, could lead to any conclusion, whichwould throw any light on the question how best to alleviate or remove theimmediate financial difficulties of the Commission,   No substantial additional   ,revenue can be obtained unless the Charges Scheme confirmed by us on the27th February last is modified and this Scheme can only be modified if, after hearing all qualified objectors at another public inquiry, we decide that it ought to be modified.   It would plainly be improper for us acting as a consultative Committee to prejudge in any way an issue determinable by usonly when sitting in our normal capacity as a Tribunal,The same primary objection stands in the way of any discussion of thepossibility of obtaining any additional revenue from the second of the two groups.   No alternation can be made in the fares charged by the services in question without the prior approval of the local Licensing Authorities concerned.We cannot properly take upon ourselves a task which Parliament has imposed on other bodies.   Nor could we in fact, even if it were proper for us to attemptto do so, form any useful opinion upon the extent to which these other bodies might be found willing to authorise any increase in the fares at presentcharged, or as to the aggregate additional revenue which these hypotheticalincreases might be expected to produce, or as to the time at which any such additional revenue might become available.We have accordingly, in considering what advice we should tender,neglected the possibility that the Commission might at some future date obtain some further revenue from these two sources.6. The advice we tender is, for the reasons which, we hope, are sufficiently indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, as follows;&quot;(1)  that it is desirable that immediate measures be taken to enable theCommission to obtain additional revenue of the order of  20 millions to  22 millions per annum;(2)  that the only measures immediately available whereby additional revenue of this order cf magnitude could be obtained are:-(a) an increase of 7^c/o in the railway, dock and canal freight ratesand charges, coupled with(b) a similar and simultaneous increase in the commission s road haulage rates;(3)  that the additional revenue ( 12 millions per annum) obtainable by themeasure proposed by the Commission, namely an increase of 5%in the railway, dock and canal freight rates and charges, is theminimum contribution which can be required of these services towardsthe relief of the Commission^ immediate financial difficulties.(Signed)   Hubert Hull13th November, 1952.(Signed A.
