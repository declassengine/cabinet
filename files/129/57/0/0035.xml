Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 43510th December, 1952CABINETRELEASE OF ALAN NUNN MAY FROM PRISONMemorandum by the Home secretary i was invited by the Cabinet on 25th November (C.C. (52) 100th Conclusions,Minute 11) to consider and report whether arrangements could be made to give areasonable assurance that Alan Nunn May, if he were released from prison, wouldnot leave this country, at any rate until the expiration of the full term of ten years from the date of his conviction in 1946.2. I have given very careful consideration to this matter, but I have been unable to find any means by which Nunn May could effectively be prevented from leaving this country after his release if he wishes to do so. I set out in the appendix the methods which I have considered and the reasons for which I have felt compelledto reject them. I cannot therefore give an assurance in the terms for which mycolleagues have asked. I remain, however, of the opinion that it would be wrong to deprive Nunn May of the remission he has earned and to require him to serve the full ten years of his sentence.3. Further I adhere to the view expressed in paragraph 4 of my previous memorandum (C.C. (52) 419) that, on a long view, the risks attendant on NunnMay&apos;s release are likely to be less if he is released in the normal course than if the exceptional course of detaining him until the end of his sentence were taken. Iunderstand that those who have seen him in prison, although they cannot speak with certainty of his present beliefs or state of mind, have formed the impression that, if suitable work could be found for him, he would probably settle down quietlyin England and would not seek to leave this country and put his services at thedisposal of any foreign Power. He is not married and I understand that he intends to stay with his brother on his release. Special efforts would be made to find himappropriate employment and I am advised that there are several fields in which itmay be possible to do so without prejudice to security. If, however, he were detained for the full ten years he would be likely to have a considerable sense of grievancewhen he was eventually discharged, and would be less likely to remain in this country as a law-abiding citizen.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W. I,10th December, 1952.APPENDIX1. The Criminal Justice Act, 1948. abolished the old ticket-of-leave systemwhen penal servitude was abolished and there is now no power to release NunnMay on licence.2. I have considered whether any other way of releasing him subject to conditions can be found. The conditions would presumably be (a) that he shouldnot leave Great Britain (or the United Kingdom) and (b) that if he attempted to doso he should be liable to recall to prison to complete his sentence.Copy No. p43355
3.   I have examined two possible methods:  (a) Release on parole under Rule 84a of the Prison Rules. This is open toobvious objections of principle and law:  (i) Section 47 (5) of the Prison Act, 1952, which replaces the rule-making power in the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, provides thatRules &quot; may provide for the temporary release of persons servinga sentence of imprisonment &quot; and the Rule provides that a prisoner may &quot; be temporarily absent from prison on parole fora stated length of time.&quot;(ii) Thus the statutory provisions clearly contemplate that the prisonershould return to prison after a period of parole and it would be inconsistent with their obvious intention to release a prisoner onparole for the whole of the unexpired term of his sentence.(iii) I have considered whether it would be possible to free him for anumber of successive &quot; stated lengths of time &quot; (say, six months)on these conditions. For such a course to be of any value itwould, however, have to be made clear to Nunn May that if hekept the conditions he would be free for the remainder of hissentence. This makes such a course highly artificial even if itwere legally valid.(b) Conditional pardon.- This proposal is also open to grave objections:(i) In the eyes of the man in the street such a course would involve the queen in giving special treatment to a traitor.(ii) To use a conditional pardon to impose conditions on the releaseof a prisoner who has earned the ordinary remission on hissentence is a subterfuge to reintroduce the ticket-of-leave system which Parliament has abolished.&apos;(iii) It would be wrong to use the Prerogative of Mercy not to amelioratea prisoners lot but to make him worse off than other prisoners in a similar position.(iv) The main use of Conditional Pardons is to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment. This practice is governed by statute. There is a common law power to attach any other conditions to the grant of a pardon in other cases, but it has very seldom been used, and generally only to substitute one formof sentence for another, e.g., detention in an approved schoolfor detention in a Borstal institution, or a fine for imprisonment.No use has ever been made of this power to impose a condition which did not at the same time confer a benefit on the prisoner.(v) Where there is no statutory sanction for the grant of a ConditionalPardon, the condition must not only be reasonable and capableof performance by the prisoner, but must also be accepted byhim.(vi) If Nunn May accepted the condition, and was released, but subse-quently broke the condition, it might be difficult to enforce it.If such a condition is broken, the Pardon ceases to have anyeffect, and the position quo ante revives. There have been a few cases where this view has been acted on, e.g., one where a youngman broke a condition that he should go to a training school and remain there until the end of his sentence and the police were then asked to arrest him and he was returned to a Borstalinstitution to complete his original sentence. If a ConditionalPardon were granted to Nunn May, it might afford sufficientauthority to instruct the police at all ports to arrest him if heattempted to leave the country. But if he were arrested and returned to prison in these circumstances, the action taken wouldbe likely to arouse very strong criticism.
