I217(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MATESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET ,, ;&amp;.G.(52) 450 COPY NO,19th DECEMBER, 1952.CABINETSAUDI ARABIAN FRONTIER dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs.In my memoranda C. (52) 383 of 4th November and C. (52) 417 of21st November, I informed my colleagues of our offer of arbitration on theFrontier Dispute with the Saudi Arabian Government.   In a note dated 6th Decemberthe Saudis have virtually rejected-this offer.   As the proposal of arbitrationhas considerable merit, both intrinsically and from the point of view ofinternational opinion it will be prudent to press them again, particularly as there are indications that the United States Administration will now give uspositive support.   It is probable, however, that the Saudis will eventually rejectour offer finally, and we shall ultimately be compelledto enter into some formof bilateral negotiations.   This raises in an acute form the question of how farwe are ultimately prepared to go in defending our great interests in the Gulf,,and compels us to reconsider possible lines of action,,2.     Factors involved(a)   British interests in the GulfThe Western shore of the Persian Gulf, excluding   the Saudi province of Hasa, is divided into a small number of Arab States for whose defence andforeign relations Britain is responsible:  Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the TrucialSheikdoms, viz. Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Qaiwain, Ras AlKhaimah, Fujairah.   An exception is the Sultanate of Muscat, with which, however,Britain has long standing ties0   This area is important to the United Kingdomboth economically for its increasing oil supplies and strategically as a gatewayfrom the north to the Indian Ocean and the Middle East.   Kuwait, Bahrain andQatar draw large revenues from oil.   The unexploited oil areas of politicallybackward Muscat and Abu Dhabi are considered highly promisingc   Moreover, theBritish political position in the Gulf has long been a symbol of British power.Events in Persia have been a stunning blow to British prestige and any further reduction of our influence in the Gulf would cause the Rulers of Kuwait., Bahrainand Qatar to re-assess the value of the British connection.(b)   The weakness of the Trucial SheikdomsThe extent to which the Trucial Sheikdoms and the Sultanate of Muscatswith their limitedpopulation  (total well under one million) can be built uppolitically, economically and militarily is extremely limited.   None of them isyet producing oil:  but some receive small &quot;dead rents&quot; from oil companies in respect of unexploited concessions.   Even with very extensive assistance bothin terms of money and manpower, these States singly or in combination are unlikely to be an effective barrier to Saudi aggression.   It is extremely doubtful
how far they could maintain their independent existence against their largerneighbours without outside helpe   Although in the past it would have been within our power to defend these States against all aggression (relying on Indian forces)it is unfortunately no longer true that we can afford them protection against aggression from outside the Middle East area and now the power of Saudi Arabiais for the first time a significant threat.     This creates a new problem for us inftilfilling our obligations towards these States,(c)     The American position the Americans have a predominant position in Saudi Arabia,   The onlyoil company operating within Saudi territory is 100 per cent. American,   Thereis also a United States Air Force base at Dhahran.   The Americans have maintained their position principally by yielding constantly to Saudi pressure and keeping the Saudis friendly at almost any cost.   They argue that a friendly Saudi Arabiawill ensure the supply of oil and provide a valuable base for the West in thecase of war.   The United States Administration has been unwilling to take a firmline with the Saudi Arabian Government in any controversial issue and wouldnot seem to consider the absorption of part of what we regard as the territory of the Trucial Sheikdoms or Muscat as detrimental either to American or to western interests.   It should also be noted that 50 per cent, of the oil produced in the British Protected States of the Persian Gulf is owned by american companies which are at present well disposed towards our influence.(d) The new importance of Saudi ArabiaUntil 1947 the British position in the Gulf depended principally upon our power based on the availability of the Indian army, and to a very minorextent on the goodwill of Ibn Saud.   Since 1947, the date of the withdrawal from india, our position has become for the first time to a large degree dependent onthe continued goodwill of the neighbouring States and particularly of Saudi Arabiawhich, in the last decade, has acquired significant wealth and power.   Thus,for the first time in the history of the Persian Gulf, our relations with Saudi Arabiabecome a matter of first importance.(e) The Threat of Saudi Arabian AmbitionsSaudi Arabia, with its annual income of $260,000,000 and its militarytarget for 1956 of an army of 17,000 men, an air force including fighters and aminiature navy may shortly become a power to be reckoned with.   At no fardistant date its forces may well outweigh the forces which we can convenientlyhold in th:; area to counter-balance it.   The domination of the maximum possiblearea of the Arabian peninsula is the undoubted ambition of many elements in the saudi Arabian Government.   This ambition may well constitute a direct threat to our position.   We are at present sheltered to a certain extent from this threatby Ibn Saud&apos;s genuine respect and friendship for us but this is largely overshadowedby his exaggerated ideas of his ancestral claims,(f) The immediate obstacles to the establishment of good relations withIbn Saud(i) All the British protected States and Muscat have frontier disputes,dormant or active, with Ibn Saud.   The disputes with Kuwait and Bahrain aredormant.   Those with the Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Muscat are acute, and settlement .is an urgent necessity.   At any time the dormant disputes could become thesubject of sharp differences.(ii) An obstacle to good relations between the United Kingdom andIbn Saud is the complete lack of any material bonds between the two countries.
Ibn Saud was once utterly dependent on us for money, arms and internationalprotection.   Today he obtains all these benefits from his new friends in theUnited States,   Ibn Saud is now in no way beholden to us, and it is our influencealone that stands in the way of his absorption of his less powerful neighbours,3,     Courses open(A)    A firm line with Ibn SaudFrom the point of view of our political and economic interests the bestpolicy towards Saudi Arabia would be to take a firm line with the SaudiGovernment and stand by our obligations to our clients,   Saudi Arabianencroachment at Presert threatens in particular Abu Dhabi and Muscat and to a lesser degree Qatar where frontiers have never been clearly defined:  but itmay eventually spread to other States also.   Under this policy we should beprepared ultimately to defend a frontier line which took account of what we consider to be the justifiable claims of our friends.   Such a line would be unacceptable toIbn Saud,   This policy would involve(a) the use of British land, air and sea forces;(b) considerable expenditure of money by Her Majesty1 s Government and the interested sterling oil companies in tribal subsidies;  and(c) the equipment at Her Majesty&apos;s Governments expense of increasedlocal forces.(i) Advantages of this policy.(a) It would be of important prestige value both in the Gulf and the Middle Eastgenerally and have a tonic effect on our friends.(b) It would retain for sterling oil companies highly prospective oil areas.(c) It would maintain our position in an important strategic area,(ii) Disadvantages of this policy.(a) It would involve serious expenditure of money and manpower in a widecommitment.(b) It would be damaging to Anglo-Saudi relations with possibly harmfulresults on Araglo-Arab relations.(c) It would be unpopular with the Americans and might also involve us inthe United Nations,This policy, once adopted, would have to be sustained,,   To abandon it in the face of Saudi counters-pressure would gravely damage our prestige in the area and thewhole Middle East.(B)  Settlement with Ibn Saud involving substantial concessionsIf it is impossible to assign the resources to the defence of the Gulfnecessary for the adoption of the policy in paragraph 3A above it will be necessaryto adjust our policy realistically.   We must enter negotiations with Ibn Saudwith a clear knowledge of what resources will be available to us in the last resortfor the defence of the maximum position which we regard as tenable in the absenceof a more advantageous settlement with Ibn Saud, and we may have to accept a
X10settlement at a cost in terms of territory and prestige which we have not previously contemplated.At the request of the Foreign Office the Chiefs of Staff are at presentcarrying out an urgent examination of the problem of defence resources availablefor this area.   When the results of this examination are available, ministers will be in a position to decide which of the courses referred to above to adopt.Interim measures for strengthening our position.(a)  In the meantime there is an urgent need for some strengthening.of ourposition, both to fortify ourselves against the possibility of a sudden thrust byIbn Saud and to counter the subversive activities of Turki, the Saudi official whohas wrongfully established himself in what we regard as Muscat territory at Bur-aimi among the Muscat and Abu Dhabi tribes.    I have already authorised:(i) the expenditure of certain sums by the Political Resident tostiffen our rulers and the tribes.   This expenditure will be supplemented bypayments made by the Iraq Petroleum Company in concert with the political resident.(ii) An immediate increase in the locally recruited Trucial Omanlevies up to a total of 130 men.   This small force, although extremely useful,is primitive In character and equipment, and is incapable of rapid expansion,(b) I consider that these steps should be supplemented at the earliest possible moment by the despatch of certain units of Her Majesty^ Forces.   preliminary discussion with the Chiefs of Staff has shown that the following can be madeavailable:(i) Flights of two Royal Air Force Armoured Cars (12 cars) from Iraq.(ii) Up to one squadron of Royal Air Force Fighters from Iraq.(iii) H.M.S. Ceylon from East Indies Station, as well as the two frigatesof the Persian Gulf Division,   Marines or seamen from these ships could land at Sharjah or Dubai.To bring about a concentration of this sort would require about a month.   If these forces are, in fact, moved to the area it would be desirable at the same time toencourage the Sultan of Muscat to move a limited number of his armed men intoCentral Oman.   The Sultan is, however, in an extremely hesitant mood and mightnot respond to this suggestion.(c) There is no doubt a risk in moving the forces mentioned above into theTrucial Sheikdoms before we have decided whether we can if necessary follow upsuch moves,   A sharp reaction from Ibn Saud such as the occupation of disputedterritory in Abu Dhabi might put us in some difficulty.   Nevertheless,, I feelthere is no alternative.   We are under an obligation to defend the TrucialSheikdoms.   We have great potential economic interests in these areas.   a failure to attempt to defend them would be inexcusable.5. Re commendationsI invite my colleagues:(a)  to agree to a renewal of the offer of arbitration to Ibn Saudwith the maximum United States support obtainable;
to agree to the movement of the forces in paragraph 4(b) above tothe Trucial Sheikdoms as soon as possible as an interimstiffening measure;to agree to an approach to the Sultan of Muscat to movesome of his forces into the Central Oman, this move to be synchronised with the arrival of our forcesin the Trucial Sheikdoms;to invite the Minister of Defence to report at the earliestpossible moment on the military measures which couldbe taken to maintain our position in the long term.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.19th December, 1952,
