(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 40312th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETTHE CORONATION:  ALLOCATION OF SEATS in westminster ABBEYMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorCOPY NO.     vAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 11th November I was invitedwith the Commonwealth Secretary, the Lord Privy Seal, the Minister of works and the Chief Whip to consider the Earl Marshal&apos;s request for an early decision about the allocation of seats in the Abbey to peers and peeresses and members of the House of Commons and their wives.   (C.C.(52) 95thConclusions, Minute 1).Our recommendations are as follows:-Both Houses of Parliament are being asked to accept fewer seatsthan were allocated to them in 1937 in order to accommodate the greatlyincreased number of representatives of the Commonwealth and Empire from overseas.   The figures proposed by the Earl Marshal, i. e, 880 seats for peers and peeresses and 650 seats for members of the House of Commons andtheir wives give proportionately a great advantage to the Commons over the LordsThere are approximately 736 peers entitled to sit in the House of Lords(although the total peerage including minors, peeresses in their own right,Irish and Scottish peers, etc,,is 936).   There are 625 members of the Houseof Commons,   The Earl Marshal, however, proposes that the 76 PrivyCouncillors in the House of Commons and their wives should be separatelyinvited, but that the 120 Privy Councillors who are peers should not.   Thisbrings the total number of seats to be allotted to the Commons to approximately760 as compared with 880 to the Lords.We consider that by making reductions in the allotment to the armed Forces, the Civil and Foreign Services, the attaches on the ForeignOffice list and Westminster schoolboys, a further 70 seats could be foundwhich should be allotted between the two Houses in the proportion of 40 to the commons and 30 to the Lords, bringing the total allotment to 800 to the commons and 910 to the Lords.   This represents a reduction from the 1937 figures of30 for the Commons and 235 for the Lords.   The allotment which we proposemight make it unnecessary to hold a ballot in the Commons, but a ballotwill be necessary in the Lords, which should be the subject of negotiation between the Leader of the House and the Leaders of the Opposition.   The lord privy Seal and theChief Whip agree to this as a possible allocation, but they feel that it is most important to avoid a ballot in the House of Commons ifpossible and therefore suggest that Members be canvassed privately to ascertaintheir preference as between 2 seats in the Abbey and 2 or 4 seats outside.It is considered that, a reasonably accurate picture could be obtained by, say,Tuesday, 25th November.Simonds.Lord Chancellor^ Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1952.
