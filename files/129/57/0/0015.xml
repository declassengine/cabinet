CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 41518th November, 1952CABINETMARRIED QUARTERS FOR THE UNITED STATES forces memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the United States Armed Forces here and in other European countries are having difficulty because of the scarcity of married quarters and the consequentdiscontent of their men who cannot bring their families over. They have noappropriations from which to build married quarters, but their men are entitled to high lodging allowances arid the Defence Department has the power to guaranteerents. The Defence Department have just sent Mr. Thomas Coogan, Directorof the Armed Forces Housing Agency, on a mission to Europe to work out schemes(which will require the approval of Congressional Committees) for the provisionof houses with local finance, labour and materials, which would then be rentedunder guarantee for five years (the longest period which they have power to guarantee), at a high rent, with an option to the Americans to renew.!. 2. Mr. Coogan has just visited this country and has interviewed officials ofthe Departments concerned; Some attention has been paid in the press to hisdoings in Paris, whence he had just come, and there is a natural suspicion that what he proposes will get in the way of our own housing programme. It is most important to handle the scheme rightly, and Mr. Coogan has been persuaded not to say anything which might make things more difficult. I think that we can work out a scheme which will do little or no harm to our housing interests, and that we candeal with the obvious political difficulties of doing anything at all.3. If we possibly can, we obviously ought to help. The results of refusing to co-operate with the Americans might, I think, be serious. Furthermore, it wouldbe financially advantageous to us. The scheme which I describe below would cost about  1-5 millions for timber to be imported, from non-sterling sources, but would bring in directly by way of rent about $6 millions a year for a minimum of five years. Moreover, the families who would come to live in the married quarters might spend up to $10 millions a year while they were here.4. The scheme which I have in mind, and which has been discussed withMr. Coogan, is as follows.5. There would be no question of permanent housing being used (whichreally would interfere with the domestic programme). It is the intention of theUnited States Government to invite one or more British private companies toobtain sites within an agreed radius of United States airfields and to erect on themprefabricated timber houses which could be dismantled and used again when theywere no longer needed there. There is no question of any financial support for thescheme from Her Majesty&apos;s Government out of public funds: the companies concerned would make their own arrangements for financing the capital cost onthe strength of their agreement with the Americans. The company or companies would manage the estates and the rents would be guaranteed at up to $125 a month,inclusive of certain services, for at least five years. They would aim at up to5,000 structures, at least for the first stage: some more might follow later. At firstthey would be mainly in East Anglia and Oxfordshire, but there would be 200 to300 in Scotland. The Americans would have an option to renew after five years,43241. . . , Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952
which might be linked with the provision that the structures would belong to themafter a given number of years, when the capital investment had been completelyamortised. They would consult us about the type of temporary married quartersto be built and where they should go. We, in our turn, would help the contractorswith their negotiations with the Local Planning, Housing, Water and SewerageAuthorities and the various Ministries concerned. The aim would be to use thekind of structures which would make least demand on our resources. The scheme would call for a fair use of capital resources (a rough estimate of the total costis  11 millions, including furnishings), but it would conflict far less than any otherscheme with our domestic building programme. Timber houses are in production for export already and can be delivered quickly. They do not compete with defence work and the industry has ample capacity, tools and labour. Little ordinarybuilding labour is required. These structures would be placed as far as possible on land intended for housing but not required for development in the next fiveyears. Where that was impracticable they would have to go on additional sitesselected by the Planning Authorities. If the contractors are unable to get the landthey need by agreement, they may ask the Government to exercise powers of compulsory acquisition. This would raise difficult problems, but I should hopethat the issue will not arise. There may be areas where the existing water supplies and sewerage disposal facilities are inadequate and incapable of rapid expansion and emergency arrangements may have to be made.6. This removes the whole thing from the sphere of ordinary housing.Mr. Coogan has been asked, in order to mark the difference, never to refer to thescheme as housing at all: we shall call these &quot;temporary married quarters.&quot; Ibelieve the scheme would be manageable and I am quite sure that it would be highly advantageous. I suggest that it should go forward under the sponsorshipof the Secretary of State for Air, with assistance from the Treasury, Ministry of housing and Local Government, Department of Health for Scotland and Ministryof Works, as necessary.7.   I invite my colleagues to agree that (1) a scheme should be worked out with the United States Government, onthe lines set out in paragraph 5, to provide about 5,000 prefabricatedtemporary houses for members of the United States Forces and their-families; and(2) the arrangements should go forward under the sponsorship of the Secretaryof State for Air.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,18th November, 1952.
