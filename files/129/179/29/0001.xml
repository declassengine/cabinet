UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 11929 October 1974CABINETTHE SIMONSTOWN agreement memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsTHE SIMONSTOWN agreement. We have recognised and stated publicly that the Defence Reviewmight have implications for the Simonstown Agreement.    In my speech atCardiff at the weekend I said that if there were an important Britishsecurity interest in maintaining the Agreement then we must do so but thatif we were maintaining an Agreement that was politically damaging (as it is)but only militarily marginally useful it should be brought to an end orallowed to wither,    I added specifically that we would be looking at theAgreement.2.        We are about to make decisions on the Defence Review affectingdeployment East of Suez which will mean that the Simonstown facilities are much less important to us, certainly in peace time, than they havebeen hitherto.    On the assumption that we do so decide, the way is open for us to make an early decision about the future of the simonstown agreement.THE PRESENT POSITION3,        The Simonstown Agreement, which consists of letters and memoranda exchanged between the British and South African governments in 1955, remains in force ^until such time as the two Governments decideotherwise by mutual agreement&quot;.    Relevant extracts bearing on( purobligations to undertake joint training and to provide courses and certain other facilities are attached at Annex.    We have said in Parliament thatthe South Africans would be consulted if the Agreement were to be affectedby the Defence Review.COPY NO791
4. The issue is I think now fairly straightforward.    Our Party-programme in 1973 said we should &quot;withdraw from all relationshipsresulting from the Simonstown &quot;Agreements&quot; and all military exchanges,visits and technical arrangements will be terminated&quot;.    We did not enterinto any specific commitments in our manifestos of February and september this year but in the February manifesto we undertook &quot;adisengagement from Britain^ unhealthy involvement with apartheid&quot;,,Reaction to the recent visits and the measure of naval co-operation thatwent with them, however explicable on grounds of operational necessity,merely stressed the trouble this Agreement has caused us for what lookslike being a marginal benefit.;: W0 .;-&apos; &apos;l&apos; ,, W;0lkALTERNATIVE COURSES5. One course of action would be to make an announcement as soon aspossible that we intend to abrogate the Agreement.    The Agreement itselfhowever does not provide for unilateral abrogation and, as supporters ofthe rule of law and of respect for treaties, we do not want to appear to actillegally.    A unilateral gesture would also add to the antagonism of theSouth Africans and we would risk jeopardising our trade and other material interests.    We know from their aide memoire earlier this summer the importance that South Africa attaches to the Agreement.    Itwas at that time that we had evidence that any failure to continue to meet our obligations under Simon stown could affect the prospects for british firms competing in the public sector,6. The alternative is to enter into negotiations with the South Africanswith a view to ending the Agreement in an orderly way.    That of coursewould minimise the risk to our relations but there is no guarantee that theSouth Africans would agree and at the end of the day we might face theprospect of having to announce that having attempted in good faith butunsuccessfully to negotiate the termination of the Agreement we felt boundto regard the Agreement as at an end.    This would lead to acrimony anddisadvantage in the commercial and other fields, but may be unavoidable.7.        A possible further course if the Agreement is still thought to have some military value for us, eg. in wartime, would be simply to allow theAgreement to wither by reducing, in consultation and agreement with theSouth African Government, the extent to which we make use of the,facilities.    That in itself would bring us little political advantage but wecould at least announce publicly that we should not allow any furtherextensive exercises though we might have to accept some degree of jointtraining on some occasions in order to keep within our legal obligations under the Agreement;.2
TIMING8.        In about ten days1 time we shall be embarking upon consultations with the Americans about the Defence Review,,    We know they attach importance to our contribution to the Western presence in the indian ocean area, modest though it is, and to pre-empt our consultations byannouncing shortly beforehand a decision to withdraw from the simonstown Agreement would make the rest of our task more difficult.CONCLUSION u10.        I favour the course set out in paragraph 6, namely to end theAgreement in an orderly way.    But we cannot reach a final conclusionuntil we have had a military assessment from the Secretary of State for defence.    I recommend we proceed as follows:-a. Ask for the view of the Secretary of State for defence on the military consequences of closing Simonstown and thealternative facilities that will be required.b. Consider with the Ambassador at Capetown the best wayof reducing the risk of South African -retaliation.c. Have talks with the United States.d. Announce our conclusions in the context of the statement that will be made on the Defence Review, or when a statement on the completion of the Review of policy towards Southern africa is made.LJCForeign and Commonwealth OfficeMS-.29 October 19743

14.    It is agreed in principle that exchanges of officers andratings between the two navies would be of advantage to bothnavies and should take place whenever practicable.

The replacement of personnel from the United Kingdom employedin the base by South African personnel must, it is agreed, be governed by the need to ensure that the efficiency of the base ismaintained.
