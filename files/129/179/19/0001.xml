ANNEXGENERAL . ,1.     At a General Election the Government of the day is expected tovindicate its policies to the electorate, and by convention the GovernmentParty is entitled to ensure that statements made on its behalf are -factually correct and consistent with Government policy.   The provision of rapid advice to Government candidates is madeithrough,the medium of an election Business Committee of the Oabinet,   Government Departments, however,must not appear to engage in Party politics or be used for Party ends; andshould provide consistent factual information on request to candidates ofdifferent Parties, organisations and members of the-public.   It is desirablethat Departments should, so far as possible, follow a common procedure in replying to enquiries and requests for information; and the Election business committee supervises these aspects also.2.     The circumstances of an Election demand the greatest speed in dealingwith enquiries; in particular, the aim should be to answer ^hose for parliamentary candidates within the day.FACTUAL DEFORMATION3.     a8     Departments should provide any Parliamentary candidate, organisation or member of the public with purely factual information which -.i0     Is not classified,,ii.   Does not require disproportionate time or effort to produce-(of the guidelines for answering Parliamentary Questions),b.     Local and Regional Offices should deal similarly with straight-forward enquiries to them, referring doubtful cases to Headquarters for- decision. -. // .. .   &apos; 1confidentialELECTION BUSINESS COMMITTEE
2REQUESTS FOR COMMENT OR GUIDAITCE4*.    a.    Prom Labour Party Headquarters.   Labour candidates and their agentsare expected to look to the Party Headquarters who will collate requests-   and prepare draft replies.   In appropriate cases the drafts will be forwarded to the Secretary of the Election Business Committee, who will obtain the comments of the Ministers concerned, and will if necessarysubmit final drafts of replies for the Committee^ approval.   The PartyHeadquarters will be responsible for passing on the necessary guidance to candidates.b. From Labour candidates or their agents direct to Departments.   these should be referred, through the Private Office of the responsible minister)&apos;&apos;to the Secretary of the Election Business Committee.   Theyshould be accompanied by the Minister1 s advice on whether they should beconsidered by the Committee, and on the terms of a reply.c. Prom Opposition candidates, organisations and members of the public.These should be answered by the responsible Minister or his private secretary -1.    Direct, in cases where the Governments policy is woll. established and widely known.ii.   In other cases, following clearance with the Election Business&apos; Committee via the Secretariat.In either Casey two copies of the eventual reply should be sent to theSecretary of the Committee.POLICY STATEMENTS5.     a.    If an enquiry addressed to a Department from any quarter appears tocall for an important statement of policy, the Minister concerned may decide to seek the guidance of the Election Business Committee; and inany case it would be advisable to inform the Secretary of the Committeeof the enquiry and the terms of the response.
3.b.     If a Minister wishes to suggest a topic, where no issue of policyis concerned, on which guidance should be given to Labour candidates^ thesuggestion should be sent to the Party Headquarters, who will preparefirst drafts and foreard them to the Secretary of the Election business committee.CONSTITUENCY C0RRESP0HDE1TCE6.    During the Election period replies to constituency letters received from members of Parliament before the Dissolution, or to similar letters fromParliamentary candidates, should take into account that they may become public knowledge and the subject of political comment.   They should be handledwherever possible under Ministerial guidance.   In some cases it may not be appropriate for Ministers to reply personally to such letters until the resultof the Election is known; in cases where the facts do not admit of delay a reply should normally be sent by the Private Secretary.7.    While it is impossible to cover every contingency or lay down hard andfast rules the following observations may be of help.a. Once Parliament is dissolved, a Member of Parliament1s constitutionalright to represent his constituent&apos;s grievances to Government&apos;disappearsalso, and all candidates for an election are strictly speaking on an equal footing.   But this doctrine should be applied in a reasonable way0Subject to the points made in paragraph 6 above Ministers ought to replyto constituency letters from MPs written before the Dissolution.   In manycases it will be courteous for them to reply to letters written afterthe Dissolution by former Members: but they will not want to give any&apos;appearance of discrimination on constituency correspondence as betweenletters-from Labour and other candidates.   In some cases however aII     Private Secretary reply may be more appropriate.b. Clearly the main consideration must be to ensure that the citizen&apos;interests ace not prejudiced! but&apos; Departments should also bear in mind -/ i.     There may be indications that some personal case is likely tobe politically controversial - eg two candidates may write in about it, or there may be local publicity.   There is little one can do
except keep a wary eye for trouble and ensure so far as possiblethat letters are simple, straightforward and give no room formisrepresentation.   They should not be delayed because they may bedifficult provided they do not raise issues of policy.ii.   Privilege covering correspondence between Ministers and MPslapses on the Dissolution.   Care should be taken in dealing with cases about individuals that letters to former MPs do not containj    remarks^ that could be represented as defamatory.c.    Letters from former MPs or candidates asking for comment on mattersof policy raised by their constituents should be handled in accordancewith paragraph 4 above.d.     It will obviously become more difficult for Ministers to deal with individual cases as Polling Day approaches.   If possible departments should try to clear correspondence outstanding from before the dissolution by 1 October.18 September 1974
