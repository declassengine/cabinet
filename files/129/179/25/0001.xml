DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 115 COPY NO 7928 October 1974CABINETINTERNATIONAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT (INDUSTRIAL) LTDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Secretary of State for Industry proposes to make a grant of 3. 9 million to enable the convenors of International Property Development(Industrial) Ltd (IPD) to acquire the business from the Receiver and run itas a workers&apos; co-operative.2.        When the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Development consideredthe matter, they were informed that officials had estimated the minimumneeded as  4.8 million, ie the convenors1 bid for  3.9 million plus 0.85 million for extra working capital and adds to this perhaps  2 million to purchase the factory, and a near certainty of further substantial amounts of capital for future investment and modernisation.    The chances of the enterprise succeeding then are still rated as slim, even if the convenorswere also to reduce the present 50 per cent overmanning, cut out theunprofitable part of the business, and acquire suitable management - none of which, it seems, they are at present prepared, or able, to do.   Failurewould apparently mean pressure by creditors on the Government to pay all outstanding debts, after realisation of the assets.3.        The Secretary of State rejects his officials appraisal on grounds that the business will be a workers&apos; co-operative where the workers havethe will to succeed.    I am in favour of workers1 co-operatives, but this isnot one in the proper sense, which requires workers to put up a substantial part of the equity capital themselves.    I applaud their will to succeed, butwe shall do the cause which the Secretary of State for Industry seeks topromote no service at all by supporting projects which are not based on soundeconomics.    I recognise that male unemployment in the area stands at   per cent: but I am much perturbed at the precedent that support of anunviable enterprise on ihese grounds alone would establish in our present economic circumstances.    The cost per job criterion, which we apply to assistance for job creation in the regions, is met solely because thecompany is overmanned.1
4.        If we agree to support IPD Industrial, there can be no limit to thedemands we should face for public aid to insolvent companies, andlogically there would be no economic criteria that we could ever againapply in assessing them.    Industry will draw the lesson that theuneompetitive need no longer fear the consequences of failure: there is asafety net ready to catch them as they fall.    The view expressed by thePrime Minister this summer that &quot;contrived state assistance could leadto a public scandal&quot; seems to me to apply no less since the firm has gone into Receivership.D treasury Chambers28 October 1974P-.2
