DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 116 COPY NO    3228 October 1974CABINETDEFENCE review memorandum by the Prime Minister1. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee have completed the irreview of our defence commitments and capabilities, with the aim of determining the minimum essential level of our defences and the maximumsavings on the defence budget,2.        In recent years the defence budget has been subjected to a numberof unplanned cuts which have been damaging to the efficiency and morale ofthe armed forces and economically wasteful.    Yet they have still leftdefence expenditure far too high in terms of what we can afford.    Astringent approach to defence expenditure, enabling us to get the best value for the money we spend, requires a planned programme over a number ofyears: and the Committee have concluded that we should make;majorreductions over a period of 10 years.3.        In 1973-74 defence cost 5f per cent of GNP.    Cuts of nearly 350 million (1974 prices) imposed by our predecessors or forced upon usin the aftermath of the three-day week have already brought the figure downto S\ per cent of GNP for 1974-75.    Such cuts however are to some extentillusory since they have to be met partly by delaying rather thancancelling expenditure and thus build up problems for the future.    Theyhave in fact complicated our task of achieving reductions over the next twoor three years..      &apos;  - - . lh.     &apos;4.        The 1974 Long Term Costings show that to maintain and progressivelyre-equip forces of the present size would cost 6 per cent of GNP by 1978-79and over 5j per cent of GNP by 1983-84: this is because successivegenerations of equipment necessary to match the greater sophistication Ofthe equipment possessed by potential enemies inevitably cost more in real terms.    Savings can therefore only be made by reducing commitments and capabilities.    The Committee considered various models and have concluded that we can bring the figure down to 4j per cent of GNP by 1984, while maintaining a minimum essential level of defence.    In view of the distortionintroduced by the unplanned cuts of  350 million, it will not be possible toavoid a modest rise in constant price terms over the next two years, butthereafter the figures will level off as the savings from the reductions in our commitments begin to show.1
5. By comparison with the cost of the existing plans we would save 475 million a year by 1978-79 and some  750 million a year by 1983-84.This saving is fully consistent with our Manifesto.    Given the pressures on public expenditure we naturally looked at the possibility of achieving even greater cuts; but in the overall judgment of the Committee a faster run downwould jeopardise the efficiency and morale of the Services; dangerouslyundermine our ability to deal with the problem of Northern Ireland;seriously weaken the military capability of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) and the political cohesion of the West, and remove the incentive to the Russians to agree to mutual force reductions.    The cuts inour armed forces at this level will be severe and are indicated below.u&quot; ii ...NON-NATO COMMITMENTS6.        The Committee have concluded that -a. We should withdraw our forces from South East Asia exceptfor a 5-man contribution to the integrated air defence system.    if our partners in the Five Power Defence Agreement so wished wewould maintain the commitment to consult with them in the eventof aggression.b. Our involvement in Oman would be ended and our withdrawal from Masirah effected as soon as this could be done without upsettingthe delicate situation in the area which involves the interests ofSaudi Arabia and Iran. ,,c. Our force declarations to the Central Treaty Organisation(CENTO) would be ended.d. We would not renew the Defence Agreement with Malta whenit expires in 1979 and would complete the withdrawal of our forces by that date.e. In Cyprus our aim would be to withdraw our forcescompletely and give up our Sovereign Base Areas (SBAo).    The timing of complete withdrawal must have regard to the efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in the Island.    If we withdrew at the right time this could contribute towards a settlement; if we acted prematurelywe might cause further trouble between the two communities.    but even if we have to remain in the SBAs for some time, there can be//major reductions.f. A garrison would remain in Hong Kong, but it would bereduced in strength and we should, require the Hong Kong Governmentto meet a much larger share of the cost.    We would withdraw our forces from Brunei.2
g. We would withdraw our forces completely from Gan and mauritius.    To facilitate this we would however agree to theAmerican request for a modest expansion of their facilities atDiego Garcia at their own expense, under the 1966 Anglo -United States Agreement.    We would have the use of these facilities which will be helpful to us when we no longer have the use of Ganand Mauritius.    Moreover the American use of the facilities in emergency would be subject to joint decision.    We would seek their co-operation in working for a realistic scheme for arms limitationin the Indian Ocean.h. So long as the Spanish regime continues its present attitudetowards Gibraltar we must keep a garrison there and maintain the dockyard, which is critical for the Colony1 s economy,i. We must continue to contribute to the defence and securityof the Falkland Islands and Belize so long as they are subject to claims by their neighbours, but we should seek by diplomaticmeans to resolve these disputes and withdraw our forces.NATO7.        The measures recommended by the Committee would enable us toreduce our frigates/destroyers by 13 per cent, our mine counter-measures vessels by 17 per cent, conventional submarines by 25 per cent and afloat support by one-third.    The RAF Transport force would be cut by over 50 per cent, helicopters by 25 per cent, maritime patrol aircraft by 20 per cent, and the RAF Regiment Field Squadrons would be disbanded.There would be large cuts in the re-equipment plans for all three Services.For example, there would be a 25 per cent cut in planned new shipconstruction, all ship refitting would be transferred from commercialyards to the Royal Dockyards; there would be a cut of one-third in Armyre-equipment, including up to 100 helicopters; 12-15 RAF stations in theUnited Kingdom would be closed.    Taken together with the reduction inour non-NATO commitments these savings would lead to cuts of some44, 000 Servicemen and 30, 000 directly employed civilians.    Somecompulsory redundancy could not be avoided.    These savings would entail - \\a. The complete abandonment of our air and naval contribution in the Mediterranean and our commitment to reinforce the SouthernFlank of NATO.b. Reducing our commitment to reinforce the Northern Flankby about two-thirds, leaving only a Marine Commando Group andone brigade.c. Taking the maximum advantage of any NATO reductions inland forces negotiated in Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions(MBFR) (8, 000 reduction planned in the establishment of british army of the Rhine (BAOR).
d.        Reducing the home based Army by 3, 000 men (the maximumcut consistent with our Northern Ireland commitment).8.        We would continue to contribute to NATO land and air forces inGermany and to naval and air forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Channelat a level consistent with NATO strategy.    &quot;We would be able to maintainthe minimum forces necessary in the United Kingdom for home defence,including Northern Ireland, and for the reinforcement of BAOR in war.! \v\ &quot; &apos; /ill &apos;      ,, &apos;9.        The Committee concluded that we should maintain our strategic nuclear deterrent.    This is assigned to NATO and represents an insurance against the loss, temporarily or otherwise, of credibility of the UnitedStates strategic nuclear guarantee, I It would also be available for nationaluse in the event of a breakdown of NATO.    If the force is to remain acredible deterrent in the face of advances in Russian anti-missilecapability, some improvements need to be made to the missiles.    Thiswould not involve Multiple Independently-Targetted Re-entry Vehicles ora new generation of strategic weapons, and in no way would conflict withthe United States/USSR discussions on strategic arms limitations.    Thecost of the Polaris force would be less than 2 per cent of the defence budget.CONSULTATION10.       We have undertaken to consult our partners both in and outside NATObefore reaching final decisions, and are indeed under formal obligation todo so in NATO.    The attitude of the Americans and the Germans will becrucial both in our discussions in NATO.and in wider senses,, and the first step is therefore to hold very confidential bilateral discussions with them.We should like to begin these right away.    We should then be ready in thethird week of November to start the formal consultation process withinNATO, and also to tell the non-NATO Governments affected.    Immediatelyprior to this we should make a statement in Parliament of our generalintentions and the magnitude of the reductions proposed.    If we are to avoidarousing unnecessary hostility in NATO we must allow two months for theprocess of formal consultation.    We should then be able to publish a defence White Paper giving the full details.RECOMMENDATION \\11.        The Cabinet is invited to agree that we should enter into confidentialbilateral discussions with the/Americans and Germans forthwith on thebasis set out above, and that subject to any further Ministerial consideration which their reaction may make necessary, we should make a statement inParliament before beginning the NATO consultations and informing the non-NATO countries concerned.    The statement would of course be submittedto the Cabinet at the appropriate time.H W10 Downing Street28 October 19744SECRET
