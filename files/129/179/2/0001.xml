STATEMENT ON THE REPORT OF THE DEFENCELANDS COMMITTEE 1971-73INTRODUCTIONThe Defence Lands Committee was set up by the previous Government inJanuary 1971 under the chairmanship of Lord Nugent of Guildford and withthe following terms of reference:&quot;To leview the holding of land in the United Kingdom by the armed forces for Defence purposes:(a) for training areas, airfields and ranges wherever situated;(b) for any purpose in National Parks and Areas of OutstandingNatural Beauty; and(c) along the coastline for purposes other than dockyards and portinstallations.\\ / /Taking account of the long term needs of the Armed Forces and theiroperational efficiency, and of cost and other relevant considerations, tomake recommendations to the Secretary of State for Defence ^s to what changes should be made in these holdings and in improved access for thepublic, having regard to recreation, amenity or other uses which might bemade of the land&quot;.2. The Committee&apos;s Report was published in July 1973 together with an explanatory memorandum (Cmnd. 5364). In the memorandum it was statedthat the Report would be considered and decisions on its recommendationsannounced in due course. The previous Government did not in the eventannounce any such decisions. This is the purpose of this White Paper.3. The countryside is steadily shrinking as the towns creep outwards and land is taken for housing and for industry; at the same time, there is increasingrecognition of the need to preserve and improve the environment and increasing demands from the public for access to those beautiful areas of the Countrysidethat form part of our national heritage. There is also a need for greater provisionfor leisure activities and in particular for large areas for some of the moreadventurous sports which are growing in popularity. In this situation it is right that the Armed Forces, who use large areas of our countryside and coast-line, should be asked rigorously to account for these holdings. But there arefactors at work which make it difficult for the Services to release land andwhich, indeed, give rise to legitimate demands for more land. The principalones are the need for greater space to test and train on new weapons.with greater range and greater mobility and to replace training areas lost to us aswe reduce our world-wide commitments. And the very factors of remotenessand freedom from human interference that make areas ones of great naturalbeauty, also make them suitable for the Armed Forces, who need space and freedom to carry out their activities. There is no easy way out of this dilemma.Public interest demands both that the Armed Forces should be properly trained and equipped and that they should take up as little land as possible for theirpurposes.
THE NUGENT report. The Report of the Defence Lands Committee is divided into two parts.Part I contains twenty-six general recommendations which are directed primarily to questions of environmental protection, amenities, public access and estate management. Part n contains recommendations on the 465 individual sitescovered in the review.General Recommendations5. One general recommendation is that the number of major airfields usedfor Research and Development should be reduced from three to two. With theforthcoming closure of Pershore (of which the Nugent Committee were aware)the three remaining R&amp;D airfields will be at Farnborough, Bedford andBoscombe Down. Unless there is a major change in R &amp; D flying activities,there is little prospect of any further reduction.6. The remaining twenty-five general recommendations are directed to improving the degree of consultation between the Ministry of Defence and other bodies concerned with planning, environmental improvements, access to defencesites, reduction of noise, etc. In considering these recommendations, a balancehas to be struck between the requirements of the Armed Forces and the pressingneeds to protect the environment and to provide more opportunities for thegeneral public to enjoy the many beautiful areas of the country. Several of therecommendations have already been put into practice. Ministry of Defenceofficials are present at some meetings of the planning authorities in the SouthEast (Recommendation 3) and at meetings of the Noise Advisory Council(Recommendation 19). A senior officer represents the Ministry of Defence onthe Sports Council so that Council can be aware of what use can be made ofService sports facilities (Recommendation 8). A conservation officer has beenappointed (Recommendation 20). The Government is able to accept all these general recommendations in principle. Indeed, in the case of Recommendation 4,which relates to possible extensions of defence activity in special areas, we areprepared to go further by extending the consultation processes which are thesubject of that recommendation to cover proposals for intensification of theuse of defence sites in those areas which would significantly affect amenity or public access. In the present situation of financial stringency it is not, in general,possible to make special additional funds available as the Nugent Committeehoped. However, the Government will make every effort to ensure, in con-sultation with the planning authorities, that surplus defence sites do not remain as eyesores to the detriment of local amenity.Individual Site recommendations. The 465 individual sites have been considered on the basis that everyrecommendation for the release of land or improved access should be agreedunless serious damage to the needs of the Armed Forces could be clearly shown.The Government has decided to accept almost all the individual recommenda-tions. The exceptions are listed later on. We believe that this decision will have very considerable value to those most closely involved and it brings to an end the long period of uncertainty since the Nugent Report was published.Arrangements for the release of land and improvements of access will now bemade subject to the economic constraints mentioned above.
8. The following are a few examples of areas which will as a result become available for public use:Wormwood Scrubs Greater LondonRights over ten acres will be relinquished so that Hammersmith council may go ahead with plans for a neighbourhood park. Discussions havealready been held with the Greater London Council to see whether afurther reduction in the Army&apos;s use of the open common land on WormwoodScrubs can be made so that more recreational amenities for the general public may be provided.Barry Buddon Angus125 acres will be released for the development of a golf course.Thorney Island-Sussex \\132 acres of agricultural land and 905 acres of mud flats and saltingswill be released. The Nugent Committee considered that this release would^ be of benefit to the local authorities in planning for conservation and\\ development of local recreational facilities.The Wrekin ShropshireA Ministry of Defence range over an area-of 78 acres will, be given upas soon as alternative provision at Nesscliff can be made. Part of TheWrekin range is within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding NaturalBeauty and includes a Site of Special Scientific Interest.9. There are three particular site recommendations in the Nugent Repoitwhich have given rise to wide public interest and which were the subject ofnumerous representations to the Nugent Committee. They are the proposal tomove certain facilities from Shoeburyness to Tain, the proposal to remove theRAC Gunnery School from Lulworth to castle martin and recommendationsrelating to Service use of Dartmoor.The Proposal to move the Proof and Experimental Facilities from Shoeburynessto Tain (Pages 167-170 of the Report)10. This recommendation is dependent on whether there is to be a seaportat Maplin. This is being urgently studied, but until it is finally settled no decision can be taken whether and, if so, where, the P &amp; E and some other facilities at Shoeburyness or part of them will need to be relocated. As the NugentCommittee recognised, the relocation of these facilities presents a difficult problem. If in the event relocation is necessary, particular account will be taken of the special problems which would arise from moving some of the P &amp; Efacilities to Tain, an area which is already under considerable pressure as aresult of oil related industrial development.The Proposal to more the RAC Gunnery Range from Lulworth to castle martin(Pages 137-159 of the Report)11. The Committee recommended that the Lulworth ranges of about,000 acres should (with the exception of the East Holme Rifle Range) be released and the RAC Gunnery School moved to the range at castle martin currently
used for RAC continuation firing and by the German Army for tank training.The Government has considered this recommendation with the utmost care.A study has been carried out to see whether acceptable arrangements for sharingfacilities at castle martin between the RAC Gunnery School and the german army could be devised. It has concluded that this is not possible. The Govern-ment has also had regard to the environmental considerations at both Lulworthand castle martin and the heavy cost of moving the Gunnery School. account has been taken of the great volume of representations made on this aspect ofthe Report. There has been total and united opposition from all authoritiesand the public in Wales to the proposed greater use of castle martin. In the caseof Lulworth there have been arguments both for and against the suggestedv move though the local authorities and a large number of the local residentsare in favour of the Army staying. The Government has come to the conclusionthat in all the circumstances the RAC Gunnery School should remain atLulworth. The Government is very anxious that as many people as possible should have the chance to enjoy the beauty of Lulworth. The Ministry ofDefence will therefore take steps to improve access for the public at Lulworthat a cost of about  100,000 in capital expenditure and a similar sum annuallyin running costs. At the same time the possibility of still further improving thearrangements for allowing public access will be examined and as soon as possiblethe Ministry of Defence will invite the Department of the Environment, the countryside Commission, the Nature Conservancy Council and other interests to enter into discussions on these matters; and they will seek to establish the closest continuing co-operation over the future management of the area.Dartmoor12. The Services use over 30,000 acres of Dartmoor and more writtenevidence was submitted to the Nugent Committee on this than on any othersite. Most of the representations made to the Committee stressed the advantages of Service presence and supported Ministry of Defence use of Dartmoor. Amajority of the Committee recommended that most of the Services&apos; trainingareas and ranges on Dartmoor should be retained but that Rippon Tor RifleRange should be disposed of and 2,400 acres of land on the OkehamptonRange should be released from live firing. This last recommendation is acceptedexcept that the area to be released will be on the east-side of the range andnot on the north-side as recommended by the Committee. Rippon Tor will be released when the Wessex Depot leaves Exeter. The Committee&apos;s recom-mendations for improved access to the Okehampton Range and for the disposalof Plasterdown Camp are accepted, Mr John Cripps, a member of the DefenceLands Committee, entered a Note of Dissent on Dartmoor in which he madevarious recommendations including a proposal for a Public Inquiry to be heldin 1975 to recommend how the training requirements of Commando forces royal Marines and the Commando Training Centre can best be met outside and, to the extent that is essential, within the Dartmoor National Park. TheGovernment accepts that there should be a public inquiry next year how, in thelight of the circumstances then existing, essential defence needs in the south-westcan be met. In the case of Mr Cripps&apos; Notes of Dissent on other sites, themajority recommendations of the Nugent Committee have been preferred bythe Government.
Other Sites13. There are a few sites where the Government is unable to give unqualifiedacceptance to the Committee&apos;s recommendations. A number of RAF airfieldswhich the Committee recommended for disposal are now being considered aspossible alternative locations for certain Army units for which major works services would otherwise be required to provide permanent accommodation.Army sites of similar size will be released wherever possible. The airfieldsconcerned are: Debden (Essex) (Page 166), Hemswell (Lincolnshire) (Page 230)and Watton (Norfolk) (Page 239). RAF Chivenor (Page 99), which the Committealso recommended for disposal, may now be required for a further defenceuse. It is proposed to use RAF Oakington (Cambridgeshire) (Page 80), to accommodate an Army infantry battalion when it is vacated by the RAF inMarch 1975. The Army will discuss with the local authority the possibilityof increased public access to the site.14. The Ministry of Defence is not yet able to decide in the context of requirements for \ranges in the South East on future requirements at Purfleet(Greater London) (Page 177) and Colchester (Essex) (Page 164) which latter will, as the Nugent Committee recognised, have to be retained until the NorthernIreland emergency is over, when the need for the range will be reviewed.15. The areas to be given up at Netley (Hampshire) (Page 198), Driffield(Yorkshire) (Page 311) and Manorbier (Pembrokeshire) (Page 349) may atleast initially be rather smaller than recommended in the Nugent Report.The Ministry of Defence will need a little more freedom of manoeuvre forhovercraft at Gosport (Hampshire) (Page 191) than recommended in theReport. Full details of the changes will be provided to the local authorities andothers who gave evidence on these sites. Finally, Gortin (Tyrone) Army Range(Page 390) will not now be given up, but the Ministry of Defence will not need the replacement range which the Nugent Committee recognised would have been necessary.16. In addition, there are some sites where we can go further than recom-mended by the Nugent Committee. At Portsmouth (Eastney) (Hampshire)(Page 200) we are able to release 99 acres instead of the 12 acres proposed in theReport and at Portsmouth (Tipner) (Page 201) we shall be able to release 6*5acres if certain defence facilities can first be re-provided. At Orfordness, Suffolk(Page 272) the northern area as well as the southern area will be available for release and at Canterbury, Kent (Page 391) about 212 acres of training land canbe given up.conclusions the Government believes that the review carried out by Lord Nugent andhis colleagues on the Defence Lands Committee has been valuable both in providing a fresh impetus to the release of land by the Armed Forces and in establishing some general principles which will help in the future management of defence lands and guide future decisions when a choice has to be made between defence needs and the legimate demands by the public for greater opportunities to enjoy the countryside. The situation is not static. The Govern-ment is now engaged in a fundamental review of Defence Expenditure. As a
result, it may be possible for more land to be given up. When deciding on areas for release, the Government will balance not only the operational needs of theServices and regional considerations relating, for example, to employmentprospects, but also the desirability of giving up as much land as possible in areas of great natural/beauty or particular scientific interest.6Printed ia England by Oyez Press Limited, and published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery OfficeDd 256075 K 32       8/74ISBN 0 10 157140 2
