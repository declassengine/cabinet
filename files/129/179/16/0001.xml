DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government(74) 106 COPY NO     J g11 September 1974CAR TT^JE TPUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION 1974-75 TO 1978-79Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science . At a time when public expenditure has to be severely constrained, itis all the more Important that we should get our priorities right.    If wefollow the Chancellor&apos;s proposals I fear we shall be taking the wrong course;while assenting to large increases in subsidies and transfer payments, weshall be starving the basic social services, including education., of theresources they need to operate at even a tolerable level of efficiency.2, Over the last year education has lost ground in the allocation of resources, compared with many other programmes.    It suffered severelyunder the cuts imposed by the last Government in December 1973, and wehave done nothing to restore those cuts.    Nor has education had any shareof the large increases in public expenditure which we authorised for other services soon after we came into office.3, The formula we adopted earlier this year to set expenditure limits for programmes for the purposes of the Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) report bore as hardly upon education as on any other service.    However the education figures in the PESC report, taking thefour years 1975-76 to 1978-79 together, fell within the prescribed limits,though only by postulating further severe reductions in both capital and current expenditure.    Since that report was prepared revised forecasts of pupil and student numbers have led me to judge that, by taking a calcu-lated risk about future likely demand for education, it is possible to reducemy estimates (excluding those for Scotland) by  176 million over the fouryears.   In particular I am ready to accept a target of 640, 000 students in higher education in 1981, compared with the figure of a million that weadvocated when in opposition.    This presents an opportunity to restoremany of the cuts which were assumed for PESC purposes, and my proposals,as set out in the Chancellor&apos;s paper, are intended to achieve this purpose and still yield a small net saving.   For his part, the Chancellor has offered me 23 million as part of the package for the reflation of the building industry -a very welcome step which will however help me only in 1975-76 - 4 million for an increase in the rate of grant to Church schools (whichwill do nothing to provide additional educational facilities) and  37 million for other expenditure, a total of  64 million.    This does not go nearly far1
enough.    In the first place I must restore the cut of  25 million in localauthority current expenditure on education in 1975-76 built into the PESCfigures.    Coming immediately after the cuts in 1974-75 made by our predecessors last year, it is bound to depress the standard of provisionof books and equipment, already a subject of widespread complaint, andmay well lead to unemployment among newly trained teachers - all this ata time when the Bullock Committee has just recommended a big effort toimprove the teaching of reading. (1,II4. On capital expenditure:-i. The nursery building programme for 1975-76 would still fall short of the  22, 9 million (starts) already allocated by our predecessors to local authorities for that year (and for 1974-75),If our statement in The Queen*s Speech of-priority for nursery education is to be honoured, the cut must be restored,ii. The special school building programme for 1975-76 would still be well below the original figure.    Here again, if our pledges to help handicapped children are not to be broken, the cut must be restored.iii, The non-advanced further education programme of  15 million(starts) for 1975-76 would be only half the original figure.    further education at this level not only provides opportunities for themajority of school leavers who do not go on to university or otherhigher education but also represents an investment in skilled man-power urgently needed by industry.    I want to see the original programme restored,iv, I must do more to replace old schools, secondary - to helpcomprehensive reorganisation - as well as primary. The figuresthat I have in mind ( 37 million starts in 1975-76 rising to 55 million in 1978-79) are still well below those planned bythe last Government.5,        Even after the additions proposed in the two previous paragraphs,my programme will not allow for the restoration of free milk to allchildren under 11,    It also envisages increases totalling 3p in the charge for school meals next year, the first of which would take effect in January1975.    Indeed I attach so much importance to the restoration of the cutswhich I have listed, that, as a contribution towards the expenditure entailed,beyond the limits proposed by the Chancellor, I am ready to see the price ofthe school meal increased by 3p (as was done in April 1971) in January next,with subsequent increases each year sufficient to ensure that the charge toparents keeps pace with rising prices.6, I invite my colleagues to note the consequences for the education service of accepting the Chancellor&apos;s proposals, and to approve my own proposals as set out in paragraphs 3 and 4,REPDepartment of Education and Science10 September 19742
