Democracy and Devolution Proposals for Scotlandand WalesINTRODUCTION1. In 1968 the Government announced their decision to set up the RoyalCommission on the Constitution. The Prime Minister said at the time that animportant reason for appointing the Commission was the &quot;strong feeling, notonly in Scotland and Wales, but in many parts of England, of a greater desire for participation in the process of decision making, moving it nearer whereverthis is possible to the places where people live&quot;. The Commission, under thechairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon, reported in October 1973. It was unanimous in rejecting separatism and federalism and in recommending directly electedScottish and Welsh assemblies, but was divided in the rest of its recommenda-tions. The Queen&apos;s Speech on 12 March 1974 said the Government &quot;willinitiatediscussions in Scotland and Wales on the Report of the Commission on theConstitution, and will bring forward proposals for consideration&quot;. Accordingly,to provide the basis for these discussions the Government published on 3 June1974 &quot;Devolution within the United Kingdom Some Alternatives forDiscussion&quot;. This Consultative Document summarised the various schemes of devolution recommended in the Kilbrandon Commission^ main Report andin the Memorandum of Dissent which accompanied it and posed a numberof questions and identified problems relating to each of the possible schemes.The Government are now able to report on the outcome of the consultationsthey have undertaken during the Summer of 1974 and, in the light of them, toset out their decisions of principle as a basis for further development.THE UNITY OF THE UNITED kingdom. The Government agree wholeheartedly with the Commission on theConstitution in rejecting separatism and federalism as a solution. The Govern-ment, like the Royal Commission, regard it as a vital and fundamental principle to maintain the economic and political unity of the United Kingdom. This isnot just a matter of tradition and sentiment, important though they are. the unity of the country and of the economy is essential both to the strength ofour international position and to the growth of our industry and national wealth. That unity is thus crucial if we are to play an effective role in inter-national negotiations, whether political or economic; and it is crucial for thecentral management of the economy and so to the redistribution of resources in favour of all the less prosperous areas of the United Kingdom.3. It does not follow, however, that each of the constituent parts of theUnited Kingdom must be treated in exactly the same way. While the people ofScotland and Wales, as the Royal Commission noted, consider themselves tobe British, they are also deeply conscious of the fact that they are Scottish orWelsh. Nor does it follow that Scotland and Wales must be treated exactlylike each other. They have differing histories, backgrounds and culturaltraditions. Because the circumstances of the two countries are so different, thepresent arrangements for their government are not the same and it will not be
surprising if their future systems of government are different. What is important is that the needs and aspirations of the.Scottish and Welsh people are properlymet. In this context the Government are, firmly convinced, as was the RoyalCommission, that the United Kingdom must remain one country and oneeconomy and that constitutional change must be undertaken with the clearobjective of strengthening rather than weakening this unity.4. Within the United Kingdom there has however already been a substantial, movement of Government and decision making away from London what theKilbrandon Commission called administrative devolution. These develop-ments, which have been of benefit -especially to Scotland and Wales, are summarised in the following paragraphs. The Government intend to build on what has already been achieved, in order to provide more democratic involvement.existing devolutionScotland5. Since 1885 when a Secretary for Scotland was appointed, and particularly from 1939 when the Scottish Office in broadly its present form was established in Edinburgh, a very wide measure of administrative devolution has been developed. Since the war additional functions have been progressively transferredto the Scottish Office. The Secretary of State, as a member of the United KingdomGovernment, now has major responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions)both for the formulation of policy and its execution in such major fields as agriculture and fisheries; education; local government and environmental services; social work, health and housing; roads and certain aspects of shipping and road transport services. He is also responsible for a range of other functionsfrom police and fire services to sport and tourism. * The United KingdomGovernmenfs administrative functions arising from these responsibilities are carried out in the five Scottish Departments based on St. Andrew&apos;s House in edinburgh. For most of these subjects there is separate Scottish legislation orScottish application clauses in United Kingdom Acts of Parliament. separate scottish legislation has special Parliamentary machinery to handle it consistingof the Scottish Grand Committee, on which all 71 Scottish Members of Parlia-ment sit, and two Scottish Standing Committees which consider the details of scottish legislation.6. One basic reason for these differences in legislation and administrativepractice arises from the existence of a separate system of Scottish law, thepreservation of which was provided for in the Union settlement of 1707. TheSecretary of State has accordingly responsibility for legal services in Scotland,and other important responsibilities are exercised by the two Scottish LawOfficers, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. But it is notjust a case of Scottish legislation in parallel with that for England and Wales;there are usually distinctive Scottish features and in some cases the approach ismarkedly different, reflecting the differing needs and conditions of Scotlandand the people living there. Many examples are to be found in such fields as* The Secretary of State&apos;s major responsibilities are as follows: agriculture and fisheries,criminal law, crofting, education, electricity, environmental services, health, Highlands and islands development, housing, legal services, local government, police, prison and fire services,roads, certain aspects of shipping and road transport services, social work, sport, recreationand the arts, tourism, town and country planning and youth and community services.
health, education, social work, housing and criminal law. Devolution to scotland in the sense of running things differently in Scotland because scotland is different is therefore nothing new.7. The Secretary of State also has a major role in the planning and develop-ment of the Scottish economy and plays a full part in the governments determination of Energy policy. He exercises a co-ordinating function overactivities in Scotland, such as the location of industry, the creation of employment and the on-shore facilities needed for North Sea oil, which are not his direct responsibility but have an important, indeed vital, effect on the economy ofScotland. The United Kingdom Departments with significant Scottish respon-sibilities have offices in Scotland with delegated powers and work closely withthe Scottish Office. The decentralisation of central Government functions hasalso benefited the Scottish economy and the Government has decided to furtherthis by transferring 6,000 Ministry of Defence and 1,000 Ministry of overseas development posts to Glasgow over the next ten years.8. The existence of these separate administrative arrangements in scotland has ^greatly benefited the people of Scotland in that they have enabled specialScottish needs to be recognised and imet. A practical illustration of this is thatidentifiable public expenditure per head in Scotland has been at a very signifi-cantly higher level than elsewhere in the United Kingdom (except in very recentyears in Northern Ireland).Wales9. Substantial administrative devolution to Wales has also already takenplace, though at a later historical stage than in the case of Scotland. The firstMinister for Welsh Affairs was appointed in 1951, but the most importantmeasures of devolution have been concentrated into the last ten years. The first secretary of State was appointed in 1964, and since then the Welsh Office&apos;s functions have grown rapidly. The Department now has responsibility in Walesfor housing, health, the social services, primary and secondary education, childcare, town and country planning, water, highways, tourism, forestry and agri-culture (jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), and many other functions. The strengthening of the Office still continues; the post of itsCivil Service head was recently upgraded to that of full Permanent Secretary.10. In other ways too administration has been reshaped and strengthenedand decision making has been devolved to take account of Welsh interests in economic and other fields. The Secretary of State has a general responsibilityfor the economic development of Wales and exercises a co-ordinating respon-sibility in Government action to promote the welfare of Wales. Considerablepowers have been delegated to the Department of Trade and Industry Office for wales, and Wales has its own Industrial Director and Industrial development board. The Government have also announced their decision, as a further stepto assist the economy, to transfer over 7,000 Civil Service posts to Wales in thenext ten years. As in Scotland, identifiable public expenditure per head in wales has for many years been running at a substantially higher level than in England.11. In consequence of these and other measures Government action is increasingly adapted to fit Welsh needs and to further Welsh interests. The role of the Secretary of State in the United Kingdom Government is fundamental.
He not only has full responsibility for the matters referred to in paragraph above; in other matters affecting Wales hehaspowers of oversight and he safe-guards and furthers Welsh interests both.in Cabinet and in discussion withDepartmental Ministers, thus exercising a direct and powerful influence on allpolicies affecting Wales.12. Welsh interests are further represented centrally through the 36 WelshMembers of Parliament at Westminster who, in addition to their other Parlia-mentary or Ministerial functions, all sit on the Welsh Grand Committee which provides a further forum for debate and discussion of matters concerningWales.England13. For historical reasons there has not been the same pressure for sub-stantial devolution in England. The fact of the differing circumstances and needsof different parts of England was however recognised by the creation in 1964 ofthe Economic Planning Boards and Councils; the Councils have been a valuablesource of advice to successive Governments on the special requirements of theirregions, and the Planning Boards have strengthened and extended the delegation of decision making from Whitehall Departments to regional centres. Forinstance, Regional Controllers of the Department of Industry now make,important decisions affecting the location of industry by authorising loans of upto  1 million under the 1972 Act: Regional Directors of the Department of the environment take the majority of the Department^ planning and highwaysdecisions. Furthermore the Government have put forward for discussion certain proposals to aid democratisation in specific fields, for instance area and regional health authorities and to provide for statutory neighbourhood councils to beset up.CONSULTATIONS ON THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT14. While recognising the benefits to Scotland and Wales of the existing system, the Kilbrandon Commission unanimously concluded that directly elected assemblies ought to be established for Scotland and for Wales to meetthe legitimate desire of their people for greater control over their own affairs.The Commission was not agreed, however, on how this objective should beachieved, and in the main Report and the Memorandum of Dissent four schemes were set out for implementing this decision in relation to Scotland (Schemes A,B, C and E in the Consultative Document) and Wales (Schemes A, B, C and D).The Government invited all interested organisations and members of the public to comment on these schemes. For ease of reference, the description of theschemes in the Consultative Document is reproduced as an Appendix to this white Paper.Scotland15. The response of individual members of the public was disappointing;only about 170 letters or papers, some quite brief, were received. Of these therewas no clear majority for any one solution, and indeed a significant numberexpressed no specific view.
16. On the other hand over 60 organisations, including the political parties, submitted written views. Among these there was considerable support for Scheme A or variations of it. While very few indeed favoured Schemes Bor C, there was some support for Scheme E. A number wanted more decisionmaking in Scotland, without associating that demand with any specific scheme.Some wanted no change in the present system and others wanted any decisiondeferred until the new local authorities had had time to settle down. Most ofthose representing local government were particularly concerned about thepossible effects of the schemes considered on the new local authorities andtheir powers. Strathclyde Regional Authority, for example, urged the Govern-ment &quot;to ensure that the new authorities are given sufficient time and indepen-dent power to establish and develop themselves and that in the meantime thediscussions should continue&quot;.17. During July and August 1974 a series of discussions was held inScotland by Scottish Ministers, accompanied by the Government^ constitu-tional adviser, Lord Crowther-Hunt, with some of the organisations whichhad submitted written observations. Bodies consulted in this way included the Scottish Council of the Labour1 Party, the Scottish National Party, theScottish Council (Development and Industry), the Scottish Trades UnionCongress, the Council of the Confederation of British-Industry in Scotland, theChurch and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotland and various localauthority representatives. These discussions reinforced points made in the written submissions and some points emerged of particular significance. one was a strong desire for more Government decision making to take place inScotland and in that context the announcement referred to in paragraph 34below were welcomed. There was also widespread, though not unanimous,support for the view that there would be merit in the establishment of a directly elected Scottish assembly, but there was no agreement on what powers orfunctions the assembly should have. Of the schemes in the Consultative Docu-ment, Scheme A, which proposed a legislative assembly and government forScotland, commanded the greatest support, but there was clearly a good dealof uncertainty about the precise implications of the scheme and the fullsignificance of the fact that it involved a separate Scottish government respon-sible to the assembly. There was also very considerable opposition bbth totheabolition of the office of Secretary of State and to the reduction in the numberof Scottish Members of Parliament at Westminster, for which Scheme Aprovided. Of the other schemes, hardly anyone thought them appropriate to scottish conditions, except that Scheme E, which involved an advisory assemblywith limited legislative functions and no Scottish Executive, attracted some support.18. The process of consultation has made it apparent that opinion inScotland is still divided. Many are convinced of the need for a substantial measure of devolution, involving a directly elected Scottish assembly with realpowers. Others, though a minority, are equally convinced that any radical change in the present system would be to Scotland&apos;s detriment, though adminis-trative devolution might be further developed. But the overwhelming view was that the essential political and economic unity of the United kingdom should be preserved.
Wales       .. ,?.r^sk -19. In accordance with the Governments undertaking to carry outdiscussions on the Commissions Report in, Wales, the Secretary of State,with the assistance of the Governments constitutional adviser, has completeda programme of consultations.20. The bodies consulted represented, political parties in Wales, localauthorities, both sides of industry and the:Farming community. The majoritywere in favour of the establishment of a directly elected assembly for Wales,but there was no general agreement on the functions it should exercise: opinion was divided between those who favoured legislative devolution (Scheme A) andthose who were for executive devolution&quot;^Schemes B or C). The minority eitherfavoured a directly elected Welsh Advisory Council (Scheme D) or wanted nofundamental change in existing arrangements. The points on which there wassubstantial agreement among those consulted were that the office of Secretaryof State should continue and that there should; be no reduction in the numberof Welsh Members of Parliament.    .n I, );. ;21. The Secretary of State received written views from 30 organisations in wales. In most cases these were briefly stated and did not attempt to deal withthe detailed questions set out in the dtsctissibh document. The views of these organisations, mostly made up of individual local authorities and political,trade union and religious bodies, were divided: about one-third were in favourof legislative devolution; nearly half preferred executive devolution; and theremainder favoured other solutions or the status quo. In addition the Secretaryof State received written views from a relatively small number of individuals,most of which were in favour of schemes of at least legislative devolution.22. Thus no consensus of opinion has emerged. The case for an elected assembly is widely supported, but there is no general agreement about thepowers it should exercise. However, there is an evident desire to see government decision making made more responsive and accountable to the people, provided this can be done without disrupting the essential political and economic unity of the United Kingdom. In particular, it has been urged that the nominatedbodies which at present carry out many functions in Wales should be replaced by a body representative of the Welsh people, which should also dischargesome of the executive functions of Government Departments in Wales.SOME MAJOR ISSUES23. In a matter of this kind it is not surprising that, as the consultationshave demonstrated, there are diverging views. The consultations also showed that while the majority of organisations and individuals who responded to theGovernment^ invitation had a general picture of the sort of arrangements theyfavoured, few of them were prepared to accept all the implications which seemed logically to follow from these arrangements. The Governments con-tinued studies during recent months have shown that any substantial scheme of
devolution raises difficult problems; and a number of very important mattersremain to be resolved before it is possible to put forward detailed proposalswhich would command general&apos;Support and would carry with them the prospectof stability. The major issues are- !l0ti;(a) Finance and Economic management in any scheme of devolution the financial arrangements would clearly beof fundamental importance.&apos; Any&apos;niajor change in the present broad arrange-ment has to be reconciledr with;&apos;&apos;the maintenance of a general uniformity of approach in the Kingdom&apos; as a&apos; whole to the allocation of resources, to taxation arrangements and&apos;&quot;fd^&apos;t\$&apos;&apos; overall management of the economy.Consideration of alternative approaches, including the proposal in Scheme Afor a nominated Exchequer Board; lias confirmed the very great difficultyof finding acceptable solutions to these problems.(b) Trade, Industry and EmploymentThere is still a great deal of doubt about whether and if so how farexecutive powers in these fields could be devolved to Scottish and Welshassemblies without prejudice, to thcessential economic unity of the UnitedKingdom. There is a strong desire for more decision making in Scotlandand Wales, but this would not necessarily require the creation of an elected assembly. ,JJ..&apos;;.,(c) Local government ^nohriqThere is understandable concern both about the timing and effect of any constitutional changes in relation to the re-organisation of local government,and about the possible attitude of directly elected assemblies to the newlocal authorities who have just taken over their full responsibilities in wales and will be doing so in Scotland next year.(rf) The Secretary of StateThere is a strong desire both in Scotland and in Wales to retain an effectiveSecretary of State. Major changes and a diminution in their present powers would be an inevitable consequence of a substantial measure of devolution;careful thought will have to be given to their precise role. They will howeverretain important executive functions, will act as spokesmen for Scotland andfor Wales in the United Kingdom Government for those matters which arenot devolved and will contribute to the formulation of United kingdom policy as a whole. Indeed, an extension of their responsibilities, particularlyin the field of industry, may point the way to a solution to some of theproblems outlined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above.(e) Representation in the United Kingdom ParliamentThere is a great reluctance to see any reduction in the number of Scottishor Welsh Members of the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster, witha consequent weakening of Scottish or Welsh influence in United Kingdomaffairs.
THE GOVERNMENTS DECISIONS24. All these outstanding problems as well as a great many matters of detail will require further very careful and thorough study before the Govern-ment are in a position to put forward fully worked out proposals. But they acceptthe broad conclusion of the Kilbrandon Commission that a further substantial measure of devolution within the United Kingdom is desirable and that it can best be achieved by the establishment of directly elected assemblies in bothScotland and Wales.25. The Government attach equal importance to democratic accountabilityof government in England. In Scotland and Wales there has already been asufficient debate to enable the Government to make firm proposals. In England,however, the consultation process is not yet complete, and it would be wrong to go further until all the bodies consulted have had the opportunity to expressthemselves and it is clear what the people of England want.26. Northern Ireland comes into a different category from Scotland andWales because of the facts of its history and geography and the presence oftwo communities in the province. The Government have already published their proposals for Northern Ireland in a White Paper &quot;The Northern IrelandConstitution&quot; (Cmnd 5675) based on elections to a Consultative convention which will enable elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland toconsider &quot;what provision for the government of Northern Ireland is likely to command the most widespread acceptance throughout the community&quot;. final decisions on these proposals will be taken by Parliament.27. For Scotland and Wales the Government now propose the creation ofdirectly elected assemblies.28. While these new institutions will have certain common characteristicsand relationships to the central Government, they will naturally have to reflect the differences in governmental structure between Scotland and Wales which already exist. In particular, as explained in paragraphs 5 and 6, Scotland hasa distinctive legal structure which is recognised in existing legislative practice.29. The Government have therefore concluded that the Scottish assembly should have a legislative role and have legislative powers within fields in whichseparate Scottish legislation already exists such as, for example, housing,health and education.30. Taking account of the different structures of law in Scotland andWales but with the same principles in mind the Government intend that the welsh assembly should parallel the Scottish counterpart in assuming certain powers of the Secretary of State in respect of delegated legislation. The welsh assembly would also be given responsibility for many of the executive functionsat present carried out by nominated bodies within Wales, and by the Secretaryof State himself.
31. The membership, functions and procedures of the assemblies will call for detailed study and consideration. The Government^ provisional proposals on some key aspects are as follows:-(a) Membership will be on the same system as membership of the UnitedKingdom Parliament, ie a single member elected for a geographical area.This is simple to operate,- easily understood by the public and providesfor the clear and direct accountability of the elected representative tohis constituents.(b) The assemblies will assume some of the executive functions of theScottish and Welsh Offices, and of the nominated authorities now operating within their boundaries.(c) The financial allocation for the functions over which the assemblieshave responsibility will be in the form of a block grant voted by theUnited Kingdom Parliament under arrangements which will take account of both local needs and the desirability of some uniformity of standards of services and of contributions in all parts of the UnitedKingdom. It will be for the assemblies to judge among competingpriorities within Scotland and Wales in the light of their own assessment of their communities&apos; needs: as between, for example, hospitals androads or schools and houses.(d) The assemblies will not be expected to assume existing powers from local government, since this would undermine rather than improvedemocracy. There will, of course, be a new relationship to be established between the assemblies and local government, and the new authoritiescreated by recent local government reorganisation will require time tosettle down in their new functions before this can be achieved.32. The setting up of Scottish and Welsh assemblies does not, however,detract in any way from the overriding interest of all the peoples of the UnitedKingdom in the determination of United Kingdom policies as a whole. TheUnited Kingdom Parliament and the central Government Ministers, will ofcourse remain fully responsible for the overall interests of the United Kingdomand it is essential that the determination of United Kingdom policies shouldfully reflect the needs and contributions of all its constituent parts.33. For this reason the Government. regard it as essential that bothScotland and Wales should retain their existing number of Members ofParliament in the United Kingdom Parliament and that there should continueto be Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales who act as full members ofthe United Kingdom Government in forming United Kingdom policies. Thisis especially important in relation to the distribution of resources as betweenScotland, Wales and the regions of England: these are fundamentally political decisions and cannot in the Government^ view be delegated to a nominatedExchequer Board as the authority to be responsible for this task. It must bedetermined within the Government itself, with the two Secretaries of State ableto speak for Scotland and Wales, and approved in the House of Commonswith Scotland and Wales fully represented in it.
OFF-SHORE OIL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT34. The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the North Sea and Celtic Seapromises though there is much to be done before the promise is fulfilled new economic and industrial opportunities for the less prosperous areas inScotland and Wales and England. The Government have already acted: the headquarters of the Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Energy isbeing transferred to Glasgow and the new British National Oil corporation is to have its headquarters in Scotland. Still more important in the Scottishcontext is the Government^ intention to establish a Scottish DevelopmentAgency, which is to be responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland.Its task will be to strengthen the instruments available for promoting thedevelopment and restructuring of the Scottish economy. It will also carry outin Scotland appropriate functions of the National Enterprise Board. and within the British Airports Authority a separate organisation to be known asScottish Airports is to be set up. Similar arrangements will be made in wales to strengthen the instruments for promoting the development of Wales&apos; economy.35. The Government is determined that the community as a whole andthe regions in need receive their full and fair share of the benefits resulting fromthe exploitation of these new energy resources. This must mean that maximum benefit goes to redress the regional imbalances in Scotland, Wales and Englandwhich have followed in the wake of the first Industrial Revolution.36. The task of economic reconstruction is one for both central and regional government. Creating assemblies in Scotland and Wales will not of itself bea solution to our regional unemploymentproblems which have been so intractableup to now. Central Government will have to take direct action on the linesalready put forward in the White Paper on the Regeneration of British Industry.But there must be scope too for real initiative and participation at the levelof the assemblies, for instance in the drawing up of regional economic plans,and consideration will need to be given to the relationship between theDevelopment Agencies and the assemblies.CONCLUSION37. In its approach to devolution the Government is concerned to fosterdemocratic control over the increasingly complex processes of modern govern-ment and to bring government closer to the people. The people and their repre-sentatives must have a full share in the decision-making process. This is themain objective- to make a reality of the principle of democratic accountability.The Government has now decided in principle the way in which this should be accomplished in Scotland and Wales.38. The Government intends to legislate for the establishment of scottish and Welsh assemblies as soon as possible. Much work still remains to be done and many critical decisions taken on winch the Government will wish to havethe widest consultations. But when detailed schemes have been worked out andimplemented the Government believe that this will bring great benefits to thepeople of Scotland and Wales. They will be able to have a decisive voice in the
running of their own domestic affairs. At the same time the political andeconomic unity of the United Kingdom will be preserved with all the attendantbenefits from that unity which accrue to the people of Scotland and Wales no less than to the people in the different parts of England. There are, of course, manymaterial aspirations and social objectives which devolution cannot further. nor can it solve indeed if wrong decisions were taken it could aggravate our basiceconomic problems of how to raise the national output, reduce inflation and secure a satisfactory balance of payments. The Government are, however,confident that, given the will to make devolution work, the proposals hereoutlined provide a framework which will give full scope for the creative energiesof all pur people.
appendix extract FROM THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT&quot;DEVOLUTION WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM&quot;THE SCHEMES RECOMMENDED IN THE MAJORITY report and THE MEMORANDUM OF DISSENTA.  Legislative Devolution for Scotland and wales. Legislative devolution was recommended for Scotland by. eight of thethirteen members of the Commission and for Wales by six members^1)General description2. Responsibility for legislating on specifically defined matters wouldbe transferred from the Westminster Parliament to directly elected scottish and Welsh legislatures. In relation to the transferred subjects theselegislatures would make such laws and policies as they saw fit, and would carry out all aspects of administration. The ultimate power and sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament would be preserved in all matters, but itwould be a convention that in the ordinary course this power would not beused to legislate for Scotland or Wales on a transferred matter without theagreement of the Scottish or Welsh Government^2) The United KingdomGovernment would also have the power, for use in exceptional circumstances,to determine, with the approval of the United Kingdom Parliament, that aBill passed by the Scottish or Welsh legislature should not be submitted for the Royal Assent. The Scottish and Welsh executives would be composed of Ministers drawn from their respective assemblies who wouldthen operate the traditional Cabinet system of government. It is the intention that the Scottish and Welsh Governments should have a large measure offinancial independence, especially in matters of expenditure, but would besubject to such restraints as are necessary in the interests of the economicmanagement of the United Kingdom as a whole.Main features of the scheme3. Legislative power in the following subjects would be transferredto the Scottish and Welsh legislative assemblies: Local government Road passenger transportTown and country planning HarboursNew towns Other environmental services (e.g.Housing prevention of pollution, coast pro-tection and flood prevention)Building control Education (probably excluding univer-Water supply and sewerage necessities)Ancient   monuments   and historic   Youth and community servicesbuildings Sports and recreationRoads (including the construction,   Arts and culture (including the Welshuse and licensing of vehicles) and Gaelic languages)C)The proposals for legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales are outlined inparagraphs 1125 to 1153 of the Majority Report. The strengths and weaknesses of legislative devolution are discussed in more detail in paragraphs 733 to 826.(2) Majority Report, paragraph 1126.
Social work services (including, for   Agriculture,   fisheries   and   foodScotland, probation and after-care)     (except price support and someMiscellaneous  regulatory functions   Forestry(including matters such as betting,   Crown estatesgaming, and lotteries, obscene pub-   Tourismlications, shop hours and liquorlicensing)4. Legislative power in the following additional matters would betransferred to the Scottish Assembly only: Police Legal matters, including law reformFire services Highlands and Islands developmentAdministration of justice5. ^ In the subjects listed above the Westminster Parliament would normally cease to legislate for Scotland and Wales (though existing UnitedKingdom legislation in these fields would continue to apply initially). Butthe United Kingdom Parliament and Government would continue to beresponsible for the international aspects of transferred matters. It is alsoenvisaged that the Scottish and Welsh assemblies might have some limited powers in relation to consumer protection, road freight, civil aviation and broadcasting.6. The legislative assemblies in Scotland and Wales would each have about 100 members directly elected for a fixed term of four years by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, though in the moresparsely populated areas of Scotland the alternative vote system might beadopted. All matters relating to the franchise and to elections to the assembly(though not elections to local authorities) would be reserved to the UnitedKingdom Parliament.7. The Scottish and Welsh executives would consist of 1 Ministersdrawn from their respective assemblies. Normally the leader of the majorityparty would be chief Minister (or Premier) and would form a Cabinet whichwould operate in accordance with the traditional Westminster principlesof collective and ministerial responsibility. Scotland and Wales would eachhave a separate civil service.8. Scotland and Wales would continue to be represented in the westminster Parliament, but their representation in proportion to population would be the same as for England. This would probably reduce thenumber of Scottish MPs at Westminster from 71 to about 57; and thenumber of Welsh MPs from 36 to about 31.9. The offices of Secretary of State for Scotland and Wales would disappear, but Scotland and Wales would each have a Minister with thespecial responsibility of representing its interests in the Cabinet.(3)(3) Paragraph 1148 of the Majority Report.Healthother functions)Criminal policy and administrationPrisons(including crofting)Sea transport
: 10. There are detailed proposals for finance which the Report says are open to modification^4) The chief object would be to give the Scottish and welsh Governments maximum freedom in expenditure. Each would have its &quot;fair share of United Kingdom resources&quot; and freedom to allocateexpenditure on the transferred services according to its own chosenpriorities.(5) Scotland and Wales might also have some limited powers of independent taxation, and perhaps a share of United Kingdom taxes., Butthe assemblies&apos; income would come mainly from United Kingdom subventions-tions.  They might also be able to raise loans to meet capital expenditure.11. The determination of Scotland&apos;s and Wales&apos; &quot;fair share of UnitedKingdom resources &quot; would be in the hands of a nominated Exchequer board which would be independent of the Scottish, Welsh and United kingdom governments. Exceptionally the United Kingdom Government could reject the Board&apos;s recommendation with the approval of the United kingdom parliament.B.  A Scheme for Elected Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and the english regions.12. This scheme of intermediate level governments was the mainproposal in the Memorandum of Dissent signed by two members of theCommission^6)General description13. The scheme seeks to achieve a substantial measure of devolution of power from the central Government to Scotland, Wales and the english regions. It could, however, be considered for application to Scotland andWales alone. Under the scheme the United Kingdom Parliament and government would remain responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy on all matters, but directly elected Scottish and Welsh and english regional assemblies would be responsible for adjusting UnitedKingdom policies to the special needs of their areas and putting them intoeffect. The Scottish, Welsh and English regional Governments would be runon the local authority pattern with a functional committee structure and noton the Cabinet model as in the scheme of legislative devolution. They would assume control of all the regional outposts of central Government now operating in their areas including the Scottish and Welsh Offices in theirpresent form and the regional and local offices of other central GovernmentDepartments.(7) Thus these outposts, which employ very substantial numbersof civil servants, would be completely &quot; hived off &quot; from central Government.(4) Paragraphs 679 to 693 of the Majority Report describe a scheme of regional financeintended to bring about the maximum degree of regional independence. Paragraphs 775 to 777discuss this scheme in relation to the problems of legislative devolution generally. Paragraphs1134 to 1139 apply it to the Commission^ specific proposals for legislative devolution inScotland and Wales.(6) Majority Report, paragraph 1134.(8) The scheme is summarised on pages xvi to xx of the Memorandum of Dissent and developed more fully in paragraphs 208 to 276.(&apos;) The term &quot; regional &quot; includes where appropriate, the all-Scotland or all-Wales level.It does not mean the regional level of local government in Scotland; nor that Scotland andWales are to be equated with English regions.
The &quot; intermediate level&quot; governments (i.e. the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments) would also take over completely the functions ofcertain ad hoc authorities operating in their areas (e.g. health and water authorities); and they would be given some supervisory responsibilities inrespect of the activities in their parts of the country of the various industrial and commercial authorities (e.g. gas and electricity boards). The &quot; inter-mediate level &quot; governments would not be limited to the specific functions or duties conferred on them by Parliament; they would have a general residualcompetence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas. They would have some independent revenue-raising powers and sufficient financial &quot; independence &quot; of central Government to give them the requisite degree of freedom to carry out their duties and responsibilities.Main features of the scheme &apos;\\14. The scheme envisages that the broad range of functions set out inparagraph 13 above would be devolved to an assembly and governmentin Scotland, in Wales and in each of, say, five English regions. Eachassembly would consist of about, 100 members elected by the single trans-transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of fouryears. The executive of each government would consist of a numberof functional departments or divisions staffed by the authority&apos;s own civilservants. There would be departments or divisions for such functions asFinance, Education, Health and Social Security, the Environment, etc. each department or division would be controlled by a committee drawn fromthe membership of the assembly reflecting the balance of party strengths. -15.  Each assembly would be able to make &quot; ordinances &quot;: (a) to implement United Kingdom policies and legislation and to adaptthem to the special needs of the area; and(b) to give effect to their residual power to act for the welfare and good government of the people in the area.(8)16. Each intermediate level government would have its own civilservice and a separate ombudsman. There would be no change in thefunctions of local authorities, although they would deal with the appropriateintermediate government instead of with the central Government as atpresent. They would have direct representation in the intermediate level governments.(9)17. The general financial arrangements are outlined at the end ofparagraph 13 above. A possible development of these arrangements isoutlined in Appendix B of the Memorandum of Dissent. It is designed togive the intermediate level governments a considerable degree of financialand economic independence of central Government; and to improve the ability of the central Government to achieve the major objectives of national economic policy such as full employment, regionally and nationally, and asatisfactory rate of economic growth.(8) These powers are subject to various safeguards which are set out in paragraphs 242to 245 of the Memorandum of Dissent.(9) Memorandum of Dissent paragraphs 212 and 254 to 255.
18. At the centre, the scheme envisages that Members of Parliament, by being relieved of a great deal of detail, would have time for a much greatershare in Government policy making including more influence on the decisions which United Kingdom Ministers have to take in the Council of ministers in Brussels; for these purposes MPs would need to be organised infunctional committees matching each of the main Departments of Govern-ment. The composition of the House of Lords might be altered to include,members of the &quot; intermediate level &quot; governments.19. The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would remain as members of the United Kingdom Cabinet though their existing departments would be taken over by the Scottish and Welsh Governments. They wouldhave the special responsibility of safeguarding and promoting Scottish and welsh interests in all Cabinet decisions. A third Cabinet Minister wouldperform a similar function for the English regions. There would be no reduction in the number of Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster.C.  Executive Devolution for Scotland, Wales and Eight English Regions20. This scheme was recommended by two members who signed theMajority Report.(10)General description21. The scheme seeks to achieve a substantial measure of devolutionfrom the central Government to Scotland, Wales and the English regions.It is in essence a more restricted and less radical version of the scheme presented at B above. The United Kingdom Parliament and Governmentwould be responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy inall matters, but wherever possible would transfer to directly elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales and eight English regions the responsibility,within that framework, for devising specific policies and executing themand for general administration. The intention would be to promote themaximum amount of regional participation and variation consistent withthe general policy aims of the United Kingdom Government. The two members who support the scheme regard it as an essential feature that itshould be applied in a more or less uniform way throughout GreatBritain.(u) It could, however, like Scheme B above, be considered for application to Scotland and Wales only.22.  Its main differences from Scheme B are: (a) The assemblies would have no independent revenue raising powers.(b) The assemblies would not have a residual competence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas.(c) The assemblies would not have the wide ordinance-making powerproposed in Scheme B.(d) The functions of the assemblies would be limited initially and increased in the light of experience; they would not necessarily take over all the existing executive functions of the Scottish Office(&quot; The scheme itself is outlined in paragraphs 1154 to 1173 of the Majority Report;executive devolution in general is discussed at greater length in paragraphs 827 to 919.(u) Majority Report, paragraph 1155.
and the Welsh Office, nor necessarily all the other outposts of central Government Departments operating in Scotland or Wales orin the English regions.(e) The assemblies would not necessarily effect a general take-over ofthe work of the various non-industrial, non-commercial ad ad hoc authorities operating in their areas.(/)The assemblies&apos; relationship with local authorities in their areasmight well be different from that envisaged in Scheme B (seeparagraph 27 below).(g) Scheme C does not recommend any changes in the institutions of central Government.Main features of the scheme t\h23. Scotland, Wales and the eight English regions would each havean assembly of about 100 members directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of four years.Each, assembly would administer with as much freedom as possible thelegislation and policies of the United Kingdom Parliament and Government.24. Functions would be conferred on the assembly by the amendmentof existing law and any new legislation relating to specific matters. acts of Parliament would lay down policy in broad terms, authorising theassembly to fill in much of the detail in some cases by statutory instruments.(12) Executive authority would be vested not in Ministers butin the assembly itself, which would delegate much of its authority tofunctional committees, as local authorities now do.(13) The transfer of functions would be a lengthy process, spread over many years. At first the assemblies would have a limited range of powers in matters such asstrategic planning, but these powers would be gradually extended as time went on.(14) Most of the existing executive functions of the Scottish and welsh Offices would be devolved. Almost all subjects would offer somescope for regional involvement.(15)25. The regional assemblies would not have any independent revenueraising powers. They would be financed out of United Kingdom fundsnegotiated direct with the central Government. Their total expenditure would ultimately be for the United Kingdom Government to decide. TheGovernment would also need to be satisfied that each assembly&apos;s proposed allocation of expenditure was broadly consistent with central policies.Subject to this the assembly would make its own expenditure decisions.(16)26. The scheme would not involve any change in Parliamentaryrepresentation, but it envisages that the separate offices of the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would disappear. There would be a minister with general responsibility for regional affairs.(17)(la) Majority Report, paragraph 1156.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraph 1165.(14) Majority Report, paragraph 1160.(15) Majority Report, paragraph 1157.(16) Majority Report, paragraphs 1157 and 1163.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraphs 1168 to 1169.
27.. The relationship between the regional assemblies and local govern-ment could develop in a number of different ways.(is) Three possible waysare described: (a) local authorities could be completely subordinate to the regional government and it would be for each regional government to decide on the distribution of functions between itself and its local authorities;(b) local and regional authorities could each be autonomous in functionsallocated to them from the centre, and could work in parallel; localauthorities would remain accountable for the proper performance oftheir functions to the United Kingdom Government;(c) the relationship between local and regional government could dependon what Parliament considered appropriate in each separate field oflegislation.28. The precise relationship between the regional assemblies and ad hocbodies would depend on a detailed review.(19)D.  Welsh Advisory Council29. Three members who signed the Majority Report recommend theestablishment of a Welsh Advisory Council.(20)General description30. The reasoning behind this scheme is that Wales has derived great benefit from the comparatively recent appointment of its Secretary of State,and that the economic and other problems facing the Principality can best be dealt with through the development and retention of that office. So thescheme aims to reconcile the continued existence of the Secretary of Stateand the Welsh Office in its present form with the widely expressed desire for a directly elected assembly to act as the voice of Wales. Accordinglythere would be a directly elected Welsh Council to advise the Secretary ofState and to scrutinise the operation of Government policies and agenciesin Wales.Main features of the scheme31. The Welsh Advisory Council would be directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation and would consist ofabout 60 members. It would replace the existing nominated Welsh Council.It would have no legislative, executive or administrative powers. Its functions would be to scrutinise, debate and make representations to the Secretary ofState about Government policies and activities in Wales, including theactivities of the nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies operatingthere. It would inevitably be interested in, but would in no sense supervise,the activities of local authorities.(21)32. The Councils scrutiny would range over such matters as the Welsheconomy, employment, major road development and land use proposals,(I8) Majority Report, paragraphs 831 to 833 and 1158.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraph 1159.(20) The scheme is set put in the Majority Report, at paragraphs 1174 to 1183.(21) Majority Report, paragraphs 1175 and 1178.
public services and the Welsh language. It would also hold an annualdebate on the Governmenfs expenditure; proposals for Wales.(22) It would operate through standing committees and be financed from the UnitedKingdom Exchequer. It would also have the right to nominate some membersof ad hoc bodies operating in Wales.(23)33. The Secretary of State and other Welsh Ministers would on invitationattend the Council to explain policy, answer criticisms and receive advice-Officials of the Welsh Office would also be invited to report to the Counciland to answer questions on their activities. Members of Parliament fromWelsh constituencies might attend and speak, but not vote, at the Council&apos;?plenary sessions.(24)E. A Scottish Council with Advisory and Legislative Functions34. One member who signed the Majority Report recommended theestablishment of a Scottish Council with advisory and legislative functidns.(25)General description35. There would be a directly elected Scottish Council which would havethe same advisory functions as proposed for the Welsh Council and sum-marised at paragraphs 30 to 33 above. In addition, however, the Scottish Council would have some powers in relation to Scottish legislation. thus it would take the Second Reading, Committee and Report stages of scottish bills referred to it by the House of Commons. Unless a Bill was thenrecalled by the Leader of the House, the Scottish Council would be ableto give it a Third Reading and submit it for Royal Assent without any reference back to the House of Commons and without any passage throughthe House of Lords.F. Regional Co-ordinating and Advisory Councils for the English Regions36. Eight members of the Commission recommended this scheme for english regional councils with advisory and co-ordinating powers.(26)General description37. The scheme is based on the view that it would not be right for theEnglish regions to be given any legislative or executive powers now exercised by central Government, and that it would be illogical (following the recent reorganisation of local authorities) for them to take over powers from local government. Yet at the regional level it is believed that there isscope for more effective co-operation between local authorities and a needfor more open discussion and democratic influence on those matters affectingthe region which are decided by central Government or by ad hoc bodies..(22) Majority Report, paragraph 1176.(23) Majority Report, paragraph 1178.(21) Majority Report, paragraph 1177. .   &apos;(25)The scheme is described in paragraphs 1184 to 1187 of the Majority Report. It isbased oh the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Committee of: the Conservative party which are discussed in paragraphs 966 to 975.(26)The scheme is summarised in paragraphs 1195 to 1209 of the Majority Report;paragraphs 920 to 965 discuss in more detail the implications of schemes of this kind.
To meet, this need, and to give advice to the central Government on regionalproblems, there would be regional councils primarily composed of localgovernment councillors.Main features of the scheme38; There would be eight English regions (i.e. those that have alreadybeen established for economic planning purposes). Each region would havean advisory council which would consist of about 60 members. Four-fifths of the members of each council would be members of the local authorities inthe region and would be &quot; elected &quot; by those local authorities to membership of the regional advisory council. One-fifth of the members would be nominated by the central Government to secure representation from industryand commerce, trade unions, education and other interests.39. The regional advisory councils would have no legislative, executiveor administrative powers.  Their functions would be to: (a) take over the functions of the present nominated regional economic planning councils;(b) advise on Government spending in their regions;(c) advise and make representations to central Government about government policies and activities generally in their regions, includingthe operations of nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies(some of whose members they would nominate);(rf).have a mainly co-ordinating function in the field of local government.40. Under (d) it is envisaged that the regional council would play an important part in the formulation of the broad economic and land usestrategy which would be the regional framework within which central andlocal government services would be provided. The structure plans of localauthorities would have to fit into this general strategy and would besubmitted for Ministerial approval through the regional council with tscomments, The council would by agreement promote and co-ordinate action by local government in the region. It would have no power of directionover local authorities in the region and would not itself administer services or undertake works.(27)41. In carrying out their functions the councils would ordinarily meet in public.  They would elect their own chairmen.G.  A scheme for Co-ordinating Committees of Local Authorities42. This scheme is recommended for England by one member of theCommission^28)General description43. The scheme is based on the view that in England the best way ofdevolving power from the-centre is to concentrate on strengthening thepower of the new larger local authorities.  It is envisaged that if this were(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraph 1204.(2*) It is outlined in paragraphs 1210 to 1214 of the Majority Report.
done the only need at regional level would be to co-ordinate the planningactivities of local authorities. Instead of the present voluntary co-operationbetween local authorities there would be established a formal system of regional committees. Each would consist entirely of indirectly elected representatives of local authorities and there would be no provision fornominated members. It would be mandatory for local authorities to submit their plans for the regional committee and obtain its comments before submitting them for Ministerial approval. The present economic planning councils would be abolished. It is envisaged that the scheme might be combined with regional committees of the House of Commons which mightvet regional plans and Government expenditure in the regions.(29)(29) The organisation of the House of Commons on these lines is discussed in paragraphs1050 to 1092 of the Majority Report.21Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Oyez Press Limited.//      Dd 256081   K160  9/74
