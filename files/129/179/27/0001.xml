THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENTi-&quot; - i   &quot; 79C(74) 117 COPY NO29 October 1974CABINETSUGARMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and food. In the annex to this paper I set out the basic facts of the sugarsituation and the course of events which led to the decisions taken at lastweek!s Council of Agriculture Ministers.2.        In my view the deal we have secured represents the best we could have achieved.    The only alternative would have been to try to insist onCouncil endorsement for a Community deal with Australia instead of theCommission^ scheme.    But even if we had secured this outcome, our immediate situation would have been worse, not better.    Australia mighthave had no sugar at all immediately available for us and the quantitywould have been 200, 000 tons at most.    We should then have had to buyat least 400, 000 tons more at the world price, at an extra cost of up to 100 million.    We should probably have had to accept Australian terms which would have meant paying more than the full European economic community price for several years.    We might well have prejudiced the chances of a good deal for the developing Commonwealth (the Communityscheme on the other hand gives the Community an incentive to pay them a realistic price so as to save heavy subsidy costs).    We should certainly have prejudiced the chance of securing an increase in our productionquota.    We should have found it very hard to explain to the British peoplewhy we had turned down the chance of a subsidy on the whole of our deficit in exchange for an inadequate (perhaps non-existent) quantity of Australiansugar at an apparently higher price.3. These arguments would apply equally to any attempt to reopen the deal.    I regarded the deal, moreover, as fully within the instructionsI had been given.    I therefore accepted it without reservation, and I do not feel that I can seek to reopen it.1
4. I suggest that our task now isi. to make sure that the Community scheme is operatedeffectively and that the great bulk of the subsidised sugar comes to United Kingdom refineries for refining;ii. to secure agreement as soon as possible to acceptablelong-term arrangements under Protocol 22 lor the developingC omm on we alth;iii. n  to consider further with Australia what contribution theycan make to our requirements, eg. by supplying sugar under theCommunity arrangement or, on a commercial basis, for re-export;and -iv. to consider the future structure of the refining industry,and the possibility of refining more beet sugaijat the ports.F ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food28 October 19742
SUGAR - ANNEXSugar Supplies1.   The United Kingdom normally consumes about 2.6 million tons of sugar annually.   In the past that has been met by 1.3m tons(i.e. 1.4m tons of raw sugar) from the developing Commonwealth underthe Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSa); about 300,000 tons from australia; and about 900,000 tons from home-produced beet sugar.Small quantities have been imported at the world price or from the eec to make up any deficit.2.   In the next twelve months these normal supplies will be greatly reduced.   In 1974 the West Indies are sending us 300,000 tons lessthan their quota; their exports to us over the next twelve months,even following a satisfactory arrangement under Protocol 22, may wellin practice be no more than the 1974 level or even less.   They prefer to sell to the US or elsewhere at the very high world price.   Otherdeveloping Commonwealth countries will probably send us more thanin the past; but their production seasons are in.the second halfof the year so this does not greatly help the supply situation overthe next twelve months.   Australia is due to send only the last150,000 tons of CSA sugar in this period; they have no obligationto supply in 1975.   Our home crop has been hit by bad weather anddisease and at 600,000 tons is 350,000 tons below the first estimate.These three factors make up a shortfall of 800,000 tons.   But inaddition our refiners have an obligation to pay back, by exports,200,000 tons of sugar borrowed from the world market in 1974.&apos;  Sowe need to import a million tons of sugar from somewhere.   The most that other e.c. member countries can be expected to have available forus is 400,000 tons, which will of course come to us at Communitymarket prices.   That leaves a deficit of at least 600,000 tons II(worth  275 million at the current world price of over  400 a ton).Australia3.   The Australian position has changed fundamentally since the negotiation of the Treaty of Accession.   Then the world price waslow, and the Australians wanted a three-year phasing out of their.
sugar exports to the UK over 1975-77-   Protocol 16 (which deals withdamage to third country interests) might have allowed this if theworld price had stayed low, and the previous Administration promisedsupport for the Australian request.   Now that the world price isvery high, however, the Australians reject phasing out, which nolonger&apos;has any attractions for them.4.   When I began talks with Australia in July about the possibilityof a continuing supply of Australian sugar, they said that they// 1 &apos;f;&quot;?:S ii..would reserve for us until September an extra 200,000 tons fromtheir 1974 crop (their 1975 crop could not begin-to reach here tillAugust 1975).   But this was conditional on our making a new agreement for not less than five years and for at least 500,000 tons a year,at a price which would start at the Australian dollar equivalent of / 140 a ton f.o.b. (compared with e.c. intervention and thresholdprices equivalent respectively to  95 and  115 f.o.b.).   Moreoverthey wanted this price to escalate automatically with increases inEEC prices so that it would stay above them.   I did not settle forthese terms, but in September I tried to get the necessary coverfrom the Council of Ministers to enable me to conclude a deal with australia.   This meant trying to get the Council to agree that theAustralian sugar would never be subject to an import levy thatwould make it unsaleable.The Commission&apos;s proposals.    when I put this to the Council, Mr Lardinois, the agriculturalCommissioner ,   pointed to the fact that a long-term government-to-government deal with Australia was inconsistent with Article 11$ ofthe Treaty of Rome.   He recognised our immediate difficulty oversupplies, but argued that a short-term Community shortage should bemet by short-term action.   Whatever case we might make for access to community markets for low-priced food from third countries, hethought it difficult for us to argue that long-term access shouldbe secured for a foodstuff at well above Community prices.   Tomeet our supply difficulty he put forward instead a proposal for theCommunity to subsidise imports from the world market.   The schemewas not for a straight subsidy of the difference between world andEEC prices.   The importer was to be allowed to export the samequantity of beet sugar from the 1975 Community crop.   This would give2.office I^EN 11^^.L
him a profit, which in turn should mean that he could operate witha smaller rate of import subsidy.   The subsidy would be allocated toimporters on the basis of competitive tendering, and the importerwould have to sell at prices geared to the threshold price equivalentto about  115 a ton (f.o.b. raw sugar).   Other member countries didnot react to the proposal at that stage.   I promised only to considerit.Australian reactions6.   Soon after the September Council, Mr Patterson, AustralianMinister for Northern Development, came to London to see Peter Shoreand myself.   He told us categorically that Australia was not interestedin any deal with the UK which was not endorsed by the Community;indeed their preference was for a deal with the Community as such.He reluctantly agreed to try to go on reserving 200,000 tons of sugaruntil the next Council meeting on 21 October.   But after consultinghis industry he wrote to me to say that &quot;because of its own growingproblems Australia must retain its freedom to dispose of all or partof the sugar being reserved from the 1974 crop if subsequent eventsshow that it is in our overriding interests to do so&quot;: in other words,it might be sold to Japan if Australian interests so dictated.After his return, Australian officials told mine that even without a japanese deal they could no longer guarantee that 200,000 tons wouldbe available, for their crop was turning out less well than had beenforecast.The Cabinet decision7.   It was against this background that first the EQ Committee andthen the Cabinet considered the line I should take in the Council on21 October.   It was agreed that I should try to get the Council td  ,approve both the Commission proposal and a long-term deal with australia; that if the Council would not give an open-ended commitment to subsidise sugar imports I should insist on endorsement of an australian deal; that in the last resort I should accept the Commissionproposal without endorsement of an Australian deal, subject to theneed to obtain the best possible assurance that a Community subsidy for our sugar supplies would not be limited to one year only; thatI should aeek the strongest assurances that the proposal would be&apos;3.CONFIDENTIAL
made to work effectively, without regard to cost; and that I should give no undertakings which would close the doors to further talks with Australia.8.   It was also agreed that I should seek a bigger production quota for the UK; that if necessary I could agree to the Community&apos;s seeking to raise production to the level of its consumption; and that I should try to get the Council to endorse a price of at least  14-0 for the developing Commonwealth under Protocol 22 (which we have alwaysinterpreted as requiring access for 1.4m tons at a fair price) in1975* so as to maximise the quantity of sugar we could expect from them.The Council of 21 October9.   At the Council I carried out these instructions.   I pressed for both the Commission proposal and the Australian deal.   Other member countries made it very clear, however, that they regarded theCommission&apos;proposal as making an Australian deal unnecessary, andthat they would not agree to both.   Indeed the difficulty was toget the Germans to agree to the Commission proposal without settingdestructive limits to its cost.   After the scheduled one-day meeting had gone through a second day, the Council at ]ast agreed on thefollowing decision:-&quot;On the basis of Article 16 of Regulation. 1009/67/e.c.(the basic sugar regulation) the Council agrees to adopt themeasures necessary to ensure an adequate supply of sugarthroughout the Community for the 1974/1975 marketing year, .at common prices, the costs being financed by the Communityunder the 1975 FEOGA budgetary provisions.   The first stage -is for the Council to adopt the appropriate Regulationproposed by the Commission for an amount of 200,000 metric tons.   The Council will decide on further stages in the lightof experience and depending on the effectiveness of this measure&quot;.PitThus the Council commitment is to cover the whole deficit.   If theCommission^ scheme does not work efficiently the Council is committedV;-vftft&apos;-ftH&apos;-    .&quot;- &apos; . &apos;   i I&apos;,&apos;--   A&apos; ....... ,.       . -.&apos;to adopting a better one.10.   In order to ensure that this commitment was indeed open-endedI insisted on two understandings, which are recorded in the Council4.
minutes: first that there should be no limit on the cost of the sugar import subsidy as such; secondly, that the subsidy should haveexactly the same claim on FEOGA as any other item of expenditure.I did not succeed in getting a Council commitment to more than oneyear: the Community&apos;s practice is to reach decisions of this kind,within the context of a basic commodity regulation, separately foreach marketing year.   But the Commission accepted the need to cover any continuing Community deficits and said that they would want their scheme extended to,cover 1975/6.   1 gave, no undertaking that we wouldnot continue to talk with Australia.   I secured an increase of140,000 tons in our basic quota.   Under the arrangements for 1975the full e.c. price will apply to maximum as well as basic quota.As a result the full guarantee will apply to 1.5m tons - about 40%more than our maximum previous production.   I had to agree toincrease in quotas for others too, designed to increase theCommunity1s sugar production.   It was not possible in thecircumstances of this meeting to secure the endorsement of, a priceof  140 for the developing Commonwealth, though such remarks as other member countries made were encouraging.   I did get agreement, hxnvever,-to press forward the consideration of the Protocol 22 sugararrangements and, in the absence of a decision from the next foreign ministers&apos; Council, to deal with them at the next Agricultural Council(18-19 November).   We remain determined to get access for 1.4m tons at a price of not less than  140.Public Reactions11.   Public reaction to the agreement has concentrated On theimmediate questions of supplies and prices and has in general beenmarkedly favourable.The Port Refineries12.   There has however been criticism from the port refiners, theirworkers and the backbenchers who speak for them.   They argue that thedeal offers no long-term assurance&apos;/of a supply of raw sugar for the   Jiport refineries; and they are doubtful about the extent to which our refiners will be able to bid competitively for the subsidisedsugar since, it is argued, they may find it difficult to buyCommunity beet sugar forward from the 1975 crop.5.
13*   It is true that the method of competitive tendering does not give an absolute assurance that our refiners will secure the great bulk of the subsidised imports.   We shall need to work closely withthem and the Commission so as to maximise their chances of securingthe supply, and this may call for help in funding the operation, andfor an approach to the British Sugar Corporation to sell them sugarfrom the 1975 crop.   If in the event they do not secure the greaterpart of the first POO,000 tons we shall need to secure more effectivearrangements for succeeding quantities.   The main source of therefiners&apos; raw sugar supplies, in both the short and long term, howevermust be the developing Commonwealth countries under Protocol 22.   Therefiners recognise this but would clearly have liked a long-term dealwith Australia as well, and are reluctant to take a realistic viewof the difficulties in the way of such an agreement.   There arepossibilities of securing a higher future level of port refining than would otherwise be the case by having additional beet sugar refinedthere.   This raises the question of the future structure of therefining industry and I will be putting a paper on this to mycolleagues shortly.Assessment14. In my view the deal we have secured represents the best we could have achieved.   The only alternative would have been to try to insist on Council endorsement for a Community deal with AustraliaJIIHBhHSHBMHhMhHinstead of the Commissions scheme.   But even if we had secured thisoutcome, our immediate situation would have been worse, not better.Australia might have had no sugar at all immediately available forus and the quantity would have been 200,000 tons at most.   We should then have had to buy at least 400,000 tons more at the world price,at an extra cost of up to  100m.   We should probably have had.toaccept Australian terms which would have meant paying more than thefull e.c. price for several years.   We might well have prejudicedthe chances of a good deal for the developing Commonwealth (theCommunity scheme on the other hand gives the Community an incentive to pay them a realistic price so as to save heavy subsidy costs).We should certainly have prejudiced the chance of securing anincrease in our production quota.   We should have found it very hard to explain to the British people why we had turned down the chanceof a subsidy on the whole of our deficit in exchange for an inadequate(perhaps non-existent) quantity of Australian sugar at an apparentlyhigher price.
