THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO&quot;VERNIffiNTC(74) 125 COPY NO   g jj1 November 1974. &apos; &apos; &apos;   &apos;&quot;&apos;. - U &apos; \CABINET    : - &apos;.RATES 1975/76:   LEVEL OF grant memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment.    We must reach decisions by the end of this month about the leveland the basis of distribution of rate support grant for 1975/76 and about the allied question of the level of the increase order for1974/75*   We need to take decisions in principle during the courseof next week, preliminary to the final round of consultations withthe local authority associations and the GLC leading to thepromulgation of our decisions on rate support grant at the end ofNovember.2.    This paper is concerned exclusively with the level of grant onwhich       Prime Minister held a preliminary meeting with the Ministersimmediatbly concerned.   I shall be putting a further paper to Cabineton the distribution of the grant for consideration at a subsequent meeting.5.    Last year the average increase in domestic rate demand was 30 percent.   This caused acute concern and in July we introduced a measure of relief for those whose rates had increased by over 20 per cent.   Duringthe summer I and some of my colleagues met the local authority associations and the GLC to consider the implications of the steeprise in rates in 1974/75 and the prospect of an ovon larger increasein 1975,-76*   I warded local authorities of the gravity of the economicbackground against which local authority expenditure and rates had tobe considered, and obtained their agreement to study a number of expenditure options as the basis for our decisions for the coming year.4.     The key questions to which we have to address ourselves are -i. the acceptable level of local government expenditure for rate support grant purposes;ii. the tolerable level of rate increase;
iii. the split of grant between the increase order and next year&apos;rate support grant;iv. the measures open to us to contain local authority expenditure within the level agreed. .5,    If we were to do nothing to increase the grant, average domestic rates would increase next year by about 70 per cent over this year&apos;s level as modified by the July relief.   This would be intolerable politically and indelation to the.social contract.   At the meeting of MISC chaired by thePrime Minister we therefore decided to recommend the following line ofaction to the Cabinet - - &apos;\\. i. &apos; local authorities should be asked to hold expenditure in 1975/76to this year&apos;s actual level subject only to inescapable commitments.Even this would involve a growth of local authority expenditure in real terms of about if per cent as. contrasted with a rate of growth of about 8 per cent in 1972/73 and 1973/74.   It is however as far aswe can go without major disruption of current programmes and policy.ii.   the level of grant would have to be increased to the extentrequired to restrict the average increase in domestic rates to atolerable level.  At the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting there was a difference of opinion on &quot;what this should be.   In my judgement anaverage 25 per cent increase in domestic rates represents the maximumbearable;   in the judgement of&quot;the Chancellor of the Exchequer weshould be prepared to accept an increase on average of 35 Ver cent.If we go for the lower figure we shall moderate the political and social:impact of a second successive, major increase in rates;   if wego for the higher figure we shall be exerting fiercer pressure on local authorities to contain expenditure, but at the risk of furtherendangering the chances of holding the social contract.. With 25 percent the additional Exchequer expenditure would be about  640 million,with 35 per cent about  471 million.   Whichever figure we go for,there will be a wide range of increase around it,\:.&quot;.&apos;&apos;-&apos;.&apos; -      .  &apos;    ::\ :.       -&quot; : &quot;   %       &apos; : /:&apos; : :   j Pr:;/     \\2
iii. the additional support required from Government, whether rates are held at 25 per cent or 35 per cent, should be divided between theincrease order and next yearfs grant, the object being to cover in theincrease order the gross underestimation for inflation resulting from our predecessors1 settlement for this year and to moderate the inevitable rate of increase in grant for next year.iv. in negotiating a settlement on these lines with the localgovernment associations we should put great pressure on them to i \undertake to hold employment of local government staffs broadly atpresent levels and to set up monitoring arrangements to achieve this.With,labour counting for 60 per cent of local government expenditureon the relevant services, control of manpower is of special importance as evidenced by the very large increases in the last 2 years.v. Finally, we must be prepared to issue detailed guidance to localauthorities on the Governmenfs priorities so that they know quite clearly which services we are prepared to see held at their present levels or even curtailed and what expansion we consider inescapable andtherefore compatible with the settlement.   This guidance would stopshort of direction to local authorities about their expenditurepatterns but it would make responsibility quite clear.5.    In the attached Annex I have shown the consequences of these proposals interms of holding the increase in domestic rates next year at 25 per cent or35 per cent on average.   In broad terms a 25 per cent increase in the domesticrate represents about 0.75 per cent increase on the retail price index.6.     I invite the Cabinet -i. to approve this approach to the level of rates and rate support grant for 1975/76ii. to decide between 25 per cent and 35 per cent as the tolerablelevel of increase in domestic rates.A department of the environment November 1974.       -&apos;     -&apos;     confidential
