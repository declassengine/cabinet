THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 1211 November 1974CABINET\\   PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES:THE OVERSEAS AID programme memorandum by the Minister of Overseas development . I fully appreciate the public expenditure problems outlined in the chancellors paper (C(74) 120); and I would like to acknowledge theconsiderate hearing I have had in my bilateral discussion with theChief Secretary.    Nevertheless, I mustput to Cabinet the special case,even in our present difficult situation, for a meaningful increase in the aid programme, particularly for next year.2. The PESC figures would lead to a decHne in real terms from thisyear to next and I am grateful to the Chancellor for suggestingsympathetic consideration for an increase of  9 millions.    However,this represents only a standstill in real terms, and will be clearlyrecognised as such.    It is very difficult to estimate future scoresagainst the international target of 0. 7 per cent of GNP, but on thebest forecast I can make this standstill would mean that we should standnext year, as last year, at 0. 35 per cent.    I must ask my colleagues to consider the need for an increase of  30 million in the aid programme for 1975-76, the year about which I am most concerned.    This would bean important measure of our intent, and would represent a recognisableincrease in the aid programme in real terms as well as bringing ourscore to 0. 37 per cent.    For later years I would accept the PESCfigures, while resisting the proposed cut of  10 million in the final year.3. There are compelling reasons for such an increase, which ismodest enough in scale:i.    If we exclude defence and the administrative costs of theForeign and Commonwealth Office, the aid programme is theonly element of our public spending directly affecting andhelping the outside world.    In this sense aid expenditure should be measured against the total of our domestic spendingrather than against the spending of individual Departments.    Atthe increased level I seek, it would represent only 0. 9 per cent of total public expenditure.COPY NO    m n79
ii.     There is a profound moral case for a socialist Governmentto give a sincere priority to overseas aid, which I need not argue.It was fully expressed in our Manifesto.    In the recent cabinet discussion of the CPRS review of strategy and priorities(CC(74) 38th Conclusions) it was noted that the Manifestocommitment should be regarded as a moral imperativetaking precedence over all others.    The Queen&apos;s Speechsaid:  &quot;My Government recognise the economic problemsconfronting the developing countries and will seek to increasethe provision of aid&quot;, and this has been warmly welcomed bythe voluntary organisations, who take it as an implicitcommitment.    To fail to fulfil it will present the Governmentwith some political difficulties from a highly articulate and now very considerable group.iii. There is now also a most important economic case forincreased aid.    The countries most severely affected by the crisis in oil and commodity prices, which include our majorclients, face catastrophe, as the CPRS review clearlyindicated.    If their economies collapse, not only will theycease to be effective trading partners for Britain (and thereis a trade spin-off of some 18 per cent of British exports to developing countries) but the danger of world recessionaffecting the industrialised countries will be intensified; andwe acknowledge this to be even more serious than the risks involved in the inflationary situation.    The economic crisisfor the most seriously affected developing countries bringswith it the danger of political instability, which would inevitably follow economic breakdown.    Informed economicobservers have reported to me in the last week their anxietiesabout what could happen in India and Bangladesh.    It is clearly in our own direct interest to do whatever can be done to avoid this.    There has never been a greater element of self-interest,on both these counts, for providing more economic assistance-especially to those poorest and hardest hit countries to whichthe CPRS review (C(74) 110) gave emphasis.iv. Our own aid effort has significant consequences in the&quot;matching&quot; by other countries, as has been evident in our recent insistence that the e.c. should make available a first part of its contribution to the United Nations emergency measures.    But a corollary of this is that our aid performanceshould not be measurably worse than the countries we seek to influence.    The general aid prospects of donor countries arenot good, because the United States, Germany and France seemunlikely to do particularly well next year.    Even so, theGermans stressed last week in Paris at the meeting of ministers of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD that theywill have an aid increase of 9 per cent next year (against an
estimated current rate of inflation of 7 per cent), and the americans hope for Congress approval of considerable increases in food aid.    Other projections, some provided orally by ministers of other countries and not in strictly comparable terms,are summarised below.    They are expressed in cash, andtherefore need to be measured against rates of inflation.Next vear&apos;s %    % Current Rate of increase in aid   inflation (estimated)Canada 25 11Japan 35 23Sweden 35 9New Zealand 75 1,0Norway 40 9The Netherlands aim to reach 1. 2 per cent) of GNP next yearand Denmark expect to increase aid by 7 per cent against ageneral budget cut of 10 per cent.4. For all these reasons, I am convinced that we must allow 30 million more for overseas aid next year.    It is in our ownconsidered interests to do so, and in the present condition of the thirdworld, our own moral intent must now be underwritten by a positivefinancial response. i 1J HMinistry of Overseas development  November 1974
