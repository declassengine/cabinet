THIS DOCOlvIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BBIT/fflIC MAJESTY-S GOVEHNMEHT0(74) 11829 October 1974INTERNATIONAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT (INDUSTRIAL) LIMITEDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industryl.i   The Convenors of the Shop Stewards of International Property Development(industrial) Limited(IPD) have applied for a grant of  3*9 million toenable them to acquire the business from the Receiver and run it as aworkers&apos; Co-operative, employing 913.- - ;     - PSK     V&apos;.-    12o     This factory has had a most unhappy history, it was originally owned by Fisher and Ludlow and has changed hands frequently!   it was the scene of a &apos;sit in* in January 1972, resolved only after the intervention ofthe Prime Minister.   IPD took over the factory in 1972 and was offeredfinancial assistance in 1973 hy the previous Government, but thecompany were unable to fulfil the conditions of the offer and reappliedfor assistance.3o     On my recommendation we agreed last June that assistance to thatfirm - IPD Industrial - should not be providedbut agreed that proposals could be submitted to use the present factory and work force for a viablescheme.   To this end I commissioned Consultants to prepare a feasibilitystudy and their expertise was made available to the workers.   Whenthe company failed in July? I was also authorised to tell the receiver that the Government was a potential buyer for the factory.   the consultants have helped the workers to prepare their present proposalsybut they are not responsible for the assumptions on which the proposals were based.4.     The workers&apos; proposals are based on a strategy of expanding the market to absorb the present production of IPD Industrial, particularly as regardscontract   engineering   and night otcrsge.heatera.      They intend tocontinue the present pattern of production for the time being, but willif necessary adjust it to make it profitable*.. 1  ,confidentialCOPY NO rj/9CABINET
5*     The Convenors propose to recruit professional management to run the factory with three worker directors.   Decisions of major significancefor the Workers, would he submitted for approval to the work force as a whole.   A non-executive &quot;implementation review group&quot; would alsobe set up to involve the workers generally in a detailed review of progress.6. The workers&apos; application was considered by the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Development.   The Committee were, on balance, in favourof support for the proposed workers8 Co-operative.   The Receiver has- \\      &apos;; \.&quot;&apos;.Y;;y;:^v,,   . ;.V&apos;: ,      , &quot;v- Jft&apos;;v--.v.; f&apos;:&apos;:since agreed to keep the business going for a further week, ie until4 November, on the terms previously agreed whereby the,Government is making a grant towards his losses, but he&quot;has made it clear thatthere can be no further extension.7.    The arguments for assisting the Co-operative are as follows -a.     Male unemployment in Merseyside exceeds 9 &quot;5 per cent andin Kirby it is still higher.   If assistance is refused, the receiver will close the factory after the end of this week andthrow the men out of work.   There is no real prospect of alternative employment for them, and they will not understand oraccept our decision,bo     These are determined people who, having experienced redundancybefore, are intent on making the Co-operative a commercial success.Sales have continued at a high level even during the. period ofreceivership, and on the basis of enquiries coming in the workers are confident that orders will come in at an even higher level once the^reseht^long period of uncertainty is over.   They have emphasised their willingness to make whatever changes - including a reduction of the labour force - appear necessary in the lightof experience to ensure the survival of the Co-operative.   the financing proposals include a contingency of  500,000 which theworkers are confident will be enough.c.    The assistance proposed represents a cost per job of some 4,300.   This is well within the normal cost per job maximum for selective assistance projects of  5,000.   Even if the Government2
were to acquire the factory, for up to  2 million, this acquisitionwould represent an addition to the stock of factories in the assisted areas already owned by my Department?   the factorywould be leased to the Co-operative at an economic rent.   Thus,the cost of the acquisition, if that should prove necessary,would not count against the project cost - anj more than it doesin other cases where the Government is the landlord.d.    The Co-operative represents an important experiment in workerparticipation in management: which could be very significant for industry generally, x8.    In the light of the foregoing argumentSg I invite the Cabinet toagree to the proposal endorsed by the majority of members of the ministerial Committee on Industrial Development, namely, that -i. Assistance of up to  3*9 million, less any money providedby the workers, should be provided to enable the workers toacquire the business of IPD Industrial, from the Receiver andrun it as a workers&apos; Co-operative.   Government assistance wouldbe given on a onoe for all basis.ii. The Government should if necessary, take steps to ensuresecurity of tenure for the Co-operative by acquiring       factory at a cost in the region of  2 million.A W BIgliilSf -: :/..  , ^vliilllillllli?Department of Industry29 October 1974 U
