NATIONAL CONSUMERS1 AGENCY[To &quot;be presented by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection to Parliament by Command of Her MajestySeptember 1974]INTRODUCTIONEvery one of us is a consumer, so measures to ensure that therights of consumers are respected and their interests taken in^oproper account are of concern to us all.   The Department ofPrices and Consumer Protection, since it was established by thepresent Government in March 1974-* has been studying what needs to be done to: redress the balance between the consumers and theproviders of goods and services and ensure that the voice of theconsumer is properly heard at national level.2   The law is not today the main problem.   Compared with fifteen years ago, the fundamental consumer protection law on quantity,description and similar matters has been notably improved.   Inparticular the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 swept away a great dealof outdated law, and has for the greater part proved sound, although some problems which practical experience of its working have raisedare now being reviewed by a Departmental Committee under theChairmanship of the Director General of Pair Trading.   It is alsonow widely recognised that nineteenth century contract law was based on an unreal assumption that buyers and sellers had equalbargaining power.   Recent legislation, particularly the supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 and the new Consumer Credit Act,recognises that in unregulated bargaining the individual consumeris at a very substantial disadvantage compared with suppliers ofgoods and services, and these measures prevent the imposition ofunreasonably onerous terms on him.   The Law Commissions will

For dealing with theindividual unfair trader or the unfair trade practice detrimental to    consumers, the Fair Trading Act 1973 provides the director general of Fair Trading with flexible weapons for taking actioneither in the courts or by initiating secondary legislation.   Itis too early to assess the effectiveness of these in operation;if deficiencies appear here or in other consumer protectionlegislation the Government will not hesitate to propose new legislation to rectify them.3   Just as it is important that there should be a fair system of consumer law, so it is necessary that consumers should benefitto the full from its provisions.   Many consumers are still unaware of the new laws that protect them.   There is, therefore, a needfor a service of advice and help to be available locally so thatexperienced and impartial people can assist those who have consumerproblems or seek guidance.   Local weights and measures authoritieshave this statutory function, and with the encouragement ofGot e.r n m e n t local authorities have generally respondedwith enthusiasm to public feeling that consumer advice is now a service that ought to be widely available.   In toi-ms many advicecentres in shopping areas axe now open or planned, and various methods for making consumer advice available in less densely populated areas (such as mobile consumer shops and pre-paidcomplaint cards) are being tried and established.   The Governmentwelcomes all these developments.   It is also assisting the expansion and improvement of the Citizens&apos; Advice Bureaux which perform amost valuable role in extending the geographical coverage of consumer advice.
affairs have long considered that there is a gap in the spectrumof bodies which represent the consumer.   This gap was widened bythe disappearance of the Consumer Council, which operated intwo main ways.   One of those was by making information availableto consumers.   This is now one of the functions of the director general of Fair Trading.   The second main role of the ConsumerCouncil was as a partisan body to promote action for furtheringand safeguarding consumers&apos; interests.   This gap cannot suitablybe filled by the Director General whose role in respect ofmonopolies, mergers, restrictive practices and consumer creditprecludes him from acting exclusively in the interest of consumers.Existing consumer bodies have played a most valuable role on behalfof the consumer, doing much to make the consumer voice heard, and consumer interests have greatly benefited by their efforts.   Butthere remains a lack of any independent national consumer bodysufficiently representative and influential to ensure that thosewho take decisions which will affect the consumer can have &apos;a balanced and authoritative view before them.ESTABLISHMENT OP THE AGENCY5   The Government proposes to fill this gap by the establishmentof a National Consumers&apos; Agency financed by the Government.   those concerned in the production of goods and services are extensivelyinvolved with Government in the national counsels through the tuc and the CBI.   The role of the consumer in economic activityis as important as that of the producer, and the Government considersthat the consumer ought through the new Agency to have a similarjopportunity to be heard.6  Workpeople and management have each formed their own self-financedunions and associations because there is a direct and obvious needfor them to bargain collectively, and they gain direct benefits from doing so.   The benefits which will be gained from the consumerCONFIDENTIAL
voice being heard properly will be shared by all.   Indeed it is theinarticulate and disadvantaged who most need a body to speak forthem and ensure that they are protected, and it is they whose needshave least been met   by the consumer activities of the last decade.The Government believes that the new body proposed will be in aposition to insist that the interests of all consumers, includingthe least articulate, should be taken into account.FUNCTIONS AND APPOINTMENT of THE AGENCY7   The functions the Government envisages for the Agency are:-a) to make representations of the consumer view to central andlocal Government, to the Director General of Pair Trading,to industry, and to any other quarter where the consumervoice ought to be heeded.   This will include making representations on the law and on proposed legislation;on advertising standards and methods; on the adequacy andavailability of consumer advice services; on consumerinterests during the remaining stages of metrication; andon the availability of facilities for testing productsafety and suitability;b) to be available to be consulted by those who seek a consumerview on policies and proposals.   In particular, the Agencywill consider and report on the consumer interest in matters referred to it by the Government;c) to represent the consumer on appropriate Government andother bodies, and within the framework of international organisations such as the European Community;d) to review the present arrangements for consumer representation in the nationalised industries as part of the government&apos;s policy of enabling the nationalised industries to be moreresponsive to the consumer&apos;s needs.Existing consumer bodies will of course be able to make
CONFIDENTIALrepresentations direct&apos; to   the Government as at present, if they wish, and the Government will continue to consult them directlywhere appropriate.8   The Agency will he a non-statutory body, with a Chairman and members appointed by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection.   This will in no way prejudice its independence and freedom to criticise the Government.   To operate effectively the agency&apos;s membership will need to be limited.   Part of the member-ship will be appointed in a representative capacity.   The mainconsumer and women&apos;s bodies will be invited to submit short lists of nominees from which the Secretary of State will make appointments.The remainder of the members will be appointed by the Secretary ofState in an individual capacity.   There will be special arrangementsfor Scotland and Wales; the membership of the Agency from each country, together with additional members, will form nationalcommittees with separate offices.   There will be correspondingarrangements for Northern Ireland recognising the responsibilities of the Northern Ireland authorities in this field under the NorthernIreland Constitution Act 1973.NATIONALISED INDUSTRY CONSUMER COUNCILS9  When the nationalised industry consumer councils were set up bythe nationalisation statutes for the coal, gas, electricity, and surface transport industries, and for the Post Office, they were- it : -   &apos; -f    &apos; i&apos; &apos;an important innovation in the consumer&apos;s interest.   Now that aseparate Department of Prices and Consumer Protection has been created, the Government has decided that certain statutoryfunctions in respect of these councils should be transferred tothat Department.   Accordingly, once the National Consumers&apos; Agencyhas been established, appointments to the councils will be madeby the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection,with the advice of the Agency or its appropriate national
Committee, and after consultation with the Minister responsiblefor the industry.   Members of the Scottish electricity consultativecouncils will continue to be appointed by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, with the advice of the Agency&apos;s Scottish Committee.Keferences to the councils will be made jointly by the minister responsible for the industry and the Secretary of State for Pricescouncils1 representations and reports and Consumer Protection, who will both receive the     Any consequentdirections to the industry would be given by the Minister responsible for the industry, after consulting the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protectionabout the decision.   The Government will be able to seek the advice of the Agency in exercising its functions in relation to these /councils.   The Government will also in due course introduce legislation so that all the councils are financed directly by theGovernment.OPERATION OP THE AGENCY10   The establishment of the National Consumers&apos; Agency will not affect in any way the position and responsibilities of the director general of Pair Trading under the Fair Trading Act 1973.   Likewiseunaffected will be the operation of the Consumer ProtectionAdvisory Committee, whose function is to advise on consumer trade practices referred to it which may adversely affect the economic interests of consumers and on remedies the Director General may-propose under Part II of the Fair Trading Act.11   The National Consumers&apos; Agency will concern itself closely with the adequacy and availability of assistance for consumers with individual problems.   It will not itself handle individual consumercomplaints and cases; these will continue to be dealt with by theexisting range of agencies - consumer advice centres, tradingstandards departments of local authorities, Citizens&apos; Advice
Bureaux, nationalised industry consumer and consultative councils and others.12   Central and local Government are expanding their services to consumers, and the new Agency will be available to advise them on these, and on the many problems individuals face in the provisionof public sector services.   It has been an important role of consumer organisations in the past to promote adequate arrangementsfor consumer representation in these areas.   Where there arebodies already established for this purpose, the Agency will naturally wish to work in consultation and co-operation with them,and not in competition.   It is not intended that the setting up ofthe Agency will in any way affect the responsibilities of localauthorities, or derogate from the customary consultations with local Government through the local authority associations.   Noris it the intention that the Agency will supersede or duplicatethe work of bodies with an existing responsibility for looking after consumer interests in specific areas such as the health service, the nationalised industries or broadcasting.   The Agency&apos;sSole    in all these fields will primarily be one of ensuring that adequate mechanisms exist for expressing the consumer voice, andof drawing attention to matters of concern to consumers.1&apos;3   The problem of the control of advertising in the public interestwill impinge widely on the work of the Agency.   It will have aparticular responsibility to advise the Director General of PairTrading in respect of his important functions in connection with^ advertising as well as making its views on the subject known tothe Government and the advertising industry.   The present systemof control combines voluntary self-regulation by the industry anda wide variety of specific statutory provisions.   The Governmentis reviewing this system and in deciding whether further legislationCONFIDENTIAL
is required will wish to take account of the views of the Agencywhen it is established, of the outcome of the review of the TradeDescriptions Act 1968 now being carried out, and of any improvementsthere may be in the voluntary system.CONCLUSION14   The Government considers that the setting up of a NationalConsumers&apos; Agency will go far to strengthen the position and influence of the ^ordinary consumer.   Coupled with the strengthening of the system of price control and the new powers in connectionwith price marking and unit pricing in the Prices Act, and withthe greatly improved protection for the consumer in borrowinggiven by the Consumer Credit Act, it demonstrates the continuingdetermination of the Government to ensure a fair deal for theconsumer in all aspects of our national life.
