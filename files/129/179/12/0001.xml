DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC-MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 102 COPY NO10 September 1974&apos;. /in :&apos;   II &quot;cabinet public EXPENDITURE TO 1978-79Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. In their discussion on public expenditure on 26 July Ministers gavetwo instructions to the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS): first toexamine the scope for savings and wider provision through greaterausterity in the standards of equipment and buildings financed from public sector programmes, including the possibility of low-cost housing;and, secondly, in consultation with the Treasury, to examine certain widerissues affecting public expenditure and the need to contain it,2.        The first of these remits is discharged at Annex 1 and we recommendMinisters to instruct Departments to initiate the necessary work as amatter of urgency,3.        In carrying out the second remit, we have identified a few areas where savings might be made; these are set out in Annex 2 and werecommend Ministers to instruct Departments to initiate the necessarywork.4.        We also concluded that a piecemeal review of public expenditure programmes cannot achieve the savings which are necessary, if the growth of current and planned programmes is to be contained.    An effective reviewcan only be carried out against a set of criteria, which relate to theGovernments overall objectives.1 POSITIVE&apos; CRITERIA //&quot;.//5.        It was pointed out in the Cabinet discussion that some parts ofpublic expenditure are important for the social contract and others for achieving greater industrial productivity.    The CPRS believe there is   !a prima facie case for exempting the following types of expenditure, sofar as possible, from cuts;a. Investment in exploiting indigenous fuels and energy saving.b. Productive industrial investment with a high rate of return in the short to medium term.f* P- F* f-^&quot;
c. Expenditure directly related to short-term improvements inthe balance of payments.d. Expenditure on the efficient redeployment of manpowerresources.e. Pension uprating and other social spending which concen-trates help on those most in need. \\1 NEGATIVE&apos; CRITERIA6.        It would also be worth defining criteria which might help to identifycandidates for cuts.    The CPRS believes there is a prima facie case forlooking more closely at programmes satisfying the following general conditions:a. Where Public Expenditure Survey figures! explicitly orimplicitly allow for an improvement in standards,b. Where there are very wide variations in existing standards(thus indicating that some may be unnecessarily.high).e.        Where the benefits are indiscriminate or disproportionatelyconcentrated on the better-off (eg some subsidies), or on a small minority (perhaps localised).d. Where demand for the service in question might decline asthe result of outside events (eg a fall in the birth rate), of a policydecision which Ministers might take soon (eg to raise nationalised industry prices), or of the general economic situation (eg adeceleration in the growth of road freight transport).7.        V/e recommend that Ministers should agree these or some otherset of criteria, against which Departments and the Treasury can examinepublic expenditure programmes.    The only alternative is to accept the bluntand naive instrument of an across-the-board percentage cut,Cabinet Office ///10 September 1974
i 4ANNEX public EXPENDITURE SAVINGS THROUGH LOWER STANDARDS1.        In theiif remit to the CPR3 on public expenditure economies, the Cabinetlaid particular emphasis on the search for savings through greater austerityin the standards of equipment and buildings in the public sector, includingthe possibility of low-cost housing.   As the first stage of this stud;,-,.therefore, we examined industrialised building methods and factory built homes;then, on the basis of - the criteria set out above^we looked for other ways of reducing public expenditure.   We report below solely on those areas where wehave identified possible savings which could be made, or which we believe could produce savings after further critical study;:   in each case Ministers will haveto decide.whether the lower standards would be acceptable.INDUSTRIALISED BUILDING2.        By industrialised building, we mean systems where large components aremanufactured under factory conditions of production and tight quality controland erected on the site.   The advantages of industrialised building systems arespeed of erection, high quality control, lesser dependence on the (seasonal)building trades, lower design costs per marginal unit, and standardised components .and procedures.   The disadvantages are uniformity of layout and appearance,certain1&apos; structural limitations and the initial expenses of installing the necessarycapital equipment and the consequent need for long runs for the systems to beeconomic.   The disadvantages have more force in the field of housing, where with experience of industrialised housing local authorities have greatly reduced their demand for it.   Vie feel that industrialised building can be best regarded as anadjunct to the house building industry, rather than as a technique capableof substantial expansion.3.        This is less true of building for institutional use; &apos; in this areaindustrialised building is widely thought to be good value for money.   However,in the past, industrialised systems have competed with traditional systems withinthe price constraint of cost yardsticks and have been planned and costedaccordingly;    if the price competition were against a common standard, costsavings should be possible.   Costs could also be reduced with continuity ofordering.   Local government reorganisation should make this easier in the educational field.   The Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) is developing a system oi standardised design modules for hospital departments;   this work should continue, but further work is needed to identify the cost savings which could be achieved.   We recommend that a thorough study of the potentialcost advantages of industrialised building techniques over conventional (buildingmethods should be set in hand by the Department of Education and Science (DES)and DKSS, with the assistance of the Property Services Agency.HOUSING4*        Moveable HousesThese houses are built, entirely in the factory, often in two sections, and aretransported to site, where they are connected to existing services and are ready for immediate occupation.   Their initial cost is marginally less (up to 10yi)than that of conventional housing of the same area.   They can meet Parker-Morrisstandards for three person homes (or smaller) and, s lthoug&quot;-* they cannot provide
high site densities (as they are inherently single storey units), their speed of construction and suitability for difficult ground conditions make them an attractive proposition for further study.   However, the expected life ofcurrently available factory built housing is under 30, years (compared with 60years plus for conventional housing);    this could probably be increased by improving the quality of the external cladding but will nevertheless createproblems of acceptability for loan finance, both in the public and private sectors.   In the longer term, this form of housing could become significantlycheaper than comparable conventional housing - given assembly line operations,bulk orders from local authorities, more economic techniques and longer life&quot;materials.   At present, the whole area is under-researched.   We recommendthat the Department of Environment (DOE) should set in hand studies on the scope for cost reductions,Up to a point, for every 1$ decrease in Parker-Morris space standards there isabout a 0.5$ decrease in cost per house.   If, for instancy pre-1967 space standardswere re-imposed and a mandatory cut in space of 6$ made, there would be a saving on 150,000 homes of roughly  30m.   Space savings would have to be concentrated in the living room or bedrooms, given the extended use of machines in kitchensand the unavoidable space constraints in bathrooms.   It is for decision whether an annual saving of  30m would outweigh the social costs of more crowded living  6. Lower Standards of Finish and Materials. One result of the continuing pressures exerted by the cost yardstick is thatmaterials are already used in the most economic way.   But a reduction in the quaand amount of kitchen fitting, which could be made up by the tenant, could savesome  7m over 150,000 homes.   It is for decision whether this saving outweighsthe social costs.7.        Provision of Car space in a recent survey of 100 new public sector schemes, it was found that whilealmost one car space was provided per dwelling, only 25/i of the households usedthese.   In the same survey, it was found that 29$ of households owned cars.   Areduction in the level of car provision down to one car space for every twodwellings might save in the order of  20m over 150,000 homes.   We recommendthat the provision of car space be reduced in new estates.8.        Simplification of DesignsA new generation of Coronation Streets with long, uniform terraces,.long runs,simplified and standardised designs, construction and fitting might lead to a saving of up to 3$ on the cost of a house.   If a further 10% of the .150,000houses in the programme were of this type, savings of  3m could be made.   It isfor deoisioi whether this saving outweighs the social cost.9. Reducing the level of Impr6vement GrantsVie have considered the possibility of reducing the rate of basic improvementgrant from 50$ to say 40$;   there is, however, no available evidence from whichthe effect of such a change on. applications for grants can be deduced,   However,the rate was increased in the assisted areas to 75$ for 1972 and 1973*   an analysis of the effects of these changes might throw some light on the sensitiviof the number of applications to the rate of grant.   We recommend that the DOELowering Housing Space Standardsrooms and bedrooms.make such an analysis.2
PRISONS10.       The &quot;bulk of the capital programme is directed towards reducing grossover-crowding in prisons (about one-third of the prison population is livingtwo or three in a cell designed for one), and to improving or replacing the worst of the Victorian prisons.     Lowering standards in closed prisons is aquestion of providing fewer amenities;   security considerations largely rule out the possibility of lower construction standards.   Savings of up to  2m overthe PE3  could be made by having communal washing and lavatory facilitiesrather than facilities in each cell, but only at the cost of perpetuatingthe chamber pot routine;   economies could also be made in the standards ofother facilities, eg recreation areas.      We do not recommend such savingssince the harmful effects on morale would more than outweigh the marginalsavings achieved.HOSPITALS11.       Bed Ratios-1   1  1 1 - 1       \\The growth of personal social services and improving treatment methods shouldgradually reduce the number of geriatric and mental patients needing longterm hospital care;    it should therefore be possible over a period to reducethe scale of provision of long stay hospital beds.   But because the presentprovision for mental patients in the community is small, and the numbers ofthe elderly are increasing, there will be little reduction in the need forlong stay beds in the PIS period.     For other conditions the national averageis 3.5 &quot;acute1 beds per 1000 population but the DHSS has recently designedhospitals with only 2 beds per 1000 for two areas where community health services have been developed to deal with early discharge from hospital.This loiter figure may be too low, and in some cases high bed ratios may bethe unavoidable consequence of outdated buildings.      We recommend that theDHSS should examine closely areas with provision of beds above the national average, to identify potential economies.12,       Extended use of short-life buildingsI    I    i   H i i   .    .......... It       i I I .    11 Ti   .I9hBVWVV&apos;VVIIIPMMHMK^&quot; &quot; )&apos;Short-life building is already put to two major uses in the hospital service:first, temporary accommodation attached to hospitals due for redevelopmentor being redeveloped;    secondly, the relief.of overcrowding, especially inaccommodation for geriatric cases, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped,since these groups of patients do not need the full facilities of an acutehospital.     The initial costs of short-life building- can be as low as 50$ ofthe cost of a comparable conventional building;   where the design, use andequipment of the building needs to be more complex, and its likely lifeincreases, the cost rises to 80-90$.     Savings can also be achieved throughupgrading rather than replacing existing buildings.      We recommend that theDHSS should continue to encourage the use of short-life buildings where theyare appropriate.13.       Hospital EquipmentGuidance on equipment for hospitals,, is regularly issued by the DHSS to health authorities.     The Department does hot, however, know in any detail how farthese guidelines are observed in practice.     Provided that health authoritybudgets are .iot seriously out of line with previous budgets, they are unlikely to be challenged by the DHSS.     There are one or two exceptions to this:   forexample, in developing a policy on radiotherapy, the DHSS has found it necessaryto regulate the distribution of linear accelerators.   The DHSS accepts that someequipment may be &quot;standing idle&quot; some of the time, and argues that this is
types of equipentjal)Virtually inevitable. But it is up to the hospital demanding such equipment in the first place to satisfy the regional authority that the need is such asto guarantee k satisfactory utilisation rate.     Apart from the more expensive &apos;development for specialised treatment and, for example, laboratoryequipment capable of large-scale automation of tests, the Department-has nofigares on the rates achieved in practice for various types of equipment and give no guidance to authorities on this subject.      Rigidities in the systemmay occasionally prevent the transfer from one hospital to another of *equipment (especially for research purposes), ordered by a particularconsultant who has subsequently been transferred.     The DHSS is trying todeal with this problem.       The CPRS does not believe it would be feasible to exercise detailed control from the centre over the purchase of all types of equipment.     This is much better left to health authorities to decide,in the light of their assessment of local needs and after consultation with individual hospitals.       In the short run, reduced expenditure on the purchaseof equipment could probably best be brought about by an arbitrary cut in thecapital spending of the health service (although health authorities might inpractice decide to spread such cuts over the rest of the hospital programme).In the longer run, health authorities should be given more support in their efforts to get value for money;   this applies both to equipment and to its use.We recommend that the DHSS should ensure that much more guidance is available about the overall effectiveness of equipment, based on fuller information about distribution and use, and on more widespread and rigorous evaluationstudies, where appropriate by the medical orofession itself.1 EDUCATION14,      Reducing Area and Quality StandardsTo meet the needs of the costs limits scheme the school building programme has already had to reduce area standards near to the statutory minimum, and quality standards to below the desirable level on maintenance and amenitycriteria.      We do not favour further reductions in standards.   But we. seeadvantages in the extended use of temporary school buildings.     They aresignificantly cheaper, much quicker to erect and are quite suitable for use as classrooms.     The major disadvantages of huts are their inability to offervariety in space, shorter life expectancy and lower (but not inadequate)standards.       The extended use of temporary school buildings could lead tosavings, particularly in areas of falling population where there is lessneed for accommodation with a 60 year life.       Improving, rather than replacing,existing schools could also lead to savings but there is insufficientinformation available on the current state of the national school stock toenable the savings to be quantified.     The DS3 is preparing a sample survey&apos; on the state of the national school stock.       If this shows scope for significantsavings, we recommend that the Department should encourage local authorities toadopt these approaches.15*      Standardising the provision of equipmentDiffering accounting conventions make it impossible to determine precisely how much local authorities spend on educational equipment but it seems that thereis a fairly wide range of standards between authorities.      We recommend thatthe DES should consider giving guidance on the &quot;reasonable&quot; level of provisionof equipment per child.
NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES * CAPITAL EXPENDITURE116.       TelecJmmunicat ionsOver 90$ of the Post Office investment programme ( 670m in 74/75 rising to 790m in 78/&quot;jJ9) is for telecommunications;   the chief objectives are to expand the sjfstem, to improve the quality of the existing service and tomeet the demsjnd for new services.     Investment in the business sector, for new services [and improvements to Telex and International Subscriber dialling,should be supported but Ministers may wish to review the Post Office!sobjective of a telephone in 80$ of all homes by 1982/83 (the current figure is just under 50$).     The revenue raised from a,,large additional number ofsmall domestic users will not meet their share of the costs of the systemunless connection and rental charges arc increased.     Reduction in the rateof growth of the domestic sector could achieve useful capital economies butonly at the expense of reduced employment levels in the telecommunicationsindustry, and an increased waiting list.     We  ^commend that these factorsshould be quantified for different target dates.17.railway-ysBritish Rail&apos;s investment has already been severely cut but much of whatremains is still aimed at improving standards.   The justification given forthis is that improvement is often only marginally more expensive thannecessary replacement;    and that in any case, improvements in standards of service, especially speed, attract additional passenger traffic and revenue.     We recommend that both these assumptions should be looked atcritically.     There should also be a study of the proportion of investment in London and South East commuter services attributable to improvement andthe extent to which this improvement would be justified.
g (confidential)ANNEX other POSSIBLE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SAVINGSNATIONALISED INDUSTRIESFuel industries. Capital expenditure by the nationalised fuel industries is due to rise from  997m in 1974/75 to  1193m in 1970/79.     We have already referred tothe rapid growth in subsidy payments to the nationalised industries as a resultof their inability (because of Government counter-inflation policy) to charge the full market price for electricity, coal and gas.     But selling energy belowits true cost also results in greater consumption than would otherwise havetaken place.     It is not possible to estimate precisely what savings in energyconsumption might result from fully covering costs - including depreciationat a realistic rate (with, perhaps, some small supplement to cover futureinvestment programmes as in Holland),     But the sharp rise in oil pricesimposed by the OPEC countries has already led to substantial reductions inenergy consumption forecasts and it is reasonable to assume that chargingenergy at full cost would have a similar effect, with immediate benefit to thebalance of payments by reducing oil imports.     This could lead to some reduction in capital investment programmes;  with reduced demand it might,for example, prove possible to spread out investment in new power stationsover a longer period.     Against this, if oil and coal prices remain high fora long period, it may prove advantageous to increase the size of the nuclearprogramme beyond what is at present allowed for in the PES estimates.. .      Channel Tunnel2. On present plans the Channel Tunnel, if it goes ahead, will be financedmainly by private sector loans which would not count as public expenditure.However, if the Tunnel is not to be almost exclusively a rolling motor way,a new rail link to London will have to be built.     Provision for  1281,; 8mduring the PES period has been included under the British Rail Board heading;the current estimate for the rail link is not less than  400m for completionby 1980/81, and the PES figure is therefore likely to be a significantunder-estimate.     The public expenditure cost of providing alternative meansof transport for the increasing cross-Channel traffic, by investment in docks,ships and aircraft, could be considerably less than that of the rail link toprovide a slightly slower, but more flexible service.     There is no chanceof being able to cancel the Channel Tunnel project this year.     however the project comes up for review next year and, given the cost of the associatedrail link, must be a very strong candidate for cancellation,6(confidential)
(confidential): .roads AND TRANSPORTTrunk Roads3.     The CPRS suggests that no new contracts should he let which do not satisfy the criteria referred to in our covering paper,L o cal T ran spo rt4,    With the introduction next year of new arrangements for financing JLocalauthority transport services, the chance should be taken to bring under control the rapidly rising level of subsidies to public:c transport, and to scrutinise and,if appropriate, restrain expenditure on local roads, .HOUSINGEliminating Under Occupation of Public Section Dwellings5.    There is anecdotal evidence of the widespread under-occupation of localauthority dwellings.     Unfortunately there are few hard facts; but it is known that many local authority records are badly out of date, and that little effort is made to persuade tenants to move when family size falls,     A sample surveyshould show if there is indeed a problem.      If there is, consideration shouldbe given to what sort of steps might be taken to ensure more efficient occupatioiof dwellings,EDU CATIONHigher Fees6.    To the extent that higher fees mean higher grants, no savings would resultHowever, public expenditure could be reduced by several million pounds a year if overseas students paid something nearer the real cost of their further education,TAXATIONPetrol Tax7.     An increase in tax on petrol of at least 15p/gallon but not on diesel fuelseems an obvious way of conserving energy, improving our balance of payment!and benefiting the Exchequer,     It would also bring our petrol prices more into line with those on the Continent,- 7(confidential)
