S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government(74)lll COPY NO      7918 October 1974CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1974-75Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. Before we settle the terms of The Queenrs Speech for the 1974-75Session we need to be clear about the size and content of the legislative programme for the Session.    The Queen^s Speech and Future legislation committee was appointed to consider this and our proposals are as follows.2.        The position is that apart from two major Finance Bills,Departmental Ministers have proposed a total of well over 100 Bills forthis Sessions programme, the great majority of which are held to be highly desirable and of high priority.    This is impossible.   It is also,in our view, ill-judged to attempt to fulfil virtually all of the programme on which we fought the General Election in one Session.    What we havedone, therefore, is to group the Bills into three priority categories:Category I.    This comprises Top Priority Bills from the main programme of Bills, including the nine major Bills which werebeing prepared during the last Session, the eight lost on Dissolution,and some others which are already prepared and which could usefully be brought in early in the Session,    It also includesEssential Bills (in the technical sense that powers or money willrun out if they are not passed this Session);  and Contingent Bills(which, if they become necessary also become Essential).    Wewould expect to be able to complete all these Category I Bills(assuming that Departments have them ready in time) during the session.if-Category II.    This comprises the Priority Bills in the main programme on which work should proceed so that if and whenprogress on Category I allows, they could be brought into theprogramme for the Session. \Category III.    This comprises No-Priority Bills which we wouldnot expect to be able to complete this Session.1
3,      There are in addition special categories of Scottish GrandCommittee Bills, Second Reading Committee Bills, anil Bills suitablefor Members successful in the Ballot, progress on which will not generally be dependent on progress on the Category I and II Bills, exceptthat we must not allow them to pre -empt the time of the Parliamentarydraftsmen needed for higher priority Bills.4.        The Annex to this memorandum sets out all the Departmental bidsfor Bills under these categories, as a programme for this Session,    all departmental Ministers proposing Bills were invited to put to theCommittee their views about the priority afforded to their Bills in the annex and these have been taken into account as far as possible but it is,of course, inevitable that some must be disappointed.    We concluded thatthe lists in the Annex now provide a realistic basis for the programmeexcept in one respect which my colleagues will need to considerimmediately, both for the purposes of the programme and of the opening speech,    The top priority category (Category I) is at present overloaded.The Committee considered it unlikely that it would be possible in the time available to get all of these measures through both Houses, and doubted the political wisdom of making the attempt.5.        I invite my colleagues -a. To consider whether we should attempt to get all the top Priority (Category I) Bills through to Royal Assent in the first session;  and n     -b. subject to their conclusions on a., to agree that we should prepare and manage the legislative programme for the coming session on the basis of the priorities set out in the Annex, and totake account of this in considering the Opening Speech.E privy Council Office/ 18 October 1974
