pS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO       Q 9CABINETRESTRICTION OF LESS ESSENTIAL CONSTRUCTIONEXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer ,1.        I was invited, in the context of the Cabinefs discussion on    //26 July 1974 on economic strategy and public expenditure, to examinethe ways open to us of restricting less essential construction expenditurein the private sector and possibly of avoiding emergency &quot;winter-works&quot;projects which tended to distort priorities between projects.    During our discussions it had been suggested that it would not be appropriate tointroduce restrictive measures at a time when the construction indusrty was in difficulties.POWERS AVAILABLE2. There are limited powers,  currently in suspense, to controlbuilding by a system of licensing under the Building Control Act 1966.3.        The Act makes it unlawful to carry out any work in theconstruction or alteration of a building or of any other fixed works of construction or civil engineering, not exempted by or under the Act,unless a licence is obtained from the Minister of Public Building and works (now the Secretary of State for the Environment).    The control was suspended with effect from 20 November 1968.    The suspensioncan be ended by the Secretary of State making a further Order to1 this effect under the Act.    The Order would be subject to negative resolution by either House of Parliament.4.        The Act exempts certain types of projects from control: themain ones are projects costing less than a fixed limit, private dwellings,industrial buildings, all projects in development areas, development byor on behalf of the Crown and work carried out at the expense of localauthorities and other public bodies.5.        The cost exemption limit under the Act is now  100, 000.    Thelimit can be changed by order to a lower or higher figures, subject toa minimum figure of  50, 000.1C(74) 996 September 1974
POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION IN RELATION TO BUILDING LICENSING6. The following considerations apply to any use of the Act to ,restrict less essential construction of such as places of entertainment; -i.      Maay places of entertainment are provided by adaptationrather than new construction, and those requiring adaptationwork of less than  50, 000 would be exempt.ii.      It would be necessary either to ban all work above the exemption limit on entertainment premises or distinguish between the merits of various forms of entertainment       ueg bingo, cinemas, clubs, theatres.iii.      Without other measures the funds and resources freedby the refusal of licences could be diverted to other uses inthe private sector equally undesirable to the Government.&apos; ii .    \\-- .v : - &apos; jl :      - ;,       //   ,,,7.        The main argument put forward for a licensing system is that itgives Government the power to impose cuts on the private sector when there is a risk of over-loading the construction industry.    The worklikely to be judged undesirable is however small in total volume; whencontrols operated in 1966-68 applications for licences for projectsworth  392 million were made, of which only those for  21 million .were refused.    Refusals amounted therefore to less than 0. 5 per cent of new construction.CURRENT OUTLOOK8,        The industry at present faces it biggest decline in output sincethe war, with the threat of the loss of over 100, 000 jobs by the end of1974 compared with the end of last year.    Output is expected to declineby 5 per cent during the course of this year and by a further 2 per centin 1975.    Under the present circumstances it is unlikely that private,commercial and industrial investment spending on construction willrecover during 1975.CONCLUSIONS II9.        Thus, apart from the points in paragraph 6 above, this would not seem an appropriate time to reinstate the powers under the building control Act 1966.    Nor would it seem right to use administrativedelaying tactics on granting of IDCs etc.10.      My colleagues will be conscious of the dangers of &quot;winter-works&quot;projects which affect their departments  priorities.    But I suggest thatj^jLs should be considered in the context of the construction industrypackage which is being discussed separately.D W HH M Treasury6 September 1974 2
