HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government (74) 124 copy NO      U1 November 1974CABINETLATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEHOUSING FINANCE ACTNote by tbe Secretary of State for the environment, At a meeting of Ministers yesterday tinder the chairmanship of thePrime Minister the proposals made in the annexed paper were approved generally; and I was invited to circulate them for consideration by theCabinet at the meeting on Tuesday.    I will as necessary report more fully at that meeting.2. On the issues affecting-Clay Cross, it is necessary to modify what i said in my paper.    I have reluctantly concluded that the disqualificationincurred by the ex-councillors should, as recommended, be removed bythe legislation, and not be made conditional on repayment of the surcharge.But we would not rescind the surcharge of  6985 already made and nowforming the subject-matter of an order of the court.    The payment ofthat sum properly falls to be dealt with in the manner indicated in thePrime Minister&apos;s statement to the House on 4 April, that is to say, by&quot;those associated with the decisions taken at the relevant conferences&quot;.Interest and costs relating to the court actions are also outstanding;the relevant amounts have not yet been finally determined but it will benecessary for them also to be met.    (There is in existence a modest Partyfund to help with costs, but there is no Party or other fund available topay the surcharge- )3. I seek my colleagues agreement:-^ ,,a. to the proposals in the attached paper, as amended by paragraph 2 above; ^b. to may making a statement in the House on Wednesday6 November;   andc. to my proceeding with the drafting of the necessary Billfor introduction as quickly as possible.A department of the EnvironmentI November 1974
NFIDENTIALANNE3PAPER CIRCULATED AS MISC&apos;33(74)33 ON 28 OCTOBER 1974LATE IMPLEMENTATION OP THE-HOUSING.FINANCE ACT 1 972Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment.    At the last meeting of MISC 33 my colleagues:(a) approved the proposals in my paper MISC 33(74)1 :(b) agreed that the matter should be considered again after theElection; but(c) asked me to look into one possibility, which I had to dismiss(letter of 9 August).2.    The process of audit ha3 been continuing; and the Annex shows thelocal authorities where surcharge now seems likely, the amount, thenumber of councillors at risk, and the stage reached.Present position at Clay Cross &apos;3.    I understand that the eleven ex-councillors of Clay Cross havetold the District Auditorfs .legal advisers that they have no assets;and that the District Auditor has subsequently been considering, withhis legal advisers, which of the courses open to him-he should follow in.enforcing the judgement order obtained in the High Court on 2 Augustin respect of the surcharge of  6985 plus interest from   October 1973and costs.    The audit of the Clay Cross Council&apos;s accounts for1972/73 and 1973/74 has been continuing.    In addition to the furtherprobable surcharges of about  100,000 shown on the Annex I understandthat the District Auditor is investigating a number of other itemsnot relating to the Housing Finance Act.Po1icy considerations .    Our policy objectives, as stated by the Prime Minister on lj April,are:(a) to remove or obviate the disqualification for membership oflocal authorities as a result of surcharges arising out of theHousing Finance Act;(b) to avoid any extra charge on public funds;(c )   to resolve the problem with fairness to all-concerned,. including fairness to those who reluctantly&apos; implemented the
(confidential)Act, and&apos;in a spirit which will diminish for the future thebitterness engendered.The Prime Minister also said that the law of the land must bo obeyed.We are committed to removing tho sanction of disqualification.    Butin other respects we should seek a solution which upholds tho rule oflaw.The issue to be consideredThe essential question is whether we want recovery of the lo3t     ,rent income from the councillors to be attempted.    A3 the figures in&apos;the Annex show, the sums involved are large, and it is virtuallycertain that only a small part could be brought in.    Most of it wouldhave to be written off as not recoverable; and would fall to be met by the local authority  (with such support from central Government as wasthen appropriate under the relevant statutory provisions).    Some of   ,n.the lost rent could, however, be recovered from the councillors:attachment of earnings would yield periodical repayments; seizure of assets Ttfould yield something; enforced bankruptcies would yieldsomething.    Surcharges are joint as well as several, and where one ofthe councillors had a shop or other business, or even a house, anenforced bankruptcy might pay his share and that of several othercouncillors.    If court orders for seizure of assets or attachmentof earnings were made and not complied with, the councillors wouldrisk prison.6.    If my colleagues consider that some attempt at recovery isnecessary, the surcharges must proceed.    If not, and since disqualifica-tion is to be lifted, the only two results of surcharge would beremoved; and the process of surcharge becomes pointless,.7.    The arguments for attempting recovery ares that law enforcementshould not be interfered with; that the rates and/or rents should be relieved of any amount which can be recovered; that it will bosalutary to remind people that group decisions carry personal responsibility.    The arguments against attempting recovery aresthat the processes are bound to drag on for a long time with continued -publicity and controversy; and that it is necessary to avoid furtherbitterness.    It could also be argued that the financial repercussions of failure to implement the Act, coming at a time of local government reorganisation, have produced a situation of such complexity thatan ad hoc solution for dealing with losses would be justified andwould not constitute a precedent in other circumstances.    There isalso the question whether the prospect of hundreds of councillorsbeing subjected to the process of recovery  (no matter how tactfully   *handled it may be by the District Auditors) when substantial publicwrite-offs x^would be seen to be inevitable in the end might tend-to diminish the respect for law which we want to encourage.A possible alternative solution8.   Wo must recognise that there is no way of avoiding making good the lost rent income.    If the councillors do not meet it the onlyavailable sources are future rents or rates.    We must rule outcentral Government funds because of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement,but we could treat rates as not being &quot;public funds&quot;., in that context,   )On. that basis a possible solution would bo to &quot;include in tho proposed (Bill provisions to authorise tho relevant local authority to make
confidentialgood the rent income lo3t, as a result of negligence or misconduct,out of &apos;f utura rents, beginning in 1975/76 and spread over a fairlylong period, say five or seven years.    This should not prove onerous,especially as local authorities will have freedom to fix their own&quot;reasonable&quot; rents once our Housing Rents and Subsidies Bill is passed.    If, however, they chose not to make good the loss out of future rents, or to the extent that they did not choose to, we wouldprovide for the amount to be met out of the rates, the sum involvednot being counted, however, as relevant expenditure for rate support grant.9.    There is a further point which has policy implications.    Owing tolocal government reorganisation, many of the late implementingauthorities no longer exist..having become parts of new and largerauthorities.    Those communities now incorporated in the North-East -Derbyshire District which, when independent authorities, implementedthe Act on time, have already-shown their resentment of a possiblerequirement to contribute to make good the Clay Cross losses.   Thisis a just objection which other communities similarly affected may also make, and to meet it we would need to give authorities power to charge differential rents, or levy a differential rate, so that,for example, the Clay Cross burden fell only on the tenants and/orratepayers of the old Clay Cross area and not upon the whole bodyof tenants and/or ratepayers of the new North-East DerbyshireDistrict.Two special points affecting Clay Cross.10.  . Another point is that if we now provide authorities with a means for making good the lost rent income we cannot justify not doing the same for Clay Cross.    It would be necessary, therefore,to provide for the surcharge already made at Clay Cross to berescinded.    In order to avoid hybrid legislation a general provision would be necessary.    But I would not think it right for tenants and/or ratepayers to be required to bear the legal costs etc for whichthe Clay Cross ex-councillors are liable,    (these include their owncosts and those of the District Auditor and of the Department in thelegal actions).    Any surcharges against the ex-councillors for theother items referred to in paragraph 3 would of course proceed in theusual way. -11.    Finally, Clay Cross did not make the rate fund contributionsthey should have made towards their housing revenue expenditure.    Asa result the North-East Derbyshire District Council havo inherited a deficit upon which they will probably wish to rate the Clay: CrossParish differentially.    The sum has yet to be finally assessedj butit could be as much as  75*000, involving a 9p additional rate inthe Parish and attracting rate support grant.    I do not see how wecould refuse this.    Provision/would probably be needed in.the Bill,Immediate action needed,12.    If we decide to adopt the solution outlined above it would benecessary to make an announcement in the House as soon as possible.When this had been done the District Auditors would not feel itnecessary to proceed with any further Housing Finance Act surcharges(though they would still havo to establish the amounts involved)pending a decision by Parliament on the Bill.
Conclusion13.   I invite my colleagues to agree(i) that the balance of argiiment is against attempting to recover the very large sums  (see Annex) from the councillorsconcerned and that vie should;(ii) include in the proposed Bill provisions enabling localauthorities to&apos;make good the lost rent income out of future rentor, if they chose not to do so, requiring them to meet it outof rates  (paragraph 8); *(iii) enable local authorities to charge differential rents orlevy differential rates to make the old defaulting area bear theliability (paragraph 9) J ,?(iv) rescind the surcharge made as a result of the extraordinaraudit at Clay Cross but leave the ex-couhcillors to meet legal.costs  (paragraph 10);(v) provide power for local authorities to levy differentialrates where the old areas did not make the required rate fund/       contributions, as at Clay Cross  (paragraph 11 );(vi) announce our decisions in the House as soon as possible&apos;:        (paragraph 12).ACf ,   &apos;        &apos; &apos;Department of the environment  Marsham StreetSW12g October 1 97U
