I am required under Section 36 of the Social Security Act 1973 to&quot;review social security provision for chronically sick and disabled persons,and /to/ lay a report on Jm J review before Parliament by 31 October 1974&quot;.When Social Services Committee considered my proposals on 23 July they agreed to the general principles on which I was proceeding and expressedthe hope that it would be possible for the Cabinet&apos;s public expenditureexercise to be conducted in such a way that I should be able to publish thereport in September.    To make this possible, I arranged for the report tobe laid in dummy just before the Recess.2.        I attach a draft of the report which, subject to the agreement of mycolleagues, I should wish to publish on 12 September.    This would showthat we were honouring our Manifesto commitment to &quot;introduce a new scheme of help for the disabled&quot;.    I haye not yet settled with theChancellor of the Exchequer the action to be taken on Lady Sharp&apos;s reporton mobility for the disabled, so that would be left for separate announcement.3.        My immediate proposals for social security changes are set out inparagraphs 54-65 of the draft report.    They fall short of the measures weworked out in Opposition but I accept that in view of public expenditurelimitations we cannot at present go beyond the following specific commit-ments:a. To introduce in 1975-76 a non-contributory invalidity pension, at the rate of/ 6 a week free of tax, for congenitallyhandicapped persons (with a pocket-money rate of  2 a week for in-patients in psychiatric hospitals).    The net cost wouldbe about   7 million in a full year.    This benefit would not applyto disabled housewives.b. To introduce in 1976-77 a non-contributory invalid careallowance, also at a rate of  6 a week, for those breadwinnerswho have had to give up work to care for a severely disabledrelative.    The cost would be perhaps  1 milliqn in the firstfull year.1C(74) 973 September 1974
c.      To introduce subsequently a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled housewives.    I envisage that this benefit would be introduced in 1977-78, at a rate of  3. 70 a week free of tax, and that the cost would be about    8 million a year.All the above amounts are expressed in 1974 terms.    My original plan was to introduce c. at the same time as a. but at a meeting with the chief secretary on 2 August it was agreed to delay c. till 1977-78 in order toreduce the cost of the scheme over the PESC period and to enable theHouse of Commons Paper to be published early in September before thegeneral review of public expenditure! is complete.4.        The Chancellor of the exchequer quer has since made a furtherreservation and has indicated that he has not yet had an opportunity of considering the text of the House of Commons Paper and may wish to comment on it.5. 1 seek the agreement of my colleagues to publish on 12 Septembera House of Commons Paper in terms of the attached draft, subject to anyminor or drafting amendments.B A department of Health and Social Security3 September 1974

introduction. In accordance with Section 36 of the Social Security Act 1973*, I present this report on my review of social security provision for chronioally sick and disabled people.2.     The report indicates the substantial shortcomings in current provision for disabled people.     While war pensioners and the industrially disabled receive a fairly high pension-according to the severity of their disablement - to whichallowances of various kinds can be addedj   there are at the other end of thespectrum some 200,000 people of working age who have been totally incapable ofwork for a long time, but at most receive only means-tested supplementary benefit aThe needs of those who have been prevented by their disablement from payingsufficient contributions to establish entitlement to benefit go unrecognised inthe national insurance scheme, unless they are among the small minority whoqualify for attendance allowance.     Similarly, for those who are unable to do a paid job because they have to stay at home to care for someone who is severelydisabled there is only means-tested provision.    Beyond this, disablement canimpose extra costs on the sufferer and on his family:   costs which receive limitedrecognition at present.     The severely disabled worker, whose disablement oftenmeans low earnings, does not, because he is working, receive cash support.3.     This situation cannot be wholly remedied at once.   It takes time to identifythose who should qualify for hew benefits; and eligibility&apos;has to be carefullyestablished by the use of skilled medical manpower, to avoid unfair differences in the benefits payable to people with the same degree of disablement.     otherlimitations apart, in the present economic situation we cannot move as fast aswe would like.     But what is important is to develop a comprehensive long-termstrategy and coherent philosophy for meeting the needs of disabled people.This paper sets out the Governmenfs thinking on the fundamental issues for public discussion and debate, not least among disabled people themselves.     Atthe same time it contains proposals for establishing new categories ofbeneficiary and for recognising needs by non-contributory benefits which willrun parallel to the present contributory benefits.*&quot;The Secretary of State shall review social security provision for chronicallysick and disabled persons, and shall lay a report on his review beforeParliament by 31st October 1974&quot;.    Section 36, Social Security Act, 1973 c.38.
4.      The main theme of this report is cash benefits.   While there are gapsin the provision of services, it is broadly known what services are needed.The Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 has led to great localefforts to find all disabled people who need help and provide them with thishelp.   The Government does not underestimate the importance of other services such as rehabilitation.5.      Provisions &quot;in cash and kind need to fit together as part of a comprehensive plan.   Lady Sharp&apos;s   report on &quot;Mobility of Physically DisabledPeople1 clearly indicates the close inter-relationship between cash and services.   Mobility needs can be met either by the provision of vehicles orby the provision of cash to enable those with limited mobility, to pay for,their own transport.   The Governmenfs conclusions on Lady Sharp&apos;s report are being announced separately.6.      The Government&apos;s proposals represent a substantial step forward.   Inthis report I indicate some of the problems which need further discussion andfurther research.    More thought has to be given to a benefit for disabledhousewives.   Where disabled children are concerned, we lack adequateinformation about their numbers and about the precise character of their needs.   It is by no means clear how best to channel further help to thosewho are disabled and at work.   I look forward to a continuing dialogue withthe organisations representing disabled people, on these and other questions.Barbara CastleSecretary of State for Social Services
CHAPTER ONE.VHO ARE THE CHRONICALLY SICK AND DISABLED?7. i  Chronically sick and disabled people are not a homogeneous group.   the term &apos;disabled&apos; is used loosely to indicate those with a wide range of differentphysical and mental impairments.   The main information available about thenumber of people who are disabled comes either from surveys, in which people havebeen asked questions about their condition and its consequences, or from the operational statistics of the social security scheme, which depend in turn onthe particular contingencies for which provision is made.   The statisticsderived from the different sources overlap and are incomplete.   Nevertheless,it is likely that as many as 3&quot;2 million adults with some physical or mentaldisablement already receive cash benefits because of disablement or depend whollyor mainly on public funds.8.     This broad conclusion can be inferred from the following figures,bearing that mind that some people may be counted in mcrcj than one category:-- roughly 2% million retirement pensioners have some disablement;   ;- nearly 420,000 people under pension age incapable of work for more than six months receive a national insurance invalidity pension1;- about 225,000 people under pension age incapable of work for more than six months receive supplementary benefit, of whom some 135,000 have nocontributory benefit;- nearly 280,000 people receive a state benefit (other than the short-term injury benefit) because of industrial disablement and some 340,000people because of war disablement;- over 160,000 people of all ages severely enough disabled to needextensive care receive attendance allowance;- about 60,000   people   who      have been unemployed for more than sixmonths are disabled* &quot;&quot;----------------------There is as yet no consistency in terminology.   The terms impairment&apos;,&quot;chronic sickness&apos;, &quot;disablement&apos;, &apos;handicap*, etc. are used loosely or withspecial   meanings in particular contexts.   In this report, &apos;chronic sickness.&apos;means incapacity for work which has lasted mare than six months; &quot;disablement&apos;is used as a general description of physical or mental impairment with measurablerepercussions; &quot;impairment1 and &quot;handicap&apos; are used in the sense given tcthese terms in the 0PCS survey (see reference note at the foot of page 4).   Thus&apos;impairment&apos; means &quot;lacking; part or all of a limb or having a defective organ ormechanism of the body;the practical implications of impairment may be negligible.    &quot;Handicap&apos; means&quot;the disadvantage or restriction of activity&apos; caused by impairment seriousenough, in a particular context or generally, to limit functional ability.
- about 4,000 people are receiving rehabilitation or training allowances as disabled people.     About another 13,500 are receivingearnings from sheltered employment.9.     A,s the above figures show, the majority of disabled people are overpension age.   The Government survey undertaken in Great Britain in 1968/69 ofthose aged 16 and over living in private households (&quot;the 0PCS survey&quot;)   1v estimated that 73 Per cent of very severely handicapped people were aged 65 or over.   The coverage of those with sensory or mental handicap was known to beincomplete.   The survey concentrated primarily on physical handicap, measuredin terms of capacity for self-care.   It did not necessarily identify as disabledpeople those who were chronically sick and incapable of work, but whose domesticcircumstances meant that they had no real difficulty in caring for themselves at home.   The difference between self-care and other aspects of disablement is illustrated by the fact that quite a high proportion of &quot;housewives&quot; who wereidentified as unable tc do their housework were classified as impaired but nothandicapped (categories 7 a&quot;d 8), while large numbers of people classified ashandicapped were in paid employment.   On this basis, the 0PCS survey provided an estimate of about 1.1 million handicapped people, spread over six categories:157,000 (categories 1 to 3) being &quot;very severely handicapped&apos;, 35^,000(categories 4 and 5) &apos;severely handicapped&apos; and 6l6,000 (category 6) &quot;appreci-ably handicapped&apos;.   Projections of such estimates are hazardous, but adjustmentfor the increasing number of elderly people in the population suggests that by now the number of severely and appreciably handicapped adults (in 0PCS surveyterms) has probably risen to about 1.2 million.   The number of handicapped children living at home can only be guessed at; as a minimum, it may be of theorder of 50,000.   Further information about disabled people is given in the annex.10.   The 0PCS survey provided a wealth of information about disabled people.Since then, often using similar survey methods, local authorities, in fulfilment of their obligations under Section 1 of the Chronically Sick and disabled Persons Act 1970, have been estimating the numbers and establishing the identities of disabled people in their areas.   The results of:those localsurveys which are comparable with the national survey have in general beenbroadly consistent with the earlier findings.* Handicapped and Impaired in Great Britain, Office of Population Censuses and surveys (0PCS) Social Survey Division.

11.   The substantial difference between the number of attendance allowance beneficiaries originally expected and the number of awardsactually made when the allowance was introduced&quot;- illustrates thedifficulty of using survey data not specifically designed for the purpose toestablish how many people might qualify for other new benefits.   Thi3difficulty applies even when the survey classification corresponds broadlywith the basis of entitlement to the benefit.12.   Identification of handicap i3 not the same thing as identification ofthe financial effects of handicap.   Just as the relationship between impair-ment and handicap in physical terms depends on such factors as age, environment,sex and social role, so the financial consequences of being disabled vary according to the individuals education, training, job, etc.   Rough projectionsbased on the 1968/9 OPCS survey figures suggest that there are now about 390,000adults under the age of 65 &apos;in the community&apos; who are handicapped&apos; in terms ofself-care.   Of these about 250,000 receive some form of state cash insurance benefit other than family allowances, but in most cases not because of theirhandicap as such.   Host of the remaining 140,000 do not receive a benefit, becausthey do not come within a contingency for which benefit is currently provided,or because they have not paid the necessary contributions.   Of the elderlyhandicapped people, now numbering perhaps 830,000, all but a tiny minorityreceive state benefits.   It is, however, important to remember that the 0PGSsurvey did not cover every type of disablement or children or people inresidential care. &apos; n13.   The fact that, after one of the most large-scale and comprehensive surveysever carried out in this country, our knowledge of the extent of disablementremains incomplete serves to emphasise a crucial point about disabled people.They are not a separate and clearly identifiable section of the population.Most of them are ordinary people leading ordinary lives in the community, andmany of them do not think of themselves as disabled.   What distinguishes them as a group from the rest of the population is that their opportunities are limited, only slightly for some but very severely for others, and specialcompensatory measures are needed to enable them to overcome their handicaps tothe fullest possible extent, and to restore to them some of the freedom of choice which their disablement has removed.* Although the classification of people by reference to their capacity for self-care might have been thought to be very broadly in line with the basicof entitlement to the allowance, in fact, the use of OPCS data led to anunderestimate of the number of expected beneficiaries of the higher rateallowance and to an overestimate in respect of the lower rate.
CHAPTER TWOPRESENT PROVISIONSHistory and recent developments14.   The present pattern of social security provisions for disabled peoplecan best be understood by examining its historical origins.   Two somewhat different philosophies underlay early developments: the first expressed inthe legal concepts of tort and common law liability; the second in the concept of insurance to provide maintenance.15.     The Workmen1 s Compensation Act of 1897 marked an important step forward from the concept of tort by imposing a liability even where the employer hadnot been negligent.   The provision at first covered only dangerous trades,the rights were not readily enforceable and the employee was expected, broadly speaking, to bear half the loss,   nevertheless, the underlying principle was to compensate for loss of earnings.   The much older war pensionsprovisions were influenced in the early part of the 1914-18 war by the workmen1 compensation arrangements, and prominence was given to loss of earning capacity.   But, from 1917, loss of faculty (see paragraph 17 below) becqpethe dominant concept governing entitlement - with disablement pensions paid on top of earnings.   Pensions varied according to service rank, and duringthe war or shortly afterwards increases for dependants and certain supplementary allowances, including constant attendance allowance, were added.16.   As part of the extension and development of national insurance after the1939-45 war, in the light of the Beveridge Report of 1942, a new industrial injuries scheme was introduced to replace workmen^ compensation.   Contribu-tions had to be paid towards the cost of the scheme by those in insurable iemployment, and by their employers; though entitlement to benefits did not depend on contribution conditions as such.   A basic short-term injury benefitwas paid at a flat rate for those incapable of work, though at a higher rate than sickness benefit.   This preferential rate of benefit provided to those with injury or disease &quot;arising out of and in the course of their employment&quot;recognised the special risks of the working situation.Social Insurance and Allied Services. Sir William Beveridge, Cmd. 6404,November 1942. HMSO-Reprinted 1968.
17.   The new long-term benefits for industrial injury were based not onincapacity for work, nor on loss of earnings, but on loss of faculty - thusdrawing on the conoepts evolved in the war pensions scheme.   Loss of facultyinvolves assessment of the degree of disablement by a comparison between thecondition of the claimant and that of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex.   Pension assessments range from 20 per cent to 100 per cent in 10 percent steps.   A lump sum payment is normally made for assessments of less than20 per cent.   As a relatively minor loss of faculty can be associated with adisproportionately heavy loss of earnings, a special hardship allowance was introduced as well, on a broadly similar basis to the allowance for loweredstandard of occupation in the war pensionsuscheme as it had by then developed,to provide some compensation for loss of earnings.   As in the war pensions scheme, there are now supplementary allowances for unempioyability (which takethe place of national insurance sickness or invalidity benefits), for constantattendance, and for exceptionally severe disablement.   (The war pensions scheme has a number of further special allowances which have no counterpart in theindustrial injuries scheme.)   Disablement benefits for industrial injury, otherthan the unempioyability supplement, are paid on top of basic national insuranoebenefits, such as sickness benefit or retirement pension.18.   By contrast to industrial disablement provision, the original national health insurance scheme was based upon the principles of voluntary insurance asthey had been developed by the friendly societies.   In return for a flat-rate contribution, a flat-rate weekly sickness benefit was provided for those whowere incapable of work,,without any addition for dependants.     Additions tothe basic benefit,for wives and children,were introduced as part of the 1948post-Beveridge changes.   Eligibility for sickness benefit depended upon thecontributions which had been paid.19.   The present sickness, and invalidity, benefits are available under thenational insurance soheme for men and women, married or single, who areincapable of work and have paid the necessary contributions as employed orself-employed persons.   The definition of incapacity for work is laid downin statute, regulations and case-law.   A person is regarded as incapable ofwork &apos;if, having regard to his age, education, experience, state of health andother personal factors, there is no work or type of work which he can reasonably be expected to do.&apos;*   In the short-term, a claimant*s incapacity for work isjudged by reference to his normal job, but in the longer term, where there isSee Index and Digest of Decisions given by the Commissioners under the national insurance Acts etc, Volume II, pp 617-651. HMSO 1964.
no longer a &quot;normal&apos; job, any job which the claimant might reasonably be ableto do, or for which he could be trained, is taken into account.   This approach is readily understood and relatively straightforward to administer, yet capableof considerable flexibility, relating as it does to the condition, backgroundand experience of the claimant.20.   Prom 1966, earnings-related supplements were added to the flat-ratesickness (and industrial injury) benefit,   from the end of the second week of &apos;incapacity for a period of 26 weeks, to cushion the drop in income from earningsto flat-rate benefits.   This was seen as the first step in a strategy to relatelong-term,as well as short-term,sickness benefit   and retirement pensions,toprevious earnings.   The immediate effect, however, was to create a markeddistinction - for many though not all beneficiaries - between-short-term and long-term incapacity.21.     From 1971* all those entitled to long-term sickness benefit were paidfull rate benefit, now called invalidity pension, even if their contributionrecord v/as deficient, and special higher dependency increases were introduced for wives and children.   The standard rate of invalidity pensionwas also made payable to married women contributors, to whom sickness benefitvas paid at a lower rate.   In addition, a new invalidity allowance was addedto invalidity pension based upon the age of onset of incapacity.   the allowance is at three rates, the highest being paid to those becomingchronically sick earliest in life.22.   This new invalidity allowance was increased more than proportionately in subsequent benefit increases; and, in 1973, pensions, including invaliditypensions, were increased by a greater proportion than the flat-rate short-term benefits.   The 1974 uprating extended this differential.   Thus, by the end ofJuly 1974, a married man with two children, who was aged under 35 when he becameincapable of work and who had consistently been receiving earnings at the levelof the national average, could receive, with family allowances, up to  27.05sickness benefit, followed by invalidity benefit of  27.85 (about 70 per cent of his previous average take-home pay including family allowances).Disablement however caused23.   The National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill, which was beforeParliament at the time of the dissolution in 1970, aimed to provide earnings-related invalidity pensions, and also an attendance allowance for those whoneeded substantial care by day and at night.   The attendance allowance was subsequently introduced by the new Government, the first payments being madein December 1971*   The soope of the allowance was later extended to those
needing substantial care either by day or at night, and a lower rate for such people was &apos;phased in&apos; between June 1973 and December 1973*   There is no contribution test, there is no means test, and the allowance is paid to or fora person ef any age from two onwards.   Thus it is received by the parents ofdisabled children, by housewives, by men and single women who have never paidcontributions and by elderly people who long since ceased to pay them.   It canbe paid on top of invalidity pension or retirement pension.   The attendance allowance introduces a wholly new philosophy in cash provision   for disablement.It is a comprehensive universal benefit based neither on the compensationprinciple nor on the insurance principle, but on evidence of severe disablement,however caused,which requires attendance.Those who are left out24.   Some chronically sick and disabled people whose disablement does hot arise from work or from service in the armed forces, and who have no contributionsor inadequate contributions to national insurance, may have resources of theirown or receive compensation from other sources.- suoh as lump sum compensation foraccidents not arising from work, or payments under the criminal injuriescompensation scheme.   Others are maintained by their families.   But the majoritydepend in whole or part on supplementary benefit, which also providesadditional support for some of those who do have other resources!   Long-termbeneficiaries not considered able to work receive the higher scale rates which include a margin for special expenses.   The amount of any attendance allowancepayable is added to the disabled person&apos;s requirements.   Up to  2 a week ofindustrial or war disablement pensions and also up to  2 of part-time earnings(.C1 for those registering for work) are &quot;disregarded&apos; when assessing needs.Disabled people, like others, can receive extra allowances for such needs asspecial diets, extra heating or essential domestic help, and lump sum&quot;exceptional noeds payments for necessary expenditure which cannot be met fromthe weekly benefit.The Royal Commission on Civil Liabilility and Compensation for Personal Injury25.   The question of compensation for personal injury is currently being reviewed by the Royal Commission set up in December 1972 under the chairman-ship of Lord Pearson.   Its terms of reference include compensation for death orj    injury suffered in the course of employment; through the use of a car or other means of transport; through the manufacture, supply, or use of goods or services;on someone else*s premises; or in other circumstances where someone else mightbe held responsible.   Though these terms of reference are wide they do not cover non-industrial diseases, congenital abnormality not attributable toantenatal injury,or some classes of accident where the injured person cannot
at present held another responsible.The relationship between services and cash benefits26.   Parallel to the increasing provision of cash benefits, has been the growth of services which help disabled people.   Some services, such as shelteredemployment, industrial rehabilitation and special training services, arespecifically designed to meet their needs.   Others, such as the personal social services and the national health service, are used by people with many different types of need though those who are disabled may make more use of theathan others.   It would not be appropriate to discuss the aims, scope andadequacy of all the different services used by disabled people in the oontextof a review of social security provision.    But in so far as their specialnet A3: are more appropriately and economically met in kind, it would be wrong to attempt to provide for these same needs in cash.   Where services have gaps,and where prevision is inadequate, the right answer is to fill these gaps and strengthen these services rather than provide cash benefits for all disabledpeople because a particular service is not available for some disabled people in some places, though there may be a case for providing cash benefits insome circumstances to enable people to pay for the services they need.   as mentioned above, the Supplementary Benefits Commission has discretion toprovide extra allowances where essential services such as domestic help haveto be purchased.   But this is not the only principle which should determine the relationship between cash benefits and services.   It is of crucial importance that disabled people should have a choice of how their needs are met, wherever choice is a realistic possibility.27.   There are three specific areas in the relationship between cash provision and services which should be mentioned.   A major aim of policy is to helpdisabled people to return to full-time employment wherever this is possible.The importance of rehabilitation cannot be overstressed.   But there is a potential conflict between the need to make proper cash provision for those whoare disabled while they cannot work, and the need to retain a cash incentive to return to work - particularly when the jobs available are low paid.Invalidity benefits can in this sense be a disincentive to rehabilitation.Thus the relationship between industrial rehabilitation and training allowances,wages in sheltered employment and social security benefits needs to be care-fully considered.   This is discussed further in the next chapter.28.   The second area is in the provision of attendance for those who needconsiderable care.   This can be provided by the health and personal social services or it can be provided by a member of the household., or by both.10
V/hile the staff of health authorities and local authority social servicesdepartments are paid to provide care, household members are not normallypaid even when they have given up work for the purpose.   This problem isalso discussed in the next chapter.Summary29.   This chapter has described some of the current cash benefits providedfor disabled people and mentioned those services which are particularlyclosely related to the provision of cash benefits.   In the case of warpensions and industrial injury benefits, the concept of compensation, akinto that embodied in common law rights, has influenced the development ofthese provisions.   The benefits are confined to those whose disablement hasstemmed from the risks of employment or of service in the armed forces.Benefits are paid whether or not the employer or the state was in any way at fault, andin the case of war pensions the conditions for payment are likely to besatisfied if the origin of the disablement can be traced to a period ofservice in the armed forces.   Industrial injury benefits represent an amalgambetween principles of compensation and principles of insurance.JO.   Sickness and invalidity benefits are based on insurance principles inthe sense that the benefits are available only to those who have paidcontributions.   A scheme which was originally one of flat-rate contributions and benefits, now has earnings-related contributions, and earnings-relatedsupplements are paid on top of flat-rate sickness benefit.   Under theGovernment&apos;s recent proposals*, invalidity benefit will also be earnings-related.   The attendance allowance is the only social security benefit paidspecifically to disabled people which is not restricted either to those whohave paid contributions or to those whose disablement can be traced to employment, or to service in the armed forces.31.   It is because the benefits paid to those who are disabledare based either on the principle of compensation for what has occurredwhile in the services or in employment, or on the insurance principle, thatthose disabled in other circumstances and who have paid no contributions have so far been &quot;left out&apos; and have had to rely largely on supplementary benefit.-^&quot;Better Pensions&quot;.   Cmnd.5713 September 1974.
CHAPTER THREEMET NEED AMD UNMET FEED32.   Those who are disabled do not want to be regarded as a class apart.   they want their needs to be met, wherever appropriate, by provisions available toall, and not by separate provisions designed for disabled people.   Nor do they want to be denied benefits available to others, simply because they aredisabled and cannot qualify as others do by paying contributions.   Many of theneeds of those who are disabled are shared by others.   Not all disablement   (generates extra costs and thus extra needs for &quot;income, though some clearly does.This is why it is right to examine how far the needs of disabled people areadequately met by existing provisions or will be met by the radical reform ofnational insurance for which the Government has already announced its plans.The impact of the Governmenfs other plans for improvements in social security33.     Of all the existing national insurance benefits, retirement pension is ofthe greatest importance to disabled people, simply because the majority of hdisabled people are over pension age and a high proportion do not becomedisabled until after this age.   Those aged 65 and over constituted 63 per cent of the &quot;appreciably handicapped&apos; category in the OPCS survey, 64 per cent ofthose in the &quot;severely handicapped1 categories and 73 per cent of those in the&apos;very severely handicapped1 categories.   It was pointed out in chapter two that,of the current total of perhaps 1.2 million people who are appreciably or moreseverely handicapped (in OPCS survey terms), about 830,000 are elderly.   Thecontinued improvement of retirement pensions is therefore crucial for meetingthe financial needs of disabled people.34.      Older people who are disabled have already benefitted from the recordincrease in pensions this year, and will benefit from the guarantee that futureannual increases will be in line not jus&quot;t with increases in prices but withIncreases in earnings.   The Government&apos;s long-term pensions policy will gradually transform the living standards of many old people through theprovision of earnings-related pensions by the new state scheme or a combination of state and occupational schemes, giving them real security, and reducing thepresent substantial dependence on means-tested benefits.
35.     Below pension age, the severest financial consequence of disablement isinability to earn.   Provision for incapacity for work has long been made in thenational insurance scheme, but it is only in recent years that long-terminvalidity benefit has been separated from short-term sickness benefit and given a preferential lead not only in terms of the basic personal rate of benefit butalso in the level of dependants&apos; benefits.   The Government has already announcedits plans for further improvements in invalidity pension, based on the same principles as the proposals for retirement pension, thus recognising that long-term invalidity is often tantamount to early retirement.36.    V/here rehabilitation for work has proved impossible, invalidity benefithas the central role in provision for the chronically sick and disabled ofworking age.   At any one time, over 400,000 people draw invalidity pension,and this is topped up in more than four cases out of five by the invalidityallowance - which is carried over into retirement as an addition to the retire-ment pension, just as the adverse effects of prolonged incapacity duringvrorking life are carried over.   In common with retirement pensioners,invalidity pensioners have benefitted from this year&apos;s unprecedented increasein long-term benefit rates; and they will also benefit from future increases in line with earnings.   When the Government&apos;s new pension scheme is introduced,future invalidity pensioners will obtain the right to earnings-relatedinvalidity benefits.   The invalidity allowance will continue, in1 recognitionof the special position of those who have had to give up work at an early age.They are the group for whom earnings-related pensions will bring least help.The Government&apos;s intention to raise the upper-age limit for the higher rateoof invalidity allowance will provide for many beneficiaries an   allowance ata higher rate than they now receive.Other benefits37.      The attendance allowance is of immense importance not only because itextends across all age groups from the age of two, but because it is thefirst benefit specially designed to meet the exclusive needs of some of the mo fitseverely disabled.   It is not, and was never intended to be, a general benefit for disablement as such.   Its purpose was, and remains, to help those among the disabled who require a considerable degree of personal attention.   TheGovernment has carefully considered whether, apart from such procedural develop-ments as may be possible, there is a case for changes in the scope of the allow-ance.   The number of higher rate allowances in payment is probably nearingstability at about 110,000 but the number of lower rate allowances - 55*000 in payment at 30 June 1974 - continues to move upwards.   Nevertheless, the
response to the introduction of the lower rate has been much less than expected.   This in itself suggests that there is no solid basis for a further extension of the allowance designed as. it is as an attendance-needs benefit,further extension would produce a benefit for &quot;disablement&apos; as such ratherthan &quot;for attendance needs.   The rate of the allowance has however been increased this year to become  8 a week at the higher rate and  5.35 atthe lower rate (instead of  6.20 and   1*4.15 respectively).   And the attendance allowance Board are reviewing their procedures so that, insofar as theresources of medical manpower permit, a more intensive examination can be madeof claims, particularly at the review stage,   what is needed now in the areaof attendance needs is a benefit to meet the needs of those,who give up workto care for disabled people.&apos;! :-:i-::-rK;^&apos;v     - &apos; U&apos;v &apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;- - &apos; ll - r- V &apos;    &apos;     &apos; -     -&apos; 7 &apos; , - &apos; - . &quot;M, i   &apos; -        &quot;II     &apos;&apos;   -30.     Britain is in accord with the practice of most other countries in makingspecial and preferential provision for those disabled at work or in war.   Thewar pensions and industrial injuries schemes have a proper and honourable placein a wider system - a place which in no sense impedes appropriate development by the state of cash and service provision for other disabled people39.   Invalidity-benefit, attendance allowance, war pensions and industrial injuries benefits by no means exhaust the list of benefits that are of help to large numbers of disabled people.   The existing structure of general and specific benefits focussing on the main contingencies, on which the Governmentis planning to build important improvements, is fundamentally sound.   The maincriticism that can be levelled against it is that there are some people who areat a serious disadvantage as a result of disablement but who are neverthelessleft out, and some serious    effects        of disablement which are largelyignored.&quot;Congenitally&apos; disabled people40.    Invalidity benefit is payable during a person1 s working years only tothose who have paid at least a minimum of contributions.   The contributory ^principle has been modified over the years, but many people still attach greatimportance to its positive aspect, namely the legal entitlement to rightsif-without test of means.   The negative aspect is that those who have not paidcontributions, even through no fault of their own, have no entitlement tocontributory national insurance benefit.   This applies with particular force tosome 220,000 people under pension age who have been incapable of work for morethan six months, and who, were it not for their incapacity, would be bread-winners.   The majority of them have been disabled from birth (many by mentalimpairment), but this is not true of them all.   Some became disabled duringchildhood and others after reaching working age but before they becamequalified for invalidity benefit.   It is for this group of people, deprivedboth of their normal role in the community and of the normal rights that go
with that role, that pressure is strongest for a non-means-tested benefit toconfer the very important psychological advantage of membership oi&apos; the national insurance community.   IJor is their case weakened by the fact that, if theywere granted a new, non-means-tested benefit, some of them (the number v;oulddepend on the level of benefit) would still be unable to manage withoutcontinued recourse to supplementary benefit.41.   Of the 220,000 people in this group, some 135,000 depend on supplementary benefit.   Another 15,000 or so do not even receive supplementary-benefit.   This is because their families carry the burden themselves or perhaps,in some cases, because of private resources.   In addition to these 150,000people, there are 70.000&apos;or so long-stay 1 patients of working again psychiatrie hospitals who have no national insurance record.   Their pocket-money, if any, comes from hospital funds, oh which there are many other demands,and they thus tend to receive pocket-money well below that received by otherlong-term hospital in-patients.   The previous Government announced in 1971 thatthe Supplementary Benefits Commission would take over from the hospitalsresponsibility for providing psychiatric in-patients with pocket-money as sponas resources permitted.Full-time attendants42.   In some cases a person&apos;s handicap is so severe that a member of the house-hold has to give up work (or is unable to start it) because of the need toprovide care at home.   There are often considerable savings to the health and personal social services as a result.   A long period of caring for a sickrelative may mean that the &apos;attendant&apos; emerges at the end with poor health andpoor prospects of getting a job.   Successive Governments have taken the view thatthe contingency of giving up work to meet attendance needs cannot be providedfor under a contributory insurance scheme.   They have argued that supplementary-benefit - without the usual requirement to register for work - is an appropriate and flexible way of providing an income for the attendant.   A theoreticalalternative solution is the development of services to reduce the burden ofattendance so that it is unnecessary for the relative to give up work.   Ingeneral, however, the health and personal social services.still lack theresources and manpower to provide the intensive level of services required.Thus, in these instances of very severe disableaent,the only way the disabledperson can continue to be cared for at home and avoid institutional care is oftenfor the relative to give up work.   With the current strain on both domiciliaryand residential services, the value of care in the family by the family whensomeone is willing to take responsibility is beyond dispute.   Even if adequateservices were available, care by-a relative would still be a better solution in many cases.   There is a strong
case for the provision of a non-contributory benefit as of right in thesecircumstances, even though the person needing attendance qualifies for the attendance allowance, since this is not designed to provide for themaintenance of the attendant.Disabled housewives43*     &apos;Housewives&quot; in this context are essentially married women who do nothave paid work, and whose normal job is in the home.   Some housewives are sodisabled that not only would they be incapable of doing a paid job, but theyare unable to cope with the household work which is their working contributionto the family.   The OPCS survey suggests the very tentative estimate of 40,000such women below pension age with husbands at work.   A wife with this degreeof incapacity can have a most serious impact on the household budget, indeedon the family&apos;s ability to stay together.   The economic value,to the householdof the wife&apos;s work is beyond dispute.   The cash implications of the housewife&apos;sdisablement are higher expenses for laundering, extra heating, mechanical aids,domestic help and so on.   In extreme cases, the wife&apos;s disablement not onlycuts into her husband&apos;s resources and time but takes him out of the employmentfield altogether, and there is the risk of the marriage breaking under all the physical, emotional and financial strains.44*     understandably, this situation has been an important element in the criticism in recent years of the exclusion of the housewife from personalentitlement to contributory and non-contributory benefits (other than attendance allowance).   This exclusion is popularly but wrongly attributed to the fact thatshe is not &apos;a worker&apos;.   The exclusion exists because national insurance and supplementary benefits alike have been planned to provide a substitute for maintenance from earnings.   Those wives who have gone out to work and have paid the requisite contributions are covered for invalidity benefit at the same rate as anyone else.   A substantial number of disabled housewives, however, have norecent contribution record to enable them to qualify for invalidity benefit.This is partly the result of the married woman1s option not to contribute and   1partly the result of the pattern of married women&apos;s employment.   The qualifyingconditions for invalidity pension as laid down under the Social Security Act 1973will be easier to satisfy than the present ones, and this means that, from April 1975more married women who have had paid jobs outside the home will be able to qualify.In any event, the Government intends to remove the married woman&apos;s option in respectof pensions,including invalidity pension, when its new pension scheme is introduced.This will ensure that almost all married women in the employment field will be covered for invalidity benefit.   But there will still be some severely
disabled housewives who are 1left out, notably those whose disablement is such that they have never been able either to take laid work outside the home and soto build up a contribution record or to do their household work.   The Governmentwill be studying further how best they can be helped.Disabled children45.   Disablement in a child can involve serious handicaps for his family aswell as for the child himself.   It can prevent a parent from taking paidemployment or otherwise restrict career opportunities.   It can also limit the time available to do the housework and look after the other children.Similarly the child&apos;s disablement can involve payment for services which the parents would normally provide for themselves,.   Providing a severely disabledchild with the stimulus that all children need (and disabled children oftenmore than other children) may be more expensive in cash.terms, as well asmaking additional physical and emotional demands on the parents.&quot;Jihough cash is far from being the whole answer.Domiciliary services, playgroups, day nurseries and special educationfacilities, and many other services are needed as well.The experience of the Family Fund*shows the wide variety of needs.   Attendance allowance is currently provided to the parents of 33,000 children.   There are many other children who do not satisfy the medical criteria for the attendance allowance, but are none theless severely disabled.   The Government will be sponsoring research to helpanswer some of the hitherto unanswered questions about disabled children andtheir needs.Disabled people in employment46.   A great many disabled people manage to work full-time or part-time, somesuffering a partial loss of earning capacity.   To work at all, they oftendisplay a courage and determination which is seldom required of those who arenot disabled.   Many of them receive low earnings for their work.   A survey ofdisabled earners^whioh the OPCS conducted in 1973 through the mechanism of the*&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;1&quot; n*The Family Fund was established in April 1973 with an initial  3 million fromthe previous Government.   Its purpose is to help the families of congenitallyhandicapped ohildren.   By the end of May, 1974, the Fund, whioh is managed bythe Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust,/had given grants totalling nearly 1,300,000 to about 6,000 families.^The &quot;disabled earner&quot; in this oontext was essentially sometme who identifiedhimself as handicapped in respeot of employment by his disablement - handicapincluding extra expense as well as reduction in earnings or earnings potential.Many people who, for example, get an industrial injuries disablement pension would not be &quot;disabled&quot; on these criteria.   Net all disabled earners were actually working, and the disabled earner definition does not coincideprecisely with that used in the 1968/69 OPCS survey &quot;Handicapped and Impairedin Great Britain&quot;.   The General Household Survey indicator for   use of thespecial disabled earner schedule was a &quot;long standing&quot; illness, disablement orinfirmity.
General Household Survey found that they were less well paid, less satisfied with their work and in lower status jobs than the average of the employedpopulation. As well as being older, they also, as a group, had lower educationalattainments than employed people as a whole.   Those who have acquired neitherskills nor qualifications suffer the greatest disadvantages, while those with higher education may get good jobs and good pay and may not even be identified as disabled.   Thus the ideal solution to the employment problems of manydisabled people is rehabilitation and the provision of special opportunities fortraining and education to enable them wherever possible to enter jobs where their disablement is not a handicap.47.     Questions involving th  employment of disabled people are primarily matters for the Department of Employment, though the close relationship between medical and vocational rehabilitation is being given increasing recognition.   The.Department of Employment is conducting a comprehensive review of its services and policies in this field.   Assisted by the co-ordinating role of the ParliamentaryUndersecretary of State (Disablement) (the &quot;Minister for the Disabled&quot;), theDepartment of Health and Social Security and the Department of Employment willcontinue to work closely together on aspects of the review which are or may beaffected by policy on cash benefits.48.   There are a number of possible intermediate stages between benefit at oneend of the spectrum and full earnings in open employment at the other.   they include benefit plus earnings in an occupational centre, industrial rehabilitation-tion allowances, wages in sheltered employment and training allowances.   Anindividuals progress towards satisfactory resettlement should not be impededby financial disincentives.   Indeed financial incentives should be pulling inthis direction; although it is not easy to ensure that this happens in practice.In relation to those attending an industrial rehabilitation unit part-time,while still hospital patients, it has already been possible to agree upon more flexible arrangements as to the amount of work they can do without sacrificingbenefit entitlement.   In this field, the problems of each individual need to be identified and assessed and the various central and local services closelyco-ordinated to ensure an efficient, intelligible and accessible programme forthe use of cash and non-cash resources.      I49.   Under present arrangements people are assumed to move from &quot;total&quot;incapacity for work and the receipt of invalidity benefit to full-time work and earnings.   Many do manage to achieve this.   But it has been cogently argued thatsome might be able to resume work more quickly if there were a cash benefit which could be reoeived at the same time as earnings.   This has been thesubstance of recurring criticism of the fact that those who earn  4.50 or morebecome disqualified for invalidity benefit.   What emerges clearly from these
critioisms is that the  4.50 permitted earnings is seen not as an &apos;easement&apos;,which it was intended to be, but as a restriction.   Invalidity benefit is payable only if the claimant is incapable of work.   In general, anyone who isat work or could be working is disqualified; but the earnings limit allows a hospital in-patient, for example, to do some work under medical supervision aspart of his treatment and yet to continue to be regarded as incapable of work.Critics of the earnings disqualification, however, claim that it hinders orstops disabled people from returning to part-time work, in other words, that itacts as a brake on rehabilitation.50.   The simple expedient of raising the ..G4.50 figure would not, of itself, makeinvalidity benefit into a benefit suitable for instances of partial as well astotal incapacity.   The key point is that limiting income support to thosetotally incapable of work is increasingly seen as too narrow an approach.  Butif a benefit were to be paid for partial incapacity as such, it would benecessary to define it in practical operational terms.   Firm evidence is lackingon precisely what partial incapacity means in practice, and indeed on thiswhole area.51     The problems for the disabled worker of extra expense, of low income and of incentives are closely related.   Such evidence as there is, here andabroad, points to the possible value of a separate standard benefit to bepaid to severely disabled people who are working despite their disablement.This sort of benefit must not be confused with invalidity benefit, which provides for the maintenance of disabled people who are unable to work.   a benefit of this kind would give some recognition of what has been lost, andof the wider implications of disablement, without being tied to assessmentsof the effects of disablement.   Such assessments are bound to be complex,costly to administer and at considerable risk of being inequitable or seemingIto be inequitable to those who are not given what they expect to be given.This is an area in which more informed discussion and more information are needed before the right answers can be found.   The Government is anxious todraw on the practical experience of those who are professionally andI personally involved, and will be making the necessary arrangements for consultation.General52*   Despite the wealth of new evidence, no clear picture emerges of the&apos;problem of disablement&apos;.   There are, in fact, a number of different inter-locking problems rather than one single problem.   No simple analysis can be19
made and no single simple solution i3 appropriate.   Nor can new benefits be worked out in isolation from the provision of servioes.   A balance has to be struck between the provision of service^ and the provision of cash, to securethe best use of available resources.   The constraints on further improvementsare more than financial.   It is not only services which involve the use of skilled manpower.   The prooess of assessing &quot;disablement1, for the determina-tion of eligibility for benefits however it is done, can also make cbnsider-able demands on scarce skills.53.   A new overall structure would not provide every &quot;disabled1 person with thesame benefit.   Nor would everyone who could be called disabled necessarilyreceive some benefit.   There must be priorities.   The greatest needs must be identified and met first,   A start must be made with a sound programme of cash benefits and services which takes account both of the practical limitations of detailed assessments of need and of the choices expressed by disabled people themselves.
CHAPTER FOURTHE GOVERNMENT&apos;S PROPOSALSSocial Security Developments54&apos;   The Government&apos;s immediate proposals for social security changes are based on four principlessFirst, better provision for the severely disabled must come before further provision for the less severely disabled.Second, benefits for those who cannot work should take priority overfurther provision for those who can, as the loss of the ability to earnis stark, overwhelming and readily identifiable.Third, those of working age who would be at work but for long-standingincapacity should have the right to a benefit without test of means.Fourth, those who relieve the social services and sacrifice work oppor-tunities to look after people at home should be provided with a benefitas of right.   Neither the stated purpose of attendance allowance nor theevidence on how it is spent make it right to regard it as a maintenancebenefit to be paid over to a full-time attendant who has no benefit or pension.Non-contributory Invalidity Pension55*   As explained earlier, national insurance contributors who have been incapable of work for more than six months receive invalidity pension.   This is at thesame rate as the standard rate of retirement pension -  10 for all contributors,including married women.   There are some 220,000 chronically sick people underpension age who do not qualify even though they would ordinarily have beenbreadwinners but for their disablement.   This group consists of people, other ,than married women, who have never been able to establish an adequate contri-butiori record, usually because they have been disabled from an early age.   Of;t/he 220,000, about 135,000 are on supplementary benefit, perhaps 15,000 arewithout any benefits, and roughly 70,000 are long-stay in-patients of psychiatrichospitals.*Where &apos;congenitally&apos; disabled people not receiving supplementary benefit areconcerned, estimates have had to be derived from the OPCS survey;   and experience with the attendance allowance counsels caution in translating the survey data into precise estimates of the numbers who might establishentitlement to a new benefit.
56.   It is palpably wrong to deny altogether basic benefit as of right to people who because of severe disablement have not been able to established themselves as contributors in the insurance scheme.   At the same time, itwould be inconsistent with the maintenance of the contributory basis of that scheme and inequitable in comparison with the treatment of those already overpension age - particularly those who have no or reduced pensions and are just&apos; as disabled as those under pension age - to pay non-contributory invalidity pension at the full contributory rates to people under pension age.   following the precedent of the non-contributory pension provided for people aged 80 andover, the Government therefore proposes to,provide a non-contributory invalidity pension at the rate of 60 per cent of the standard benefit, that is, at therate of  6 a week, without any test of means.   The benefit would be availableto people of working age who would have been entitled to contributory invalidity pension had they satisfied the contribution conditions and who would ordinarilyhave been breadwirmeig but for their disablement. The benefit will not be designed to cover married women living with or maintained by their husbands.As explained in paragraphs 43 and 44 above, there are sound reasons for providing a non-contributory benefit for married women who, by reason of disablement,are unable to perform their household tasks (as well as being unable to performpaid work) and the Government is studying the possibilities.   It will, however,be necessary to consider this group as a whole since it would not be practicableor justifiable to seek to distinguish those who would have been working outsidethe home but for their disablement.   The qualifying conditions to be satisfied by married women dependent on their husbands would be rather different fromthose relating to the benefit now proposed for other women and for men (insofarae iraspcrty to do housework would be the prime issue on which the entitlementof dependent married women would turn) and, on the precedent of the old persons&apos;pensions, the rate of benefit would be rather lower.would get57.   Psychiatric hospital in-patients of Working age who qualified for the opw benefit/the normal pocket-money rate for long-stay in-patients of  2 a week, insteadof the supplementary benefit previously envisaged for them (paragraph 43) -always provided, as under the present rules, that the full amount can be usedfor the patienfs personal comfort or enjoyment.
l)Pi.   Subject to Parliamentary approval, the Government aims t,o get the newinvalidity pension into payment during 1975/76.   This would meet a long-standing and understandable grievance, and reduce dependence on supplementary benefit,potential or actual, for over 200,000 people under pension age.   Once awarded,and subject to incapacity continuing right up to pension age, the new benefit would remain in payment beyond pension age unless the person concerned qualified for retirement benefit at an equal or higher rate,59.   At 1974 rates of benefit, the net cost of the proposed non-contributoryinvalidity pension in the first full year woui,&amp; be  7 million, after taking account of savings on supplementary benefit (or, in the case of the psychiatrichospital in-patients, pocket-money from hospital funds).&quot; 11Invalid     gage Allowance60.   The Government also proposes a new benefit for those of working age who would be breadwinners in paid employment but for the need to stay athome and act as unpaid attendants to people who are severely disabled and need care.   The attendants would in the main be relatives, but long-termmembers of the household might also be included.   Caring situations arenot, of course, limited to households with a severely disabled member -problems of a similar sort arise where there is a small chid, a temporarilysick person, or an elderly person; but it is important to set limits to thescope of a new benefit, and to concentrate on the most severe contingency.Thus the receipt of attendance allowance would be used to determine the disabled person&apos;s need for care and married women (other than those notliving with or maintained by their husbands) would not in general be eligible for the benefit (as they might be at home in any event.), Theinvalid care allowance would like the other new non-contributory benefitbe at the rate of  6 a week (in 1974 terms) for men  or women.   Also likethe non-contributory invalidity pension, the allowance would be paid witn-out test of means or of contributions - to include the few who had never been at work as well as the many more Who had had to give up a paid job.The Government&apos;s White Paper &quot;Better Pensions&quot; (Cmnd 5713) proposes that^the pension entitlement of, among others, those who have to stay at home to care for an adult receiving attendance allowance should be protected.Prom the start of the new pension scheme, recipients of invalid careallowance would be covered by this proposal, which would ensure that, in themajority of cases, pension rights are not lost because of the interruption,or delayed start, of earnings.
6l.   No firm information is available from which to estimate how many people might be eligible to claim the new allowance, though it is known that some 7,500 women and 4,000 men have been receiving supplementary benefits for more than six months because they are looking after elderlyor disabled relatives.   Based on this total of 11,500, the net cost wouldbe nearly  1 million in a full year.   But the cost could well be greateronce the availability of the new allowance became known.   By basing theentitlement on the receipt of attendance allowance, it should be possibleto start paying the new allowance in 1976/77.Tax Status of the New Benefits ,!62.   As the non-contributory invalidity pension would, in effect, be acounterpart to the contributory invalidity pension - which is tax-exempt -the non-contributory invalidity pension would also be exempted from taxwhilst the beneficiary was under pension age.   There is no such precedent,howeverrto apply to the invalid care allowance, which would be taxable.In practice, tax liability is not likely to arise for many of those concerned.Further Progress63.   These new benefits will run alongside the improved invalidity benefitfore-shadowed in the White Paper on long-term pensions, and the improvements in provision for the family which will take place when theGovernment&apos;s new child cash allowances come to be paid.   Other improvements in existing benefits, such as changes in the supplementary benefitdisregards, will be considered in the normal way.64.   The improvements described in this chapter will benefit nearly a quarter of a million people.   For the congenitally disabled - those people whose disablement has prevented them enjoying normal contributory rights in the national insurance scheme - and for single women (and others) whohave sacrificed a career as well as other prospectB to care for aseverely disabled person, what is proposed gives help where it is badly needed, establishes radically new principles, and corrects some seriousdeficiencies in the existing scheme of things.65. The Government also recognises that the disablement of the housewifecan bring disaster to many homes. It is in the interests of society thatthe family should be kept together and that the breadwinner should not be forced to give up his job to do the domestic tasks that have become beyond
his wife&apos;s capacity.   In addition to what is already provided for thoseeligible for the attendance allowance, help for the disabled housewifehas long been one of the priority demands of the organisations which speakfor the disabled and the Government recognises its validity.   There arespecial problems associated with the provision of a benefit for women whoare not only unable to do paid work   but who may never have wished to seekemployment outside the home.   Nonetheless the jG-overnment is satisfied thata solution can be found and will be working out detailed plans to be implemented on a phased programme once the other improvements described in this chapter are under way.   This further development will not meet allthe problems of the disabled, but resources must be kept in hand for theexpansion of the services which are equally vital to them.   The three newcategories of cash benefits we shall be introducing will lay the foundations on which the Government will wish to build as resources permit.
ANNEXFURTHER information the basis of the review,    It has been made clear in a number of statements about  ite.review under Sectioh 36of the Social Security Act 1973 that decisions would be taken on the basis of asthorough an examination of the information available as time allowed:    of what hadbeen written about disabled people and, certainly no less important, what had been written by them.   The literature is extensive, and the rate at which additions havebeen made has accelerated in recent years.   It reflects divergent interests, and indeed divergent points of view;   it ccld hardly do other, given the range andemotive nature of the subject.   In addition to published material, unpublishedresearch and personal or collective contributions, based on-personal experience,have been taken into account.   The responsibilities of the Department of health and Social Security, direct and indirect, touch for good or ill on many aspects ofthe lives of people who are disabled.   Use has also been made of the experienceacquired in this way.2.     It would not be appropriate to seek to reflect all this material explicitlyin this report.   Its main influence is implicit in the conclusions reached, and inthe further work already in progress to prepare the way for possible laterdevelopments.   However, this annex dets out some of the information available^asfurther background to the discussion in the -uain body of the report.7ery severely, severely and appreciably handicapped3.  A number of references have been made to the 1968/9 survey, by the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), and to its estimates of the numberof people, living at home, physically &apos;impaired&quot; or *handicapped&apos;, by reference to capacity for self-care.   It may be helpful to repeat hereillustrations used in the OPCS survey report itself to explain the significance of the gradations of handicap:&apos;Very severely handicapped1 (categories 1-3):   A man, in full-time employment,with polio, who lived alone but employed a man to get him out of bed each morning,bathe and dress him, and carry him to his wheelchair;   who was able to eat and drink without help, but not to leave his chair or get to a W.O.&apos;Severely handicapped&apos; (categories 4-5) J   A man, in full-time employment,affected by a stroke, who needed help from his family with putting on shoes andsocks, and with having a bath;   and who found dressing and shaving difficult, but could use the W.C. without difficulty.

5.    A diagnosis   on its own does not necessarily provide evidence as to the^severity of disablement;   the effects of a particular condition vary from person to person and over a period.   The Character of the 0PC3 survey in itselfinfluenced the extent to which various conditions were&apos; or were not recorded.   the broad-brush picture is, however, of interest.   For all the adults covered by theOPCS survey, the commonest condition causing impaiiment was arthritis, whereassevere handicap was most commonly associated with diseases of the central nervoussystem.DHSS statistics6.    The industrial injuries and war pensions schemes provide rather specialiseddais.   More general interest attaches to the data obtained from invalidity pension and attendance allowance.   The number of (long-term sick) invalidity pensioners hastended to rise?   although the fact that invalidity pension is replaced by retire-ment pension to some extent masks the size of the older ohronioally sick  population.It was estimated that at 3 June 1972, there were 425j000 invalidity pensioners,including some ovej? minimum pension age, and at 3 June 1973, 436,000.   The oomraon-est diagnostic categories, in order of importance, are bronchitis, psychosis andneurosis, and isohaemic heart disease.   Attendance allowance statistics are avail-able for a more recent  date.   At 30 June 1974i of the 165,000 allowances in payment,33,000 were paid for children, 52,000 to adults of working age and 80,000 to peopleover pension age.   Among children for whom attendance allowance was in payment,congenital abnormalities constituted the most frequently recorded main diagnosis,whereas among adults of working age it was diseases of the nervous system, and among elderly attendance allowance beneficiaries diseases of the circulatorysystem.7.     People being maintained in hospital      other residential care at public expense do not in general qualify for attendance allowance;   and the OPCS survey was concerned only with adults living at home.   Invalidity pension (and retirement pension for those over pension age) are payable to those in the various forms of residential care, though the beneficiary may receive only a reduced rate ofpension.   It is estimated that some 200,000 adults are in a long-stay category,most of whom aregeriatric or psychiatric in-patients.   Over 7,000 children have been in hospital for/more than six months, often reflecting less the absolute need for the sort of medical care only available in hospital than the inability of the parents to provide the very high level of support needed at home.   Residential care statistics do not distinguish between need based on physical or mental dependence, and need based mainly on theunsuitability of alternative domestic arrangements.   Such as they are, they showthat there are of the order of 45,000 adults in resident! I homes and another 5,500
in psychiatric homes and hostels; some 130,000 children are in special schools forthe educationally subnormal, the physically handicapped, eto; and 28,000 childrenwith mental handicap are in the oars of looal authorities.8.   ,Other statistics at present available relating to disabled ohildren indicatebroadly that 5,500 are registered with local authorities as blind or partiallysighted; 3,500 blind or partially sighted children are receiving specialeducation; 5,500 children are registered with local authorities: as deaf or partiallydeaf; some 6,500 deaf or partially deaf children are receiving special education;and there are some 15,000 ohildren on the general classes registers of localauthorities. ,&apos; ;   ir -&apos; - X &apos;    J&quot;       : &apos;Reoent surveys9.     In addition to further work on the data from the 1968/9 OPCS surrey, two further studies, on which reports will be published, have been carried out by theOPCS on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Security.   These are the disabled Earners Survey and the Medium and Long-Gem Sickness Survey.10.   The Disabled Earners Survey, which was conducted in 1973 by using the GeneralHousehold Survey, attempted to assess the extent to which disabled people at worksuffer a loss in earning potential and incur expenses arising from disablement.The results of this survey, based on interviews, suggested, inter alia, that thenumber of impaired earners might be expected to lie between 1,440,000 and1,780,000 and that.the number of disabled earners (ie those whose impairmentinvolved seme work handicap measurable in financial terms) could.be estimatedat about 650,000.*11.   The Medium and Long-Term Sickness Survey (carried out by the OPCS on thebasis of a sample of people reoeiving incapacity benefits) investigated thecircumstances and needs of sick persons themselves and factors causing delay inreturn to work.   The survey was limited to people of working age and to those whohad been incapable of work for a certain length of time (groups of people werecompared who had been off sick for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year).Results so far to hand are concerned with extra expense, and illustrate   the wide range of experience in this respect.This compares with a figure of 575,000 people currently registered with theDepartment of Employment as disabled.   A disabled person in this context is defined as someone who &quot;,..on account of injury, disease or congenital deformityis substantially handicapped in obtaining or keeping employment or in undertakingwork on his own account of a kind which, apart from that injury, disease ordeformity would be suited to his age, experience and qualifications&quot; (disabled persons (Employment) Act 1944).   The Department of Employment estimates that thenumber of people eligible for registration is considerably higher than this figure.    The primary emphasis here is not on the financial implications of disablement. &apos;a*\
*The first two quotations in paragraph 13 are both from a 1969 Symposium,reported in &quot;Pensions and the Handicapped&quot;; Ed. William Hargreaves.   The thirdquotation is from Reginald Ford writing in &quot;Stigma - The Experience ofDisability&quot;;   Ed. Paul Hunt.   Chapman 1966.12.   The report of the 1968/69 OPCS survey estimated that some 225,000 marriedwomen - in round terms nearly a quarter of a million - could not do their householdwork;   two-fifths of them (ie 89,000 or so) being under age 65.     Further, moreselective, analysis of the survey data by OPCS produced a figure of 58,000 marriedwomen housewives who were prevented by their disablement from doing their housework:this figure excluded women over 60.     Of the 58fOOO, 4*000 were working full-time and4,000 part-time;   2,000 were temporarily sick or unemployed;   and a further 13,000were receiving personal benefits or had husbands receiving benefits.     This producesa net figure of 35*000, which might be rounded - in view of the uncertainties - to40,^00 as an estimate of the number of married women housewives of working age, not normally in paid employment, incapable of doing their housework, and without anybasic benefit cover.Characteristics of disabled living13.   Statistics alone do not provide sufficient basis for even a very preliminarypicture of &quot;disablement1.     Three quotations^ from disabled people enlarge thatpicture:   &quot;We didn&apos;t buy our disablement, so why should we pay for it?&quot;   &quot;Non-disabled people did not buy our disablement either, so why should they have to pay for it?&quot;   &quot;The wider the view, the more places are visible that one realizes areunreadable.&quot;        From the point of view of one professionally concerned with helpingdisabled people, an Imerican writer has quoted the proverb: &quot;A fool can put on bisown clothes better than a wise man can do it for him.&quot;.1/J.   The &apos;problem&apos; of disablement can be considered at the national economic and social level - in terms of lost production, the demand on scarce resources of manpower and technology;   or it can be seen in terms of the fact that one man&apos;sloss Is a loss to the whole community.     At the level of the individual enterprise,social group, or family, the disablement of one member of the group can involvea wide range of handicaps for the other members.     For the disabled person disablementcan mean a narrowing of choice, a closing of options, reduced income, extra effort and cost in order to achieve even ^uite modest goals.     Much depends both on innateabilities and characteristics, and on the physical and human environment.     Therearc, some ve-y severely disabled people whose achievement is now as well known as their disablement.
15*   While case histories abound, statistical data capable of generalising&apos; orbalancing individual experience are less readily available.    Both the 1968/9OPCS l&amp;rvey, at one extreme, and the later small Merseyside study by the DisablementIncome Group, at the other extreme, encountered the same problem.     It has been noted&apos;that the correlation between income level and degree of disablement is influenced by many other factors, and that the evidence suggests that it is often in low incomejobs that disablement appears as a specific work handicap.    In terms of extraexpense, of the cost of disabled living, generalisation is also difficult.   Notonly does severe disablement, particularly when combined with old age (as it oftenis), sometimes mean restriction of travel costs and food costs;   but to spend moreyou need to have more to spend;   while the more you have to spend, the less a shiftin expenditure because of disablement will be necessary.    Expense on medicines&apos;iihas loomed large in the survey data available, but the exemption cf the elderly, andthe extension of free or special arrangements for other groups substantially affects the position;   and the Government is of course committed to the eventual abolition ofprescription charges when economic circumstances and the resources available to the health servioe allow, and, in the shorter term, to seeking ways of providing furtherrelief to the ohronic sick .&quot;)6.   Among other expenses related to chronic sickness or disablement, extra heating,special diet, domestic help and travel loom large.   Travel costs fall to be dealtwith in the Government&apos;s conclusions on the Sharp report.   The costs of domestichelp are of course influenced by the availability of home helps and the chargingpractices of local authorities.   Estimates of the overall incidence of extra expenses due to disablement among the various survey populations rangebetween one third and two thirds of those surveyed.    In Norway where extraexpenses benefits are paid to disabled people under certain conditions, it hasbeen necessary to relate entitlement to the (assumed) need for extra expense ratherthan to the established existence of extra expense.     (Some account is taken offinancial ability to meet the extra expense in the Norwegian system.)    Perhapsparticularly in the oase of children, the extra oost is an aspect as much of beliefas to the benefits which might be gained were extra financial resources available,as it is something based on evidenoe that more money is actually being spent ondisabled individuals than would be spent on the same individuals if they were notdisabled.    The belief, in the case of a child, is that growth, which comes aboutonly through interaction with the human and physical environment, and what the childmakes of that environment, may be more expensive in the case of the handicappedchild because less can be taken for granted and less left to the childf/s owndevices.&quot;&quot;Disabled Housewives on Merseyside (Fourteen Case-studies)N.

17.   The financial implications of disablement are tnus an aspect of rehabilitationand integration.   The more these are seen as objectives, the wider the .range of activities in which it is recognised as right and natural for the disabled person to be involved.   The wider the involvement, the more obvious the remainingbarriers and the more unnatural the appearance of restrictions on choice whichare imposed rather than inevitable.   From the wealth of evidence produced here andabroad, the financial problem often associated with disablement emerges as one ofengaging in normal activities, of meeting addition 1 needs, of supplying alternativesbecause the normal course is ruled out.   The solution is clearly not a simplyfinancial one;   nor, even in financial terms, is it a problem to be tackled by asingle approach.   Belonging means more than payment of the membership fee.Social security provisions for disabled people in other countries18.   Publications issued by, and meetings arranged by the United Nations, theInternational Labour Office, the International Social Security Association, theCouncil of Europe, the European Economic Community, and other international bodies provide a continuing flow of information.   In addition, study visits to andfrom individual countries, and the regular process of negotiating reciprocal,agreements with other countries, mean that working knowledge of social security&apos;provisions elsewhere in the world is acquired in the day-to-day course of&quot;theDepartment1 s work.   During 1971 a Department of Health and Social Security study team,including a doctor, visited Jersey, Denmark, Finland, France, the federal republic of Germany and The Netherlands, to look in greater detail at the operationof cash benefit schemes for handicapped people,&quot;&apos;19.   The relative successes or failures of provisions in one country do not providea ready-made lesson for another country.   Evan between countries which have much in common, there are sufficient differences both in the general background of social policy and in particdar areas to make caution in interpreting the results necessary.Variations in the age structure of the population, the employment situation, the climate of industrial relations, the general economic situation and industrial structure, the character of the system of medical care, and the availability of medical manpower, all have a very real and direct bearing on social securityprovision,,   The desired end of co-operation across national frontiers is generallyseen neither as standardisation nor as precise copying but as the opportunity to relate experience elsewhere to what is known of the needs and circumstances at home..It is,of course, a two-way process.*Gash Benefits^for the Handicapped: A Selective Study of the Schemes of some european Countries in operation:   DHSS i9?Z.fvii)
20.   Commentators usually accept that 1 league tables1 are not very valuable, even when the more grossly misleading data have been eliminated ^and all theappropriate reservations made.   It is more helpful to think in terms of particular points of contrast.   Pour such points are:    the level of benefits, provision forhousewives and others not * employed1 in the traditional sense, provision for disabled people who are working, and trie link between cash benefits and rehabilitation.21.   Earnings-related provision for long-term incapacity is common, though by nomeans universal.   For this particular contingency,&apos; it is generally modifiedearnings-relation, so that a system based in principle on lev.el of earnings and length of service can be tempered to some extent to the needs of those whoseearnings record or time in the employment field has been adversely affected bydisablement.   The effect of earnings-relation maybe further modified by buildinginto the pension an increase in respect of attendance needs;    and this samecombination of long-term incapacity pension and attendance allowance is found in countries where the pension is flat-rate.   The long-term benefit tends to be lower than short-term incapacity benefit (sickness benefit), though this is not invariablyso.   Even with a comparatively low rate of benefit, problems arise in areas whereemployment prospects, particularly for disabled people,are poor, and earnings low,with the result that the pension compares favourably with possible earnings.Comparison with the provision made during rehabilitation (if this is separatelyprovided for) also presents difficulties.   Permanency, which is a common condition for entitlement to the long-term benefit seems to be impossible to establish^ withjaydegree of certainty, and, on balance, an undesirable and an umecessarycomplication.22.   Some schemes are much more selective than the national insurance scheme inthis country in the extent of their coverage.     They may be open to membership!only for employed people - excluding the self-employed - or for certain groups ofemployed people.   Other schemes are more broadly based than the national insurancescheme, so that, for example, married women who have not worked outside the homeand those too disabled ever to have worked at all are included.   Admission based ona residence test extends to the other long-term benefits, and it implies a flat-rat&apos;or basic pension.   In the case of the housewife, there are obviousimplications for dependency benefits:    she will not be provided for both as adependant and a- a member in her own right.   Incapacity for housework tends inpractice to be a severe test.   This is natural insofar as housework is more flexible than most forms of paid employment, and the woman unable to cope with more
than a negligible part of her household duties, even given that flexibility, islikely to be severely handicapped.23.   Provision in cash terms for disabled people at work takes many forms, and theretends to be not one solution but a complex of solutions which relate to eachother a little uneasily.    Arrangements include cumulation for a transitional period of benefit and earnings;    adjustment of benefit by reference to ^earnings;tolerance of modest earnings for an indefinite period without any loss of benefit;graded partial incapacity pensions;   special rehabilitation benefits in place of incapacity benefits;    a severely disabled worker&apos;s allowance pai&quot;&quot;5 to those debarred from incapacity pension because they are working;    and the continuation of certainelements in the pension, such as the attendance allowance, when the: main pensionceases on return to employment.   The effectiveness of policies for the rehabilitation and employment of disabled people is obviously strongly influenced by other factors within those policies as well as by externax factors such asthe state of the labour mafcket, and it would be extremely difficult to single outthe effects of cash benefits as such.   In fact there seems to have been little or no attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of cash benefit policies in this respect.Comments (inevitably subjective) suggest that some of the other cash benefitprovisions are more effective in terms of rehabilitation than partial incapacitypensions as such.24.   Incapacity pensions in other countries in general require   - as compared withtiie requirements in this country - a very substantial medical report, to becompleted either by the doctor with clinical responsibility for the patient, or byone of a large corps of &quot;control doctors&apos;.   That non-medical factors may also beconsidered, particularly where assessment of &quot;partial&apos; incapacity is concerned,means not less medical involvement, but additional involvement by other professionalpeople.25.   Assessment of incapacity for work often relates very closely in other countries to ^assessment of capacity for particular types of work and assessment of need forrehfbilitation and training.   The emphasis on rehabilitation is impressive;   thoughit sometimes reflects the fact, less desirable in British eyes, that responsibility for rehabilitation services is shared between different authorities,each catering for a particular sector of the community rather than forrehabilitation needs irrespective of insurance status.
