IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 10010 September 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1974-75 - 1978-79Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. We have agreed as our guideline for total public expenditure thatit should grow on average over the period to 1978-79 at 2f per cent ayear in demand terms.    One set of programmes which would match thatguideline is that of the 1974 Survey report (shown for convenience inC(74) 101 table A).    But that report only describes what we would get forthe broad allocations of money which we set, with priority for social security, housing, infrastructure for offshore oil, price supportsubsidies and nationalised industries&apos; investment and Northern Ireland(defence being subject to a special review) earlier this year.    Since the survey was made there have been some estimating and policy changes.My colleagues have now looked at these programmes and have told mewhere they think they need more over and above these additions, as inC(74) 101 table B.    We also have substantial prospective commitmentsbeyond these claims.2. Unless we leave enough in our contingency reserve, we shall notlive through the period without having to cut back our plans over and overagain in order to accommodate some imperative new expenditure.3. But our guideline is an economic one, not an accounting one.We are able therefore to accept expenditures beyond those of the 1974Survey (which are already assessed in demand terms) where the additionwill not add materially to demand, although in some cases problems of financing, and therefore perhaps of timing, will arise and require consideration at the time.    There are prospective commitments to   //expenditure in this category shown in C(74) 101 table C.4.        A particular instance of acceptable addition to demand arises in!;the construction industry,   but only in 1975-76 (and the earlier part of1 976-77) when we must expect an unusually low level of demand for this industry&apos;s output.    I have therefore agreed to add to the Surveyprogrammes the amounts shown in table 1 attached to this memorandum,without charging them against the contingency reserve, in order to enableextra public sector construction, generally of a minor kind, to be under-taken within the specified period.COPY NO      r1 g
5.On this account I hope that my colleagues who have asked me for extra expenditure on construction will be able to withdraw these claims.At the least (except in the case of Property Services Agency civil expenditure, which I regard as the means of removing a major source of unrest in local and provincial offices of Departments) I am regarding   for  of my colleagues&apos; claims as met by the construction package.6. The net additions which we then have to consider are set out intable 2 attached.    Part 1 of that table shows changes since the Survey,either agreed changes of policy or revised costings of agreed policy.It is incomplete because it is not possible at this stage to reassessprospective shortfall; I would expect there to be some offset on this account to the escalation of estimates.    I also take account of the fact that someof the policy changes (notably REP) do not add   for   to demand.    while a total offset is not to be expected I propose that this part of the potentialextra commitments should be taken into account at this stage only asbackground to our consideration of other potential additions.7 These are of two kinds.    First, prospective commitments withpositive demand effects, listed in table 2, part 2, together with the probability that our forthcoming negotiations of rate support grant will show that the current expenditure of local authorities has been rising wellabove earlier estimates.    Each of these items will require specificaction in due course.8. Second, there are the claims as reduced by the amounts of theconstruction package.    These are shown in table 2, part 3.    My proposals relating to them are set out in table 3;  some of my proposals would clear the way for early announcements.9. But on this basis we should be left with substantially moreadditional demand than could be met within our guideline.    We must therefore also examine the scope for adjusting priorities betweenprogrammes so that we may accommodate the new elements which wefavour.    I provided notes on the issues arising in the individual programmes as part of my paper C(74) 81, and I should welcome broadguidance from my colleagues; alternatively I will accept a remit to offermy own proposals on priorities.CONCLUSIONS10.I invite my colleagues -a.to note the construction industry package in table 1;b.to agree that I should seek settlements with mycolleagues responsible on the items in part 1 of table 3;secret
c. to endorse my proposals in part 2 of table 3 for settling my colleagues&apos; bids in respect of thoseprogrammes;d. to offer me their guidance on adjustment of priorities,or to give me a remit to offer my proposals, for the accommodation of other extra expenditures within ouragreed guideline.D H11HM Treasury10 September 19743

The Chief Secretary has written to  the Secretaries of State  for the Environment  and Scotland asking them to consider a.-policy for local transport  fares which would limit  fresh calls on public  expenditure and the need for higher Government  grants to local  authorities.     In Scotland,   Strathc^de Regional  Council havebeen considering abolishing  fares  for public  transport at an estimated cost of  60- 75 million a year  (roughly  k5 million in demand terms)  which would be in addition to the sums  shown above.Of the order of  150 millionduration uncertain.(3)   Of the order of  100-150 million over 5 years,  but. offsetting savings are being examined.

These cannot be taxed and cannot bepaid to all groups of social security beneficiary.(c) We should increase RAM in 1975-76 by 35/25p andpostpone the introduction of FB, by one year, to1977-78,    Residual child tax allowances would beretained,(&amp;)     We should not reduce the qualifying period for thelong term rate of supplementary benefit (SB) .b.utwe should increase disregards for SB etc.
