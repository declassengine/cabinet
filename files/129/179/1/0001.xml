Educational Disadvantage and the Educational Needs ofImmigrantsObservations on the Report on Education of the Select Committee on race relations and Immigration1. The Government welcome the Report on Education by the Select Com-mittee on Race Relations and Immigration. They believe that the education service has important contributions to make both to the well-being of immigrantcommunities in this country and to the promotion of harmony between thedifferent ethnic groups, of which our society is now composed. This is because,first, the education service has some responsibility to assist citizens of-all agesto develop their abilities to the full and, within that responsibility, a specialobligation to children who for one reason or another are most at risk of notachieving their true potential: and second, education can be a potent instrument for increasing understanding and goodwill between the races^ It would be wrong to suppose that education alone can achieve all the objectives on whichsociety may set its sights, or that it can function unaffected by conditions insociety at large. As the Select Committee point out, these must have an impact on the environment in which pupils, students and teachers work. Nevertheless,the Government believe that over the years the education service has achievedsignificant results, and at the same time they accept that much remains to bedone to meet the needs of immigrants and their children. The Committee&apos;sReport contains valuable suggestions for action; these the Government have carefully considered from the standpoint of how they can promote the objectivesindicated above. Among other measures, they have decided to set up withinthe Department of Education and Science a special unit to deal with the needsof all those suffering from educational disadvantage including the special needsof different ethnic groups (see paragraph 10 below).2. The arrival in our society of people with a variety of social and culturalbackgrounds has faced the education system with particular challenges. Manymay wish to pursue the social objectives associated with their own culture aswell as that of the host Society. All, of whatever ethnic group, aspire to emoloy-&apos; ment and levels of income commensurate with their abilities; but many enter the education system with sizeable handicaps. These are most pronounced&apos;for the new arrivals children and adults who are confronting for the first timean alien culture and have, additionally, inadequate command of the english language or indeed no knowledge of it at all. Lesser, but Still serious; difficultiesmay face adults from some ethnic groups after many years in this country, who,although reasonably settled in a way of life here, had all or most of theireducation in their country of origin. The Government accept that membersof the immigrant communities recently established in this country have specificeducational needs arising from the fact of immigration and its continuingconsequences needs which may differ according to the country of origin.Some of the measures taken to meet them are described elsewhere in this Reply.There will be a continuing requirement for such measures for many years.3. At the same time the likelihood is that arrivals of new immigrants into theUnited Kingdom, both adults and children, which have fallen in recent years,will not again rise to the levels of a few years ago and will eventually fall further.Thus an ever-increasing proportion of the children of immigrant descent entering
the schools will have been born in this country, many of them to parents settledhere for many years or indeed themselves born here. It is true that some ofthese children may have been reared in the language and customs of the country of origin and may need the same sort of help as a newly arrived immigrant1 child. But, where immigrants and their descendants live in the older urban andindustrial areas, the majority of their children are likely to share with the indigenous children of those areas the educational disadvantages associatedwith an impoverished environment. The Government believe that immigrantu pupils will accordingly benefit increasingly from special help given to all thosesuffering from educational disadvantage. They accept the Select Committee&apos;view that many of those born here, of all minority ethnic groups, will experiencecontinuing difficulties, which must receive special attention from the education service. But others, including many children and adults of indigenous origin,alsp have particular problems to which the education service must respond;arid in large, if, not in complete, measure much the same effort and attention will,be called for.^The pattern of special help must thus provide for all thosesuffering educational disadvantage, taking account of the distinct needs ofdifferent ethnic groups and of individuals, whatever their origin.4. The Government are thus concerned that children in this situation shouldreceive the help that they need. This requires that they should be identified by those in the main the local education authorities and the schools who can give them this help. It is not, however, necessary for this purpose that individualsshould be identified by means of national statistics. The Department of Educa-&apos;tion and Science formerly collected national statistics of immigrant pupils,based upon part only of the relevant population. These statistics were not, ofcourse, the Governmenfs only source of information on the education ofimmigrant pupils; there were also reports from Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate andthe findings of research commissioned by the Department of Education and science, in particular the two reports published by the National Foundation for educational Research, &quot;Immigrant Pupils in England&quot; and &quot;Organisation inMulti-Racial Schools&quot;. But in themselves the statistics, as the Select Committeeconcluded, yielded very little information of educational value; the criteriawere too unselective for the resulting figures to serve as a basis for government policy, while local authorities, schools and teachers required their own morerefined assessments of needs in order to take the various types and levels of decision within their responsibilities. As the Select Committee know, over aconsiderable period the Department of Education and Science devoted effort to exploring whether some other satisfactory basis of statistical return could beagreed, but these efforts did not succeed. In the Governmenfs view the main reason for failure was that no general factual definition could answer such needas is felt within the education service for information about the educationalneeds of immigrants, and that a proper assessment of these needs through the mass collection of Dational statistics was not feasible. The previous government therefore accepted the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that the count ofimmigrant pupils in schools on this approach should be abandoned forthwith.As the next count fell due to be made in January 1974, the decision was made known last November in advance of this Reply.5. Clearly new initiatives are required for the future. It is the local authoritiesand schools which need to identify individual children who are suffering fromeducational disadvantage. But the Government need a soundly based appraisal
of the extent of the problem. This appraisal could be based on a sample of the relevant population and the procedures used to make it should have no implications-tions for the educational treatment of the individual pupils in the sample. Thisis an operation which both raises issues of principle and involves difficulttechnical problems. Initially, the Department of Education and Science will consult with the associations of teachers and local authorities on the objectives and methods involved. Thereafter it will be necessary to commission detailed study and investigation of the extent to which it is feasible to measure the attainment of boys and girls at school, and differences in that attainmentbetween those suffering from social disadvantage, and others, and betweenimmigrants and others.6. The steps described in the previous paragraph will take some time to yieldresults. They should give the Government a better measure of the problems but will not in themselves suggest remedies. Meanwhile there is much that can bedone to secure improvements in the education of immigrants and disadvantagedchildren generally, and there is every reason to do it. To a large extent this is amatter of the dissemination of existing good practice. It has always been partof the role of Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate to identify promising developments in this as in other fields and to advise local authorities and teachers on theintroduction of such developments in new settings/Much of this, of course,relates to local situations but the Inspectorate has helped the Department toproduce three pamphlets on the more general aspects of the education of immigrants; &quot;The Education of Immigrants&quot; and &quot;Potential and Progress in aSecond Culture&quot; both published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office in 1971,and &quot;The Continuing Needs of Immigrants&quot; published in jl 972. In additionmost local authorities employ inspectors or advisers and many of those with substantial immigrant populations have a specialist adviser on immigranteducation. Teacher training, more especially in-service courses, also has animportant part to play, as the Select Committee noted in their Report. TheGovernments views on these matters find expression in their later comments on the recommendations explicitly addressed to the question of teacher training,Nos. 9-13 below.7. The Select Committee&apos;s Report rightly draws attention to the contribution of further and adult education to the educational needs of immigrants. But muchmore is being done by these services than the Committee were able to comment on in their Report. For instance, by March 1974, twenty further educationestablishments were offering preparatory courses mainly, but not exclusively, forimmigrants with an inadequate knowledge of English and Arithmetic. these courses are arranged by the Department of Employment in conjunction with local education authorities and are intended for adults whose standard ofliteracy or numeracy is a bar to vocational training under the Training Oppor-tunities Scheme, or to, suitable employment. In addition there are part-timecourses in English for unemployed immigrants, and some further educationestablishments are able to take account of the special language problems ofsome immigrant students in the wide range of GCE, vocational and non-vocational courses which they provide. There is also the contribution madeby the Youth Service and similar provision for young people. Many immigrantsparticipate in the facilities on offer. In recent years the Department of education and Science has devoted a considerable proportion of its grants for experimental
work to action-research into the ways in which the Youth Service can assistwith the integration of young immigrants and in which the Service can respond to their needs. Here too it appears that immigrants share many problems withother disadvantaged young people.8. The above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of what is being done,nor would the Government claim that enough is already being provided. How-ever, while they do not dissent from the Select Committee&apos;s view that in the &apos;immediate future local education authorities may have to give priority to improving their services for immigrant children, the Government believe that provision is also required for adults. Such provision will be for the sake of theadult immigrants themselves (to enhance their opportunities of self-fulfilmentand of integration in our society), for society&apos;s sake (to assist racial harmony and enable immigrants to make their fullest contribution to national life), and fortheir children&apos;s sake (to increase the number of immigrant homes where Englishis spoken). The Government therefore welcome the initiatives that are already being taken by local education authorities and voluntary bodies in these fieldsand wish to encourage further developments. The Government will sponsorresearch into the educational needs of immigrant adults and into ways of meeting those needs. They will also encourage local education authorities in areas where there are immigrant communities to co-ordinate their work withthat of the voluntary bodies so that adequate opportunities can become availablefor those who require them.9. The Government attach importance to the advancement of harmonybetween the races in this country&apos;s multi-cultural and multi-racial society andbelieve that such harmony must be based on mutual understanding and respect.For the education service this implies that all pupils and students should been abled to acquire a greater knowledge and appreciation of the cultural tradi-tions of the countries of emigration as well as of this country, and to developrational attitudes to race and colour. A condition for success in this aim is thatthe teachers should have had the opportunity to gain the necessary knowledge and skills through initial and in-service training. &quot;Teacher Education for a multi-Cultural Society&quot; -  the recently published Report of a Joint working party of the Community Relations Commission and the Association of teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education will stimulate and inform dis-cussion among all concerned with teacher education and training of how this may be better ensured for the future. The Government also welcome theinitiative of the National Foundation for Educational Research, the NationalUnion of Teachers and the National Association for Multi-Racial education in proposing to the Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations (whichis granvraided equally by the Department of Education and Science and thelocal education authorities) a research project to develop curriculum materialson the theme of education for a multi-racial society. This project has alreadyproduced two preliminary reports surveying existing work. The Governmentacknowledge the work of the educational staff of the Community relations commission in promoting by a variety of means good race relations in educa-tional establishments. Numerous voluntary bodies are engaged in similar work.10. The Government believe that it is necessary to make more formal arrange-ments for the development of the work which is now being done on the education
of immigrants and education for a multi-racial society. But they also see a need to provide for all those suffering from educational disadvantage, and, con-sistently with the approach described in paragraph 3 above, they have decidedthat the arrangements which they create, while allowing for any distinct educa-tional needs of different ethnic groups, should have this broader concern. TheGovernment will therefore establish as a fully integrated part of the Depart-ment of Education and Science a unit to be called the Educational DisadvantageUnit. A statement of the terms of reference and principal tasks of this Unitis at Annex A.11. The Government also believe that the local authorities, school teachers,and staff in further and adult education would welcome a source of information and advice on curriculum and teaching methods for the disadvantaged. this could be provided by the establishment of a centre which would draw together the results of research and development undertaken by other bodies such as the schools Council and the National Foundation for Educational Research orsponsored by the Department of Education and Science, local educationauthorities and others, disseminate advice to teaching staff and encourage new developments in the schools and colleges. The centre would be independent ofGovernment control, as is the tradition in matters affecting the curriculum. Asthe work of this centre develops, the Government will consider whether itwould be expedient to link to it a number of regional, centres to facilitate thetask of dissemination. There might be scope for such regional centres to developsome amount of specialisation to take account of local needs.12. These then are in the Governments view the general directions of andvance for the education service. There will be new initiatives to identify educationaldisadvantage and to tackle the problems which it presents. The need to educatechildren and adults for life in a multi-racial society is recognised and the implications of this for the education service are accepted. There will be new machinery geared to improving the performance of the education service intackling the needs of those suffering educational disadvantage, i including themajority of immigrants. The success of these policies will depend in very great measure not on the Government itself but on the local education authorities,the teaching profession and voluntary bodies. In all this the Government will seek their close co-operation.13. Subsequent paragraphs deal with various specific recommendations listed in paragraph 228 of the Select Committee&apos;s Report.RECOMMENDATION (1)&quot;Local education authorities should be in no doubt that facility in English is ofcrucial importance, not merely at the first stage of simple communication, but toa standard which will enable immigrant children to compete on equal terms withtheir contemporaries.&apos;&quot;The Government accept that a good command of English is of crucial importance for immigrant, as for other, pupils. Advice and assistance to localeducation authorities have consistently reflected this principle.RECOMMENDATION (2)&quot;The Department of Education and Science should institute a survey of thevarious methods of dealing with the education in English of immigrant children,with a view to advising local education authorities on the best practice.&quot;if r
There is a need to distinguish here between teaching methods, i.e. the professional methods used by a teacher with an individual or class, and the organisational arrangements adopted by a school or local education authority.At national level the Schools Council seeks to develop new methods and materials so as to widen the range of choice open to teachers. Its work on theeducation of immigrants and on race relations is described in Appendix 24 in volume III of the Committee&apos;s Report. The Council has supported two major projects in language teaching for immigrants, one for non-English speakersand one for pupils from the West Indies. Both projects incorporated surveysand field trials.In choosing what arrangements to employ for teaching English to immigrantpupils, the local authorities and schools need to take account of local circum-stances (such as the degree of concentration of immigrants in the area and thetime elapsed since their arrival) and of the particular needs of the pupils whom they have to educate (which will vary according to age, country of origin, homecircumstances, and so on). In the Governmenfs view, it would not be practicable to cover all the factors of this kind which would need to be studied in a singlenational survey, or to distil from such a survey a body of good practice for application throughout the country.The Government do, however, support research into certain aspects of teachingEnglish as a second language. A project on the &quot;Educational Arrangements forSchools with Immigrant Pupils&quot;, undertaken at the National Foundation for.Educational Research has been looking at language teaching in the context ofa general survey of the education of immigrants, and some of its results havebeen published. Another project at the NFER has devised and publishedstandardised tests of the proficiency in English of immigrant pupils. As afollow-up of the original project, these tests have been administered to a sampleof children of varying educational experience.Members of Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate of Schools advise authorities and teachers on arrangements and methods of tuition in English suited to theircircumstances. In 1969-70 a special programme of inspections was drawn upto study an aspect of English teaching which seemed to need more attention:&quot;second-phase&quot; teaching for immigrant pupils who had had some initialinstruction in English and had then been placed in secondary schools. Someconclusions from this programme were summarised in &quot;The Continuing Needsof Immigrants&quot; which followed on the general advice given in &quot;The education of Immigrants.&quot; There have also been a number of local surveys by Her Majesty&apos;sInspectorate which have proved their value to the education authorities con-cerned. In drawing up its future programme of inspections, the Inspectoratewill have regard to the desirability of devoting more time to the teaching of english to immigrants whether by inspection of schools with large numbers of immigrants or by surveys.RECOMMENDATION (3)&quot;Local education authorities to whom it is applicable should consider how best to approach, with tact and discretion, the convincing of West Indian parents thatsome of their children may need special English teaching, without implying thattheir children, because they lack standard English, are basically inferior&quot;.The Government trust that local education authorities will take note of thisrecommendation. In a circular letter on &quot;Educational Arrangements for
Immigrant Children who may need Special Education&quot; sent to Chief EducationOfficers on 1 November 1973, the Department of Education and Science drew attention to the fact that West Indian children as well as non-English speakersmay have language difficulties. The letter also advised that, when teachersfirst began to think that a child might need special assistance, the matter shouldbe discussed unhurriedly and sympathetically with the parents. The expansionof nursery education should increasingly make it possible for appropriate stepsto be taken at an early stage of children&apos;s development.      &apos;RECOMMENDATION (4)&quot;Local education authorities should seek to expand contacts between families and schools by all possible means, paid or voluntary&quot;.The importance, for all children, of strengthening the links between home and school is now widely recognised within the education service. As the Committeesay, this must primarily be a matter for local initiatives tailored to the needs and opportunities which present themselves in the areas concerned. Themaintenance of good relations makes heavy demands on staff time and voluntaryhelp, often supplied by the parentSjthemselves, can be of the greatest value. TheGovernment have been able to support the efforts of the local authorities and voluntary interests in a number of ways. Following a recommendation in theReport of the Plowden Council &quot;Children and their Primary Schools&quot; (her majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, 1967), the Department of education and Scienceprepared a booklet containing examples of good practice in home and schoolrelations, which was published as &quot;Parent Teacher Relations in Primary Schools&quot;(HMSO, 1968). More recently the report of the Educational Priority Areaaction-research project financed by the Department of Education and Science,the Scottish Education Department and Social Science Research Council(&quot;Education Priority&quot;, Volume 1; HMSO, 1972) has suggested methodswhereby parental interest and co-operation in education may be enlisted insocially disadvantaged areas. Some local education authorities have, been ableto undertake appropriate developments of their services from the resourcesordinarily available to them. In Phase 9 of the Urban Programme the Govern-ment invited bids from local authorities for home-school projects and this met with a ready response. The invitation has been renewed in Phase 11. In the selection of such projects for approval under the Programme the Governmentwill keep the claims of multi-racial areas very much in mind. In Circular 2/73,which gave guidance concerning the expansion of nursery education, theDepartment of Education and Science asked local education authorities to do everything possible to provide amenities to make it easier to welcome parentsinto schools and enable them to participate in their work. The Circular also recommended that authorities should provide opportunities in colleges offurther education and elsewhere for parents to learn more about young children.RECOMMENDATION (5)&quot;The DES should seek to discover and evaluate what is being done by social/educational aid to alleviate the problems of urban deprivation, advise localeducation authorities of their findings and encourage them to follow the bestpractice&quot;.It will be among the tasks of the special unit in the Department of education and Science and of the information and advice centre proposed in paragraphs 10
and 11 of the main part of this Reply to develop advice of this nature. Mean-while DES is undertaking a limited follow-up of some of the projects approvedunder Phase 9 of the Urban Programme, and local education authorities will find many helpful suggestions in &quot;Educational Priority, Volume 1.RECOMMENDATION (6)&quot;Careers advisory services should be strengthened&quot;.Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 local education authoritiesare required (from April 1974 in England and Wales and from May 1975 inScotland) to provide a vocational guidance and employment service for pupilsat school and for all students attending full-time and for certain studentsattending part-time courses of further education. These arrangements supersedethe previous system whereby the Youth Employment Service was provided inmost of the country by local education authorities but in some areas by theDepartment of Employment direct, and enlarge the responsibilities of theService for students at further education establishments.It is for the local education authorities to determine how many careersadvisers to employ subject to the guidance of the Secretary of State for Employ-ment. This guidance suggests that the needs of immigrant young people warrantspecial consideration and that extra staffing resources should be provided.It is open to local authorities to apply for assistance with the cost of such appointments under Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966. The &apos;arrangements whereby careers officers are able to call on the help and supportof the Department of Employment^ race relations employment advisers ineach region will continue.The Survey of Careers Education in England and Wales recently issued by theDepartment of Education and Science is likely to prove an incentive to localeducation authorities and teaching staffs to give high priority to the processof educational and vocational guidance-an essential element in secondary education. In this context, the special needs of immigrant boys and girls willbe a matter for joint concern on the part of teachers in school and the careersofficers who work in partnership with them. The new emphasis on providing a service for students at further education establishments will help to increase and improve the already strong links between those establishments and industryto which the Committee refer in Recommendation 16.RECOMMENDATION (7)&quot;All local education authorities should draw the attention of head teachers tothe need to keep their ideas up to date on the choice of books in a mixed society&quot;.The choice of books for use in schools is, as the Recommendation implies,a matter for the judgment of local education authorities and the governors ormanagers and heads of schools. A number of bodies, both national and local,produce reading lists for the guidance of teachers.RECOMMENDATION (8)&quot;Her Majesty^ Inspectorate, the Schools Council and teachers should seekevery opportunity within the curricula for broadening horizons, for giving thishalf of the world more chance to discover how the other half lives. This should be reflected in the content of examinations and in greater use of the multi-racialCommonwealth as a new dimension in the study of many subjects in the curricula&quot;.
The Government accept that it is essential for children and young people to learn about the backgrounds of their future fellow citizens and, on a widercanvas, to be made aware of the conditions of life in countries other than theirown. In practice the teachers have to decide within the context of an over-rcrowded curriculum how much time they can devote to these needs, and thebest methods of meeting them. General Studies Courses in schools and further education establishments often include learning about such subjects. The workof some agencies which advise teachers on this aspect of the curriculum has been described in paragraph 9 above. In the ordinary course of its work of advisinglocal education authorities and teachers, and through its short course pro-gramme, Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate helps to identify good practice and toencourage development in this area of work. The Commonwealth Institute andthe Royal Commonwealth Society organise courses and conferences, and provide materials and. information for teachers on many aspects of theCommonwealth. Local authorities also include material about the Common-wealth in their in-service training courses for teachers and in displays at teachers&apos;centres.External examinations for the GCE and CSE cover only the final stages ofschooling and, at any rate before the school leaving age was raised, about 40%of school leavers did not attempt them. The GCE and CSE Boards, as indepen-dent bodies, are responsible for setting their own syllabuses; the Schools CounciFssupervisory powers are limited to the approval of new syllabuses proposed bythe GCE Boards at Advanced Level. However, the teachers are stronglyrepresented on all the examining boards and the boards have always shown aflexibility of approach to changes of emphasis in the curriculum.RECOMMENDATION (9)&quot;Students at colleges of education should be made aware that, wherever theyteach, they will be doing so in a multi-cultural society. This should be reflected not so much in special courses, but throughout the training, more particularly in suchaspects of it as the sociology of education.&apos;&quot;RECOMMENDATION (10)&quot;Specialist courses in race and community relations should be considered by .colleges of education in immigrant areas&quot;.RECOMMENDATION (11)&quot;Local education authorities, with the co-operation of university departments,polytechnics, colleges of education and other suitable bodies, should expandin-service courses of special training for teachers in schools with pupils of differentcultures. They should also introduce or strengthen, perhaps by visiting groups,specialist training of teachers in such schools. The advice and help of DES shouldbe sought&quot;.RECOMMENDATION (12)&quot;The DES should make a close study of the problem of shortage of teachersable to teach English as a second language and of people to train them&quot;.RECOMMENDATION (13)&quot;The DES should seek finance to ensure that the level of visits and exchanges of teachers and others overseas does not drop and preferably increases. They
should also ensure that the experience of those who go overseas should be aswidely spread through the educational system as possible&quot;.The Government are in general agreement with the Select Committee&apos;srecommendations in the field of teacher training and in particular with therelative emphasis placed by the Committee on the role of in-service training.Consultations have been initiated with those concerned to establish guide-linesfor a programme of progressive expansion of in-service training opportunities for teachers generally. It may be expected that within this programme the pattern of local development will reflect, in both the content and structure of courses(including the balance between school-based and other forms of training),the specific needs of the education service in each area. The Government share the concern of the Committee to ensure that there are sufficient teachers equipped to teach English as a second language and propose to make a careful study of how this may be best achieved. The increased opportunities for in-service training and the improved arrangements which are to be introduced for the inductionof new teachers are likely to make a particular contribution in this field.As far as initial training is concerned, colleges and departments of education(with whom responsibility for the curriculum rests, under the general supervision of their area training organisation) are increasingly alive to the need to introducetheir students to an awareness of the multi-cultural society, and where appro-priate to provide more specialised courses in race and community relations and associated subjects.The Government accept that visits and exchanges of teachers and othersoverseas have a useful, though necessarily limited, role to play, and that it isimportant that the experience of those who go overseas should be widelydisseminated. The Department of Education and Science have funds availableto assist exchanges of teachers with developing Commonwealth, as with other,countries. Concerning visits, the Government take the view that it is for localeducation authorities, as providers of the education service and employers, todetermine in the light of their other financial commitments what priority to assign to supporting teachers on future visits or courses overseas. If thereis evidence of a demand by authorities for further courses, the Department ofEducation and Science will be ready to make appropriate arrangements and,as in the past, to meet the central course expenses.RECOMMENDATION (14)&quot;Local education authorities should seek vigorously to increase the provisionfor nursery education, particularly in areas of deprivation. The Government should,when considering the cost, take into account the implications for race relations&quot;.The Government accept that nursery education is particularly valuable as a means of reducing the educational and social disadvantages suffered by children from homes which are culturally and economically deprived. The importanceof language difficulties as a source of educational handicap is recognised;these difficulties are acute for many immigrant children with non-English-speaking home backgrounds.The new building programme for the systematic expansion of nursery educa-tion begins this year. The allocations to local education authorities have beenweighted in favour of areas of social deprivation and will thus be of specialbenefit to areas in which there are large numbers of immigrant children.Although the initial allocations to local education authorities also reflect the
11deprivation which exists in rural areas, the large conurbations will maintain their accelerated start in the expansion of nursey education provision.The Government take the view that local education authorities are in the best position to assess the needs of their own areas, and their proposals show thatthey intend to give priority to disadvantaged children. Over half the new placeswhich they proposed to provide in 1974-75 are for areas of special social need,including the inner city areas. The Government are confident that, where appropriate, authorities will continue to have regard for the needs of immigrantpupils, not only in the distribution of new places but also in the range of facilities provided and in the choice of teaching programmes. The Government alsorecognise that in areas of social disadvantage the proportion of children needingto attend on a full-time basis will be higher than average.RECOMMENDATION (15)&quot; Where local education authorities are satisfied that a voluntary or semi-officialbody is meeting the need for the education of adult immigrants they should offeradvice and (limited) funds to enable the work to continue and expand&quot;.The Governmenfs general views on the role of adult education in providingfor immigrants are set out in paragraph 8 above. This recommendation might best be considered in the light of the Report by the Committee of Enquiry intoAdult Education, chaired by Sir Lionel Russell, CBE, &quot;Adult Education: a plan for Development&quot;. A number of the recommendations of that Report,published in March 1973, relate to the education of the adult disadvantaged,amongst whom are those with a limited educational background or with an inadequate command of English, and with the co-ordinating role of localeducation authorities in the provision of adult education. The Government arenot yet able to announce their conclusions on the Russell Committee&apos;s report but, in the meantime, they will draw this recommendation to the attention oflocal education authorities; and will continue the support already available through Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966 and the urban programme.RECOMMENDATION (16)&quot;Local education authorities should seek to make links with industry for further education of immigrant employees&quot;.The Government will draw this Recommendation to the attention of localeducation authorities. Consultations have begun with selected authorities witha view to establishing a number of units which will provide language training at the employers&apos; establishments on the lines of the Pathway Centre at Ealing,to which reference is made in paragraphs 135-6 of the Committee&apos;s Report.RECOMMENDATION (17)&quot;The Home Office should reconsider whether 15 hours a week is long enough tobe classified as a full-time course for overseas students, and whether collegesshould not be made responsible for notifying them of a student&apos;s prolongedabsence&quot;.The Government will consider this recommendation in the context of the immigration control system and will consult appropriate bodies on any changein existing practice which may be contemplated.
RECOMMENDATION (18)&quot;The DES should look again at the grant regulations to students for further education to see whether potential sources of friction can be eliminated&quot;.Awards to students on further education are of two kinds: mandatory awardsfor students on first degree and comparable courses who satisfy certain conditions laid down in the Awards (First Degree etc.) Courses Regulations 1971, andawards at the discretion of local education authorities (&quot;discretionary awards&quot;)for students not satisfying those conditions or oh other kinds of course. the awards Regulations do not cover the administration of discretionary awardswhich is a matter for local education authorities.With regard to mandatory awards the Regulations prescribe for whichstudents local education authorities should accept responsibility. In particular they make clear that the authorities have no duty to make awards to students who have not been resident in the United Kingdom for at least three years beforethe start of their course, unless their absence abroad has been for one of certain specified reasons. Advice on the making of awards under the Regulations Wasgiven to local education authorities in the Department of Education and ScienceCircular 5/71. The Government will consider when next the Regulations arerevised whether it would be possible to simplify them, but the principle offairness to students in widely varying circumstances must be preserved. Withinthe framework of the Regulations it is for the local education authority todecide how far it will carry its enquiries into a studenfs circumstances.RECOMMENDATION (19)&quot;If the disproportion of West Indian children in ESN schools and classes in greater London continues the DES should institute a special inquiry into thereasons for it&quot;.One of the suggestions contained in the Department of Education and ScienceCircular letter to Chief Education Officers, mentioned in the comment onRecommendation (3) above, was that all local education authorities with asizeable immigrant child population should make plans to provide by an earlydate special facilities in ordinary schools to overcome the linguistic and adjust-ment problems of immigrant children with a level of ability higher than thegeneral run of pupils in special schools for the educationally sub-normal.If the Government have reason to think that the disproportion referred to bythe Select Committee is continuing, they will consider asking the local educationauthorities concerned to report on progress with their plans.RECOMMENDATION (20)&quot;Dispersal should now be phased out as soon as possible in those areas whereit is still pursued, but where there is a sufficient number ofparents who prefer their children to be dispersed arrangements should be made, if practicable, to meet their wishes&quot;.The Government drew attention to some of the disadvantages of dispersingimmigrant pupils in &quot;The Education of Immigrants&quot; and the same pamphletstressed the importance of respecting the wishes of parents in the matter of choice of school. However, the decision whether or not to disperse immigrantpupils has to be taken by the local education authority in the light of their
judgment as to what will best serve the interests of the community as a Whole.The local education authorities will, no doubt, bear in mind the Select Com-mittee&apos;s Recommendation.RECOMMENDATION (21)&quot;The collection of statistics under the present DES formula should ceaseforthwith&quot;.RECOMMENDATION (23)&quot;Local education authorities should be required, as a condition of using theDepartment&apos;s resources and services, to report to the DES regularly and fully onthe situation in their area and what they are doing about it&quot;.RECOMMENDATION (24)&quot;An immigrant education advisory unit should be set up in the Department ofEducation and Science&quot;.The Governments response to these Recommendations is set out in theopening paragraphs of this Reply.RECOMMENDATION (22)&quot;Consideration should be given to the establishment of a central fund to which local education authorities could apply for resources to meet the special educationalneeds of immigrant children and adults.&quot;The Government have given consideration.to the case for a central fund forthe education of immigrants. The case for a central fund seems to rest on twoarguments. The first is that the presence of large immigrant populations places a burden on local authority services (among them, education) which falls more heavily on some local authorities than others because of the uneven pattern of immigrant settlement. The second is that local education authorities willnot take initiatives to improve the education of immigrants unless there is anearmarked Department of Education and Science fund on which they can drawto meet the cost. The first of these arguments has been accepted by successive governments. It is for this reason that they have maintained the provisions ofSection 11 of the Local Government Act 1966 under which local authorities with large numbers of Commonwealth immigrants can obtain Exchequer grants of 75% on the cost of the extra staff whom they have to employ. In the latestyear for which figures are available, the Government expenditure from this source on educational staff specifically amounted to,  6m. In addition it hasbeen the practice over the years to devote some Urban Programme monies to schemes, including educational schemes, explicitly of benefit to immigrants orfor areas where large numbers of them live. It was announced last december that an extra  6m would be added to the Programme to be used exclusively toassist local authorities whose services were under strain because of the highconcentrations of immigrants in their areas.The Government do not believe that the second argument is borne out by experience. The public provision of education is, for the most part, theresponsibility of the local education authorities. It is financed like any other local authority service largely through the rates and Rate Support Grant.
It is the job of the local authority to decide how best to use its resources ofstaff and money to meet the needs of its area. If specific grants for particularaspects of education in which the local authorities have previously enjoyeddiscretion were to be introduced, the effect might be to reduce the scope oflocal responsibility. Since the Government believe that such responsibility isessential to the vigour of local government, they would be reluctant to do this,and their policy is to channel special assistance through Section 11 and the urban Programme (use of the latter is not confined to immigrants) which applyto a wide range of local services, thus giving the authorities the opportunity toset their own priorities.
ANNEX ATHE EDUCATIONAL DISADVANTAGE UNITTerms of ReferenceTo serve as a focal point for consideration of matters, at all stages of education,connected with educational disadvantage and the education of immigrants;to influence the allocation of resources in the interests of immigrants and thoseidentified, on the best currently available criteria, as suffering educationaldisadvantage; to develop in association with the Assessment of PerformanceUnit (APU)* other relevant criteria to improve this identification; to establishsuitable arrangements for promoting good practice by the educational system in its treatment of the disadvantaged and of immigrants.1. To advise the Secretary of State and to keep in touch with other Depart-ments, local authorities, national statutory and voluntary bodies, educationalestablishments and teachers.2. To inform itself of the extent and distribution of educational disadvantageand of the methods used (eg by local education authorities) to define its incidence.3. To appraise educational measures (whether under special programmes or as a component of existing programmes) which have been, and are being takento assist the deprived (including immigrants), by central government, LEAsand others.4. To identify (in conjunction with the APU as appropriate) the incidence of successful practice in meeting the needs of all those suffering educationaldisadvantage.5. To promote within existing programmes the allocation of resourcesweighted in the interests of those identified as suffering educational disadvantage,and to administer any special resources available. \ \6. To encourage experiments and developments likely to help solve any partof the problem.7. To establish an information centre (independent of the Department ofEducation and Science) concerned with giving advice on curriculum, teachingmethods, etc., and on good practice generally relevant to the education of thedisadvantaged and immigrants.8. To co-ordinate the Department of Education and Science&apos;s interests inrelevant inter-Departmental activities in the field of social deprivation.9. To promote such further research as may be necessary.* For convenience, the terms of reference and tasks of the APU (like the EducationalDisadvantage Unit, an integrated part of the Department of Education and Science) are setout in Annex B.Tasks
ANNEX BTHE ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE UNITTerms of ReferenceTo promote//the development of methods of assessing and monitoring the achievement of children at school, and to seek to identify the incidence of under-achievement.Tasks1. To identify and appraise existing instruments and methods of assessmentwhich may be relevant for these purposes.2. To sponsor the creation of new instruments and techniques for assessment,having due regard to statistical and sampling methods.3. To promote the conduct of assessments in co-operation with local educationauthorities and teachers.4. To identify significant differences of achievement related to the circum-stahces in which children learn, including the incidence of under-achievement,arid to make the findings available to those concerned with resource allocationwithin the Department, local education authorities and schools.Printed in Encland by Harrison &amp; Sons (Hayes) Ltd. and published by Her Maiesty&apos;s Stationery OfficeDd/136733  K32   8/74
