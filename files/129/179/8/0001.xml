DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 98 COPY NO     733 September 1974CABINETDEVOLUTIONMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. I invite my colleagues views on the draft White Paper at Annex Asetting out the Government1 s proposals for devolution to Scotland and Wales.2.        At our earlier Cabinet discussion of Devolution on 2 August weconcluded that a short White Paper should be produced setting out theGovernments general statement of intent, in the light of the Reports ofthe Royal Commission on the Constitution, to establish elected assembliesin Scotland and Wales.    The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Waleswere invited to revise the existing drafts on this basis.    This revision isat Annex B,    Concurrently, however, the Labour Party&apos;s Home PolicyCommittee had been studying these issues and has produced its owndocument on devolution which is at Annex C.    This is expected to bepublished within the next few days, meanwhile its confidentiality shouldbe respected,,3.        Both the documents at Annexes B and C limit the Governmentscommitment to setting up directly elected assemblies in Scotland andWales, the former having some legislative powers, and to retaining theexisting Secretaries of State and the Scottish and Welsh seats at Westminster.Each emphasises that much detailed work will need to be done beforelegislation can be introduced.    But the style and approach of the two documents is quite different and we shall need to ensure that theGovernments White Paper is not made to seem less forthcoming,appearing so soon after publication of the Party document.    The merit of annex C is its positive approach to the merits of devolution and its extension of the argument to the English regions.    The merit of Annex Bis its convincing exposition of all that has been achieved so far by way of moving decision-making into Scotland and Wales,   I am doubtful, however,whether Annex B is an adequate statement of future policy, and I am inclined to think that the Government cannot say less - although we shouldbe ill-advised to say more - than is in the Party document.   Nor must we
allow room for apparent differences as between Government and Party tobe created on this issue, when all concerned know that only the broadestconclusions can be reached at this stage.    For these reasons 1 askedofficials to prepare a composite draft embodying the substance of the annex B statement of the record to date and of the Annex C statement ofour proposals.    This is the draft at Annex A, on which I should like tohave the Cabinefs views.H W10 Downing Street3 September 1974
ANNEX A&apos; - - &apos;    -   &apos; mZQQRACYjm REVOLUTION -: &apos;    raOrOSALS FOR SCOTLAND JIJD WALES-. -INTRODUCTION .      ,,      ..    &apos; &apos;    .      &quot; &quot;*1.     The 20th century has seen the responsibilities of central government expandfaster than provision for their democratic supervisiont   As the range of governmentresponsibility has spread over wider there has been a concentration of power in thehands of executive organisations.-.., In the past 30 years assorted nominated ad ad hoc authorities have proliferated which have assumed not only some of these new tasks of central government, but also many of the responsibilities for public servicesearlier entrusted toYlocal government such as hospitals, gas, electricity and trunk roads.   Only this year1 local authorities lost responsibility for water and sewerage.Central government departments have evolved their own&apos;regional structures which,in the interests of efficiency, now make decisions within their regions without reference to headquarters, but without reference to the peoples&apos; electedrepresentatiyes either.   A regional level of governmental decision-making already exists but is not subject to direct democratic oversight.2.     In I968 tie Government announced its decision to set up t.he Royal Commissionon the Constitntuon.   The Prime Minister said at the time that an importantreason for appointing the Commission was the &quot;strong feeling, not only in Scotland-.and Wales, but in many parts of England, of a greater desire for participation inthe process of decision-making moving it nearer - wherever this is possible - tothe places where people live&quot;.   The Commission, under the chairmanship ofLord. Kilbrandon, reported in October 1973.   It was unanimous in rejectingseparatism and. federalism..and in recommending directly elected Scottish and welsh assemblies, but the Commissioners were divided in the rest of their recommendations.   The queen s Speech on 12 March 1974 said the Government &quot;willinitiate discussions in Scotland and Wales on the Report of the Commission onthe Constitution, and will bring forward proposals for consideration&apos;^)   Accordingly.to provide the basis for these discussions the Government published on 3 June 1974&quot;Devolution within the United Kingdom -;Some Alternatives for Discussion&quot;.This Consultative Document summarised the various schemes of devolution recommended,in the Kilbrandon Commission&apos;s main Report and in the Memorandum of Dissent which accompanied it and posed a number of questions and identified problems relatingto each of the possible schemes.1
3.     The Government agree with the Commission on the Constitution in rejectingseparatism and federalism as a solution.   The Government, like the Royal Conradssiorijattach the greatest possible importance totthe maintenance of the economic andpolitical unity of the United Kingdom.   Particularly important is the unifiedmanagement of the economy, from which in the long run all parts of the Union canonly stand to gain, especially those like Scotland and Wales   and some of thedeclining English regions whose needs can only he adequately met by allocating to^them a disproportionate share of resources.4.     It does not follow, however, that Scotland and Wales must be treated exactlylike any other part of the United Kingdom,   while the people of Scotland andWales, as the Royal Commission noted, consider themselves to be British, they arealso deeply conscious of the fact that they are Scottish or Welsh.   Nor d.oes itfollow that Scotland and Wales must be treated exactly like each other.   Theyhave differing histories, backgrounds and cultural traditions.   Because thecircumstances of the two countries are so different, the present arrangementsfor their government are not the same and it will not be surprising if theirButfuture systems of government are different, ^each of them has already seensubstantial movement of government and decision-making away from London to theirown cities which will provide a sound, base fr-r future devolution. :EXISTING DEVOLUTIONScotlaiicI .5.     Since I885 when a Secretary for Scotland was appointed, and particuarlyfrom 1939 when the Scottish Office in broadly its present form was established in edinburgh, a very wide measure of what the Kilbrandon Commission described asadministrative devolution has been developed in Scotland.   Since the waradditional functions have been progressively transferred to the Scottish Office.The Secretary of State, as a member of the United Kingdom Cabinet, now has majorresponsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions)/for the formulation of policyand its execution in Such major fields as agriculture and fisheries; education;local government and environmental services; social work, health and housing;roads and certain aspects of shipping and road transport services.   He is alsoresponsible for a range of other functions from police and fire services to sportand tourism.   The administrative functions at central government level arising     jfrom these responsibilities are carried out by the five Scottish Departmentsbased on St Andrew1s House in Edinburgh.   For most of these subjects there isseparate Scottish legislation or Scottish application clauses in United Kingdom
onfidentiaActs of Parliament.   Separate Scottish legislation has special Parliamentarymachinery to handle it consisting of the Scottish Grand Committee, on which allScottish Members of Parliament sit, and two Scottish Standing Committees whichconsider the details of Scottish legislation.      *&apos; .&apos;.6.     One basic reason for these differences in legislation and administrativepractice arises from the existence of a separate system of Scottish law, thepreservation of which was provided for in the Union settlement of 1707*   TheSecretary of State has accordingly responsibility for legal services in Scotland,&apos;and other important ^responsibilities are exercised by the two Scottish Lav; officers the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor.-General for Scotland.   But it is not just acase of Scottish legislation in parallel with that for England and Wales; thereare usually distinctive Scottish features and in some cases the approach ismarkedly -different, reflecting/the differing needs and conditions of Scotlandand the people living there,   Devolution to Scotland - in the sense of runningthings differently in Scotland because Scotland is different - is thereforenothing new.7.     The Secretary of State also has a major role in the planning and developmentof the Scottish economy and plays a full part in the government it s determination of Energy policy.   He exercises a co-ordinating function over activities inScotland, such as the location of industry, the level of employment and thedevelopment of North Sea oil, which axe not his direct responsibility but havean important, indeed vital, effect on the economy of Scotland.   The United kingdon departments with significant Scottish responsibilities have offices in Scotlandwith delegated powers and work closely with the Scottish Office.   Appropriatecentral government functions are also carried out in Scotland and the Governmenthas decided to further this by transferring 6,000 Ministry of Defence and 1,000Ministry of Overseas Development posts to Glasgow over the next ten years.8.     The existence of thetie separate administrative arrangements in scotland has greatly benefited the people of Scotland in that they have enabled specialScottish needs to be recognised and met,.   Ajorjjcj^al^i^^3(confidential&quot;)
Wales -9*     As in the case of Scotland, substantial adm.inistati.ve devolution to Wales,has already taken place, though at a later historical stage.   The first Ministerfor Welsh Affairs was appointed in 1951. but the most important measures of devolution have been concentrated into the last ten years.   The first Secretary ofState was appointed in 1964, and since then the Welsh Office&apos;s functions have grown rapidly.   The Department now has responsibility in Wales for housing,health, the social services, primary and secondary education, child care, town-and country planning, water, highways,-tourism, forestry and agriculture(jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), and many other functions.   The strengthening of the Office still continues.   The post of itsCivil Service head was recently upgraded to.that of Hill Permanent Secretary andthe senior staffing has been further strengthened.10.   In other ways too administration- has been reshaped and strengthened and decision-making has been devolved to take account of Welsh interests in economic-and other fields.   The Secretary of State has oversight responsibility for theeconomic development of Wales and exercises a co-ordinating responsibility inGovernment action to promote the welfare of Wales.   Considerable powers have beendelegated to the Department of-Trade and Industry Office for Wales, and Wales has.its own Industrial Director and Industrial Development Board.   The Governmenthave also announced their decision, as a further step to assist the economy, totransfer over 7,000 Civil Service posts to Wales in the next ten years.   As inScotland,, identifiable public expenditure per&apos; headin Wales -has^b,r,;-.-m&apos;any-jffiarg&quot;been running at a substantially higher level .than.in England.11,   In Consequence of these and other measures Government action is increasinglyadapted to fit Welsh needs and to further Welsh interests.   The role of theSecretary of State with a seat in the Cabinet is fundamental.   He not only hasfull - responsibility for the matters referred to in paragraph 9 above; in other-matters affecting Wales he has powers of oversight and can safeguard and furtherWelsh interests both in Cabinet and in discussion with departmental Ministers.No Welsh problem escapes his attention and he exercises a powerful influence onpolicies affecting Wales.
12.   Welsh interests are further represented centrally through the 36 WelshMembers of Parliament at Westminster who, in addition to their other Parliamentaryor Ministerial functions, all sit on the Welsh-Grand Committee which provides afurther forum for debate and discussion of matters concerning Wales.England - &apos;13.   For historical reasons there has:.&apos;not been the same pressure for substantialdevolution in England.   The fact &quot; of differing circumstances and needs ofdifferent parts of England was however recognised by the creation in I965 ofthe Economic Planning Boards and Councils;,, the Councils have been a valuablesource of advice to successive Governments on the special requirements oftheir regions, and the Planning Boards have-strengthened and extended the delegation of decision making from Whitehall Departments to regional centres.   For instance,Regional Controllers of the Department of Industry now make important decisions affecting the location of industry by authorising loans of up to  1 millionunder the 1972 Industry Act: Regional Directors of the Department of the environment approve road improvement schemes and take the majority of theDepartment&apos;s planning decisions,-    CONSULTATIONS ON THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT^- i I !y&apos; p -fx f    y,:X;]&quot; ;:..-.    - .;.  :.;. -     j\     %   . ...;14.   While recognising the benefits to Scotland and Wales of the existing system,     pthe Kilbra.nddn Commission unanimously concluded that directly-elected assembliesought to be established for Scotland and for Wales to meet the legitimate desire of their people for greater control over their own affairs.   The Commissionerswere not agreed, however, - on how this objective should be achieved, and in themain Report and the Memorandum of Dissent four schemes were set out for implementinithis decision in relation to Scotland and Wales (Schemes A, B, C and E in the consultative Document).   Ail interested organisations and members&apos; of the public      \- II fwerj invited to comment on these schemes.&apos;  ^       x&apos; /   //:.   0     \ ;. ,Scotland15.   The response of individual members of the public was disappointing;&apos; only about 170 letters or papers, some quite brief, were received.   Of these therewas no clear majority for any one solution, ond indeed a significant numberexpressed no. specific view.
16.   On the other hand over 50 organisations, including the political parties,submitted written views.   Among these there was considerable support forScheme A or variations of it.   While very few indeed favoured Schemes B or C,there vias some support for Scheme E.   A number wanted more decision-making inScotland, without associating that demand with any specific scheme.   Somewanted no.change in the present system and others wanted any decision deferred until the new local authorities had had time to settle down.   Most of theserepresenting local government were particularly concerned about the possible effects of the Schemes considered on the new local authorities and their powers;Strathclyde Regional Authority, for example, urged the Government &quot;to ensurethat the new authorities ore given sufficient time and independent power toestablish and develop themselves and that-&apos;in the meantime the discussions shouldcontinue&quot;.17.   During July 1974 a series of discussions was held in Scotland by ScottishMinisters accompanied by the Governments constitutional adviser,Lord Crowther-Hunt, with some of the organisations which had submitted writtenobservations.   Bodies consulted in this way included the Scottish Council of theLabour Party, the Scottish National Party, the-Scottish Council (Development andIndustry), the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Council of the Conferation ofBritish&apos; Industry in Scotland, the Church and Nation Committee of the Church ofScotland and various local authority representatives.   These discussions reinforce;points made in the written submissions and some points emerged of particularsignificance.   One was a strong desire for more Government&apos; decision-making to takeplace in Scotland - and in. that context the announcements referred to inparagraph 31 below were welcomed.   There was also widespread, though by no meansunanimous, support for the view that there would be merit in the establishment ofa directly elected Scottish Assembly, but there was no agreement on what powers 01functions the Assembly should have.   Of the schemes in the Consultative Document,Scheme A, which proposed a legislative assembly and government for Scotland, (commanded the. greatest support, but there&apos; was cleurly a good deal of uncertainty about the precise implications of the scheme and the full significance of thefact that it involved a separate Scottish government responsible to the Assembly.There was also very considerable opposition both to the abolition of the officeof Secretary of State for Scotland and to a reduction in the number of Scottish ;Members of Parliament at Westminster, for.:-which Scheme A provided.   Of theother schemes, hardly anyone thought them appropriate to Scottish conditions,except that Scheme E, which involved an advisory assembly with limitedlegislative powers and no Scottish Executive, attracted some support.
18.   The process of consultation has made it apparent that opinion in scotland is still very much divided.   Many are convinced of the need for a substantial measure of devolution, involving a directly-elected Scottish Assembly with realpowers.   Others are equally convinced that any radical.change in the presentsystem&apos;wouHbe to Scotland&apos;s detriment, though administrative devolution mightbe further developed.Wales19*   In accordance with the Government&apos;s undertaking to carry out discussions on the Commission^ s Report in Wales, the Secretary of State, with the assistanceof the Government *s constitutional adviser, has completed a programme of consultations.20.   The bodies consulted represented political parties in Wales, localauthorities, both sides of industry and the farming community.   The majoritywere in favour of the establishment of a directly elected Assembly for Wales,.but there was no general agreement on the functions it should exercise: opinion was divided between those who favoured legislative devolution and those whowere for executive devolution.   The minority either favoured a directly electedWelsh Advisory Council or wanted no fundamental change in existing arrangements.^The points on which there was substantial agreement among those consulted wasthat the Sffice of Secretary of State should continue and that there should beno reduction in the number of Welsh Members of Parliament.21.   The Secretary of State received written views from 30 organisations in Wales.In most cases these were briefly stated and did not attempt to deal with the detailed questions set out in the discussion document.   The views of these organisations, mostly made up of individual local authorities and political,trade union and religious bodies, were divided: about one-third were infavour of legislative devolution; nearly half preferred executive devolution;and the remainder favoured other solutions or the status quo.   In addition the Secretary of State received /written views from a relatively small numberof individuals, most of which were in favour of schemes of at least legislative devolution.22.   Thus no consensus of opinion has emerged.   The case for an elected assembly is widely supported, but there is no general agreement about the powers it should exercise.   However, there is an evident desire to see Government decision-making7
made more responsive and accountable to the people, provided this can bedone without disrupting the essential political and economic unity of theUnited Kingdom.   In particular, it has been urged that the nominated bodies which, at present carry out many functions in.Wales should be replaced by a body representative of the Welsh people, which shcixld also discharge someof the executive functions of Government Departments in Wales.DUTSTANDDTG ISSUES    &apos;23.   There are a number of very important matters that remain to be resolved.bdbre it is possible to put forward considered proposals for further measures&apos;&apos; of devolution that would command general support and would carry with them theprospect of stability.   The principal issues are -a.     FinanceIn any scheme of devolution the financial arrangements would clearly beof fundamental importance. Any major change in the present broad- arrangement would be difficult to reconcile with the maintenance of a general uniformity !of approach in the Kingdom as a whole to the allocation of resources and to taxation arrangements. Consideration of alternative approaches, including , jthe proposal in Scheme A for a nominated Exchequer Board, has confirmed the jvery great difficulty of finding accepta,blessolutions to these problems&apos;.^*     Trade. Industry and EmploymentThere is still a great deal of doubt about how far (if at all) powers inthese fields could be devolved without prejudice to the essential economic   &apos;jiunity of the United Kingdom.   There is a strong desire for more decision^making in Scotland and Wales, but this would not necessarily require thecreation of an elected Assembly.There is understandable concern both about the timing of any constitutional-&quot;changes in relation to the local government reorganisations which has justtaken effect in Wales and which is&apos; taking place in Scotland next year and about the possible attitude of a directly elected Assembly and Executive to local authorities.8
confidentiald.     The Secretary of StateThere is a strong desire both in Scotland and in Wales to retain an effective!Secretary of State. A significant diminution in his present powers would he,an inevitable consequence of a substantial measure of devolution, but it may; be that he could still exercise considerable powers in the financial,economic and industrial spheres as well as acting as spokesman for Scotlandand for Wales in the United Kingdom Cabinet.   Indeed an extension of his,present responsibilities in these areas might point the way to a solution to the problems outlined in paragraphs a. and b. above,e*     Representa-bion- in the United Kingdom ParliamentThere is a great reluctance to see any reduction in the number of Scottishor Welsh Members of the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster, with a consequent weakening of Scottish or Welsh influence in United Kingdomaffairs.   This must be reconciled with whatever devolutionary arrangements are made.THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S DECISIONS24.   All these outstanding problems as well as a great many matters of detailwill require further very careful and thorough study before the Government is ina position to put forward fully worked out proposals for consideration.   But they accept the broad conclusion of the Kilbrandon Commission that there is room and a [real need for a substantial measure of devolution of power away from Westminsterand Whitehall.   The object of the following proposals of principle is to adaptthe British Constitution to the needs of the remainder of the 20th Century;to avoid fragmenting the United Kingdom; but to bring the spotlight of democracyto bear on the level of government which already exists in Scotland and Wales.25.   The Government have, of course, an equal commitment to democraticaccountability of government and&apos;equality of political rights in England.In Scotland and Wales there has already been a full debate which has enabled the Government to make firm proposals.   In England, however, the consultationprocess is not yet complete.   The Government has already put forwards fordiscussion certain proposals to aid democratisation in specific fields, forinstance to add more local government members to the area and regional health authorities and to legislate for the establishment of statutory neighbourhoodconfide ntia
councils.   These would he steps towards helping existing institutions, including&quot;both local and central Government, to be more responsive to the needs andwishes of the man in the street   But it would be&apos;wrong to go further untilall the bodies consulted have had the opportunity to express themselves.26, For Scotland and Wales the&quot;Government now proposes the creation -of directly- jelected Assemblies, .While the new institutions for Scotland and Wales will    jshare common characteristics, they will differ from one another in theirrespective powers and responsibilities: the diverse traditions of the nations   ,j    !and regions of the United Kingdom cannot be confined within an arbitrarystraight-jacket of rigid uniformity, nor can institutions of regional government be duplicated for planting in&quot;unnatural settings.   Differenttraditions alreadi&apos;- exist between Scotland, Wales and England.   These must berecognised in the future structure of government,however,27.   Despite their differences,/and their individual senses of nationhood the&apos;Scots, and the Welch and the English have much in common.   This the Governmentrecognises by seeking to develop proposals from existing constitutional and political arrangements which have become accepted features of the presentsystem.   The Government regard it asi es gent ial^ that Jboth ^Scotland and wales should retain theirexisting number of Members of Parliament in thej^Parliament ^and that both the posts^of^Secretary of State f&apos;ovScotland and for wales in the Cabinet ^should be^maintained.   The distribution of resources ^between Scotland, Wales and the regions of England and the determination of j&quot;fair shares&quot; is the most. fundamental pf poljitij3al decisions and cannot be delegated by elected representatives.   The Government rejects, therefore, theCommission1 s concept of a nominated Exchequer Board to be responsible for this     jtask.   It must be argued out in Cabinet, with the two Secretaries of State present as of right to speak for Scotland and Wales, and approved in the Houseoi Commons with Scotland and Wales fully represented in it.   The United Kingdom   sParliament, and many central Government Departments will of course retainsubstantial areas of responsibility eg for foreign policy and defence spending.There is all the more reason, therefore, for maintaining full Scottish and welsh representation at Westminster and for having Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales who act as full members of the United Kingdom Cabinet informing United Kingdom policies, since it is essential that the determination ofJieeds and united Kingdom policies should fully reflect the^contributions of all its constituent parts. /; &apos; (confide mtial)..        :
28.   The present method of election to the United&apos;&quot;Kingdom Parliament will apply to elections to the&apos;Scottish and Welsh Assemblies.   It is simple to operate and well understood by the public.   Above all it provides for the clear and direct accountability of the elected representative to his constituents.The&apos; single transferable vote system with multi-member constituencies iscumbersome and would cut this essential link, weakening rather than strengthening the principle of direct accountability.   Moreover, such a system of proportional representation could not operate in by-elections to the Assemblies.   Finally,1 the use of a different system for elections to the Assemblies from thatemployed for local council or Parliamentary elections would constitute a sure. recipe for confusion on the part of the electorate.29.   The Scottish ,and We.british.&apos;Assemblies will each assume many of the presentfunctions of the Scottish and Welsh Offices, and the^ responsibilities,of manyof the nominated authorities now operating within their boundaries.   This willgive them substantial responsibilities within, for example, areas such ashousing, education, health, regional planning and, in Wales, water.30.   The^ finances for each of the Scottish t and Walsh.&quot;:. ^As^emblies will, C1qme froma block grant voted Jjy^heJLFnited Kingdom Parliament.   It will be theAssembly&quot; s job to budget for the distribution of that grant between competingpriorities within Scotland and Wales in the light of its own assessment of themost urgent needs.   It will be for the Assembly to choose between ploughingresources into building more hospitals or roads, schools, or houses.   TheAssembly will have to shoulder this responsibility and face up to the. starkproblem of choice.Off-shore oil and economic development31.   The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the North Sea and Celtic Searevolutionises the opportunity for transforming the future economic andindustrial prospects of all the depressed regions of the United Kingdom ata time when radical changes are being introduced into how the regions managetheir own affairs.   The Government itself has already acted: the OffshoreSupplies Office of the Department of Energy is to bs transferred to Glasgowand the new British National Oil Corporation is to have its headquarters in Scotland.   Still more important in the Scottish context is the Government:intention to establish a Scottish Development Agency, which is to be responsible11
.     (confidential)- ; :-fco the Secretary of State for Scotland.   Xts task will be to strengthen the instruments available for promoting the development and restructuringof the Scottish economy.   It will also carry out,in Scotland appropriatefunctions of the National Enterprise Board.   And a Scottish Airports authority is to be set up.   Similar arrangements will be made in Wales, as part of theUnited Kingdom Government&apos;s policy for United Kingdom offshore oil and gas.to strengthen the instruments for promoting the development of Wales&apos; economy,&apos;The organisation which will be set up for this purpose will exercise in Walesappropriate functions of the National Enterprise Board,-     - /0::::\0 ------ -&apos;-;&apos;-&apos;.V&apos;   &apos;&apos;l32.   But the opportunities which off-shore oil has presented will only begrasped if those of our people living in areas off&quot;whose shores the majordiscoveries have been made are able to put aside avarice and selfishness andrecall that not only Scotland and Wales, but other regions also - for example,the North West and North East of England - have all suffered as a result ofa concentration of contracting industries.   The Government is determined thatthe community and each deserving region receives its full and fair share of theprofits resulting from the exploitation of these new energy resources in -accordance with its needs.-   This must mean that maximum benefit goes to- redressall the regional imbalances which the years of industrial decline have caused,33.   The task of breathing new life into our depressed areas is one for bothcentral and regional Government,   Only if the United Kingdom Government adoptsa completely new approach to that which has failed in the past can we envisage,any solution to our seemingly intractable regional unemployment problems.Creating Assemblies in Scotland and Wales will not of itself be a solution.Central Government will have to take direct action at the level of Britain&apos;sbiggest firms in the form of planning agreements and a National EnterpriseBoard.   But there must be scope too for real initiative to be takeniatregional level.   The Scottish and Welsh Assemblies will therefore participate in the decisions on how best to promote their development, for instance by drawing up regional economic plans.   Executive powers in the trade and industryfields could be transferred from;central Government to enable the Assembliesto tailor policies to their own needs in the promotion of employment andindustrial regeneration.   It might also be appropriate for the proposedScottish Development Agency to become responsible to the Scottish Assembly.Similar arrangements cculd apply in Wales.12//-(confidential)
34.   The Government does not propose either for Scotland or. for Wales to take powers away from local government to the Assemblies.   To do otherwise would,i undermine the objective of bringing power nearer to the people.   Moreover, sincethe Government are unable at this stage, for the overwhelmingly practical reasons of lack of time, to go much further than declare where they stand on the principle-   of devolving,power from the United Kingdom Parliament and outline the basic formtheir proposed scheme of devolution will take, the new authorities created by recent local government reorganisation will have time to settle down in their newfunctions before the Assemblies take office. &apos;&amp; .5..;. ?iliS;K ^0&amp;^$^0%^^MMiSM:^ &apos;35*   The Governments proposals for Scotland and Wales are directed to the needsof the present and future.   But in matters of fundamental constitutional practice,reasonable men do not lightly break with the traditions of the past.   They areafter all part of our heritage.   Scotland for example has always had a distinctlegal structure and legislative process firmly bedded in hundreds of years of history.   Many Scottish laws today are significantly different from those inEngland and are indeed separately enacted for Scotland.   &quot;The Government thereforeproposes that uhe Scottish Assembly will have legislative powers vjithin^th^sofields in which separate Scottish legislation already f^ists^^i^h^^jpujjji^,healthy education and homo affairs.   The Government intend that the Welsh^^SBerably &apos;should parallel the Scottish counterpart jit, assuming-resuonsibi^t^^for manyexecutive-functions at present carried out by; the undemocratic nominated, bodies with-in.&apos;- Wales,together with some of the Secretary of Staters executive functions.The Welsh Assembly would also assume certain powers of the Secretary of State inrespect of dele-gated legislation^CONCLUSION&apos;i 36.   Above, all, the proposed Assemblies must be eauipped to respond to &quot;the realneeds of Scotland and Wales.   In part this may mean ad apfcing to their special needs policies determined in the United Kingdom Parliament.   But in the main itwill mean vital decisions affecting Scotland and Wales being made within Scotland-i and Wales by the-&quot;Scots and Welsh.37.   In promoting this policy of devolution of power the Government have been concerned to strengthen the principle of direct accountability.   They make no pretence at having established more than the principle, and in Scotland andWales the basic form in which this should be accomplished.   The increasing13(confidential)
sophistication and range of government activity and machinery make the taskhighly complex and inevitably lengthy.   The Government intend legislatingestablishment   of Scottish and Welsh Assemblies as early as possible.   But mlpoints&apos;of substance remain to be determined before legislation can be draftSome of these decision are of critical importance and cannot be taken lightl;The new system of government proposed must stand the test of time.   TheGovernment&apos;s proposals will strengthen British democracy.   They will restoredemocratic control over important levels of government, bring power nearer tithe people, and enhance the ability of government to respond positively to t!special needs of the various nations and regions of Britain.
(^CONFIDENTIALBRAFr MilTE&apos;PAPER &apos; ANNEXEDEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALESINTRODUCTION1      In 1968 the Labour Government announced its decision to set up the RoyalCommission on the Constitution^.   The Prime Minister said at the time that animportant reason for appointing the Commission was the &quot;strong feeling, not onlyin Scotland and Wales, but in many parts of England, of a greater desire forparticipation in the process of decision-making moving it nearer - wherever thisis possible - to the places where people live&quot;.   The Commission^ under thecliairmansihip of Lord Kilbrandon, reported in October 1973.   It was unanimous in rejecting separatism and federalism and in recommending directly electedScottish and Welsh assemblies, but the Commissioners were divided in the restof their recommendations.   The Queen&apos;s Speech on 12 March 1974 said theGovernment &quot;will initiate discussions in Scotland and Wales on the Report of theCommission cn the Constitution, and will bring forward proposals forconsideration&quot;.   Accordingly, to provide the basis for these discussions theGovernment published on 3 June 1974 &quot;Devolution within the United KingdomSome Alternatives for Discussion&quot;.   This Consultative Document summarised thevarious schemes of devolution recommended in the Kilbrandon Commission&apos;s mainReport and in the Memorandum of Dissent which accompanied it and posed a numberof questions and identified problems relating to each of tlie possible schemes.(For ease of reference Part I of the Consultative Document, setting out theschemes,, is reproduced as an Annex to this White Paper.)2     The Government agree with the Commission on the Constitution in rejectingseparatism and federalism.   Scotland and Wales are and must remain integral partsof the United Kingdom.   The Government, like the Royal Commission, attach thegreatest possible importance to the maintenance of the economic and politicalunity of the United Kingdom.   Particularly important is the unified management of the economy, from which in the lon^ run all parts of the Union can only stand to gain.   These are considerations which Ministers have had in the forefront oftheir minds in considering possible schemes of devolution.3     It does not follow, however, that Scotland and Wales must be treated exactlylike any other part, of the United Kingdom.   While the people of Scotland and Wales,GfS M    s or- m T i a
3as the Royal Commission rioted, consider themselves to be british. they arc alsodeeply conscious of tine fact that they are Scottish or iVelsh*  Nor does itfollow that Scotland and Wales must be treated exactly like each other.   Theyhave differing histories, backgrounds and cultural traditions.   Because thecircumstances of the two countries are so different, the present arrangementsfor their government are not the same and it will not be surprising if their future systems of government are different.4     That circumstances are different in Scotland has long been recognised inthe arrangements made for the machinery of government of Scotland. The extentto which there is already a very substantial measure of devolution to scotland is all too often over-looked; it ought to be emphasised and the benefits whichit has brought to Scotland recognised.5     Since 1885 viien a Secretary for Scotland was appointed, and particularly from 1939 when the Scottish Office in broadly its present form was established in Edinburgh, &amp; very wide measure of what the Kilbrandon Commission described asadministrative devolution has been developed in Scotland.   Since toe waradditional functions have been progressively transferred to the Scottish Office,The Secretary of State, as a member of the UK Cabinet, now has major responsibillin Scotland (with some exceptions) both for the formulation of policy and its execution in such fields as agriculture and fisheries, criminal law, crofting,education, electricity, environmental services, health. Highlands and Islandsdevelopment, housing, legal services, local government, police, prison and fire services, roads, certain aspects of shipping and road transport services, social work, sport, recreation and the arts, tourism, town and country planning andyouth and community services.  The administrative functions at central goveronentlevel arising from these responsibilities are carried out by the five ScottishDepartments based on St Andrew&apos;s House in Edinburgh.   For most of these subjects/there is separate Scottish legislation or Scottish application clauses in DYc Act!Parliament.   Separate Scottish legislation has special Parliamentary machinery t(handle it consisting of the Scottish Grand Committee, on which all ScottishMembers of Parliament sit, and two Scottish Standing Committees which considerthe details of Scottish legislation.SCOTLANDExisting Devolution&apos;2
( p.nw ffocmt6     One basic reason for these differences in legislation and administrative and other important responsibilities are exercised by the two Scottish LawOfficers - the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.   But it isnot.just a case of Scottish legislation in parallel with that for England andWales; there are usually distinctive Scottish features and in sons cases the. approach is markedly different, reflecting the differing needs and conditionsof Scotland and the people living there.   Devolution to Scotland - in the sea as of running things differently in Scotland because Scotland is different - istherefore nothing new.7     The Secretary of State also has a major role in the planning and develcpEsntof the Scottish economy and plays a full part in the government&apos;s determination of Energy policy.   He exercises a co-ordinating function over activities inScotland, such as the location of industry, the level of employment and the        ^*development of North Sea oil, which are not his direct responsibility hut havean important, indeed vital, effect on the economy of Scotland.   The United. kingdon departments with signifleant Scottish responsibilities have offices in Scotlandwith delegated powers and work, closely with the Scottish Office.8     St is the Government&apos;s view that the existence of these separateadministrative arrangements in Scotland have greatly benefited the people ofScotland.   They have enabled special Scottish&apos;heeds to be recognised and met.   Itis also significant to note, as did the Kilbrandon CoMiidssion, ttsat identifiablepublic expenditure per head in Scotland has been at a significantly higher level than elsewhere in the United Kingdom (except in very recent years in NorthernIreland)..9     In recent months a number of .iuportant further measures have been announced by the Government.   The Off-shore Supplies Off ice of the Department of Energy isto be transferred to Glasgow.  Also to have its headquarters in Scotland is thenew British National Oil Corporation.   Still more important in the Scottish contextwas the announcement of the Goverrurent*s intention to establish a scottish development Agency-, which is to be responsible to the Secretary of State forScotland.   Its task, will he to strengthen the instruments available for promotingpractice arises from the existence of a separate system of Scottish law  thepreservation of which was provided for in the Union settlement of ?707, TheSecretary of State has accordingly responsibility for legal services in Scotland3
confidential the development and re-structuring of the Scottish economy.   It vail alsocarry out in Scotland appropriate functions of the National Enterprise BoardsA Scottish Airports authority is to he set up.   Also indicative of theGovernments intention to carry out appropriate central government functions in Scotland was the decision to transfer 6,000 Ministry of Defence and 1,000Ministry of Overseas Development posts to Glasgow over the next ten years.10    There is thus already very full recognition of the importance attached. by people in Scotland to ensuring that more decision taking occurs in Scotland,particularly where the decisions are ones affecting Scotland itself.Kilbrandon Commission unanimously concluded that a directly elected scottish assembly ought&quot; to he established to meet the legitimate desire of the people ofScotland for greater control over their own affairs.   The Commissioners were notagreeds however, on how this objective should be achieved, and in the main report and the Memorandum of Dissent, four schemas were set out for implementing thisdecision in relation to Scotland (Schemes A, B, C and E in the ConailtativeDocument).   All interested organisations and members of the public in scotland were invited to comment on these schemes.f2    The response, of individual members of the public was disappointing; only about 170 letters or papers, some quite brief, were received.   Of these therewas no clear majority for any one solution, and indeed a significant numberexpressed no specific view.13    On the other hand over 50 organisations in Scotland, including the political parties, submitted written views.  Among these there was considerable support for Scheme A or variations of it.. While very few indeed favoured Schemes B orC, there was some support for Scheme E.   A number wanted moro decision making inScotland, without associating that demand with any specific scheme.   Some wantedno change In the present system and/others wanted any decision deferred untilthe new Iccal authorities had had time to a^ttle down.  Most of these representslocal government were particularly concerned about the possible effects of theSchemes considered on the new local authoriti.es and their powers.   StrathclydeRegional Authority, for example, urged the Government &quot;to ensure that the newConsultations on the Consultative DocumentIt    While recognising the benefits to Scotland of the existing system, the
NTIALauthorities are given sufficient time and independent power to establish and develop themselves and that in the meantime the discussions should continue&quot;.&apos;14    During July ,974 a series of discussions was held in Scotland by ScottishMinisters accompanied by the Governments constitutional adviscr5 Lord Crovitiiei^Hunt,consulted in this way included the Scottish Council of the Labour Party, themade in the written submissions and some points emerged&apos;of&quot; particular significancesOne was a strong desire for more Government decision making to take place inScotland - and in that context the announcements referred to in paragraph 9 above were welcomed.   There was also widespread, though by no means unanimous,, support for the view that there would be merit in the establishment of a directly electedScottish Assembly, but there was no agreement on wiiat powers or functions theiAssembly should have.   Of the schemes in the Consultative Document, Scheme A,which proposed a legislative assembly and government for Scotland, commanded thegreatest support, but there was clearly a good deal of uncertainty about the precise implications of the scheme and the full significance of the fact that it involved a separate Scottish government responsible to the Assembly.] i There wasalso very considerable opposition both to the abolition of the office of secretary of State for Scotland and to a reduction in the number of ScottishMembers of Parliament at Westminster, for which Scheme a provided.   Of the other schemes,&apos; hardly anyone thought them appropriate to Scottish conditions, exceptthat&apos;Scheme E, which involved an advisory assembly with limited legislative powers and no Scottish Executive, attracted some support.IS    The process of consultation has made it apparent that opinion in Scotland&apos;is still very much divided.  Many are convinced of the&apos;need for a substantialiseasure of devolution, involving a directly elected Scottish Assembly with realpowers.   Others are equally convinced&apos;tnat any radical change in the presentsystem would be to Scotland&apos;s detriment, though administrative devolution might/ be further developed,with some of the organisations which had submitted written observations.   BodiesScottish National Party, trie Scottish Council (Development and Industry) y theScottish Trades Union Congress, the Council of the Confederation of BritishIndustry in Scotland, the Church and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotlandand various local authority representatives. , These discussions reinforced points5
&apos;(&apos; CONFIDENTIAL &quot;1Point-3 Jc ^be i resolved16 There are a number of very important points that remain to be resolvedbefore it is possible to put forward considered proposals for further measuresof devolution for Scotland that vsould command general support and would carry with them the prospect, of stability.   The principal ones are:-(a) FinanceIn any&apos;scheme of devolution to a Scottish Assembly and Government, the&apos; financial arrangements would clearly be of fundamental importance.   any major change in the present broad arrangements would oe dj.fficult to reconcile with,the maintenance of a general uniformity of approach in: the Kingdom as a whole to the allocation of resources and to taxation;..arrangement s0   Consideration of alternative approaches, including theproposal in Scheme A for a nominated Exchequer Board, has confirmed thevery great difficulty of findiiig acceptable solutions to these problems.(b) Trade^,^ and EitftlnymantThere is still a great deal of doubt about how far (if at all) powers inthese fields could be devolved to a Scottish Assembly and Government vitalprejudice to the essential economic unity of the.United Kingdom.   There is&apos;a strong desire for more decision making in Scotland, but this would hotnecessarily involve the creation of a Scottish Assenbly.There is understandable concern both about the timing of any constitutional changes in relation to the local government reorganisation uhlch is taiunjplace next year and about the possible attitude of a Scottish Assembly and government to local authorities.(d) The Secretary of StateThere is a strong desire to retain an effective Secretary of State. a significant diminution in bis present powers would be an inevitableconsequence of a substantial measure of devolution to a Scottish GovemuBnlbut it may be that he could still exercise considerable powers in thefinancial, economic and industrial gjheres as well as acting as Scotland^spokesman in the UK Cabinet.   Indeed an extension of his presentresponsibilities in these areas might point the way to a solution to theproblems outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.6CONFIDENTIAL
confidential&quot;).(e) Scottish representation at WestminsterThere is a great reluctance to see any reduction in the number of Scottish&apos; Members of Parliament at Westminster, with a consequent weakening of- Scottish influence in UK affairs.  This must be reconciled with whatever-Revolutionary arrangements are made. -Decisions17   All these outstanding problems as well as a great many matters of detailwill rebjiire further very careful and thorough study before the Government isin a position to put forward fully worked out proposals for consideration.   Butat the present stage the Government have reached the following decisions otprinciple:(a) A Legislative AssemblyIt is the Government^ intention to set up a directly elected scottish assembly with legislative pavers within the context of the political and/economic unity of the United Kingdom.   The Assembly will be elected bythe same method as is now used for the Westminster Parliament.- (b) Tlie Secretary of State vA Secretary of State for Scotland will be retained within the UK cabinet with effective powers in Scotland.  An examination will he made of the/extent to which further responsibilities might be devolved on to him,particularly in the fields of economic and industrial development and in financial matters. ........; (c) Scottish representation at &quot;WestminsterThere will be no reduction in the number of Scottish Members of parliament as a consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Assembly.-:,) WALES iExisting devolution ^18   As in the case of Scotland , substantial administrative devolution to wales has already taken place, though at a later historical stage.  The first minister for Welsh Affairs was appointed in 1951, but the most important measures of devolution have been concentrated into the last ten years.  The first secretary CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL )of State was appointed in 1964-, and since then the Welsh Officers functionshave grown rapidly.  The Departnent now has responsibility in Wales for housing,health, the social services, primary and secondary education, child care, tovai if and country planning, water, highways, tourism, forestry and agriculture (joint]with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), and many other functions,The strengthening of the Office sti 11continues.  The post of its civil servicehead was recently upgraded to that of full Permanent Secretary and the seniorstaffing has been further strengthened.19    In other ways too administration has been reshaped and strengthened and decision making has been devolved to take account of Welsh interests in economicarid other fields.  The Secretary of State has oversight responsibility for theeconomic development of Wales and exercises a co-ordinating responsibility ingovernment action to promote the welfare of Wales.   Considerable powers have beedelegated to the Oepartnent 0^ Trade and Industry Office for Wales, and Kaleshas its own Industrial Director and Industrial Development Board.  As part of tftGovernment&apos;s policy for United Kingdom Offshore Oil and Gas, similar arrangement to those in Scotland will be made in Wales to strengthen the instruments for promoting the development of Wales&apos; ecohorn/.  The organisation which will be setup for this purpose will exercise in Wales appropriate functions of the proposedWatidnal EnterpriserBoard&apos;,  The Government have: also announced their decision, aa further- step to assist the economy, to transfer over 7,000 civil service poststo Wales in the next ten years.  As in-Scotland, identifiable public expenditureper head in Wales has for many years been running at a substantially higher level than in England. &apos;20    In consequence of these and other measures Government action is increasingljadapted to fit Welsh needs and to further Welsh interests.  The role of theSecretary of State with a seat in the Cabinet is fundamental.  He not only hasfull responsibility for the matters referred to in paragraph 18 above; in othermatters affecting Wales he has powers of oversight and can safeguard and furtherWelsh interepts both in Cabinet andin/discussion with Departmental Ministers.No Welsh problem escapes his attention end he exercises a powerful influence onpolicies affecting Wales.21    Welsh interests are further &apos;ixl^Wht:cd:cefitrally through the 36 WelshMembers of Parliament at Westminster who, in addition to their other8
f CONFIDENTIAL/)&apos;.Parliamentary or Ministerial functions, all sit on the Welsh Grand Cosrcaitteewhich provides a further forum for debate and discussion of matters concerningWales.Gonstijxations on the Consultative Docuiirent22    The members of tlie Kilbrandon Commission luere agreed that a directly elected Welsh Assembly should be established^ bat they were divided about thepowers which it should exercise.   In the main Report and the MemorancUm ofi Dissent four different schemes were proposed (Schemes Af BP C and D in the consultative document).   In accordance with the Government&apos;s undertaking tocarry out discussions on the commission s Report in Wales, the Secretary,ofState,,with the assistance of the Government&quot;s constitutional adviser, has completed a programme of consultations,23    Tine bodies consulted represented political parties in Wales, localauthorities, both sides of industry and the farming community. Ii The majority//were in favour of the establishment of a directly elected Assembly for iYaiessbut there was no general-agreement on the functions it should exercise: opinion was divided between those who favoured legislative devolution and those whowere for executive devolution.   The minority either favoured a directly electedWelsh Advisory Council or wanted no fundamental change in existing arrangements.The points on which there was substantial agreement among those consulted wasthat, the office of Secretary of State should, continue and that there should beno reduction in the number of Welsh Members of Parliament.24    The Secretary of State received written views from 28 organisations in wales.&apos;::In most cases these were briefly stated and did not attempt to deal v&amp;with the detailed questions set out in the discussion document.   The views of these organisations, mostly made up of individual local authorities and political,trade union and religious bodies, were divided: only about one-third were infavour of legislative devolution; a slightly smaller-proportion preferred executivedevolution; and the remainder favoured other solutions or the status quo.   Inaddition the Secretary of State received written views from a relatively small number of individuals, most of tthich were in favour of schemes of at leastlegislative devolution.25    Thus no consensus of opinion has emerged.   The case for an elected assembly is widely supported, but there is no general agreement about the powers it should
C CONFIDENTIAL )exercise.Howr/er, there is an evident desire to see Government decision makingfeeing made more responsive and accountable to the people, provided this&apos;ear. bedone without disrupting the essential political and economic unity of the Urdted&apos;Kingdom.   In particular, it has been urged that the nominated bodies which atpresent carry out many functions in Wales should be replaced by a bodyrepresentative of the Welsh people, which should also discharge some of theexecutive functions of Government Departments in Wales.* decisions. ;i  .26    The Government have considered the way ahead very carefully in the Ii$-,t of lie Kilbrandcn proposals and the subsequent consultations and their conclusion13 that the needs of Wales would best be met by setting up a directly elected assembly with mainly executive functions, including some at pie sent carried outby the Secretary of State; it would also take over the functions of a largenumber, of nominated bodies in Wales.   It would assume certain powers of theSecretary.of State in respect of delegated legislation, and it would havedeliberative functions.   The Secretary of State for Wales would remain and, asin the case of Scotland, would play a crucial parti consideration would be givento extending his role in relation to industrial development, finance and energy cWales&apos; present representation of Members of rarliaraent at Westminster would,remain unaltered.   The members of the Assembly would be elected by the samesystem as that used for the Westminster Parliament,   Such a democratic assembly would undertake considerable responsibilities on behalf of the people of Wales bycarrying out many functions affecting daily lifej it would have sufficientflexibility in operation to enable it to act effectively in discharging its responsibilities.   At the same time, the retention of. the office of Secretaryof State and of the pre sent number of Welsh Members of Parliament at iJestminsterwould ensure effective representation of Welsh interests in the centralfosfsulation of policies affecting tl*e United Kingdom as a whole and Wales inparticular.I10
CONCLUSION27    These proposals will represent the most significant constitutional changes tohave taken place in Great Britain in the last 250 years.   Their implementationwill enable people in Scotland and Wales to exercise greater control over theirown affairs and will bring Government closer to the people.   The consequenceswill be far-reaching, and will affect everyone in the United Kingdom.   The new arrangements must work well and endure; hence much care is needed in working outthe complex new provisions which will be required.   The Government will put this work in hand urgently; but it would be irresponsible at this stage to try to givedetails of the nature and exact powers of the new Assemblies.   They believe thatthe decisions of principle now taken will be broadly in line with the wishes of a wide section of opinion in the two countries, and they will welcome the furtherexpression of views to help with the many further detailed decisions which willhave to be taken.
&apos;ANNEX CConfidential Labour Party RES; 145/Aufirnat. 1974(Revised)Hoae Policy CommitteeBRIffGIHG PoflER BACK TO THE PEOPLE?A Statement of Labour...Party policy the history of the Labour Movement has been one of struggle to gain for individual working men and their families a full share in political, economic and industrial power.   This means much more than the simple principle of one man: one vote.   Democracy must be more than aperiodic exercise in head counting.   It must provide for the involvementof individuals in all decision-making processes. 1A profound public appreciation is developing of the relativelynarrow fields in which the exercise of power at present is demo-cratically accountable and those other areas wehere a yftwning gap pre-vails between those who make decisions and those who bear the con-sequences.   To most workers on the shop floor or in offices Britishbusiness is at best a benevolent dictatorship.   Labour has already;        -Hproposed measures to promote.greater democracy at work and to ensure a transformation.of relationships in the factory and the workplace0But there are areas of governmental decision-making which themselves are subject to inadequate democratic control.   It is to these areas thatthis statement is directed.The 20th century has seen the responsibilities of centralgovernment expand far faster thanjprovision for their democratic
supervision.   As the range cf government responsibility has spreadever wider there has been an increasing concentration of power at westminster and in Whitehall.   At the same time assorted nominatedad hoc authorities (often organised on a regional basis) have pro-liferated.   They have assumed not only some of these new tasks of central government, but also many of the responsibilities for public services earlier entrusted to local government such as hospitals,gas, electricity and trunk roads.   In addition central government departments have evolved their own administrative and executive regional structures.In the interests of efficiency civil servants now make a range of decisions within their regions without reference to headquarters, amiwithout reference to the peoples9 elected representatives,,.    Forinstance Regional Controllers of the Department of Industry now makeimportant decisions affecting the location of industry, authorisingloans of up to  1 million under the 1972 Industry Act?   RegionalDirectors of the Department of the Environment approve road improve-ments schemes.   J/T&quot;regional leve] of governmental decision-makingtherefore already exists   but is not subject to direct democraticoversight.   Harold Wilson emphasised this in February 1973* whenhe pointed   to the glaring gap between local authorities and centralgovernment which at present ie bridged by a series of undemocraticad hoc expedients, and to the existence of regional government withoutregional democracy.   It is a gap which must be closed by changes in ourdemocratic structure.   They must give to the British people the powerto control the decisions exercised in their hame by the variousnominated bodies, and outposts of government.
But we must be clear that separatism is not the answer.Nationalist parties, of Welsh, Scottish and Cornish varieties have all tried to exploit geographical remoteness from the centre ofgovernment, by playing upon the genuine fears of the people that government based in London is English and therefore alien.In contrast^since the early 1960&apos;s successive Labour governments have demonstrated particular sensitivity to the diversity of regional economic and industrial problems and needs0The nationalists solicit *borrowed&apos; votes to create separateparliaments - but refuse to come clean on how else they would use such support.   No-one really knows - for they do not know themselves -where they stand on the major issues of prices, unemployment and.&apos;;   &apos;- i    &apos;-&quot; -&apos; &apos; &apos;   -  - &apos;    &apos; &quot;\ If- &apos;.&apos;::.-r&apos;.:f:Gf:)f r f:housing or on the crucial issue of public ownership.   Lacking any visiof a fairer, more just society, they   seek only to create a Scotlandand Wales separate from^and independent from, the United Kingdom.&apos;1They seek to serve the political and economic links which give the United Kingdom it cohesion.   But these are the verylinks which would have to be laboriously established to avoid the   disastrous economic consequences of separatism.
The Labour Movement ha3 always recognised that the working classes&apos; strengstems from unity.   The break-up of the United Kingdom would only isolate andexpose ordinary families to the excesses of big business and market forces,Scotland, Wales and the depressed regions of England face severe economic andindustrial problems, but these differ only in scale from those facing the UniteKingdom/as a whole. They are the problems of all working people and the only definitesolutions are the socialist policies, in a United Kingdom context, which we aroputting forward. . .. - .The nationalist parties, claim, that only they understand and represent theScottish and Welsh nations with their distinctive traditions, cultures and social values.   At the same time they ignore the deep sense of identity thatexists in the North West and South West of England as well as in Scotland andWales.   They fail to recognise that Labour alone of British political parties,fully comprehends from its own bitter experience the depths of injusticethroughout all the nations and regions of the United Kingdom today.But ignorance cannot forgive their attempt to steal Labour&apos;s history.   Itwas the Labour Party which called in 1948 for the establishment of a Council of wales;   it was pressure from the Parliamentary Labour Party which resulted inthe Welsh Grand Committee meeting for the first time in I960;   it was thoLabour Government which created the post of Secretary of State for Wales witha seat in the Cabinet in 1964;   and it was the Welsh Council of Labour whichcalled in 1965 for an elected Welsh Assembly,It was the Labour Party in Scotland, the party of Keir Hardie and JamesMaxton, which in 1958 reaffirmed its support for the principle of maximumself-government for Scotland consistent with remaining within the United Klngdo:
it was the Labour Government which encouraged the Scottish Council of labour which in 1974, after an open, honest debate, overwhelmingly called for an elected Scottish Assembly with legislative powers,,It was out of realisation of the deepening popular frustration at theworkings of the British system of government that the Labour Government in 1969established the Kilbrandon Commission on the Constitution.   The Labour Party fullyendorses the unanimous view of the Commissioners in rejecting federalism andseparatism, and accepts the broad conclusion of their Report that there is roomand a real need for a substantial measure of devolution of power away1 fromWestminster and Whitehall.   The object of our following proposals is to adapt theBritish Constitution to the needs of the remainder of the 20th century;   to avoidfragmenting the United Kingdom but to bring the spotlight of democracy to bear onthe Scottish, Welsh and English levels of government,\ which already exists.,We now propose tha creation of directly-elected Assemblies for Scotland andWales.   We have of course an equal commitment to democratic accountability ofgovernment and equality of political rights in the English regions.   In Scotlandand Wales there has already been a full debate which has enabled us to make firm proposals.   We shall now begin a similar consultation process in England.   Whilethe new institutions we propose for Scotland and Wales will share commoncharacteristics, they will differ from one another in their respective powersand responsibilities.   We have no wish to confine the diverse traditions of thenations and regions of the United Kingdom within an arbitrary straight-jacket ofrigid uniformity, or to duplicate a series of identical institutions and plantthem in unnatural settings.   Different traditions already exist between Scotland,Wales and the regions of England.   Tj^ese must be recognised in the futurestructure of government.
Despite their differences and their individual sense ofnationhood the Scots and Welsh have ouch in common.   Within theUnited Kingdom framework there is much which the Scots and Welsh have longhad in common, and which provide a basis for our proposals for the future,An essential element in our policy for both Scotland and Wales isthe retention of their existing number of MPfs at Westminster and themaintenance of both the posts of Secretary of State for Scotland andfor Walen in the Cabinet, /)It Is in this context that we reject utterly the concept of a nominated Exchequer Board to decide the distribution of resources between Scotland. Wales and the regions of England.     the determination of &quot;fair shares1 is the most fundamental of political decisions and cannot be delegated by elected representatives.   Itmust be argued out in Cabinet, with the two Secretaries of Statepresent as of right to speak for Scotland and Wales, and approved in the House of Commons./^Moreover, even after the creation of directly elected assemblies for Scotland and Wales the Westminster parliament and most United Kingdom Government Departments will still have very substantial responsibilities which will affectScotland and Wales no less than the regions of England -e.g.for the overall management of the United Kingdom economy,for finance, for foreign policy, for defence and majorTrade, Industry, Employment and Energy policies etc.   hence the continuing and crucial need for the Scottish and WelshSecretaries of State to remain in the United Kingdom cabinet and for full Scottish and Welsh representation at Westminster.
The present method of election to the Westminster parliament will apply to elections to the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies.It is simple to operate and well understood by the public.   above all it provides for the clear and direct accountability of the electedrepresentative to his constituents.   The single transferable vote system with multi-member constituencies is cumbersome and would cut thisessential link, weakening rather than strengthening the principleof direct accountability,.Moreover, such a system of proportional representationcould not operate in by-elections to.the Assemblies.   Finally the useof a   different system for : lections to the Assemblies from thatemployed for local council or Parliamentary elections would constitute a sure recipe for confusion on the part of the electorate.The Scottish and Welsh Assemblies will each assume many of thepresent functions of the Scottish and Welsh Offices, and the respon-sibilities of many of the nominated authorities now operating within theirboundaries.   This will include for example areas such as housing,education, health economic and environmental planning, and in Wales,water.There will be a block financial allocation to Scotland and to wales, instead of the.present method of Westminster allocation of funds for each separate field of expenditure.   It will be for theScottish and Welsh Assemblies to determine priorities in the distri-bution of expenditure as between the competing claims of housing,schools, roads, hospitals and welfare services.
The Assemblies will thus assume heavy responsibility.   Theywill have to face up to the stark problem of making choices betweencompeting demands for public spending.   We believe it is right that they should have this responsibility, so that they may decidepriorities against the economic and historical background of thepeople they represent.   This is a key and central element of the devolution of power which we propose.      ji   - .&apos;The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the North Sea andCeltic Sea revolutionises the opportunity for transforming the future economic and industrial prospects of all   the depressed regions of the.United Kingdom at a time when radical changes   are being introduced into hov? the regions manage their own affairs.   But this opportunitywill only be grasped if those of our people living in areas off whoseshores the mtijor discoveries have been made are able to put asideavarice and selfishness and recall that not only Scotland and Wales,but also the North West and North East of England, have suffered asa result of a concentration of contracting industries.Labour is determined that the community and each deservingregion receives its full and fair share of the profits resulting from &apos; , *-        I&apos;i: $ftthn exploitation of these new energy resources in accordance with its needs.This must mean that maximum benefit goes to redress the regionalimbalance which the years of industrial decline have caused.It must also mean carrying our own proposals for ensuringmajority state participation in existing licences for Cfommercialoilfields, for majority particiaption under new licences, and for setting
up the British National Oil Corporation, with its headquarters inScotland,   It is not the nationalists      private,capitalism which is theissue for the people of Scotland and of Wales.    What matters above allis that new oil wealth is exploited to the benefit of public andnot private interests.The task of breathing new life into our depressed areas is ono for both central government and for the new Assemblies we propose.   Only a United Kingdom Government, with the socialistpolicies of the Labour Party, can overcome the failures of thepast and find solutions to the deep-seated unemployment problems inScotland, Wales and parts of England.Creating Assemblies in Scotland and Wales will not wave the&apos; magic wand.Central government will have to take direct action at the level ofBritainf3 bi/?ge3t firms in the form of planning agreements and ai national enterprise Board rather than general handouts and incentives.
The new Scottish Development Agency ve propose, working side by side withthe National Enterprise Board, will spearhead new employment opportunities andeconomic growth.   There will also be similar arrangements for Wales as oilexploration develops in the Celtic Sea,But there must, be scope too for real initiative to be taken outside LondoiThe Scottish and Welsh Assemblies will therefore participate in the decisions ihow best to promote their development, for instance by drawing up their economiplans.   Substantial executive powers in the trade and industry fields will betransferred from central government to enable the Assemblies to tailor policies to their own needs in the promotion of employment and industrial regeneration,It would also be appropriate for the proposed Scottish Development Agency tobecome responsible -to the Scottish Assembly.   Similar arrangements could-apply in Wales.A further feature common to our proposals for.both Scotland and Wales inour intention not to take powers away from local government to the Assemblies,To do otherwise would be to run counter to the entire spirit of our basicproposals and to undermine our objective of bringing power nearer to the peopli -Moreover^ 3ince we are unable at this stage, for overwhelmingly&apos;practical reasons of lack of time, to go much further than declare where we stand on theprinciple of devolving power from Westminster and^outline the basic form our proposed scheme of devolution will take, the new authorities created by recentlocal government reorganisation will have time to settle down in their newfunctions before the Assemblies take office.
Our proposals for Scotland and Wales are directed to the needsof the present and future.   But in matters of fundamental constitutional practice reasonable men do not lightly break with t:he traditions of the pasto   They are after all part of our heritage. Scotland forexample has always had a distinct legal structure and legislativeprocess firmly bedded in hundreds of years of history.     So manyScottish laws today are significantly different from those in Englandand are indeed separately enacted for Scotland.   Labour thereforeproposes that the Scottish Assembly will have legislative powerswithin those fields in which separate Scottish legislation already exists such as housing, health, education and home affairs. //.&apos;&apos; We intend that the Welsh assembly should parallel theScottish counterpart in assuming responsibility for many of the    iiexecutive   functions, certainly of those at present carried out bythe undemocratic   nominated bodies within Wales, together with, someof the Secretary of State*s executive functions.   The Welsh assembly would also assume certain powers of the Secretary of State inrespect of delegated legislation.   It will enjoy a wide area ofdeci3ion&apos;&quot;52aking, in fields such as housing, health and education,within a broad framework of central government legislation in the formulation of which the Assembly will have a substantial impact.Above all, the Assemblies must be equipped to respond to thereal nedds.   But in the main it tfill mean vital decisions affectingScotland and Wales being made Within Scotland and Wales by the Scotsand Welsh themselves.   It will give effect to the declaration we madein July 1973 &quot;Labour&apos;s Programme&quot;; w^hich set out.our intention tobring about &quot;an effective devolution of decision-making and functions&quot;from Whitehall to the regions and nations of the United Kingdom.
&quot;But/we insisted, &quot;we are not interested in the creation of talking-shope devoid of pouers.&quot;conclusion in promoting this policy of devolution of power   wa have been concerned to strengthen the principle of direct accountability,   we now assert that/principle, and propose the basic framework within whichthis should be accomplished in Scotland in Wales*a   The increasingsophistication and range of government activity and machinery makethe task we have sefi ourselves highly complex and inevitably lengthy0 /We intend legislating for tb.3 establishment of Scottish and WalshAssemblies as early as possible during the life of the next LabourGovernmento   Many point of substance, of course, remain to bedetermined before legislation can be drafted.   Some   ara of critical importance and canrot be taken lightly.   The new system of government we propose ti-st stand the test of time0Our proposals will strengthen British democracy,   They will restoredemocratic control over important levels of government, bring powernearer to the people, and enhance the ability of government to respondpositively to the special needs of the various nations and regions of britain.   Labour alone of the political parties combines meaningful,viable policies for devolving power from Westminster, with reasonable prospect of being in a position to Keep its promises in the nextParliaments
