DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT79q(74) 120 COPY NO30 October 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, At our discussioh of public expenditure on 12 September theCabinet -a. Reaffirmed the need to limit the growth of public expenditure to an average annual rate of Z\ per cent in demand terms up to 1978-79.li     -   &apos;&apos; i,  ;-1-1.     -b. Asked me to consider priorities for public spending,, to consult my colleagues mainly concerned, and to report back,2.        Since the summer, policy decisions and some major estimatingchanges, notably for housing, have raised total expenditure throughout theperiod above the Survey total, prepared on the basis we agreed.    Some ofmy colleagues have also made additional claims,    Even if the minimumallowance were made for Jbese claims public expenditure would beexceeding the limit we set for 1978*79 by  300- 4Q0 million in demand terms,3.        I attach a note by the Treasury which discusses priorities inrelation to our policy objectives and the immediate needs of the economy,including the operation of the social contract and the improvement of our industrial base.    Within this framework of priorities, the note&apos;puts forwardan illustrative scheme for accommodating the programmes within our limit,taking account of my bilateral discussions,4,        Giving a high priority to particular programmes or services doesnot mean that spending on them may increase without any restraint.    Thereis now a pressing need, for example, to phase out the very heavysubsidies at present paid to hold nationalised industry prices down, andmore gradually to reduce the cost of food subsidies.    The scope for improving less urgent social security benefits will be restricted in the nextfew years; and it is necessary to ensure that the costs of a larger housing programme are fairly shared between tenants and taxpayers or ratepayers.1
These restraints on the higher priority programmes are already assumed in the Treasury note, as a basis for determining what is available for the programmes of less immediate priority.    For the reasons explained above, these programmes have to be accommodated within a total for1978-79 which will be  300- 400 million less, in demand terms, than the survey programmes.5.        1 believe this will be possible without reducing standards of service;on the contrary, in all cases these would continue to improve.    But if wedo not contain the claims of the public sector now, as I propose, we arelikely to be faced in the near future with no choice but to make largerunplanned cuts in crisis conditions^, for the reasons which I spelled out inmy earlier paper relating public expenditure to the other claims on thenation&apos; s output.6.        Given a total allocation lower by  300- 400 million in demand terms, the programmes where I believe we must contain the rate at whichstandards improve fall largely in the field of local authorities; includingeducation, personal social services, law and order, local environmental services and roads, and local transport including subsidies for fares.    Inthese areas the estimates for this year&apos;s negotiations on the rate support grant already show a very rapid escalation in real expenditure, quite apart from inflation, and the plans for the future involve a heavy and continuing drain on the national manpower pool.    It is urgently necessaryto reduce this rate of expansion.    Unless we succeed not only will there be unacceptable pressure on real resources but both the pressure on therates and the level of support from central Government will also reachunacceptable levels.7. We need to settle the figures for 1978-79, to fix the line of progress for the future, and the allocations for 1975-76 as the basis for next year&apos;estimates.    The tables attached to the note include figures for both years.But these figures will be meaningless unless we at once take the stepsrequired to modify our policies, both for central government and localauthorities, so as to ensure that measures are put in hand to bring aboutthe reallocation of resources which is necessary over the period as a whole.CONCLUSIONS A8. I ask the Cabinet --   //&apos;a. To endorse the pattern of priorities proposed in my paper as a means of securing the total savings by 1978-79 which we need to keep within our agreed limit for the growth of public expenditure.b. To note the corresponding programme estimates for 1975-76and 1978-79, and t&amp; agree that we should proceed to frame the1975-76 Estimates and the Public Expenditure White Paperaccordingly.2
c. To endorse the modifications of policies, affecting bothcentral Government and local authorities, which we shall need to implement rapidly so as to secure these objectives.wD treasury Chambers30 October 19743
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIESNote by the treasury the Cabinet&apos;s decision in July to limit the growth ofexpenditure to an average of 7L\ per cent in demand termsover the period to 1978-79 allowed for no net increase inthe programmes as costed iii,the Survey.     Two developments have now to be taken into account:(a) The cost of new policy decisions and of some major,.; estimating increases since the summer]1(b) Some ministers requests for additional allocations.After allowing for (a) but with no substantial concessions to(b) except for family support, the 1978-79 to,tal would stillexceed the Cabinet guideline by some  300-400 million in demand terms.     This paper discusses the problem of matchingthe programmes to the guideline on the basis of a judgment of priorities.The social contract:   counter-inflation policy .     The social contract is central to the Governmenfsimmediate policy to reduce cost inflation.     A key element in the Governmenfs contribution has been restraint of rents and prices, especially prices of essential foods by food subsidies, now running at over  500 million a year.     In l[,   I&apos;addition subsidies to the nationalised industries are nowcosting over  1000 million a year, about two-thirds for price restraint, more than double the provision in the March
budget.     There is a serious conflict, particularly withregard to the nationalised industry subsidies, between the objective of price restraint and the need for economy inresource use and containment of a growing budgetaryimbalance.     Broadly,  100 million in food subsidies reduces the EPI by 0.27%;  100 million in subsidies to nationalised industry prices reduces the EPI by 0.21%.     It should nowbe an object of policy to phase out subsidies for pricesupport for the nationalised industries withii^ the period,and to taper off those for food to say  300 million by1978-79*     If these results are not secured the rest ofpublic expenditure would have to &quot;be constricted beyond the economies now proposed by many hundreds of millions of pounds.Housing 113.     Housing has been given unconstrained priority, both thebuilding of homes and the provision of housing subsidies.These subsidies involve large and rising transfers to counciltenants from taxpayers and to a lesser extent from ratepayers.Standard rents (before rebate) now represent only about halfof the costs of council housing:   this is another area whererapidly rising money costs to public authorities are notrecouped from the consumer, and where selective rate andrent rebates are more cost-effective than general subsidies.The rent freeze is to be discontinued by the end of thisyear and it has been proposed that the rent increase in1975-76 should be moderated by a special subsidy for oneyear only.     If rents do not then rise at least as fast asthe index of consumer prices, the subsidy bill will growSECEET
faster than has &quot;been assumed, and by the end of the period the effect will be to intensify the squeeze on the rest ofpublic expenditure.     Given continued priority for new building by public authorities the need is to direct policy towards containment of other housing expenditure and itsreduction where possible.     This should be pursued in thefull review of housing finance which is being put in handI        \\    - &apos;      &apos;   I] &apos;    lj  *i      wand by any other means, including exploration of the possible-ility of a better distribution of new.house-building, or ofsome economies in space or standards, or any betteralternative which the Housing Departments can suggest.Social Security4-.     Maintaining or improving the real incomes of pensioners and other recipients of social security benefits is theother main element in the Government&apos;s social policy.     Butthe 1974- pensions uprating and the pledge to uprate pensions in future in line with average&apos; earnings, together withimmediate help for the disabled and publication of long termplans for a better pension scheme for all, have already expressed this handsomely.     The present high rate of inflation makes two upratings in 1975 virtually unavoidable;and provision must be made to honour the Government&apos;s pledge to increase family allowances.     The cost of social securityimprovements is, however, heavy and irreversible, and reactson both the wage earner&apos;s take home pay and on industrialcosts.     The scope for further improvements beyond those already mentioned must, therefore, be strictly limited.
Industrial and manpower policies5.     The Government contributes through the productive investment of the nationalised industries, through regional and industrial support, and through manpower and trainingpolicies to the improvement of the industrial base, betterutilisation of labour in the economy, and thus to future growth.    \\Some of these policies, notably regional and man-power policies, are also directly relevant to the social contract.     To seek savings in this area would therefore notaccord with accepted priorities.     Because some policies,notably those associated with the National Enterprise Boardand nationalisation measures, have not yet been fully developed, specific provision in the survey programmescertainly understates future spending, which would be a.callon the contingency reserve.     Future projects for government support in industry, technological or other, must be assessedon the need to secure an adequate return to the economy onthe resources invested.6.     The shortfall on approved nationalised industry pro-grammes has, however, continued in recent years to be greaterthan expected and the totals can be reduced on this account by  200 million.     But high levels of subsidy will have tended to produce in some of the industries high demand andmore expansive plans for investment than would be required if an economic pricing policy were in force.     In particular,the CPRS have suggested questioning again the commercialcase for much of the railways&apos; modernisation programme.
Agriculture7.     Provision for agricultural support is always hard toestimate, and the difficulty is exacerbated by the e.c. re-negotiation and CAP review.     But a high priority is assumedfor a policy of continued support, in appropriate form, for efficient production.Health f &apos;8.     Since last winter there have been forceful represent-ations that the health service is &quot;under-financed&quot;.     It isnot clear how far the complaint will be found to extend beyond pay levels, which are in course of being reassessed,but the DHSS consider that there are serious inadequaciesin the numbers of staff and in the NHS estate and equipment which will need to be remedied urgently.     Further restriction of this programme is not therefore recommended.Defence9.     To avoid prejudging the outcome of the defence review,the 1974-75 defence budget figure of a little   over  3600million was projected forward in the survey throughout theperiod, as a purely notional run of figures.     If existingdefence commitments and force levels were to be maintained,&apos;   &apos; lithe defence budget would rise by some  700 million (1974-Survey prices) above the present figure by the end of theperiod, because of the increased sophistication and cost of weapons systems.     Major cuts in our overseas commitments and in our home-based forces would therefore be needed even to scale down this increase.     It will be essential to keep
to a minimum any addition required in future years to thenotional Survey figures, hut it seems doubtful whether a lower defence budget than, say,  3700 million in 1975-76can be assumed.Roads and transportOther environmental services law, order and protective services education, libraries, science and artsPersonal social services10.   These remaining   five major programmes together account for a quarter of the total of the specific iprogrammes shownin the Survey for 1978-79* out for over half of the increasein that total between 1974-75 an(3 1978-79.     Housing apart,they include practically all local authorities&apos; expenditure.While local authorities&apos; capital expenditure on these fiveprogrammes appears in the survey as only  70 million higher in 1978-79 than in 1974-75 (an average annual rise of 1 percent), current expenditure rises by over  1000 million inthe same period - an average annual rate of nearly 5 percent.     It has been 8 per cent in the past two years andwill be even faster this year.     The latest figures, on june 1969 to June 1973. show that local authority manpowerhas been rising at an average of around 80,000 a year.     the survey figures imply that it would continue to rise over thenext four years at much the same rate.    This would &quot;be the equivalent to adding to the public sector every year aGovernment- department of the size of the DHSS and thusabsorbing virtually the whole prospective increase in theworking population in that period.     It therefore seems
SECRET &apos;       &apos; &apos; \.....essential to look to the current expenditure of localauthorities in these five programmes for a large contributionto the necessary reduction in the growth of public expenditureon goods and services.     Moreover the combination of highreal rates of increase and rapid inflation will lead to such large increases in rates next year that a massive increasein the rate support grant, and thus in the borrowing requirement, will be unavoidable, notwithstanding the\ &apos; ,&quot;.   &apos;I.V   / -:&apos;Mldesirability of allowing rate increases to impose some brakeon this expenditure.     Proposals to implement this policy are being put separately to Ministers.11.   Following the analysis of priorities set out above the annex to this note explains the implications for certainprogrammes of an illustrative scheme producing a reduced rate of increase in public expenditure compared with the programmes of the Survey.     Table 1 shows the comparison between this scheme and the Survey.     The average annual rate of increase in public expenditure in the period to1978-79 under the illustrative scheme is 2.8 per cent in demand terms - just above the Cabinet&apos;s guideline of 2% percent.     Table 2 gives the totals for each programme underthe illustrative scheme for the coming year and for&apos;thefinal year of the period.     Table 3 lists the claims whichare not accommodated within these totals, distinguishingcertain claims for which Cabinet may feel there is a partic-particularly pressing case.     Table 4- lists prospective commitmentsnot yet sufficiently firm and quantifiable for inclusion inthe programmes; they do not involve, for the most part,significant additions to demand but they could have implic-ations for monetary policy and budgetary management.
Conclusions12.   The main issues for the Government are:(a;   Do they accept the interpretation of priorities in this paper - with the implication that subsidies forthe nationalised industries and, to a considerable extent, food will be cut back over the period, and housing subsidies and social security improvementscontained?(b) Do they accept that, assuming that defence expend-iture is held as closely as possible to the notionalprojections in the Survey, savings will need to be madein current expenditure on goods and services in theremaining programmes - primarily those which make upthe current expenditure of the local authorities?&quot;&apos;\\ .    &apos; ..&apos;&apos;.v.&apos;:(c) Do they accept that they should start to implementthese policy changes immediately, for 1975-76 - keepingfood subsidies flat, reducing price support subsidies to the nationalised industries, allowing some increasein council house rents, and obtaining a grip on localgovernment current expenditure in next month&apos;s negotiations-ations of rate support grant?(d) Do they accept that local authorities must be warned of the need for a major re-adjustment in theirpresent intentions, so that planned expansion of services can be reduced and staff numbers stabilised;and do they also accept that it will be necessary forthe responsible Ministers to indicate to local author-ities the services upon which the agreed reductions should be concentrated?
ANNEXILLUSTRATIVE REDUCTIONS WITHIN THE SCHEME OF PRIORITIESThe following illustrative scheme for securing the necessaryreductions by 1978-79 shows where policies need to be modified.     It is this new approach to policies, rather thanthe actual sums suggested, which is central.Roads and transport;    115 million2.     Government subsidy to British Rail is running at over 250 million this year and will rise to well over  300million by 1978-79*     But another major transport subsidyhas been added as, with reorganisation, a number of localauthorities in England and Wales have used their wider powers to assist passenger transport undertakings so thatthey can avoid increases in fares:   extra annual cost about 125 million by end 1978-79-     This subsidy should bereduced to save  100 million net on this programme by 1978-79-3.     The network of new motorways and trunk roads containsonly projects which are fully justified economically.     Buta sgueeze on local authority current expenditure generally would extend to roads, including maintenance.     At 1 percent a year it would reduce roads expenditure by  15 millionhy 1978-79.Local environmental services:    25 million.... &apos; -&quot; p a &apos;&apos; . - ife^l4-.     This programme includes manpower for the general administration of local authorities as well as the environ-mental services themselves (water and sewerage, refuse,
CONFinENTIAL    11recreation and town planning).     More than a quarter of amillion people are involved, and the forecast real growth of4 per cent a year to 1978-79 should he subject to restraint;for example, by tighter discipline on manpower.Housing:    75 million5.     The CPRS have raised the question whether the greatlyincreased cost of building houses does not make it necessaryto reconsider the standards to which they are built and theextent of garage provision.     Particular forms of housinginvestment might be considered for lower priority:   egimprovement of local authorities&apos; houses.     Such changesmight save  75 million.6.     The Department now estimate that lending by localauthorities for house purchase and the expenditure of theHousing Corporation will be  165 million more in 1978-79than was thought when the Chancellor reported to Cabinet inSeptember.     The increase must raise the question of findingfurther offsetting savings.Law, order and protective services:    25 million:   W &apos; &apos; &apos; j I   r  H&quot; ;f: :  ^7.     Given the priority which police and probation manpowermay command, reductions in this case might be concentrated on the capital expenditure plans.     These envisage policecapital spending growing by 40 per cent in the period toover  50 million; prisons by 55 per cent to nearly  45million; and courts by nearly 147 per cent to naarly  45million.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEducation:    165 million8.     The total net reduction now suggested in 1978-79of  165 million, for Great;Britain, comprises mainlyreductions on account of reduced demographic forecasts of the number of children entering education, and ofa stringent reappraisal by the Departments of thenumbers of students expected to stay at school after16, and to seek higher education.     The reductionsuggested also includes about  29 million with aview to containing the subsidy on school meals toroughly its recent level, by increasing the charge for school meals by 3p in 1975 and in each subsequent year (instead of, as assumed in the survey figures, by 5p in 1975 and 1p and 2palternatively in subsequent years).liWithin the net total, a reduction by about  48million in 1978-79 in capital expenditure on higher education would be only partially offset%     &apos; I!    -    Illby upward adjustments for special and further education and somewhat enlarged provision for replacement of old schools.CONFIDENTIAL.
CONFIDENTIALPersonal social services:    25 million9.     Local authorities have been expanding their current expenditure on personal social services at a very high rateover the past four years, averaging nearly 11 per cent, witha particularly rapid unplanned,escalation on concessionaryfares.     The Survey programmes imply that rapid expansionwould continue, though at a rather lower rate, averagingrather more than 6 per cent over the next four years.     a lower growth rate would still permit significant improvements in standards and relieve pressure on the long-stay sectionsof the health service, where growth rates have been much lower.     At 1 per cent a year less than the survey assumed,the increase in the level between 1974-75 and 1978-79 wouldbe reduced by about  25 million but would still exceed  100million. (*Overseas services and aid:    10 million10.   Many of the largest developing countries face severethreats to their living standards by the action of the arab states in forcing up the price of oil.     National programmes are d aiued by this problem, and the solution to it will haveto be sought by other means.     At the same time we ourselvesface the problem of financing a huge continuing deficit onour balance of payments; and aid is more costly   for ,  tothe balance of payments than most other forms of public expenditure.     We have, however, subscribed to internationalaid.    A balance would be struck by a programme of aid inthe traditional form which would rise at a modest rate,provided that the path is drawn to secure the best

A possible pattern would produce a level in 1978-79 - 10 million lower than the Survey showed.Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure:    50 million11.   Mainly from railway modernisation.12.   All these illustrative reductions would amount to  4-90wmillion in expenditure terms for 1978-79.     Allowing foroffsets for family endowment and supplementary benefitdisregards, the net effect is about  315 million in demand terms.
