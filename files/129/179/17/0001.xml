this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-C(74) 107 COPY NO      78II September 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1974-75 TO 1978-79Memorandum by the Secretary of State for social ServicesHEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services.        In my discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Istressed the need for additional provision of  100 million over that provided for 1975-76 in the PESC Report to meet the urgent needs ofthe health services.    The policy changes already agreed and theproposals put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (see Table 3 ofC(74) 100) would provide some  30 million of the additional money I need.But this leaves a gap of  70 million both in 1975-76 and the remainingyears of the Survey period which must be filled if we are to avoid therisk of a virtual collapse of the health service.background.        The broad background to these needs may be summarised asfollows -i. It is widely accepted that the National Health Service (NHS)has been seriously under-financed for many years. There arestill large areas of the country where standards are unacceptablylow and which must have additional money if they are to be ableto provide anything like an adequate service. The average ageof our hospitals is 70 years and fully 20 per cent of these were built before 1861.ii.    My Department, more than any other, suffers from the pressures of a growing and ageing population.    Total population is growing at about 0. 2 per cent each year but the proportion of people aged 65 years and over is increasing much more rapidly(by 100, 000 or 1. 6 per cent a year).    New accommodation and services must be provided for the elderly both in hospitals andin the community and the cost of these is very heavy.1
iii. There are steadily increasing pressures on the NHS asa result of the public demand for better health care (not only as regards treatment but in the field of preventive medicine)and the desperate need to improve conditions in services forthe mentally ill and handicapped.iv. Cuts in expenditure made by our predecessors exacerbatedthe serious problem of arrears of maintenance of buildings,plant and equipment.    In 1972 the backlog was estimated atover  100 million and unless we do something about it this will grow over the Survey period to even larger proportions.Present PESC figures leave no margin to deal with thesearrears.    In addition, as a result of new legislation, we haveto undertake another  100 million of work to provide for fireprecautions in hospitals that will meet the standards now set.v.     The NHS is in process of radical re-organisation and thenew Health Authorities have to meet the unavoidable cost ofthis from their already strained resources.CAPITAL NEEDS3.        As the recent Report of the Expenditure Committee has underlined,the cuts imposed by our predecessors (which we have maintained) on capital programmes mean that we are faced with a virtual moratoriumon starts of major new schemes for both 1975-76 and 1976-77 an(* very seriously reduced expenditure on smaller projects of great significancein social terms eg homes and hostels for the elderly and mentally illand handicapped.    I need  30 million extra capital for hospitals alone and the amount allotted to my Department in the construction industrypackage will fill only a minor part of this gap:  only enough in fact toallow us to maintain the planned expansion of the Health Centreprogramme.    Even before the capital cuts our programme of new district general hospitals would only have reduced the average age of hospitals to50 years by the end of the century.    We cannot make any progress inreplacing the asylums and infirmaries of the last century if theadditional funds that I am seeking cannot be provided.REVENUE NEEDSII&apos;&apos;4. The proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer include provision for carrying forward excess expenditure on health servicestransferred this year from local to central government but this togetherwith the small increase provided in the PESC Report will give littleopportunity for any improvement after allowance has been made for therevenue consequences of capital schemes started in past years.    Indeed,there is a real danger that in many areas the revenue allocations thatwe can provide will involve a reduction of standards.2
SUMMARY5. Thus, against the background of past neglect, we must haveadditional resources for the health services if they are not to come to a&quot;grinding halt&quot; as forecast in the Report of the Expenditure Committee.In view of the overall economic constraints I have resisted any temptation to overstate my cases.    My estimate   that the NHS needed an increaseof  100 million over the figure given in the PESC Report was a modestone.    Part of this has been provided but unless I can have the balanceof about  70 million that I need we shall enter a period of risk in whichat best the health services will only be able to &quot;make do and mend&quot;.We have said that we are committed to the concept of a comprehensiveNational Health Service and pledged ourselves to revise and expand it.If we do not honour this pledge we shall both lose the confidence of the NHSstaff and our credibility in the eyes of the public.FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND FAMILY ENDOWMENT6.        The Chancellor proposes (C(74) 100):-a. That the increase in family allowances (FAM) next year should be limited to 35p/25p (bringing the current rates to a level of  1. 25 for all children after the first).b. That the introduction of a scheme of family endowmentproviding improved cash allowances (including allowances for first and only children) in replacement of child tax allowances should be deferred for a year to April 1977,and that the new rates of allowance should be limited to 2.12 with residual child tax allowance.7.        I have already reduced my bids for social security for  1976-77from  734 million, (including  275 million for Family Endowmentat the  2.40 rate) to  415 million.    Any further reduction would bedisproportionate in relation to our social objectives.8.        Family allowances have not been increased since 1968.    Ipropose an increase in April 1975 of 60p a week for the second childand 50p for the third and each later child, resulting in a uniform rateof  1. 50.    I then propose the introduction of a fully-fledged family endowment scheme in April 1976, if we possibly can, with a uniformrate of  2.40 a week for each child - including the first, who does not qualify for a family allowance at the moment.    This rate of  2. 40 willbe enough to replace present child tax allowances (CTAs) completely,together with family allowances of  1. 50.3
9. I do not think we can defend the deferment of the scheme beyond1976, if that can possibly be achieved.    We&apos;are already under pressure to provide some form of benefit for the first child in the family; andthe coalition of pressure groups working for this will be very vocal inthe next Election.    And we should beware of exaggerating the economy to be gained from deferment.    In the absence of family endowment,even assuming that FAM could be held at my proposed 1975 level of 1. 50, it seems unrealistic to assumeithat child tax allowances couldremain unchanged in 1976.    On PESC price assumptions over the2 years 1974-75 and 1975-76, the cost of increasing CTAs by only halfthe increase in prices would be  95 million.10.       As to a reduction in the rate, I consider that there is no scopeat all for a lower increase than my proposal for a FAM rise of 50-60pin 1975.    Even this rate would fall short of maintaining the October1968 FAM values.    With a FAM increase of 50-60p a reduction in the 2. 40 rate   eg to  2. 20 (and it could not be less) saving  60 million would mean, if substantial numbers of ordinary taxpaying families werenot to be worse off even in cash terms, the retention of residual CTAs fOrsome five million children aged over 11.    This would cushion thereduction to  2. 20 for taxpayers where they have older children.    Nosuch cushion will be available to those too poor to pay tax, the verypeople we aim to help, who will stand to lose the full 2Op per child.And for taxpayers, who form the great majority of families, even atthe  2.40 rate, it is likely that inflation will seriously erode and insome cases completely eliminate the gains they would otherwise havemade from family endowment.11.      A rate of  2. 20 or  2.12 with residual CTAs has the furtherstructural disadvantage that it subsequently becomes more expensiveto introduce Family Endowment at a uniform rate to subsume the residual CTAs without making appreciable numbers of families worse off.    This dilemma could only be avoided by reproducing the agerelationship between CTA rates in age related Family Endowment.This is not a welcome constraint,    There are other possibilities fordifferential rates besides age relationships and other age relationshipsbesides those which obtain for CTAs.12.      A rate of  2. 40 is less vulnerable than  2. 20 or  2.12 toConservative references to their proposed child credit rate of theirTax Credit Scheme.    This on the Green Paper structure would be 2. 70 now, and well over  3 by 1976.    Although it would not be difficultto show that their tax credit scheme would be so expensive as to be quite irrelevant now, it is desirable to minimise the impact of this    Icriticism.4
13.       Either deferment or a lower rate would cause serious difficultyin relation to pressure for a Finer benefit for one-parent families iI was only able to drop this item for this year&apos;s FESC on the under-standing that we were to make worthwhile progress bn family endowment.14.       Finally, I am bound to suggest that if further economy is needed,it can be effected by making Family Endowment worth the same for alltaxpayers by abolishing CTAs against higher rate tax.    I understandthis would save at least  35 millipn.    While I understand the desirenot to deprive higher-rate taxpayers of the extra value which CTAs atpresent represent for them, it is far from clear that this desire shouldreceive priority in the extremely straitened circumstances in which weare now having to plan our social policies.B A department of Health and Social Security11 September 19745
