BETTER PENSIONSFully Protected Against InflationPROPOSALS FOR A NEW PENSIONS scheme presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Social services by Command of Her MajestySeptember 1974LONDONMAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE26p netHERCmnd. 5713
FOREWORDI have called this White Paper &quot;Better Pensions&quot; because that is precisely what our proposals will &quot;achieve. Our policy on pensions is to secure betterbenefits for all pensioners, present and future, those in occupational schemes and those without such cover.The proposals set out in this White Paper will fulfil the Governmenfs pledge tobring to an end the massive dependence on means-tested supplementary benefit which is the sad hallmark of old age today. The new scheme willprovide better pensions in retirement, widowhood and chronic ill-health.It will bring security at the end of working life to the many millions who atpresent lack the advantages and cover of a good occupational scheme.In return for wholly earnings-related contributions the scheme will provideearnings-related pensions fully protected against inflation at all times. This isone of the most precious assets of the scheme. Moreover,, we have designed our proposals to help particularly the lower paid.The new scheme will operate in partnership with well-founded occupational schemes, whose members will gain considerable benefit from the new arrange-ments. Terms for contracting out of the state scheme are as simple as they canbe made and the pensions which members of contracted out schemes will receive will be at least as good as those of full members of the state scheme.The pension entitlement of the individual earner will build up each year. Butwe cannot wait 40 years and a full working life for mature benefits. To do so would be to neglect the needs of those in mid-career or beyond. So the scheme will mature in 20 years. The pensions of those reaching pension age thereafterwill be based on their best 20 years of earnings. This is a completely new featurewhich will ensure justice for manual and salaried workers alike. It will helpyounger workers and those hit by unemployment, ill health or disablement.It will enable women to draw the fullest advantage from their contributiqnsduring their working years.We are proposing to introduce earnings-related invalidity benefits, whichhave been requested for so long by groups representing the disabled.- i iFor too long women have been treated as second class citizens in pension and benefit provision. The White Paper on equality for women sets out the government&apos;s proposals for securing equal status. An important part of thispolicy is equality of treatment in the field of pensions and other benefits. Theproposals in this White Paper fulfil that policy.All women stand to gain under the new scheme whether working inside or outside the home, whether single, married or widowed. The working wife willbe assured of a decent pension in her own right. She can achieve a full pensiondespite years spent away from paid employment while bringing up her family.Women looking after elderly relatives can similarly benefit. The widow mayinherit 100% of her husband s pension entitlement and can add to this by her
own contributions at work. The older widower and the widower who has hadto be supported by his wife because of prolonged sickness can inherit herpension rights.We have sought to make this scheme as simple as its social objectives allowand to make it comprehensible both in terms of contributions and benefits.&apos;The scheme also has the great merit of flexibility, which will enable successive governments to respond to the developing aspirations of men and women infuture years.The new pension scheme should be seen as an extension of the policy underwhich existing pensions have been raised this summer to  10 for a single person and  16 for a married couple, with an undertaking that these basicpensions will be uprated annually in line with earnings. With the introductionof the new scheme, it will be the new base level pension which will be ofparticular value to existing pensioners with low incomes.The cost of the commitments in this White Paper has been very carefully considered in relation to the capacity of the country to support it. The develop-ment of adequate pensions such as we propose must, however, imply a growingcost to be met by the rest of the community through contributions and taxation.   .The Government are confident that the country will be ready to pay that cost.So I invite the fullest public debate and discussion on these proposals for better pensions, confident that they will provide real security in retirement,widowhood and chronic ill-health.BARBARA CASTLE

CHAPTER 1THE FUTURE SHAPE OF PENSIONS1. For 10 years successive Governments have considered plans for pensionsreform. One element of the problem to be tackled has always been clear. Thatis the failure of the present combination of a mainly flat-rate national insurance pension and of occupational pensions of sharply varying quality and limitedcoverage to guarantee all pensioners more than a low standard of living, or toprevent large numbers of them from having to rely on means-tested supple-mentary benefits. Occupational pensions schemes have removed the threat ofpoverty in old age from a minority of pensioners and offer the promise of adequate pensions to greater numbers in future, but they are still far fromuniversal in coverage and they still i leave gaps in the provision of adequatebenefits for chronic ill-health and widowhood.2. There is a second factor which has become of Overriding significance inrecent years inflation. If people are to face retirement without continualanxiety about money, they must have a guarantee that the value of their pension rights will be maintained both while they are being built up during working life and after the pension has been put into payment. Indeed, so changed is thesituation even in the last three years that no proposals coming forward todaycould be regarded as realistic without such a guarantee.Dependence on supplementary benefit3. Of about 8 million retirement pensioners, some 2 million or about 25%--also receive a supplementary pension. Widows form the poorest group among them and in their case the proportion receiving a supplementary pension is 60%.In addition it is estimated that there may be a further million old people entitledto some supplementary pension, although usually quite a small amount, who do not claim it. These figures reflect the paradox that the British social assistanceprogramme is one of the best in the world, while British contributory benefitshave fallen behind those of most other advanced industrial nations.4. It is wrong that such large numbers of pensioners should have to rely on supplementary benefit. Men and women understandably resent the fact thatafter a lifetime&apos;s work and service in the community they have to rely on this type of assistance in order to keep themselves out of poverty. Furthermore, everyclaim for such benefits requires detailed personal investigation of the particular circumstances of an individual or family group. This calls for a high degree of human sympathy and tact. The staff of the Supplementary Benefits Commissioncope well with this very difficult task, but it is not one which can. be satisfactorilyundertaken for massive numbers of people. There will always be a few whoseexceptional circumstances will put them in need of a &quot;safety net&quot; provision1;It is quite another matter when millions of people need supplementary benefitafter a normal working life.
The present role of occupational pensions5. For some people a reasonable income in old age is already guaranteed bytheir membership of an occupational pension scheme. Such schemes are sociallyvaluable and economically important. They represent an important element of personal savings and investment. But for a number of reasons they do not-and cannot cover the whole working population against all the contingenciesfor which long-term benefits are needed. They provide benefits at widely varyinglevels, ranging from pensions of two-thirds of final salary on retirement downto very small sums. Although the best of them manage in practice to give fullprotection against inflation to pensions in payment, many fall short of this.Some provide no such protection at all. Coverage is far better for staff than formanual workers and for men than for women. Though provision for widowhoodis becoming more common and has been improved in recent years, manywidows inherit less than a half of their husband&apos;s pension and some get nothingat all. Most occupational schemes do not yet make adequate provision for the member forced into premature retirement through ill-health. The arrangementsfor the preservation of pension rights when someone leaves a pensionableemployment are still incomplete, so that, in general, an employee who divideshis working life between a number of jobs is less well provided for than one who stays with a single employer. As occupational pension schemes are set upvoluntarily, however, the Government cannot compel all schemes to conform tothe standards of the best. If the state wishes to set standards it must take the lead through its own pension scheme.The Governmenfs answer6. The Governmenfs first major decision on taking office was to raise the weeklyflat-rate national insurance pension of  7-75 for a single person and  12-50 fora married couple, set only nine months earlier, to the present figures of  10 and 16 and to undertake that these new rates would maintain their relationship with the general level of earnings.7. This was a first step towards the new pension scheme and as such forms part of the Governmenfs developing policy on pensions. With the introductionof the new scheme, the position of existing pensioners will be further reviewed in the light of the development of the economy.8. Future pensioners will qualify for higher pensions under the Governmenfsnew scheme. These will be earnings-related, reflecting the fact that pensions are deferred pay. For everyone with a complete insurance record, the newpensions will begin at a base level which will be the amount of the single flat^ratepension in force when the scheme is introduced. In 1974 terms this would be 10 a week. Up to the base level, the new pension will represent a   for  replacement of earnings. On earnings above that level, it will build up over20 years so as then to provide in addition a quarter of average earnings betweenthe base level and an earnings ceiling of seven times the base level,  70 a week in 1974 terms. For example:If a man with national average earnings of  40-92 a week (the October 1973figure for men in manufacturing and certain other industries) had been
contributing to the scheme for the last 20 years, at the corresponding pointon the earnings scale, the weekly pension payable today would have been  17-73 (single) (ie  10+25% of  30-92) 23-73 (married) (ie as above, +E6 for his wife).If he had been earning  70 a week (the ceiling level) the weekly pension payable today would have been  25 (single) (ie  10+25% of  60) 31 (married) (ie as above, -f 6 for his wife).In both cases the married pension rate could be increased if the wife had beenearning. (See Table B in Chapter 2).The combination of a 100% return on earnings up to a base level and a further,though lower, earnings-related return on earnings above the base level has theeffect of weighting the scheme in favour of the low paid. It also has the advantageof flexibility since improvements in the base level pension will be incorporatedautomatically in the total pension.9. Table A illustrates the scale of pensions which the new scheme will provideat different earnings levels when it is mature. The examples, in the table and throughout this White Paper are necessarily in 1974 terms, but annual increases in the flat-rate pension will mean that the new scheme starts from a higherbase level than  10 and that in cash terms its benefits will be correspondinglyhigher than those shown here.TABLE AFULL PENSIONSContributors weekly earnings	Single person&apos;s pension	%of earnings	Married couple&apos;s pension (on husbancTs record alone)	%.of earnings 	 	0/ /o	 	%20	12-50	62	18-50	9230	15-00	50	21-00	7040	17-50	44	23-50	5950	20-00	40	26-00	5260	22-50	38	28-50	4870	25-00	36	31-00	4410. Full details of these new pensions are given in Chapter 2. In particular the new scheme will: (i) ensure that during working life the pension rights built up, both inthe state and contracted out schemes, will retain their relationship to earnings levels generally and that pensions in payment are fullyprotected against inflation; 11(ii) guarantee a woman the same pension as a man with the same earningsrecord;
(iii) provide the first full pensions after 20 years of paying the newcontributions, rather than after a working life-time of 40 years ormore;(iv) cover death and long-term sickness by widowhood and invaliditypensions on terms similar to those for retirement; and(v) ensure that the tests which have to be satisfied by contracted out schemes are such as to secure adequate provision for the members of those schemes and for their widows.11. The Government considered whether the reserve pension scheme forwhich provision was made by the previous administration under the social security Act 1973 should be introduced and later adapted to serve the objectives set out in this White Paper. This proved not to be practicable. Itwas inherent in the structure of the reserve pension scheme, based, as it was,on money purchase principles, that older contributors would get a lowerpension return for their contributions than would younger members ofthe scheme for the same contributions. Thus older contributors could notbe provided with an adequate pension except by imposing total contributionrates upon them and their employers which would be wholly excessive. nor could a money purchase scheme provide any guaranteed protection against inflation for the pensions put into payment under it.12. The reserve pension scheme therefore, if introduced, would have beenmerely a temporary expedient designed to operate only until the governments own plans could be brought into effect. The Government decided that, fromthe social standpoint, the reserve pension scheme was not of sufficient value tojustify requiring employees and their employers to contribute to it. It wasalso clear that the interests of those concerned with occupational schemes would be better served by not introducing the reserve scheme. To have done so would have meant a period of great administrative confusion, as the presentcontracting out arrangements were replaced first by those associated with thereserve pension scheme and then by those appropriate to the Governmcnfsown pensions plan. There were however other features of the 1973 legislation notably the replacement of the present flat-rate and graduated contributions bya fully earnings-related contributions structure which were wholly acceptable to the Government. These are to come into force, as planned, in April 1975.13. The Governments proposals follow. They aim at providing adequateincome during retirement, widowhood and invalidity, with a minimum ofdisturbance for good occupational schemes. The Government are confident that these proposals will be widely welcomed by those who share a common concern for better pensions and that it will be possible to proceed, throughearly legislation, to their speedy implementation.
CHAPTER 2THE NEW SCHEMEProtection against inflation14. It is a vital element of the new scheme that the pension rights built up and payable under it are fully protected against inflation. A major defect of thepresent graduated scheme is that it does not offer such protection. Neitherdid the proposed reserve pension scheme of the previous administrationguarantee it. Under the new scheme the value of earnings-related pension rights -will be maintained during working life by revaluing past earnings in line with the growth in earnings generally. Thus the amount earned in any yearby an average earner will be revalued so that it represents average earnings inthe year in which he retires. Once a pension has been awarded the base levelelement will be increased so as to maintain its relationship with current earningslevels and the remainder will receive full protection against price increases.Graduated pension15. Under the new scheme price protection will also extend to graduated pensions that are already in payment and to the rights which have been built up under the existing graduated scheme, which now gives no such protection.Retirement pension(i) The Pension Formula ij16. The same pension formula will apply under the new scheme to men andwomen contributors. Once the scheme is mature (see paragraph 18) pensionswill be based on the earnings on which contributions have been paid in theindividual^ best 20 years. The weekly pension will represent  1 for every  1 of average weekly earnings up to a base level and a quarter of the earnings betweenthe base level and a ceiling. The initial base level will be set at the amountof the single flat-rate pension in force when the scheme is introduced and the ceiling will be seven times that amount. This means, in 1974 terms, a baselevel of  10 a week and a ceiling of  70. These figures are used throughout this white Paper for illustrative purposes. No full contributor, however low hisearnings, will get less than the base level pension.17. Examples of entitlement when the scheme is fully mature have alreadybeen given in Table A in Chapter 1, which shows the position where the wifehas not been working. Table B, expressed like Table A in 1974 terms, illustrates the full pensions payable where both the husband and the wife have contributed,one having had the earnings set out in the first column and the other having had those in the second column.(ii) The Maturity Period18. Pensions at the levels quoted in Tables A and B will be awarded after thescheme has been in operation for 20 years. Progress towards the new schemerates will be made year by year. For each year of the new scheme a contributorwill get 1J% of his average earnings between the base level and the ceilinguntil those who have contributed for 20 years qualify for the full 25%. Asregards pension on earnings up to the base level, entitlement under the new scheme will combine with earlier records of contributions so as to produce the  10 pension for the fully paid-up contributor. Tables C and D, also expressed
in 1974 terms, give examples of pensions payable to those retiring during thematurity period. These tables, like Table A, illustrate married couples&apos; pensions which are derived from the husband&apos;s contributions alone.TABLE BFULL PENSIONS FOR A MARRIED COUPLE BOTHFORMERLY EARNINGWeekly earnings of husband (or wife)	Weekly earnings of wife (or husband)	Pension of husband (or wife)	Pension of wife (or husband)	Joint pension	Joint pension as a % of total earnings .&quot;,.	 	 	 	 	%20	15	12-50	11-25	23-75	6830	15	15-00	11-25	26-25	5840	20	17-50	12-50	30-00	5050	20	20-00	12-50	32-50	4660	30	22-50	15-00	37-50	4270	30	25-00	15-00	40-00	40TABLE CPENSION AFTER FIVE YEARSContributors weekly earnings	Single person&apos;s pension	%of earnings	Married couple&apos;s pension	%of earnings 	 	%	 	%20	10-62	53	16-62	8330	11-25	37	17-25	5740	11-87	30	17-87	4550	12-50	25	18-50	3760	13-12	22	19-12	3270	13-75	20	19-75	28TABLE DPENSION AFTER TEN YEARS			Married	Contributors	Single person&apos;s	%of	couple&apos;s	%of weekly earnings	pension	earnings	pension	earnings 	 	%	 	%20	11-25	56	17-25	8630	12-50	42	18-50	6240	13-75	34	19-75	4950	15-00	30	21-00	4260	16-25	27	22-25	3770	17-50	25	23-50	34(///) Pensions for Married Couples19. A pensioner who has a wife under 60 will as at present be entitled to anincrease of his pension for her and the pension will become hers when shereaches 60. At present the rate of this pension is  6 and Tables C and D assume that it is in payment. Where a married woman has contributed under the new scheme she will receive either the  6 or her own base level entitlement, whichever is the higher. But in any case her pension on earnings above the base level willbe payable in addition.
(iv) 20 Best Years20. Calculating the pension on the best 20 years will improve pension ratesby allowing moderate or poor years to be left out of account. However, it isnot intended that people who have only 20 years&apos; contributions, or not many more, should do as well as, or better than, those who belong to the scheme fora life time. Full benefit will, as now, depend on keeping up membership of thescheme in a high proportion of the possible years. Pensions will be reducedwhere this condition is not met. However, the pension rights of people who areunemployed or sick and credited with earnings or people who in specifiedcircumstances remain at home to look after children or sick or elderlydependants, will be protected against the effects of this membership rule(see paragraph 44).(v) Pension Age and Increments21. The present pension ages of 65 for men and 60 for women will be retained,because of the cost that would be involved both for the economy and thescheme in lowering the pension age for men. The retirement condition and earnings rule will remain but the level at which the earnings rule affects pensionswill continue to be reviewed regularly. Anyone who defers retirement beyondnormal pension age will increase his pension by 61% for each year it is forgone.Contributions will cease to be payable by people who remain at work afterpension age, though their employers will continue to pay.(vi) The Contracted Out22. Members of contracted out occupational pension schemes, who will payable reduced rate of contribution (see paragraph 37), will rely on their occupational schemes for a substantial part of their retirement pension entitlement. This is described in more detail in Chapter 3.Widow&apos;s pension(/) The Pension Formula23. The widow&apos;s full pension and the personal rate of widowed mother&apos;allowance are at present at the flat rate of  10. Under the new scheme theywill be replaced by earnings-related pensions. These will comprise the wholeof the single rate of retirement pension which the husband was receiving whenhe died, or, where the husband died before reaching retirement age, a pensioncalculated on his earnings in his best 20 years. If he had been insured for fewer than 20 years, earnings will be credited to him at the base level in the yearsrequired to make up 20.(ii) Widows under 6024. The pensions described in the last paragraph will become payable aftersix months of widowhood. During that first period of widowhood a widow&apos;allowance, including an earnings-related supplement, will as now be payableat a preferential rate. When widow&apos;s allowance ceases, the full pension will beavailable to a widowed mother, or to a woman who is over 50 when widowedor when her children grow up. A woman who is between 40 and 50 whenwidowed, or when her children grow up, will receive an earnings-related pensionreduced according to her age at that time.
(iii) Retirement Pension for Widows25. From age 60, or on retirement if this is later, a widow irrespective ofher age at widowhood will be able to add 25% of her own average earnings above the base level to the pension she draws on her husband&apos;s record, subjectto the scheme&apos;s maturity provisions (see paragraph 26) and to the limitationthat her total pension may not exceed the maximum payable on one record.Table E shows the full pensions which will result from this proposal when thescheme has matured.TABLE ERETIREMENT PENSION PAYABLE TO A WIDOWHer weekly earnings	Late husband&apos;s weekly earnings	Full pension on his earnings	Addition on her earnings	Total retirement pension 	 	 	 	 15	20	12-50	1-25	13-7520	20	12-50	2-50	15-0030	30	15-00	5-00	20-0040	40	17-50	7-50	25-00 (Maximum)50	60	22-50	2-50	25-00 (Maximum)(immaterial)	70	25-00	nil	25-00 (Maximum)(iv) The Maturity Period26. As explained in paragraph 18, the first full pensions under the scheme will be paid to those who qualify after contributing for 20 years. Durjng thescheme&apos;s first 20 years, a widow over 60 and retired may add to the pension on her husband&apos;s record 1 \% of her own average earnings between the base leveland the ceiling for each year of such earnings.(v) The Contracted Out27. Members of contracted out occupational pension schemes will pay a reduced level of contributions (see paragraph 37) and will rely on their occupa-tional pension schemes for a part of their widowhood cover, as described inmore detail in Chapter 3.New benefits for widowers28. An important new proposal is the recognition of the financial needs ofwidowers. A man over 65 when his wife dies will have his retirement pensionrecalculated on the same basis as the retirement pension his widow would have got if he had died first see paragraphs 25 and 26. For example, if a husbandhas a pension of  15 including  5 related to earnings above the base level andhis wife has a pension of  13 including  3 related to earnings above the baselevel, the survivor will receive a pension of  18, whether it is the husband or the wife.29. The scheme also recognises the needs of a widower under retirement age who is ill when his wife dies. He will have a right to an invalidity pensioncalculated on her earnings record if it is better than his own.
Invalidity pension(/) The Pension Formula30. The existing invalidity pension is at a flat rate. This will be replaced byan earnings-related pension based on the claimants best 20 years of earnings.It will comprise the base level pension plus, when the scheme is mature, a quarter of his average earnings between the base level and the ceiling. Where theclaimant has not contributed for 20 years, he will receive the base level pensionplus 1 % of his average earnings between that level and the ceiling for eachyear of contributions.31. Invalidity allowance is an addition to invalidity pension and depends onthe age at which the claimant became1 sick. At present it is payable at threerates depending on whether his incapacity began before age 35, age 45, or before age 55 for women or 60 for men. It is proposed to ease these age condi-tions under the new scheme so that the highest rate will normally be availableto anyone who fell sick before haying built up a record of 20 years of earnings.This rate will become payable for incapacity starting before age 40 and the intermediate rate will cover incapacity beginning before age 50.(h) The Maturity Period32. Full pensions will become payable to those who qualify when the scheme has been in operation for 20 years. Until then progress towards the full rates will be made year by year as explained in paragraph 18.Finance33. The Government Actuary estimates, on the assumptions stated in his report (see the appendix), that a combined contribution from employers and employees of not more than 16 % of employees&apos; earnings up to the scheme&apos;sceiling would be required to finance the scheme in its early years if 8 million&apos;employees were contracted out. This contribution would compare with the14% combined contribution proposed for April 1975 under the Social&apos;SecurityAmendment Bill now before Parliament. It covers all national insurance benefits,industrial injuries benefits, a contribution to the national health service, and the employees contribution to the Redundancy Fund.34. The balance between the schemers income and expenditure will be affectedby the number of occupational scheme members who are contracted out.For example, a contribution of not more than 16% would be needed in theearly years if the number contracted out turned out to be 6 million, ratherthan 8 million. In either case, the rate would need to be increased by up to\% within 10 to 15 years and would reach about 181% m 30 years.35. It is not necessary to decide the initial contribution rate firmly at thispoint. This will depend on various factors, which will need to be reappraisednearer the time. But, for the present, it is thought right to illustrate the effects of the scheme by assuming an initial contribution of 16 % and the figures shown in the text of this White Paper are on that basis. Of a 161% contribution,if that proved appropriate, the employee would pay 6\% and the employer 10%.
(z) Employees&apos; Contributions36. For employees who earn more than the base level, contributions will be payable on all earnings up to a ceiling, which will be set at seven times the base level roughly \\ times average male industrial earnings. In 1974 terms,the base level and ceiling would be  10 and  70 a week respectively. Thoseemployees who earn less than the base level will continue to be covered for thebenefits of the industrial injuries scheme and they will be able to contributevoluntarily to maintain pension entitlement at the base level.37. Employees with earnings above the base level of  10 a week will paydifferent rates of contributions depending on whether or not they are membersof contracted out occupational schemes (see Chapter 3 below). On the assump-tion that the full 161% contribution proves to be appropriate, those who arenot members of contracted out schemes will contribute 6-1% of all their earnings up to the ceiling. Employees in contracted out occupational schemes will contribute at the 6\% rate on earnings up to the base level and at a lower rate on earnings between the base level and the ceiling, to take account of the factthat their occupational schemes will be providing a part of their pensions which would otherwise be provided by the state scheme. In paragraph 67 it issuggested that the total contribution reduction in respect of employees who arecontracted out would initially lie between 6% and 7% of the employee^reckonable earnings and a figure of 6\% is taken for illustrative purposes.It is assumed that the reduction would be divided between the employer and employee so that the employee is relieved of 2\% and the employer of the balance.In that event an employee&apos;s contribution of 6 % would come down, on earnings above the base level, to 4%.38. Table F gives examples, in 1974 terms, of the contributions which wouldbe payable on this basis at various earnings levels compared with thecontributions which the Social Security Amendment Bill proposes should comeinto force next April.TABLE FCONTRIBUTIONS FROM EMPLOYEES		New scheme	Weekly earnings	April 1975	Not contracted out	Contracted out 	 	 	 15	0-82	0-97	0-8530	1-65	1-95	1-4545	2-47	2-92	2-0570	3-79 .	4-55	3-05( 69 maximum			at April 1975)			(ii) Employers&apos; Contributions39. The pattern of contributions payable by employers will follow that of employees but will be set approximately 50% higher. Thus, on the assumptionthat the full 16 % contribution proves to be appropriate, an employer whoseemployees are fully within the state scheme will contribute 10% of their earnings
up to the ceiling. For contracted out employees an employer, on the assumptionsin paragraph 37, would pay 10% on earnings up to the base level and 6% on earnings between the base level and the ceiling. Table G illustrates thecontributions payable on this basis for employees at different earnings levels and compares them with those proposed from April 1975.TABLE GCONTRIBUTIONS FROM EMPLOYERS		New scheme	Employee^ weekly		Not contracted	. i&quot;.v;&apos; &quot;;[yvfiV:&apos;i-^S&amp;ik.earnings	April 1975   T,	out	Contracted out 	 	 	 15	1-27	1-50	1-3030	2-55	3-00	2-2045	3-82	4-50	3-1070	5-86	7-00	4-60( 69 maximum			at April 1975)			(///&apos;) Treasury Supplement40. The contribution from general taxation to the existing national insurancescheme amounts to about 18% of the total contributions paid by insured persons and employers. The same proportion will apply under the new scheme, but itwill be based on the contribution income which the National Insurance fund would receive if contracted out employees and their employers paid fullcontributions. This, together with the increase in the percentage rates ofcontributions as compared with those that are proposed from next April, means that Treasury support of the scheme will be substantially increased. On the assumptions stated above, it is estimated that in 1974 terms the Treasurysupplement will be  1,045 million in the first full year compared with the 865 million which would have been paid under the Social Security amendment bill.(iv) The Self-Employed ] j41.&apos; Self-employed people will pay a flat-rate contribution of  2-41 a week in1974 terms, those with low earnings being excepted from compulsory paymentas they are now. In return for their contributions, they will receive pension atthe base level. Those with profits br gains exceeding  30 a week in 1974 terms(three times the base level) will in addition pay an earnings-related contribution of 8% on the excess up to the  70 ceiling. This will spread the cost of self-employed people&apos;s benefits more fairly and will avoid the need for a substantially higher flat-rate contribution, which would have caused hardship to those withlower earnings.(v) The Non-Employed and Very Low Earners42. From April 1975 compulsory contribution liability will cease for people whose earnings are below a threshold level. This arrangement will be carried forward into the new scheme, where earnings below the base level will not carrycontribution liability. However, low earners and the non-employed will be
entitled to pay voluntary contributions of  1-90 a week in 1974 terms if they sowish, in order to maintain title to pension at the base level. Such contributionsmay also be paid by those who wish to repair gaps in their contribution record.Membership of the scheme43. As indicated in paragraph 20, pension entitlement will depend in part ona contributor maintaining membership of the scheme throughout working life.Membership will be maintained primarily by the payment of contributions asan employee or as a self-employed or non-employed contributor, or by receiptof widow&apos;s or invalidity pension or of short-term benefit for sickness orunemployment. People who qualify for any such pensions or benefits will be credited with earnings to the extent necessary to bring their records up to the base level.44. Membership of the scheme will continue, without any requirement to pay contributions, for a person who is at home looking after children, or who inspecified circumstances has to stay at home to care for an adult receiving aninvalidity or retirement pension or an attendance allowance. This provision will help those concerned to satisfy the membership test referred to in para-graph 20. It will be of particular value to the married woman or single parentwho remains at home while her children are growing up, as well as to singlewomen and others who are obliged to cut short their careers in order to look after aged relatives.Married women and widows45. The scheme will provide comparable treatment for men and women andin particular will include the following important features: (i) Men and women with the same earnings record will receive the samepensions. Contributions under the new scheme will in general secureextra pension, including extra pension for wives and widows inaddition to any pension on their husbands&apos; records.(ii) Pensions awarded under the new scheme will not be subject to the&quot;half-test&quot;, which is a rule of the present scheme whereby a married woman who has not paid contributions or been given credits in halfthe weeks between marriage and pension age cannot become entitledto a pension on her own contributions.&apos; (iii) Married women who are entitled to sickness or unemployment benefit will receive it at the same rate as other contributors. The discriminatorylower rate for married women will cease.(iv) Pension rights will be protected during periods spent at home looking after children or the old or sick.(v) Widowed mothers and most other widows will inherit the whole of the earnings-related pensions which their husbands had earned.(vi) A retired widow will be able to derive pension from her own earningsas well as those of her husband. A parallel provision will apply to menwho become widowers in retirement.The contribution option46. The Government are not prepared to perpetuate a system under whichmarried women and some widows who go out to work have a choice between
paying full contributions for inferior benefits and paying at a reduced rate whichconfers no benefit rights. In a scheme which provides earnings-related pensions in return for earnings-related contributions, working men and women should contribute on exactly the same basis, whether they are single or married.The existing married women&apos;s option should therefore be abolished but theGovernment recognise that, for large numbers of working wives who haveopted out of full contributions under the present scheme, the complete andabrupt withdrawal of their right to pay at the reduced rate would cause a sharp reduction in their take-home pay. The question therefore is how to bringabout equality in the new scheme in such a way that it serves the best interestsof the present and the future generations of married women and the community as a whole. %47. It is proposed that new entrants to the scheme should no longer havethe right to opt out of paying full contributions and thereby deprive themselves of the valuable new benefit rights which are being made available to them.At the same time they will be able to qualify for the same rates of sickness and unemployment benefit as men and single women with the same earnings,and they will not be subject to the &quot;half-test&quot; which prevents some marriedwomen from qualifying for a retirement pension on the&apos;ir own contributions.48. For the present generation of working wives the Government will initiatediscussions with organisations representing employers and workers and withother interested organisations as to the best way of phasing out the existing system. For them also, reduced rates of unemployment and sickness benefit and the &quot;half-test&quot; at age 60 will go. But the Government will also want toexamine the possibility that working wives should retain their right to opt outof cover for short-term benefits while coming into the scheme for retirement pensions and invalidity benefit. If, in the light of these discussions, this turnsout to be a generally acceptable and workable proposition the&apos;Governmentwill consider making this limited option available to new entrants also.49. No final decision has therefore been reached, but for illustrative purposes the scheme has been costed on the basis that married women who go out towork will be fully covered for long-term benefits but that there willi continueto be an option for short-term benefits. Table H shows, on the assumptionthat a married woman who did not seek cover for short-term benefits wouldhave her contribution reduced by lf%, how her contribution would compare with those proposed in the Social Security Amendment Bill 1974 for opted-outwomen from April 1975.TABLE HCONTRIBUTIONS FROM OPTED-OUT* MARRIED WOMEN		New scheme	Weekly earnings	April 1975	Not contracted out	Contracted out 	 	 	 15	0-30	0-71	0-5930	0-60	1-42	0-9245	0-90	2-14	1-2670	1-38	3-32	1-82( 69 maximum at			April 1975)			&quot;This means opted out of all benefits in column 2 but out of only short-term benefits incolumns 3 and 4. //
CHAPTER 3PARTNERSHIP WITH OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMES50. A crucial factor in determining the future pattern of pension provision is the existence in this country of thriving occupational pension arrangements.Occupational schemes provide their members with additional income in retirement, generally related to earnings including earnings in the higherranges which state provision does not cover. They may also be geared to theneeds of and agreements in particular industries or occupations. For example,they may provide for retirement at an earlier age than does the state scheme.And they make a valuable contribution to the economy through their encourage-ment of private saving by which employees put aside some of their current pay to provide for retirement.51. The Government ActuaryY Fourth Survey* of occupational pension schemes estimated that in 1971 about 2\ million retired people and \ millionwidows and other dependants were drawing occupational pensions. At thesame time, some 11 million members of the working population were in occupational schemes: The survey figures suggest that cover for an occupational pension was enjoyed by about one-half of the working population, including two-thirds of employed men, but only about one-third of employed women.An increasing number of members are likely to retire with an occupational pension equal to half pay. Some will have a lump sum in addition and the better schemes also provide a widow with a pension at half thS rate of her husband&apos;s entitlement.52. On the other hand the benefits in many cases are very modest. Althoughthe average occupational pension in payment in 1972 was over  6 a week,about 30% of the pensioners received less than  2 a week. Moreover there aregaps and weaknesses in the system. One of the most serious is the virtualabsence, outside the public sector, of any guarantee of inflation-proofing afteraward, even in good final salary schemes. The reason for this is clear enoughbut the problem remains. Some schemes do not provide any permanent cover for widowhood at all and many schemes do not provide a pension for widowswhose husbands have died before reaching retirement age, although lump sumsare frequently payable. Looking at schemes as a whole, they tend to cater more for men than for women and more for staff than for manual workers.53. The inferior position of manual workers is particularly striking. In 1971,despite the trend, towards occupational pensions based on final salary, mostof the 2J million members of manual workers&apos; schemes were in schemes offering a flat-rate pension for each year of membership and the amount of pensionearned each year was usually less than lOp a week a pension of less than  2after 20 years&apos; service. For. salaried staff, on the other hand, flat-rate schemes were almost unknown. Even final salary schemes for manual workers tendto provide pensions which represent a smaller proportion of earnings than dosimilar schemes for salaried workers.&quot;Occupational Pension Schemes 1971: Fourth Survey by the Government Actuary HMSO.
54. It has been a common feature of the pension plans of previous administra-tions that they have recognised the value of occupational pension schemes andsought to devise arrangements under which such schemes would share with thestate the responsibility for making provision for old age. These arrangements have attempted to accommodate the kind o&apos;f occupational pension schemes under which pension rights are built up in fixed money terms, ignoring changesin the value of money and the higher levels of earnings applying when the pension comes to be paid. Such schemes are of very limited value in a periodof inflation and cannot easily be fitted into the framework of a state scheme under which pension levels have to be judged against the living standardscurrent at the time when the pensions are in payment.55. Successive Governments have tried various ways of resolving the problem.The National Insurance Act 1959 provided that a part of the state scheme should operate in fixed money terms, so that very modest occupational schemescould be contracted out of it fully. The result of this is that the value of pensionunits earned in 1961, the first year; of the state graduated scheme, has now fallen by 50% and action is needed to prevent a further progressive decline in value(see paragraph 15). The National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill1969 chose instead a system of partial contracting out or &quot;abatement&quot;, underwhich occupational pension schemes had to provide a pension calculated infixed money terms which would have been deducted from a state pensionfully protected against inflation. Such an arrangement, under which the stateand occupational pensions were calculated on entirely different bases, was,/however, criticised by some commentators as both complex and artificial. TheSocial Security Act 1973 was more akin to the 1959 Act, with the effect that the limitations of modest occupational schemes were to be imposed upon thereserve pension scheme.56. If occupational pension schemes had not developed beyond such restrictedlevels and all that was at issue was the need to bring schemes of this characterinto partnership with the state provision, the right answer would probably,be to abandon the attempt to devise a satisfactory basis for contracting out andto encourage employers to supplement their employees&apos; state pensions throughprivate provision. This is the pattern of pension provision commonjy found in european countries. Such a system, which did not aim at any integrationbetween state and occupational pensions, would have the advantage of simplicity.It would avoid the risk that improvements in the state scheme might have to be ruled out because they could not be matched by the private sector and wouldmean that such requirements as Governments decided to lay on occupational schemes in general would not have to be supplemented by a further set of rules for contracted out schemes. In recent years, however, an increasing number of occupational schemes have adopted a &quot;final salary&quot; basis reckoning their members&apos; pensions by reference to the salary or wage earned over a short period prior to retirement. Between 1963 and 1971 the proportion of private sector schemes which adopted this basis rose from one in eight to nearly one intwo and by 1971 over 60% of private scheme members, as well as almost all of those in the public sector, were covered by such schemes.57. Of the 8 million people who were members of final salary schemes in1971 over 1\ million were earning pensions of at least one-eightieth of salaryeach year. Even allowing for the fact that not all salary may be pensionable,
many of them stand to retire on at least half-pay after 40 years&apos; service with oneemployer. Both in terms of quality and quantity, therefore, such schemes now take the lead in occupational pension provision and this makes possible anew and much more effective kind of partnership in which state and occupational schemes can combine in a simple and logical way to provide a total pensionthat is adequate and fully protected against inflation. Thus in future all employ-ees, throughout their working life, will have the opportunity of building upentitlement to a worth-while pension based on their earnings. Some will do thisentirely through the state scheme; others by a combination of state and occupational provision.Conditions for contracting out58. It will therefore be open to employers who have occupational schemes to contract their members out of a part of the state cover on the terms described below and to enter into partnership with the state in providing pensions forthem. It is proposed that members of contracted out schemes and their employersshall pay the full state contribution on earnings up to the base level and thatthey will be fully covered for personal pension at that level from the state .scheme. On earnings between the base level and the state scheme&apos;s ceiling, they and their employers will pay a reduced contribution. In return they will retainfull coverage under the state scheme for short-term benefits and invalidity pension and partial coverage for earnings-related widow&apos;s pensions (seeparagraph 62). For personal retirement pension on this band of earnings, theywill look to their occupational scheme but there will be arrangements to ensurethat at pension age their total pension is at least as much as if they had beenfully in the state scheme throughout and that they receive comparable protection against inflation after pension age.59. The Government propose that if it is to be used for contracting out anoccupational pension scheme will have to satisfy two main complementaryconditions in the provision of personal pensions. First, a scheme will have toprovide a pension based on final salary, or average salary revalued in line withthe growth in earnings generally, with an annual accrual rate equivalent to atleast one-eightieth of pensionable salary, as defined by the scheme. An accrualr^ate of eightieths corresponds to the 1J% a year at which state pension willbuild up on the upper band of earnings for men over 45 and women over 40at the commencement of the new scheme. It is also a formula which is alreadycommonly provided (or bettered) by final salary schemes. Schemes will beallowed to provide for accrual to cease after a member has qualified for apension representing half pensionable salary on retirement. Second, acontracted out scheme will be required to provide a pension which will be at least as much as the state scheme would have paid on the upper band of earnings in respect of the period of contracting out, had those same earnings been usedto calculate the state pension for that period. This amount, which is referredto as the guaranteed minimum pension, would be in practice the pension forwhich contracted out schemes would take over responsibility from the state scheme. After retirement its value will, as paragraph 65 describes, be guaranteed by the state.
60. The need for a &quot;minimum benefit rule&quot; of this kind arises because the calculation of pension entitlement from a contracted out scheme will notnecessarily follow that proposed for the state scheme. In the first place, manyoccupational pension schemes, unlike the state scheme, do not base their pensions on gross pay but on a lesser figure, whi6h may exclude earnings from such sources as bonuses and overtime. Secondly, a scheme member&apos;s careerpattern may, in some cases, mean that a pension based on final salary is not as favourable as one based upon earnings revalued in line with the growth in earnings levels generally, as the new state pensions will be. To meet this point,the minimum benefit rule will, where necessary, override a scheme&apos;s ordinaryrules so as to provide the guaranteed minimum pension.61. The amount of guaranteed minimum pension due to each scheme memberwill be notified to schemes in each case by the Department of Health and social Security. It is also envisaged that there will be arrangements wherebycontracted out schemes can be supplied with information about the current level of guaranteed minimum pension for particular scheme members beforepension age.Cover for widowhood62. The Government propose that each contracted out scheme will also berequired to satisfy two main conditions in the provision of widow&apos;s pensions.First, a contracted out scheme will have to provide widow&apos;s pensions based onfinal salary, or average salary revalued, with an annual accrual rate equivalentto at least one one-hundred-and-sixtieth of pensionable salary. Second, acontracted out scheme will be required to provide a widow&apos;s pension which isat least half the amount of the husband&apos;s guaranteed minimum pension at thetime of his death. The balance of the widow&apos;s pension will be made up by thestate scheme, so that the widow receives in total at least as much as if her husband had never been contracted out at all. This division of responsibilityfor widowhood cover is proposed partly because it is consistent with the present level of widowhood provision in good occupational schemes, but also because it makes possible a degree of flexibility in the type of benefit to be provided.63. It has been a common practice amongst occupational pension schemes,particularly in respect of death, in service benefits, to provide for widowhood bymeans of lump sum cover rather than pension cover. Whilst in general theGovernment consider that it is better for pensions rather than lump sumpayments to be provided, they are ready&apos;tb examine the possibility of lump sumpayments being accepted as an alternative to widow&apos;s pensions in some circumstances. The Government would welcome views, therefore, on whetherlump sum payments should be accepted as an alternative to the provision of a widow&apos;s pension by the occupational scheme on the basis set out in paragraph 62and, if that alternative were to be adopted, on the circumstances in which itshould be permitted.Increments for deferred retirement64. Where the drawing of the state pension is deferred beyond the normalretirement age of 65 (men) or 60 (women) it is proposed that increments shouldbe paid in recognition of the pension forgone in the form of an increase of
6 % each year pension is forgone (see paragraph 21). To ensure that contracted out employees will be no worse off if they work beyond retirement age,contracted out schemes will be required to make provision on a similar basis.Protecting the pension against inflation65. In the state scheme that part of the pension based upon earnings betweenthe base level and the ceiling will, as indicated in paragraph 14, receive fullprice protection. At present only occupational schemes in the public sectorguarantee price protection, although it is also achieved in practice by certainschemes in the private sector. In these circumstances the Government have thought it right not to require contracted out schemes to guarantee toprovide any increase in pensions after award. Instead the state scheme willprovide for the., guaranteed minimum pension on upper band earnings (see paragraphs 59 and 62) to be increased in line with prices. An alternative wouldhave been to require schemes to provide a fixed measure of post-award increase and for the balance to be paid by the state scheme. In the Governmenfs view a mixed arrangement of this kind would have been unnecessarily complex.66. A problem arises as to how the increases mentioned above should be paidto the pensioner. One way would be for the increases to be paid direct to the pensioner as part of the state scheme pension. The alternative would be to paythe increases through contracted out schemes as part of the occupational pension. This would be dependent upon it proving possible to devise satisfactoryadministrative arrangements for the payments through occupational schemes to be made and monitored. Subject to this, the payment of the increases throughthe occupational scheme has much to commend it, but the Government would welcome the views of those concerned with occupational pension schemes onthis point.Contribution reduction67. Members of occupational pension schemes who are contracted out will payable lower contribution to the state scheme on that account, as will their employers. The contribution reduction will reflect the cost of providing throughthe occupational scheme the pension forgone under the state scheme. Theamount of pension forgone in the state scheme for each year of service will vary according to the age of the employee at the start of the scheme. This is becausethe state scheme provides a higher rate of build-up in the initial years so as toenable full pensions to be paid to those who retire after 20 years in the scheme.It follows that the average cost of providing the pension forgone in the state scheme will fall over the years and so will the contribution reduction forcontracted out employees. The adjustment in the level of contribution reductionmight conveniently be made at five-yearly intervals. On each occasion that the contribution reduction is assessed the aim will be to set the reduction at a level which fairly reflects the cost of providing in a typical occupational scheme the pension for contracted out members which they would otherwise have receivedfrom the state scheme. This will involve striking an average cost as betweenemployees of different ages and, in conformity with their policy of moving towards pension arrangements which are the same for men and women, theGovernment propose that the same contribution reduction should apply for
both male and female employees. Preliminary calculations by the government actuary suggests that the reduction might lie initially between 6 % and 7% ofthe employee&apos;s earnings between the base level and the ceiling. A more detailed assessment will be needed before the initial amount is finally settled, but forpurposes of illustration a reduction of 6\% has&apos; been assumed, of which 2\%would go to reduce the employee&apos;s contribution.Preservation of pension entitlement68. Special provision will be needed to safeguard the pension entitlement of people who leave contracted out schemes before pension age or who are membersof schemes which cease to be contracted, out. At present there is no require-ment that the value of their pensions should be maintained until they are putinto payment. A crucial weakness of &quot;final salary&quot; schemes is that whenpension rights are preserved for an employee leaving before retirement age,they are based on his earnings at the time of leaving, which may be far belowgeneral levels of earnings by the time he retires. Some schemes provide for increases in preserved pensions but, except in the public sector, such increases are seldom more than a small fixed percentage, falling far short of increases in earnings and prices. This could well be a bar to&quot;the mobility of members ofcontracted out schemes. Members of the state scheme will have their earningsrevalued in line with the general movement of earnings no matter how many times they move from one firm to another. Clearly similar provision is needed for people in contracted out schemes who leave early. Contracted out schemes will therefore be required to ensure that the amount of a preserved pension ismaintained so that it is not less at any point than the amount of the guaranteedminimum pension for the relevant period of contracted-out service.Buying back employees into the state scheme69. Where members leave a contracted out scheme after only a short period,or where a scheme itself ceases to be contracted out, there will be arrangements -for the scheme to reinstate or &quot;buy back&quot; members into full state pension entitlement. The extent to which such a &quot;buy back&quot; facility should be available and the basis on which it should be costed will be matters on which theGovernment will be consulting those concerned with occupational pension schemes. But it is important to emphasise that this facility is seen by theGovernment as playing only a limited role. It will not form a major part of thenew arrangements, but will be designed only to safeguard the position ofmembers of schemes which cease to be contracted out schemes and of members who leave schemes after short service.Supervision of contracting out arrangements70. When a satisfactory basis has been settled for the relationship betweencontracted out schemes and the state scheme, it will be necessary for the ensuingarrangements to be supervised. The Government intend that the task of deciding whether an occupational scheme should be accepted as a contracted out schemeand of ensuring that a contracted out scheme has adequate financial backingshould be the responsibility of the Occupational Pensions Board, which was set up under the Social Security Act 1973.
Clearing house arrangements71. The Government see a need to examine the extent to which it may benecessary to set up &quot;clearing house&quot; arrangements of some kind for preservedpensions. This raises difficult problems and before coming to any definite conclusions the Government will wish to consult those concerned with *heoperation of occupational pension schemes.Public sector schemes72. Of the 11 million employees who are members of occupational pension schemes some 4 million are employed in the public sector, composed mainly ofcivil servants, teachers, firemen, police, staff of local authorities and thenational health service and employees of nationalised industries. Where theGovernment are the employer there will be full discussion with representativesof the staff, but, in general, the Government are confident that public sectorschemes can satisfy the conditions for contracting out of the state scheme andthat those conditions would provide a reasonable basis for such schemes to contract out.Summary73. The previous paragraphs have outlined a system of contracting out whichshould make it possible for good occupational pension schemes to continue tomake provision for their members in partnership with the state scheme, withthe minimum disruption to themselves. They will be required to provide anannual accrual rate equivalent to at least one-eightieth of pensionable salaryas defined by the scheme and to provide a pension (the guaranteed minimumpension) at age 65 for men and 60 for women which is at least as much asthe pension forgone in the state scheme on upper band earnings. They willalso be required to provide widow&apos;s pensions at half this rate of accrual, witha minimum pension of half the husband&apos;s guaranteed minimum. After awardthe state would ensure that these guaranteed minimum pensions were upratedin line with prices. Working out such an arrangement will inevitably involvethe study of many technical details and the Government are anxious to enterinto early consultation on these. But they are satisfied that, with goodwill onall sides, solutions can be found to any problems arising from the proposed arrangements in time for the necessary legislation to be introduced at anearly date.
CHAPTER 4IMPROVING OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMESGENERALLY74. The last chapter dealt specifically with the arrangements for occupational pension schemes which are contracted out. Those schemes which are not con-tracted out and whose members therefore remain fully within the state scheme will be able to continue alongside the state scheme with any adjustments foundnecessary to meet the new situation. This chapter deals with certain questionswhich will affect all occupational schemes whether or not they are contracted out.... .      ...... .......    ....J........... r    ....   ...  .     .. -H-. ....  y , .-^..1.Equal status for women 1175. The Government are committed to the principle that women should havea fair deal in occupational pension schemes. This.demands that schemes shouldnot discriminate against women in the rules for admission. It is proposedtherefore to legislate so that women have the same access to occupational schemesas men doing comparable work, so that they are admitted at the same age,after the same period of qualifying employment and on the same basis of//compulsion or choice. For this purpose, it is envisaged that the question whetheror not men and women are doing comparable work will be decided along thesame lines as similar questions under the Equal Pay Act, 1970.76. With this fundamental right to equal access secured the Government will go on to review in detail all the considerations relating to providing cover forwomen in occupational pension schemes to see whether there are other respects in which action is required to ensure that schemes do not discriminate againstwomen. The question of representation of women on boards of trustees and management of occupational pension schemes is referred to below (paragraph 81).Preservation and transferability77. The pension rights of those who leave their job before normal pension age after a minimum period of service must be preserved whether or not theyare contracted out. The Government have therefore judged it right to let thepreservation requirements of the Social Security Act 1973 come into force inApril 1975 as planned. In brief, these require that all occupational pension schemes should at least preserve or otherwise safeguard the pension rights which the early leaver has earned at the time he leaves. From any point ofview they represent a long overdue step forward. The Government appreciate that these requirements involve a considerable degree of adjustment and additional cost for many schemes and that the Occupational Pensions board have already devoted a good deal of effort to helping schemes to implement the requirements. The present need is to get the new system fully established and working smoothly. The Government will maintain a close watch on theway these requirements work in practice in order to see whether they need tobe supplemented.
78. The question of a system of universal transferability of pension rights hasbeen much discussed by those interested in occupational pensions. Most would agree that transferability is a desirable ideal. The difficulty lies in devisingworkable legislative requirements capable of universal application and whichare fair to all concerned. The Government have concluded they cannot dealwith the problem in the legislation now proposed.79. Protection of the value of pension rights earned and of pensions in paymentare vital issues which have already been discussed in this White Paper. TheGovernment are proposing through the minimum benefit rule to requireoccupational schemes which contract out to revalue, in line with the generalmovement of earnings, the accrued pension rights of early leavers for whichthe scheme has taken over liability from the state. The question whether thebalance of the pension rights of early leavers in contracted out schemes, or all such rights in schemes which are not contracted out, should be revalued is a difficult problem which the Government have under review. Increases ofpensions in payment do not create a special problem, because the preservationrequirements in the 1973 Act already require preserved pensions in payment tobe treated in the same way as full-term pensions.Questions referred to the Occupational Pensions Board80. There are several matters concerning the actual running of occupational schemes generally which in the Governmenfs view require special attention.First, the members must be able to feel sure that the benefits which they have earned in a scheme will in fact be forthcoming at the time they are due. Thisquestion of confidence becomes particularly important in an era of inflation.Second, there is evidence of concern about the degree of communication between those responsible for schemes and the members, many of whom have little knowledge of the pension schemes to which they belong. Third,the close relationship between the state and occupational schemes now proposedclearly ought to involve members of schemes themselves, either as individuals,or through their trade unions or representatives, in the administration andsurveillance of schemes.81. This is the background to the Governmenfs recent request to the occupational Pensions Board to consider and to report at an early date on three issues which are interrelated affecting all occupational schemes.They are as follows: (a) the financial security of the benefits which schemes have undertaken to provide, ie whether those benefits are adequately secured;(b) the provision of information about schemes, in particular aboutschemes&apos; finances, both to members and more generally; and(c) the possibilities of greater involvement of scheme members, includingwhether specific provision should be made for women to participate,in the running of their schemes, eg as trustees or on boards of management.In each case the Occupational Pensions Board have been asked to indicatewhether in their view legislation is appropriate and if so what it should cover.
CHAPTER 5CONCLUSION82. The Governmenfs proposals show the way in which adequate pensionprovision, such as is common in industralised countries abroad, but which most people in Britain have lacked for too long, can be achieved by a partnership between the state and good occupational schemes.Economic implications of the proposals83. The scheme will lead to a gradually increasing transfer of income andtherefore of claims on resources from the economically active section of thecommunity to those who have retired. This will be reflected in the gradualincrease in contribution rates referred to in paragraph 34. These contributions and the taxation required to finance the Exchequer^ share of the cost will mean that take-home pay of employees will be restricted and prices increased,compared with what would otherwise have been the case. But the full costs will accrue only gradually and will be far outweighed by the improvement in living standards generally resulting from economic growth.84. The main aim is to raise the standard of living of retirement pensioners,both in absolute terms and in relation to the rest of the population. national insurance pensioners already have a guarantee that they will share in.thegeneral improvement in living standards made possible by economic growth,now that the Government has undertaken a statutory obligation to upratethe basic retirement pension in line with earnings. The additional effect ofthe new scheme will be to raise pensioners&apos; living standards faster than those ofthe rest of the population.85. At present, the basic state pension, together with payments of supple-mentary pension and rent and rate rebates, provide pensioners with rather over one-third of the average income of the rest of the population counting a childas half an adult for this purpose. It is estimated that other sources provide afurther one-third so that the average pensioner income is now rather more than two-thirds of that of the rest of the population. There is, however, considerablevariation for individuals on either side of these average levels.86. By the time most pensioners are receiving benefit at the full new rates say we about 40 years&apos; time the average value of the national insurance pension,together with the minimum guaranteed pension provided by contracted outschemes, should have risen to over half the average income of the rest of thepopulation. Thus, if pensioners&apos; income from all other sources is still about one-third of the average income of the rest of the population, their total incomewill rise to over five-sixths of that average. This improvement will be concentrated on those who do not have an adequate occupational pension, and those whohave fewest resources outside their basic state entitlement.87. The pensioners&apos; share of total personal consumption is at present about10%. The new scheme will increase that share over the next 40 years or so by nearly one third to 13%. There will be a corresponding fall in the share going
to the working population which will be reduced by about 3% of total personal consumption. On any reasonable assumption about the rate of economic growth this will form a very small proportion of the improvement in living standards of the working population over this period.88. The Government recognise and attach importance to the contribution&apos;made through funded occupational schemes to savings. The amount of suchsavings has been estimated as being about  1,200 million in 1971 and it wouldseem likely that there will be some effect, at least at the outset, on these savings.The effect will depend on the numbers in occupational schemes which arecontracted out. However, the proposals for partnership with good occupational schemes are designed to enable those schemes to maintain or expand their contribution to savings.89. From the point of view of the individual contributor, the scheme impliessome redistribution of income from his years in work to his years in retirement.For the community as a whole, the redistribution must be within the total available at the time for personal consumption, as determined by the potentialsize of the total national product and by the claims of investment, public services and the balance of payments. Provided that adequate provision ismade for these claims, there should be no adverse effect on employment orproductivity, or on future economic growth.The way ahead90. The next step will be for the Government to discuss their proposals with representative organisations, including the TUC, the CBI and those concernedwith occupational pension schemes. Some features, particularly in the area of contracting out, have been deliberately left open and will not be settled until after the views of those affected are known. After taking account of views andcomments, the Government will present the new legislation as early as possiblein 1975. The aim will be to bring the new scheme into force as quickly aspossible and in any case no later than April 1978.91. This is the third pension plan to be put forward by a Government in thelast six years. It draws on the best features of each of the two previous plans and provides a firm foundation for the development of pensions fitted to theneeds of our time.
APPENDIXMEMORANDUM BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY ON the finances OF THE PROPOSALS1. This appendix reports on the cost of the proposals, which are described in detail in chapters 2 and 3 of the White Paper, and on the contribution rates required to support them. As under the present national insurance scheme, the rates of contribution underthe new scheme will be set from time to time at the levels required to produce the income which, together with the corresponding Treasury supplements, would broadly matchcurrent expenditure on benefits and costs of administration.2. In the earnings-related formula for calculating retirement, invalidity and widows&apos;pensions the base level will be fixed solas to produce a pension, on earnings up to this level, equal to the flat-rate pension in force when the new scheme is introduced.The extra cost of the new scheme will largely represent the cost of pensions calculated on earnings between the base level and the ceiling. Theexpenditure on these pensionswill, however, only build up slowly so that, as shown by the estimates given below,the additional outgo compared with the present scheme will be relatively small initiallybut will grow steadily over the years. Thus it must be expected that the rates ofcontribuion over the years.3. Provision is made for members of occupational schemes which meet certainstandards to be contracted out of a part of the retirement and widows&apos; benefits, andthis will have an important effect on the finances of the scheme. The lower rates of contribution which will apply for contracted out employees will lead to a loss of income, but there will be no immediate reduction in the outgo i under the scheme.Over the years, however, the loss of income will be increasingly offset, and may eventually be exceeded, by the saving in expenditure on pensions. In this way, theeffect of contracting out is to require a higher initial rate of contribution but to moderatethe increases which will be needed later and it will thus tend to equalise the rates of contribution over the years. j j      ,;The basis of the estimates4. In accordance with normal practice for long-term estimates for national insurance,the estimates in this report are shown on the basis of constant earnings. Projectionson this basis illustrate, in present-day terms, the trends of income and outgo if bothbenefits and contributions were to be increased in step with the movement of earnings.However, adjustments have to be made to allow for departures from this implicitassumption.5. Long-term estimates of income and outgo under the present scheme in the formthat the scheme will take from April 1975 under Part 1 of the Social Security Act 1973,as modified by the Social Security Amendment Bill 1974 now before Parliament, were published earlier this year in my report on the financial provisions of that Bill(Cmnd 5652). These estimates were expressed in terms of the  10 pension and otherbenefit rates which took effect at the end of July 1974, with earnings at the estimatedlevel at that date, and the same basis has been adopted for the estimates in the present memorandum: The demographic and other assumptions underlying the earlier estimates have also been retained. On Government instructions, a rate of unemployment of
2\ % has again been assumed and, for the purpose of the adjustments referred to below,earnings have again been assumed to rise over future years at a rate of 8 % per annum,of which 3 % represents the margin over the rate of increase in prices.6. In determining pensions under the new scheme, earnings will be revalued in line with changes in the national average up to the time of award and, once in payment &apos;the pension on earnings up to the base level will be increased regularly on the same basis. The pension arising from the upper band of earnings will be increased afteraward by amounts sufficient to protect the purchasing power as prices rise but, tothe extent that earnings rise faster than prices, these increases will be less than in line with the movement of earnings and adjustments have been made to take account of this.7. Adjustments have also been made to allow for the fact that whilst benefits remainfixed between successive upratings, which are assumed to be at annual intervals,the yield of earnings-related contributions increases continuously with rising earnings,subject only to the effect of the ceiling.Numbers contracted out8. The number of employees in occupational schemes who will be contracted outcannot be forecast at this stage. It is estimated that in 1971 about 1\ million employeeswere members of final salary pension schemes providing pensions at a rate of not lessthan l/80th of pensionable salary for each year of service and these schemes could thus meet the main qualifying condition for contracting out, in regard to personalpension, and further schemes may be set up on or converted to this basis. It cannotbe assumed, though, that all employers operating such schemes would choose to contract out, and the finances of the scheme are illustrated in this report on alternativeassumptions about the number contracted out. In each case it has been assumed thatthe distribution by age and sex and the average earnings between the base level andthe ceiling would be the same as for employees contracted out under the presentgraduated scheme and also that the number contracted out initially would increase over the years in line with the growth in the working population.Married women&apos;s option9. As explained in paragraphs 46-49 of the White Paper, it is proposed that theexisting option for married women to pay contributions at a reduced rate and to forgo the right to benefits, other than industrial injuries benefits, should be abolishedfor future entrants to the scheme. It is the Governments intention to initiate discussions with interested organisations before reaching a decision on the best way of phasingout the option for the present generation of working wives and to explore the possibilityof retaining an option in regard to cover for short-term benefits. For purposesof illustration the scheme has been costed on the basis that married women who go out to work will be fully covered for long-term benefits but that there will continue tobe an option for short-term benefits. It is estimated that, for insured persons as a whole,a total contribution of about If % of earnings is required to finance the cost of short-term sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and maternity allowance, and it has been assumed that the rate of contribution for married women who exercise an optionnot to be covered for these benefits will be reduced by this amount of If % of earnings.As at present, the employer will pay contributions at the full standard rate in every case.10. The proportion of married women who would choose not to be insured for short-term benefits in such circumstances can only be a matter of conjecture; the assumptionmade is that three-quarters of those exercising the option under the present scheme,or a little over one-half of all married women in employment with earnings above the base level, would continue to do so if the option were limited to short-term benefits.
Cost of benefits11. Table 1 shows estimates of benefit expenditure for the first 30 years of the new scheme, which is assumed to commence in April 1978.

The rising expenditure over the years is mainly attributable to the gradual increasein the average pensions awarded under the new scheme. The extra costs shown includethe additional benefits which would be payable if all married women were in future to be insured for long-term benefits in their own right, as has been assumed. Thecost of protecting the present graduated pension entitlements against the effects of inflation from 1978 onwards is also shown as an extra cost attributable to the new scheme, as there is no provision for these pensions to be increased under existing legislation.13. Apart from the provisions for married women, short-term benefits have been assumed to remain unaltered from the present scheme. The extra costs shown are wholly accounted for by the abolition of the reduced rates of sickness and unemploy-ment benefit for married women and by the assumption that fewer married womenthan at present would exercise the option to forgo benefit in return for lowercontributions if this option were limited to short-term benefits.Rates of contribution14. Table 2 shows estimates of the rates of contribution required over the years to balance expenditure on alternative assumptions about the number contracted out.For purposes of comparison, contributions on the basis of no contracting out arealso shown. The rates represent the total percentage contributions payable by employees and employers jointly on all earnings up to the ceiling for persons fullyparticipating in the scheme. They include a contribution of 1,% towards the cost ofthe national health service and of 0-2 % for the Redundancy Fund, as provided for under the Social Security Act 1973, and may be compared with the rate of 14% whichwould apply from April 1975 under the present scheme.15. For members of occupational pension schemes who are contracted out, reducedrates of contribution will be payable on earnings above the base level. As explained in paragraph 67 of the White Paper, the reductions, which will be the same for both
men and women, will represent the estimated average cost of providing through afunded occupational scheme that part of the state pension for which the occupational scheme is taking over responsibility. This amount will be calculated on earnings between the base level and the ceiling during the period of contracted out employment,with no regard to the &quot;best 20 years&quot; provisions under the state scheme, but thepercentage of the earnings to be provided by the occupational scheme will dependon the age of the employee at the starting date of the new scheme. For persons within20 years of minimum pension age at the outset, the state pension on earnings abovethe base level will accrue at the rate of 1 J% a year, reaching 25% of average earningsafter 20 years. For younger employees, however, the pension will be limited to 25 %of their average earnings above the base level and the amount forgone in the state scheme in respect of a period of contracted out employment will be calculated on thebasis that this 25 % pension accrues uniformly over the period between the commence-ment of the new scheme and the attainment of pension age so that, for example, fora man aged 25 or a woman aged 20 at the commencement of the new scheme the pension would be taken as accruing over 40 years. It follows that the average rate atwhich employees contracted out are forgoing pensions in the state scheme will fallgradually over the years and, therefore, the reductions in the rates of contribution must also diminish.16. Preliminary calculations suggest that a reduction in the region of 6% to 7%in the joint contribution on earnings above the base level might be appropriate forthe first 5 years of the scheme and, for the purpose of the estimates in Table 2, a rateof 6\% falling at 5 yearly intervals to 4 % after 30 years has been assumed.17. Table 2 shows that increasing rates of contribution would be required over theyears as the cost of the new scheme gradually builds up. The table also shows how the rate needed initially would depend very materially on the extent of contracting out.For example, allowing for a small margin, a rate of contribution approaching 16\%would be required if 8 million employees were contracted out but if the number were6 million or 4 million, rates no higher than 16% or 151% respectively would besufficient. Contributions would have to be increased, within 15 years, to rates in the region of 16 % to 17%, depending on the numbers contracted out, and to about18 % after 30 years.18. Even after 30 years, however, the expenditure would not fully reflect the levelof benefits which will ultimately be payable under the scheme. Although, after thescheme has been in operation for 20 years, pensions on the upper band of earningswill be awarded at the full 25 % rate, after 30 years substantial numberiSj of pensionswill still be in payment based on the lower rates which applied to awards during thefirst 20 years. Also the average earnings on which pensions are based, which willbe taken over the best 20 years of a member&apos;s working life, will continue to increaseslowly for many years. It is estimated that the average pension in payment in 2008/09will still be some 10% below the ultimate level under the scheme and, other thingsbeing equal, the rate of contribution would have to be increased by about a furtherH% over a period of 20 years after 2008/09. The rate of contribution required at anytime will, however, depend not only on the level of benefits but also on the relativenumbers of pensioners and contributors, and any estimates of contributions so far intothe future would be very speculative.Edward JohnstonGovernment Actuary&apos;s Department.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Oyez Press Ltd.Dd. 155940  K320    8/74
