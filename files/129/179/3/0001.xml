DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 93 COPY NO      &apos; 02 September 1974CABINETEEC RENEGOTIATION - REGIONAL AIDSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs ifv1. On 31 July the Ministerial Committee on European Questions (EQ)considered the way in which we should now approach our renegotiationobjectives on regional policy aids.    The Committee was unable to reach agreement on which of two alternative courses to adopt.   I am thereforesubmitting the issue to the Cabinet for decision.2.        The Ministerial Committee on European Community Strategy (ECS)discussed on 15 May the strategy we should follow in implementing ourManifesto commitment to &quot;the retention by Parliament of those powers overthe British economy needed to pursue effective regional .... policies&quot;.In summing up the Prime Minister said that &quot;our objective on regional aidsshould be to secure agreements in the Commission Working Party on rules which would permit our present and prospective regional measures andwould give adequate flexibility for the future.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should make clear at the next meeting of theCouncil of Ministers that a satisfactory outcome of the Working Party&apos;work was an important element in the renegotiation exercise&quot;.3.        Accordingly, in my statement to the Council of Ministers in luxembourg on 4 June I included the following passage, after consultationwith the Secretary of State for Industry -&quot;Linked with this is the question of regional aids, which a working party convened by the Commission has begun to study.   As I said on 1 April, we accept that co-ordination of the rules under which each of us gives aid has a useful part to play.   We are taking partin the work and we intend to make a full contribution to it.    our objective will be to ensure that the rules take account of the needsof the United Kingdom and of the policies we devise to meet thoseneeds&quot;.The issue which EQ has been unable to resolve is how we should set aboutsecuring our objectives in the Working Party,1
4.        In the view of the Secretary of State for Industry, our aim in theWorking Party must be to implement the Labour Party&apos;s Manifesto byensuring that, despite Articles 92-94 of the European Economic Community(e.c.) Treaty, there is no effective limitation of our freedom to determineregional policy in the United Kingdom.    He recommends that as a first step officials should put in a paper to the Working Party (attached as annex A).    The paper proposes that the problem of national regional aidpolicies leading to unfair competition within the Community should be dealtwith in future by establishing a procedure for reporting national systems of regional aid.    Member Governments would accept an obligation to explainand discuss the purposes of their policies and the methods by which theywere to be achieved.   Action should also be taken -a. to limit the powers at present vested in the Commission tohold up or override new aids;b. to retain for the United Kingdom and other member governments the freedom to give aid which reduces the cost oflabour;c. to provide that Governments must be free to take quick orexceptional action without obstruction from the Commission, and inparticular to extend the boundaries of their assisted areas whenthe situation requires it.It should be made clear that the final responsibility for regional policy inthe United Kingdom must rest with the United Kingdom Parliament.   Inthis way the Commission and Member Governments would be made aware of the kind of flexibility we required; further papers following up theproposals in detail could be put in as necessary.5,        The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has recommended an alternative course.   He has argued that the course recommended by the Secretary of State for Industry is not in accordancewith the strategy which ECS agreed on 15 May nor likely to secure the objectives we seek.    ECS have agreed (and we have so informed theCommunity) that we accept that common rules are required, and that our aim must be to ensure that these rules take account of the needs of theUnited Kingdom and give us the requisite freedom to implement policies tomeet those needs.   We should therefore seek changes in the e.c. rules tomeet our practical requirements - arguing our case on the basis of thespeaking note at Annex B.    We would not, however, provoke a doctrinalclash with the Community by challenging the whole principle of co-ordination.Such an approach would be hard to reconcile with the e.c. Treaty and wouldnot be negotiable with the other Member States or with the Commission.In the Minister of State&apos;s view some measure of control is indispensablewithin a free trade area; and it is in our interest to ensure that our industries are not open to damage by subsidised competition from richercountries in the Community.    However, if we cannot secure the changes we need in this way, we shall have to review the situation in the light of the reservation which I made in my statement to the Council of Ministers on1 April (Cmnd 5593) of our right to propose changes in the Treaties if itturned out that essential interests could not otherwise be met.2
i i6.        The majority of EQ agree with the view of the Minister of State.    Itis also my view,    I am in full agreement with the Secretary of State for industry on the need to fulfil our Manifesto commitment to retain thepowers required to secure effective United Kingdom regional policies.   ButI judge that this aim can best be achieved by the approach recommended bythe Minister of State,   If the Cabinet agree with this line, we shall also need to circulate to the Commission Working Party a paper prepared by officials which sets out the case for regarding labour subsidies ascompatible with the e.c. Treaty and explains how the incidence of such aidscan be measured and compared with other forms of aid such as aids to capital investment.    To put our case in this way offers the best prospectfor obtaining agreement to new rules which will both provide the flexibilitywe need and safeguard the powers of the Government and of Parliament,7.        I invite the Cabinet to decide whether we should -    11a, proceed as recommended by the Secretary of State for industry, circulating to the Commission Working Party the paperat Annex A; orb. instruct our representatives to explain our policy approach and requirements to the Working Party in the terms of Annex B,and to circulate to it a paper on the lines indicated in paragraph 6,J foreign and Commonwealth Office2 September 1974 ,,3
confidential annex    PfDRAPT PAPER POR SUBMISSION TO THE COMMISSION WORKING PARTY ON THECOORDINATION OP REGIONAL AIDS     ,The Community faces a dilemma over the administration of regional aidsystems.   This is recognised &quot;by the provisions of Articles 92-94 of the .,Treaty of Rome and by the acquis communautaire   which flows from thosearticles.   On the one hand there is a plain obligation of electedgovernments to tackle effectively the problems of their under-developedregions.      Unless Member Governments accept these responsibilities and bring forward effective measures it is likely that there will be anavoidable loss of economic resources and unnecessary unhappiness to people who will be deprived of jobs or be forced to subsist on lowincomes.   On the other hand the Treaty contains provisions, against thedistortion of competition while at the same time recognising that  .certain forms of distortion are acceptable.2      It is Important, however, to keep in perspective these two factors.All Member Governments.exercise regional policies within their territories and distort competition between regions.   Unless they do so,governments cannot carry out their obligations to their parliaments andelectorates to provide employment and to raise the standard of living.The validity of such policies is now almost universally accepted;certainly it is far more widely accepted than was the case when theTreaty was signed in 1957-     The obligation to discharge these responsibilities Is now clearly of a far more compelling character thanavoiding distortion of competition within the common market.   Neverthe-less there is a theoretical risk of harm through excessively generousregional aid systems and a mgre real risk   of an unprofitable bidding up/process ..
. . CONFIDENTIAL &apos; &apos;,iprocess for the attraction of mobile industrial projects.. The need ^ (^llfind a procedure which enables governments effectively to discharge theiimajor responsibilities while avoiding as far as possible the minorrisks that regional policies can entail for areas not enjoying all theirIbenefits.3      For 14 out of the 17 years of the Community&apos;s existence means were  jfound of avoiding the dilemma posed above, by a series of ad hocsolutions.   If these lacked something in logical neatness, at least theygave the Community the advantages of flexibility and pragmatism.       Itis important that the Community should not throw away these advantages which enable governments to discharge their responsibilities for the sake of achieving logical or administrative tidiness.4      Nor is there any evidence that inflexible rules are necessary tocontrol Government intervention in the common market for regionalpurposes.   As has been indicated above, the application of regional policy within Member States has led not to criticism of the distortionof competition but to more general acceptance that such policies areright and indeed inevitable.   It is almost certain that the regional,policies of Member Governments will have the greatest effect indistorting competition wibhin their own national territories, and governments are thus certain to take such effects into account whenformulating schemes of assistance.5      Within a common market it is reasonable that there should be a procedure for reporting national systems of regional aid.   member governments should accept an obligation to explain and discuss thepurposes of their policies and the methods by which they will be achieved.They should be prepared to explain the policies and persuade those concerned that what is being done is justified and effective.     But/governments
governments must be mindful of their obligations to see that national^economies are managed in such a way as to avoid the loss of economic resources..6      Action will be needed by the Council and the Commission underArticles 92.3(d) and Article 94 of the Treaty of Rome to instituteprocedures which recognise the prime responsibility of Member governments to the people who elected them.   Such action could appropriatelyrecognise the theoretical risks that regional policy could entail forother members, by instituting a process of reporting and discussion.7      Obviously it is important that systems of regional aid should be appropriate to the situation in which they apply.     Otherwise resourceswill be wasted and ends will not be achieved.   It follows that the  -Community should not rule out a priori   any forms of aid which&apos;can be effective.   In the United Kingdom the core of the regional problem is so high -rates of unemployment in industrial areas.   Among the effectiveways to tackle this are subsidies to labour, and it is important thatthe provisions of the Treaty, which draw no distinction between forms of aid, should not be extended or interpreted to limit the powers of member Governments to discharge their primary responsibilities to theelectors.8      For the same reason it is essential that when the regionalsituation requires quick or exceptional action, Member Governments shouldbe free to take it. . The limits upon government action must be those ofthe situation itself and not rules laid down in advance.&apos; -&apos; &apos;  /9.-V        :confidential
/4-9&quot;     It is of particular importance that Member Governments should be free to vary the boundaries of their assisted regions in the lightof their assessment of the needs of the places in question and atthe time when they judge such assistance to be necessary.&apos;10    &quot;The experience of the Community has shown the extreme practical difficulty of formulating adequate rules to distinguish betweenlegitimate and unreasonable forms of regional aid.     The rightconclusion from this experience is that the problem will be.more effectively tackled by an agreement between governments to actreasonably than by the exercise of administrative ingenuity designedto provide in advance for every conceivable situation.11     The final responsibility must rest with the UK Parliament.
ANNEX &amp;bAf POH TALKS WITH THE COMMISSION AND FOE discussions in THE COMMISSION WORKING PARTY ON THE CO-ORDINATION of regional AIDS1.     Officials should explain United Kingdom policy on the following lines.2.     The United Kingdom approach to the question of the Co-ordinationof Regional Aids was explained by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secre-tary in his statement to the Council of Ministers on 4 June,,     Afterreferring to the study being conducted by the Commission working party, he said:       ,\\&quot;We accept that co-ordination of the rules under which each of usgives aid has a useful part to play.     We are taking part in thework and we intend to make a full contribution to It.   Our objectivewill he to ensure that the rules take account of the needs of theUnited Kingdom and of the policies we devise to meet l^hose needs.   Weare conscious that the regional problems of Member States are differ-ent - some are agricultural, some are caused by sheer remoteness andothers like our own by changes in industrial structure.     The rulesmust therefore be broad enough in scope to cover all types of aid thatmay be required.   In our experience, they will need to be flexible and capable of modification.     It will, be necessary from time to timefor us to vary the level of aids, the definition of areas.   Whereparticular problems arise, such as steel closures, we may also need to exceed whatever fixed ceilings are agreed.     We welcome theCommission&apos;s statement that there may be derogations in ^hese clrctun-stances, but the problem may arise in other cases and the new rules should take account of this, as well as of the need to react quicklyto particular regional and industrial problems as they arise.   Thesematters are essential to us as en element of the renegotiation.   Weplan to do this by securing a satisfactory outcome in the working party&quot;.3o     The United Kingdom recognises that the Community has to reconcileconflicting pressures in determining its policies on regional aid.These pressures are reflected in Articles 92-9^- of the Treaty of rome which contain provisions against the distortion of competitionwhile at the same time recognising that various forms of aid arecompatible with the Common Market.     In the UK view the two principalconsiderations which must be borne in mind are(a)     that all Member Governments have obligations to dealwith problems of regional imbalance by seeking to provide employment and to raise the standard of living in lessprosperous regions of their countries.      All member governments conduct regional policies within their terri-/      tories and distort competition between regions for these purposes.     The validity of such policies is now almostuniversally accepted;    certainly it is far more widely accepted than was the case when the Treaty was concluded in 1957.     The obligation to discharge these responsibility-ities must be given due weight when consideration is givento the need to impose restrictions on regional policies,because of the theoretical distortions of competition which
-CONFIDENTIAL- 2 - &apos;::-;-.v:;V,;&apos;    %/&quot;&quot;might ensue and might affect other member countries.There is normally little likelihood of a substantialthreat to competition being posed by industriesoperating in regions which are in need of specialsupport measures;(b)        at the same time all Member Governments havea legitimate interest in ensuring that the regionalaids given in other countries within the e.c. are not of a type or on a scale which will distort competitionto the extent of inflicting damage on industry or employment in their own countries.     Equally they will wish to guard against the possibility that the prosper- .ous areas of one country within the Common Market mightoutbid less prosperous areas in other countries to attract mobile investment.4.    The need is to agree on rules and procedures which will enablegovernments effectively to discharge their responsibilities inrelation to the conduct of regional policy within their own terri-tories while avoiding actions or policies which could have unaccept-able consequences for other member countries.     The danger thatregional aid policies may distort competition should not be exaggerated-rgerated.     The application of regional policies within Member states has not led to criticism from interests which might in theory havebeen adversely affected within those States;     there has been general acceptance that such policies are right and.indeed inevitable.There are in-built restraints on the levels of aid which Member Statesgive, not only because of the cost, which has to be borne by other regions, but because it is almost certain that the regional policies of Member Governments will have the greatest effect in distortingcompetition within their national territories;   and governments are thus certain to take such effects into account when formulatingschemes of assistance.5.    The United Kingdom considers that the following principles shouldbe taken into.account in determining which forms of aid should beregarded as acceptable:(a) it is important that systems of regional aid shouldbe appropriate to the situation in which they apply.   Other-wise resources will be wasted and ends will not be achieved.It follows that the Community should not rule out ajgroori/ any forms of aid which are likely to prove effective;(b) in the UK the core of the regional problem is high rates of unemployment in industrial areas.     Among the waysto tackle this are subsidies to labour, which have provedeffective irrespective of whether they are linked to new investment projects.     Subsidies not so linked have been criticised in the Community on the grounds that they are&quot;opaque&quot;.     It is important that the provisions of theTreaty, which draw no distinction between forme of aid,should not be interpreted in a doctrinaire manner.   Inthe UK view it is possible to measure and compare operation-al or continuing aids as well as those that are linked to expenditure on capital investment projects.     This would permit account to be taken of capital subsidies and laboursubsidies, or indeed any form of aid, on an equal footing.A note on measurability, illustrating how this question canbe tackled, is being submitted to the Commission Working
(c) it is essential that when the regional situationrequires quick or exceptional action Member governments should be in a position to take it.     Arrangements forreporting or consultation must be such as not to hinderurgent and necessary action;(d) it is of particular importance that Member Govern-ments should be in a position to vary the boundaries oftheir assisted regions in the light of changes in Objectivecircumstances and of their assessment of the needs of the places in question and at the time when they judge such assistance to be necessary.     This means that the principles which are applied to determine the boundaries of assisted areas for Community purposes should be subject to reasonableflexibility;(e) any classification of the Community into areas forthe purpose of co-ordination should take account of! the complexity of regional problems occasioned by the differingcircumstances and special economic difficulties whichprevail in different areas of the Community.
