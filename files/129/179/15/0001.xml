THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 10510 September 1974CABINETW DEVOLUTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection1. The Cabinet, at their discussion on 5 September invited me, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor the Environment, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary ofState for Wales and the Minister of State, Civil Service Department, to revise the draft White Paper in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions.This has been done and a revised draft is at Annex for the Cabinefsconsideration.    As the Cabinet desired, it has been clearlydifferentiated in language from the Party document issued last week while retaining the structure and positive approach which was derived from that party document.2. There are two points of substance to which I draw my colleagues&apos;attention -a.    Executive powers.    We concluded on 5 September that theproposals in the White Paper should not specifically provide for separate executive governments for Scotland and Wales orcommit the Government on the scope of the powers and functions to be devolved.    The Ministerial Group concluded that it was notpolitically possible to write the White Paper without conveyingin terms that the assemblies would be given some (but unspecified)executive powers of the kind now exercised by the Scottish and welsh Offices under the  Secretaries of State and by certain of thenon-democratic nominated bodies.    The relevant paragraphs are27 (last sentence) and 28b. (which needs to be read with thestatement of Scottish and Welsh Office functions in paragraphs 5and 9).    Colleagues will wish to consider whether this degreeof commitment is acceptable.copy NO    * *
b.    Finance.     Paragraph. 28c. deals with the financial   uallocations for the functions over which the assemblies will have responsibility in terms which the Chancellor of the exchequer had proposed before he had to withdraw from the meeting.    Weomitted from his text, however, any reference to uniformity of charges (as distinct from unifqrmity of standards) because itwas thought that in the matter of eg rents there was alreadydifference as between Scotland and England.    The chancellor and the Cabinet will wish to consider whether this is acceptable.II3.        I invite my colleagues&apos; agreement to the revised text of theWhite Paper and to its urgent publication.S w department of Prices and Consumer Protection10 September 1974
DRAFTDEVOLUTION WHITE PAPERDEMOCRACY AND DEVOLUTION - PROPOSALS FOR SCOTLAND AMD WALESINTRODUCTION1.     In I968 the Government announced their decision to set up the Royal Commission,on the Constitution.   The Prime Minister said at the time that an important reasonfor appointing the Commission was the &quot;strong feeling, not only in Scotland andWales, hut in many parts of England, of a greater desire for participation in theprocess of decision-making, moving it nearer - wherever this is possible - to the places where people live&quot;.   The Commission, under the chairmanship ofLord Kilbrandon, reported in October 1973.   It was unanimous in rejectingseparatism and federalism and in recommending directly-elected Scottish and Welshassemblies, but was divided in the rest of its recommendations.   The Queen1s speech on 12 March 1974 said the Government &quot;will initiate discussions in Scotland andWales on the Report of;the Commission on the Constitution, and will bring forward proposals for consideration&quot;.   Accordingly, to provide the basis for these discussions the Government published on 3 June 1974 &quot;Devolution within theUnited Kingdom - Some Alternatives for Discussion&quot;.   This Consultative Documentsummarised the -&quot;-various schemes of devolution recommended in the KilbrandonCommission&apos;s main Report and in the Memorandum of Dissent which accompanied itand posed a number of questions and identified problems relating to each of thepossible schemes.   The Government are now able to report on the outcome&quot; of the consultations they have undertaken during the Summer of 1974 and, in the lightof them, to set out their decisions of principle as a basis for further development.THE UN.1.TY OF THE UNITED kingdom.     The Government agree wholeheartedly with the Commission on the constitution in rejecting separatism and federalism as a solution.   The Government, like theRoyal Commission, regard it as a vital and fundamental principle to maintain the/   economic and political unity of the United Kingdom.   This is not just a matterof tradition and sentiment, important thought they are.   The unity of thecountry and of the economy is essential both to the strength of our international(CONFIDENTIAL)
position and ijthus crucial(confidential)o the growth of our industry and national wealth.   That unity isf we are to play an effective role in international negotiations(whether political or economic; and it is crucial for the central management of&apos; the economy ar^d so to the redistribution of resources in favour of all the lessprosperous areas of the United Kingdom.3.     It does not follow, however, that each of the constituent parts of theUnited Kingdom must be treated in exactly the same way.   While the people ofScotland and Wales, as the Royal Commission noted, consider themselves to be british, they are also deeply conscious of the fact that they are Scottish orWelsh.   Nor does it follow that Scotland and&apos; Wales must be treated exactly likeeach other.   They have differing histories, backgrounds and cultural traditions,Because the circumstances of the two countries are so different, the present arrangements for their government are not the same and it will not be surpriseif their, future systems of government are different.   What is important is that]needs and aspirations of the Scottish and Welsh people are properly met.   In thicontext the Government are firmly convinced, as was the Royal Commission, thatthe United Kingdom must remain one country and one economy and that constitution:change must be undertaken with the clear objective of strengthening rather thanweakening this unity.4.     Within the United Kingdom there has however already been a substantialmovement of Government and^ decision-making away from London - what the KilbrandoiCommission called administrative devolution.   These developments, which havebeen of benefit especially- to Scotland and Wales, are summarised in the followiajparagraphs.   The Government intend to build on what has already been achieved,in order to provide more democratic involvement.EXISTING DEVOLUTIONScotland5.     Since 1885 when a Secretary for Scotland was appointed, and parvicuarlyfrom 1939 when the Scottish Office in broadly its present form was established in Edinburgh, a very wide measure of administrative devolution has been developSince the war additional functions have been progressively transferred to theScottish Office.   The Secretary of State, as a member of the United KingdomGovernment, now has major responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions) tootl.for the formulation of policy and its execution in such major fields as(confidential)
agriculture and fisheries; education; local government and environmental services; social work, health and housing; roads and certain aspects of- shipping and [road transport services.   He is also responsible for a range ofother functicjns from police and fire services to sport and tourism.     TheUnited Kingdcjm Government&apos;s administrative functions arising from these responsibilities are carried out in the five Scottish Departments based onSt Andrew&apos;s House in Edinburgh.   For most of these subjects there is separate scottish legislation or Scottish application clauses in United Kingdom Acts ofParliament.   Separate Scottish legislation has special Parliamentary machinery to handle it consisting of the Scottish Grand Committee, on which all 71&apos;   &apos; &apos;&apos; &quot;    \\ \\Scottish Members of Parliament sit, and two Scottish Standing Committees whichconsider the details of Scottish legislation.6.     One basic reason for these differences in legislation and administrativepractice arises from the existence of a separate system of Scottish law,the preservation of which was provided for in the Union settlement of 1707*The Secretary of State has accordingly responsibility for legal services inScotland, and other important responsibilities are exercised by the twoScottish Law Officers, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.But it is not just a case of Scottish legislation in parallel with that for &apos;England and Wales; there are usually distinctive Scottish features&apos;and&apos; in somecases the approach is markedly different, reflecting the differing needs andconditions of Scotland and the people living there.   Many examples are to befound in such fields as health, education, social work, housing and criminal law.   Devolution to Scotland - in the sense of running things differently inScotland because Scotland is differe*:t - is therefore nothing new.7*     The Secretary o.&apos; State also has?a major.role in the planning anddevelopment of the Scottish economy and plays a full part in the Governments- determination of Energy policy.,   He exercises a co-ordinating function overactivities in Scotland, such as the location of industry, the creation ofemployment and the development of North Sea oil, which are not his direct responsibility but have an important, indeed vital, effect on the economyThe full list of the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibilities is as follows:agriculture and fisheries, criminal lav;, crofting, education, electricity,environmental services, health, Highlands and Islands development, housing,legal services, local government, police, prison a^.u fire services, roads,   .certain aspects of shipping and road transport services, -ocial work, sport,recreation and the arts, tourism, town and country planning and youth and community services.
of Scotland.The United Kingdom Departments with significant Scottishresponsibilities have offices in Scotland with delegated powers and work closely,with the Scottish Office.   The decentralisation of central government functions has also benefiitcd the Scottish economy and the Government hasdecided to further this by transferring 6,000 Ministry of Defence and 1,000Ministry of Overseas Development pests to Glasgow over the next ten years.8.     The existence of these separate administrative arrangements in scotland has greatly benefitted the people of Scotland in that they have enabled specialScottish needs to be recognised and met.   A practical illustration of this isthat identifiable public expenditure per head in Scotland has been at avery significantly higher level than elsewhere in the United Kingdom (exceptin very recent years in northern Ireland).Wales9.     Substantial administrative devolution to Wales has also already taken place,though at a later historical stage than in the case of Scotland.   The firstMinister for Welsh Affairs was appointed in 1951? hut the most important measuresof devolution have been concentrated into the last ten years.   The first Secretatjof State was appointed in 1964, and since then the Welsh Office&apos;s functions have grown rapidly.   The Department now has responsibility in Wales for housing,health, the social services, primary and secondary education, child care, tornand country planning, water, highways, &quot;tourism, forestry and agriculture (joint!;with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food), and many other functions,The strengthening of the Office still continues; the post of its Civil Servicehead was recently upgraded to that of full Permanent Secretary.10.   In other ways too administration has been reshaped and strengthened and decision-making has been devolved to take account of Welvh interests in economic and other fields.   The Secretary of State has a general responsibilityfor the economic development of Wales and exercises a co-ordinating responsibility in Government action to promote the welfare of Wales.   Considerable powers havebeen delegated to the Department of Trade and Industry Office for Wales, andWales has its own Industrial Director and Industrial Development. Board.   TheGovernment have also announced their decision, as a further step to assist-......tl
ithe economy, to transfer over 7,000 Civil Service posts to Wales in the next ten years.   A3 in Scotland, identifiable public expenditure per head in Wales&quot;has for many years been ranning at a substantially higher level than in England.11.   In consequence of these and other measures Government action is increasinglyadapted to fit Welsh needs and to further Welsh interests.   The role of theSecretary of State in the United Kingdom Government is fundamental.   He not onlyhas full responsibility for the matters referred tc in paragraph 9 above; inother matters affecting Wales he has powers of oversight and he safeguards andfurthers Welsh interests both in Cabinet and in discussion with departmental ministers, thus exercising a direct and powerful influence on all policiesaffecting Wales..12.   Welsh interests are further represented centrally through the 36 WelshMembers of Parliament at Westminster who, in addition to their otherParliamentary or Ministerial functions, all sit on the Welsh Grand Committeewhich jprovides a further forum for debate and discussion of matters concerningWales.Engljnd13.   For historical reasons there has not been the same pressure for substantialdevolution in England.   The fact of the differing circumstances and needs ofdifferent parts of England was however.recognised by the creation in I964 ofthe Economic banning Boards and Councils; the Councils have been a valuablesource of advice to successive Governments on the special requirements of theirregions, and the Planning Boards have strengthened and extended the delegation of decision-making from Whitehall Departments to regional centres.   For instance.Regional Controllers of the Department of Industry now make important decisions affecting the location of industry by authorising loans of up to  1 millionunder the 1972 Act: Regional Directors of the Department of the Environmentapprove road improvement schemes and take the majority of the Departments planningdecisions.   Furthermore the Government have put forward for discussion certain proposals to aid democratisation in specific fields, for instance area, and regional health authorities and statutory neighbourhood councils.5
CONSULT ATI PITS OF THE CiHSULTATIVE DOCUMENT&apos;14.   While recognising the benefits to Scotland and Wales of the existing system, the Kilbrandon Commission unanimously concluded that directly-elected assemblies ought to be established for Scotland and for Wales to meet the legitimate desire of their people for greater control over their own affairs.The Commission . was not agreed, however, on how this objective should be achieviand in the main Report and the Memorandum of Dissent four schemes were set out for implementing this decision in relation to Scotland (Schemes A, B, C and Elithe Consultative Document) and Wales (Schemes A, B, C and B).   The Governmentinvited all interested organisations and members of the public to comment onthese schemes.   For ease of reference, the description of the schemes in the consultative Document is reproduced as an Appendix to this White Paper.Scotland -15.   The response of individual members of the public was disappointing; only about 170 letters or papers, some qxdte brief, were received.   Of these therewas no clear majority for any one solution, and indeed a significant numberexpressed no specific view.16.   On the other hand over 60 organisations, including the political parties,submitted written views.   Among these there was considerable support forScheme A or variations of it.   While very fpw indeed favoured Schemes B or C,there was some support for Scheme E.   A number wanted more.decision-making inScotland, without associating that demand with any specific scheme.   Somewanted no change in the present system and others wanted any decision deferred until the new local authorities had had time to settle down.   Most of thoserepresenting local government were particularly concerned about the possible effects of the Schemes considered on the new local authorities and their powers,Strathclyde Regional Authority, for example, urged the Government &quot;to ensurethat the new authorities are given sufficient time and independent power toestablish and develop themselves and that in the meantime the discussions shoullcontinue&quot;.17.   During July and August 1974 a series of discussions was held in scotland by Scottish Ministers, accompanied by the Government&apos;s constitutional adviser,Lord Crowther-Hunt, with some of the organisations which had submitted writtenobservations.   Bodies consulted in this way included the Scottish Council of6&quot;b
confidential the Labour Party, the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Council(Development and Industry), the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Council cfthe Confederation of British Industry in Scotland, the Church and NationCommittee of the Church of Scotland and various local authority representatives.These discussions reinforced points made in the written submissions and some points emerged of particular significance.   One was a strong desire for moreGovernment decision-making to take place in Scotland - and in that context theannouncements referred to in paragraph 30 below were welcomed.   There was alsowidespread, though not unanimous,support for the vieitf that there would bemerit in the establishment of a directly-elected Scottish assembly, but therewas no agreement on what powers or functions the assembly should have.&apos;   Of theschemes in the Consultative Document, Scheme A, which proposed a legislativeassembly and government for Scotland, commanded the greatest support, but therewas clearly a good deal of uncertainty about the precise implications of thescheme and the full significance of the fact that it involved a separate scottish government responsible to the assembly.   There was also very considerable opposition both to the abolition of the office of Secretary of State and to thereduction in the number of Scottish Members of Parliament at Westminster, forwhich Scheme A provided.   Of the other schemes, hardly anyone thought themappropriate to Scottish conditions, except that Scheme E, which involved an advisory assembly with limited legislative functions and no Scottish Executive,attracted some support.18.   The process of consultation has made it apparent that opinion in scotland is still divided.   Many are convinced of the need for a substantial measure of devolution, involving a directly-elected Scottish assembly with real powers.Others, though a minority, are equally convinced that any radical change in thepresent system would be to Scotland&apos;s detriment, though administrative devolution might be further developed.   But the overwhelming view was that the/    essential political and economic unity of the United Kingdom should be preserved.Wales II19.   In. accordance with the Government&apos;s undertaking to carry out discussions on the Commission&apos;s Report in Wales, the Secretary of State, with theassistance of the Government&apos;s constitutional adviser, has completed a programmeof consultations.7
20.   The bodjies consulted represented political parties in Wales, localauthorities,j both sides of industry and the farming community.   The majoritywere in favojir of the establishment of a directly-elected assembly for Wales,but there wap no general agreement on the functions it should exercise:opinion was divided between those who favoured legislation devolution(Scheme A) and those-who were for executive devolution (Schemes B or C).The minority either favoured a directly-elected Welsh Advisory Council(Scheme D) or wanted no fundamental change in existing arrangements.   Thepoints on which there was substantial agreement among those consulted wasthat the office of Secretary of State should continue and that there shouldbe no reduction in the number of Welsh Members of Parliament.21.   The Secretary of State received written views from 30 organisations in wales.   In most cases these were briefly stated and did not attempt to dealwith the detailed questions set out in the discussion document.   The viewsof these organisations, mostly made up of individual local authorities andpolitical, trade union and religious bodies, were divided; about one-thirdwere in favour of legislative devolution; nearly half preferred executivedevolution; and the remainder favoured other solutions or the status quo.In addition the Secretary of State received written views from a relatively small number of individuals, most of which were in favour of schemes of atleast legislation devolution.22.   Thus no consensus of opinion has emerged.   The case for an elected assembly is widely supported, but ti;ere is no general agreement about thepowers it should exercise.   However, there is an evident desire to seeGovernment decision-making made more responsive and accountable to the people,provided this can be done without disrupting the essential political andeconomic unity of the United Kingdom.   In particular, it has been urged thatthe nominated bodies which at present carry out many functions in Wales shouldbe replaced by a body representative of the Welsh people, which should alsodischarge some of the executives functions of Government Departments in Wales.SOME MAJOR ISSUES23.   In a matter of this kind it is not surprising that, as the consultationshave demonstrated, there are diverging views.   The consultations also showed&quot;that while the majority of organisations and individuals who responded to the 8
confidentialGovernment&apos;s invitation had a general picture of the sort of arrangements theyfavoured, few of them were prepared to accept all the implications which seemedlogically to follow from these arrangements.   The Government&apos;s continued studiesduring recent months have shown that any substantial scheme of devolution raisesdifficult problems; and a number of very important matters remain to be resolvedbefore it is possible to put forward detailed proposals which would command general support and would&apos;carry with them the prospect of stability.   The major issues are -a. Finance and Economic Management   jiIn any scheme of devolution the financial arrangements would clearly beof fundamental importance.   Any major change in the present broadarrangement has to be reconciled with the maintenance of a, general uniformity of approach in the Kingdom as a whole to the allocation of resources, to taxation arrangements and to the overall management of the economy.        &apos; r^--Consideration of alternative approaches, including the proposal in Scheme Afor a nominated Exchequer Board, has confirmed the very great difficultyof finding acceptable solutions to these problems.b. Trade,i Industry and EmploymentThere is still a great deal of doubt about whether, and if so how farexecutive powers in these fields could be devolved to Scottish and Welshassemblies without prejudice to the essential economic unity of theUnited Kingdom.   There is a strong desire for more decision-making inScotland and-Wales, but this would not necessarily require the creation ofan elected assembly.c. Local government there is understandable concern both about the timing and effect of any constitutional changes in relation to the re-organisation of localgovernment, and about the possible attitude of directly-elected assembliesto the new local authorities who have just taken over their fullresponsibilities in Wales and will be doing so in Scotland next ye-^r.d*     The Secretary of StateThere is a strong desire both in Scotland and in Wales to retain an effectiveSecretary of State.   Major changes and a diminution in their present powers would be an inevitable consequence of a substantial measure of devolution;9
careful thought will have to he given to their precise role.   They will however retain important executive functions, will act as spokesmen forScotland and for Wales in the United Kingdom Government for those matters which are not devolved and will contribute to the formulation ofUnited Kingdom policy as a whole.   Indeed, an extension of their responsibilities, particularly in the field of industry, may point theway to a solution to some of the problems outlined in sub-paragraphs a, -..There is a great reluctance to see any reduction in the number of Scottisor Welsh Members of the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster, with a consequent weakening of Scottish or Welsh influence in United Kingdomaffairs.   This must be reconciled with whatever devolutionary arrangements are made.24.   All these outstanding problems as well as a great many matters of detailwill require further very careful and thorough study before the Government arein a position co put forward fully worked out proposals.   But they accept the broad conclusion of the Kilbrandon Commission that a substantial measure of devolution within the United Kingdom is desirable and that it is practicable to establish directly-elected assemblies in both Scotland and Wales.25.   The Government attach ecjual importance to democratic accountability ofgovernment in England.   In Scotland and Wales there has already been asufficient debate to enable the Government to make firm proposals.   In Englari,however, the consultation process is not yet .complete, and it would be wrong to go further until all the bodies consulted have had the opportunity to expressthemselves and it is clear what the people of England want.26.   northern Ireland comes into a different category from Scotland and Walesbecause of the facts of its history and geography and the presence of two communities in the province.   The Government have already published their proposals for Northern Ireland in a White Paper &quot;The Northern IrelandConstitution&quot; (Cmnd 5^75) cased on elections to a Consultative Convention whidabove.e.Representation in the United Kingdom parliament the government S DECISIONS10Pp
I will enable ^lecied representatives of the people of Northern Ireland&apos; to consider- &quot;what provision for the government of Northern Ireland is likely to command themost widespread acceptance throughout the community&quot;.   Final decisions on theseproposals will be taken by Parliament.27.   For Scotland andis. Wales the Government now propose the creation of directly-elected assemblies.   While these new institutions will have certain commoncharacteristics and relationships to the central government, they will naturally,have to reflect the differences in governmental structure between Scotland aridWales which already^exist.   In particular^&apos; as explained in paragraphs 5 and 6,Scotland has a distinctive legal structure.which is recognised in existinglegislative practice.   The Government have therefore concluded that the scottish assembly should have a legislative role and have legislative powers withinfields in which separate Scottish legislation already exists such&apos; as, for example,housing, health and education.   Talcing account of the different structures oflaw in Scotland and Wales but with.the same principles in mind the government intend that the Welsh assembly should parallel the Scottish counterpart in assuming certain powers of the Secretary of State in;;respect of delegated legislation.   The Welsh assembly would also be given responsibility for manyof the executive functions at present carried out by non-democratic nominatedbodies within Wales, and by the Secretary of State himself.28. The membership, functions and procedures,,of the assemblies will call for detailed study and consideration. The Government1s provisional proposals on some key aspects are as follows -a.     Membership will be on the same system as membership of theUnited- Kingdom Parliament, ie a single member elected for a geographicalarea.   This is simple to operate, easily understood by the public and provides for the clear and direct accountability of the electedrepresentative to his constituents.   The single transferable vote and alternative vote systems would not have these advantages; they arecumbersome and complicated, and in their divergence from current practice for local authority and Parliamentary elections they would be confusingto electors.11(confidential)
ab. The assemblies will assume some of the executive functions of theScottish and Welsh Offices, and of the non-democratic nominated authoritynow operating within their- boundaries.c. The financial allocation for the functions over which the assemblieshave responsibility will be in the form of a block grant voted by theUnited Kingdom Parliament which will take account of both local needs and the  desirability of some uniformity of standards of services in all partsof the United Kingdom.   It will be for the assemblies to judge amongcompeting priorities within Scotland and Wales in the light of their ovmassessment of their communities&apos; needs: as between, for example, hospital;and roads or schools and houses.d. The assemblies will not be expected to assume existing powers from local government, since this would undermine rather than improve democrat;There will, of course, be a new relationship to be established betweenthe assemblies and local government, and the new authorities created by recent local government reorganisation will require time to settle, downin their new functions before this can be achieved.29.   The setting up of Scottish and Welsh assemblies does not, however, detracin any way from the overriding interest of all the peoples of the United ;&apos;ingdin the determination of United Kingdom policies as a whole.   The United KingdoParliament and the central Government Ministers will of course remain fullyresponsible for the overall interests of the United Kingdom and it is essentiathat the determination of United Kingdom policies should fully reflect theneeds and contributions of all its constituent parts.   For this reason theGovernment regard it as essential that both Scotxand and Wales should retain their existing number of Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom Parliaaenand that there should continue to be Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales who act as full members of the United Kingdom Government in formingUnited Kingdom policies.   This is especially important in delation to thedistribution of resources as between Scotland, Wales and the regions   jof England:   these are fundamentally political decisions and cannot in the12
confidentialGovernment *s view &quot;be delegated to a nominated Exchequer Board as the authorityto he responsible for this task. It must he determined within the government itself, with the two Secretaries of State able&apos;to speak for Scotland andWales, and approved in the House of Commons with Scotland and Wales fullyrepresented in it. -30.   The discovery of oil and gas deposits in the Worth Sea and Celtic Seapromises - though there is much to be done/(before the premise is fulfilled -new economic and industrial opportunities for the less prosperous areas inScotland and Wales and the different parts of England.   The Government havealready acted: the headquarters of the Offshore Supplies Office of theDepartment ofjEnergy is to be transferred to Glasgow and the new british national Oil Corporation is to have its headquarters in Scotland.   Still more^-^important in the Scottish context is the Governments intention to establish a Scottish Development Agency, which is to be responsible to the Secretary ofState for Scotland.   Its task will be to strengthen the instruments availablefor promoting the development-and restructuring of the Scottish economy.   Itwill also carry out in Scotland appropriate functions of the national enterprise Board.   And within the British Airports Authority   a separateorganisation to be known as Scottish Airports is to be set up.   similar arrangements will be made in Wales to strengthen the instruments for promoting the development of Wales&apos; economy.31.   The Government is determined that the community and the regions in needreceive their full and fair share of the profits resulting from the exploitation of these new energy resources.   This must mean that maximum benefit goes to redress the regional imbalances in Scotland, Wales and England which have followed in the wake of the first Industrial Revolution.32.   The task of economic reconstruction is one for both central and regional government.   Creating assemblies in Scotland arid Wales will not of itself bea solution to our regional unemployment problems which have been so intractableup to now.   Central government will have to take direct action on the linesalready put forward in the White Paper on the Regeneration of British Industry.OFF-SHORE OIL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT13
But there must be scope too for real initiative .and participation at the levellof the assemblies, for instance by drawing up regional economic plans, and consideration will need to be given to the relationship between the BevelopmeillAgencies and the Assemblies.CONCLUSION33.   In its approach to devolution the Government is concerned to fosterdemocratic control over the increasingly complex processes of modem governaetiland to bring government closer to the people.   The people and theirrepresentatives must have a full share in the decision-making process.   This the main objective - to make a reality of the principle of democraticaccountability.   The Government has now decided in principle the way in whichthis should be accomplished in Scotland and Wales.34.   The Government intends to legislate for the establishment of Scottish and welsh assemblies as soon as possible.   Much work still remains to be done andmany critical decisions taken on which the Government will wish to have the widest consultations.   But when detailed schemes have been worked out andimplemented the Government believe   that this could bring great benefits tothe people of Scotland and Wales.   They would-be able to have a decisive voice in the running of their own domestic affairs.   At the same time the politicaland economic unity of the United Kingdom would be preserved- - with all theattendant benefits from that unity which accrue to the people of Scotland andWales no less than to the people in the different parts of England.   Thereare, of course, many material aspirations and social objectives which devolutilcannot further.   Nor can it solve - indeed if wrong decisions were taken itcould aggravate - our basic economic problems of how to raise the national output, reduce inflation, and secure a satisfactory balance of payments.   TheGovernment are, however, confident that, given the will to make devolutionxfork, the proposals here outlined can provi.de a framework which will give fullscope for the creative energies of all our people.10 September 197414(confidential)
. APPENDIX&apos;   EXTRACT MOM THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT&quot;DEVOLUTION WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM&quot;; - Part I  THE SCHEMES RECOMMENDED IN THE MAJORITY report and THE MEMORANDUM&apos; OF DISSENTA.  Legislative Devolution for Scotland and Wales *9.  Legislative devolution was recommended for Scotland by eight of thethirteen members of the Commission and for Wales by six members.(2)General description10. Responsibility for legislating oh specifically defined matters wouldbe transferred from the Westminster Parliament to directly elected scottish and Welsh legislatures. In relation to the transferred subjects theselegislatures would make such laws and policies as they saw fit, and would carry out all aspects of administration. The ultimate power and sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament would be preserved in all matters, but itwould be a convention that in the ordinary course this power would not beused to legislate for Scotland or Wales on a transferred matter without theagreement of the Scottish or Welsh Government^) The United KingdomGovernment would also have the power, for use in exceptional circumstances,to determine, with the approval of the United Kingdom Parliament, that aBill passed by the Scottish or Welsh legislature should not be submitted for the Royal Assent. The Scottish and Welsh executives would be composed of Ministers drawn from their respective assemblies who wouldthen operate the traditional Cabinet system of government. It is the intention that the Scottish and Welsh Governments should have a large measure offinancial independence, especially in matters of expenditure, but would besubject to such restraints as are necessary in the interests of the economicmanagement of the United Kingdom as a whole.Main features of the scheme11.  Legislative power in the following subjects would be transferredto the Scottish and Welsh legislative assemblies:  Local government Road passenger transportTown and country planning            , i HarboursNew towns Other environmental services (e.g.H    . prevention of pollution, coast pro-Wousmg tection and flood prevention)Building control Education (probably excluding univer-Water supply and sewerage necessities)Ancient  monuments  and  historic   Youth and community servicesbuildings Sports and recreationRoads (including the construction,   Arts and culture (including the Welshuse and licensing of vehicles) and Gaelic languages)OThe proposals for legislative devolution to Scotland and Wales are outlined inparagraphs 1125 to 1153 of the Majority Report. The strengths and weaknesses of legislative devolution are discussed in more detail in paragraphs 733 to 826.(3) Majority Report, paragraph 1126.150061iB*2
Social work services (including, for Agriculture,   fisheries   and   foodScotland, probation and after-care) (except price support and someHealth other functions)Miscellaneous regulatory functions Forestry(including matters such as betting, Crown estatesgaming, and lotteries, obscene pub- Tourismlications, shop hours and liquor-licensing) -12. Legislative power in the following additional matters would betransferred to the Scottish Assembly only:  Police Legal matters, including law reformFire services Highlands and Islands developmentCriminal policy and administration        (including crofting)prisons Sea transport  11Administration of justice13. In the subjects listed above the Westminster Parliament would normally cease to legislate for Scotland and Wales (though existing UnitedKingdom legislation in these fields would continue to apply initially). Butthe United Kingdom Parliament and Government would continue to beresponsible for the international aspects of transferred matters. It is alsoenvisaged that the Scottish and Welsh assemblies might have some limited powers in relation to consumer protection, road freight, civil aviation and broadcasting.14. The legislative assemblies in Scotland and Wales would each have about 100 members directly elected for a fixed term of 4 years by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation, though in the moresparsely populated areas of Scotland the alternative vote system might beadopted. All matters relating to the franchise and to elections, to the assembly(though not elections to local authorities) would be reserved to the UnitedKingdom Parliament.15&apos;.&apos; The Scottish and Welsh executives would consist of Ministersdrawn from their respective assemblies. Normally the leader of the majorityparty would be chief Minister (or Premier) and would form a Cabinet whichwould operate in accordance with the traditional Westminster principlesof collective and ministerial responsibility. Scotland and Wales would eachhave a separate civil service.16. Scotland and Wales v/ould continue to be represented in the westminster Parliament, but their representation in proportion to population would be the same as for England. This would probably reduce thenumber of Scottish MPs at Westminster from 71 to about 57; and thenumber of Welsh MPs from 36 to about 31.17. The offices of Secretary of State fo*&apos; Scotland and Wales would disappear, but Scotland and Wales would each have a Minister with thespecial responsibility of representing its interests in the Cabinet.(4)(*) Paragraph 1148 of the Majority Report.
18. There are detailed proposals for finance which the Report says are open to modification^5) The chief object would be to give the Scottish and welsh Governments maximum freedom in expenditure. Each would have its &quot;fair share of United Kingdom resources&apos;&quot; and freedom to allocateexpenditure on the transferred services according to its own chosenpriorities.(6) Scotland and Wales might also have some limited powers of independent taxation, and perhaps a share of United Kingdom taxes. Butthe assemblies&apos; income would come mainly from United Kingdom subventions-tions. They might also be able to raise loans to meet capital expenditure.19. The determination of Scotland&apos;s and Wales&apos; &quot;fair share of UnitedKingdom resources &quot; would be in the hands of a nominated Exchequer board which would be independent of the Scottish, Welsh and United kingdom governments. Exceptionally the United Kingdom Government could reject the Board&apos;s recommendation with ; the approval of the United kingdom parliament. 11B. A Scheme for Elected Assemblies in Scotland&apos;, Wales and the EnglishRegions20. This scheme of intermediate level governments was the mainproposal in the Memorandum of Dissent signed by two members of theCommission^7)General description21. The scheme seeks to achieve a substantial measure of devolution of power from the central Government to Scotland, Wales and the english regions. It could, however, be considered for application to Scotland andWales alone. Under the scheme the United Kingdom Parliament and government would remain responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy on all matters, but directly elected Scottish and Welsh and english regional assemblies would be responsible for adjusting UnitedKingdom policies to the special needs of their areas and putting them intoeffect. The Scottish, Welsh and English regional Governments would be runon the local authority pattern with a functional committee structure and noton the Cabinet model as in the scheme of legislative devolution. They would assume control of all the regional outposts of central Government now operating in their areas including the Scottish and. Welsh Offices in theirpresent form and the regional and local offices of other central Governmentdepartments.(8) Thus these outposts, which employ very substantial numbersof civil servants, would be completely &quot; bived off &quot; from central Government.(5) Paragraphs 679 to 693 of the Majority Report describe ?. scheme of regional financeintended to bring about the maximum degree of regional independence. Paragraphs 775 to 777discuss this scheme in relation to the problems of legislative devolution generally. Paragraphs1134 to 1139 apply it to the Commission^ specific proposals for legislative devolution inScotland and Wales.(0) Majority Report, paragraph 1134.(&apos;) The scheme is summarised on pages xvi to xx of the Memorandum of Dissent and developed more fully in paragraphs 208 to 276.(8) The term &quot; regional&quot; includes where appropriate, the all-Scotland or all-Wales level.It does not mean the regional level of local government in Scotland; nor that Scotland andWales are to be equated with English regions.
The &quot; intermediate level&quot; governments (i.e. the Scottish, Welsh and english regional governments) would also take over completely the functions ofcertain ad hoc authorities operating in their areas (e.g. health and water authorities); and they would be given some supervisory responsibilities inrespect of the activities in their parts of the country of the various industrial and commercial authorities (e.g. gas and electricity boards). The &quot; inter-mediate level&quot; governments would not be limited to the specific functions or duties conferred on them by Parliament; they would have a general residualcompetence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas. They would have some independent revenue-raising powers and sufficient financial &quot; independence &quot; of central Government to give them the requisite degree of freedom to carry out their duties and responsibilities.Main features of the scheme22. The scheme envisages that the broad range of functions set out inparagraph 21 above would be devolved to an assembly and governmentin Scotland, in Wales and in each of, say, five English regions. Eachassembly would consist of about 100 members elected by the single trans-transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of -fouryears. The executive of each government would consist of a numberof functional departments or divisions staffed by the authority&apos;s own civil,servants. There would be departments or divisions for such functions asFinance, Education, Health and Social Security, the Environment, etc. each department or division would be controlled by a committee drawn fromthe membership of the assembly reflecting the balance of party strengths.23.  Each assembly would be able to make &quot;ordinances&quot;: (a) to implement United Kingdom policies and legislation and to adaptthem to the special needs of the area; and(b) to give effect to their residual power to act for the welfare andgood government of the people in the area.(9)24. Each intermediate level government would have its own civilservice and a separate ombudsman. There would be no change in thefunctions of local authorities, although they would deal with the appropriateintermediate government instead of with the central Government as atpresent. They would have direct representation in the intermediate level governments.(10)25. The general financial arrangements are outlined at the end ofparagraph 21 above. A possible development of these arrangement:; isoutlined in Appendix B of the Memorandum of Dissent. Jt is designed togive the intermediate level governments a considerable degree of financialand economic independence of central Government; and to improve the ability of the central Government to achieve the major objectives of national economic policy such as full employment, regionally and nationally, and asatisfactory rate of economic growth.(9) These powers are subject to various safeguards which are set Govt in paragraphs 242to 245 of the Memorandum of Dirsent.(10) Memorandum of Dissent paragraphs 212 and 254 to 255.
26. At the centre, the scheme envisages that Members of Parliament, by being relieved of a great deal of detail, would have time for a much greatershare in Government policy making including more influence on the decisions which United Kingdom Ministers have to take in the Council of ministers in Brussels; for these purposes MPs would need to be organised infunctional committees matching each of the main Departments of Govern-ment. The composition of the House of Lords might be altered to include members of the &quot; intermediate level&quot; governments.27. The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would remain as members of the United Kingdom Cabinet though their existing departments would be taken over by the Scottish and Welsh Governments. They wouldhave the special responsibility of safeguarding and promoting Scottish and welsh interests in all Cabinet decisions. A jthird Cabinet Minister wouldperform a similar function for the English regions. There would be no reduction in the number of Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster.C. Executive Devolution for Scotland,&apos; Wales and Eight English Regions28. This scheme was recommended by two members who signed theMajority Report.(u)General description29. The scheme seeks to achieve a substantial measure of devolutionfrom the central Government to Scotland, Wales and the English regions.It is in essence a more restricted and less radical version of the scheme presented at B above. The United Kingdom Parliament and Governmentwould be responsible for the framework of legislation and major policy inall matters, but wherever possible would transfer to directly elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales and eight English regions the responsibility,within that framework, for devising specific policies and executing themand for general administration. The intention would be to promote themaximum amount of regional participation and variation consistent withthe general policy aims of the United Kingdom Government. The two members who support the scheme regard it as an essential feature that itshould be applied in a more or less uniform way throughout GreatBritain.(12) It could, however, like Scheme B above, be considered for application to Scotland and Wales only.30.  Its main differences from Scheme B are:  (a) The assemblies would have no independent revenue raising powers.(b) The assemblies would not have a residual competence to act for the welfare and good government of the people in their areas.(c) The assemblies would not have the wide ordinance-making powerproposed in Scheme B.(d) The functions of the assemblies would be limited initially and increased in the light of experience; they would not necessarily take over all the existing executive functions of the Scottish Office(&quot;)The scheme itself is outlined in paragraphs 1154 to 1173 of the Majority Report;executive devolution in general is discussed at greater length in paragraphs 827 to 919.(12) Majority Report, paragraph 1155.
- and the Welsh Office, nor necessarily all. the other outposts of central Government departments operating in Scotland or Wales orin the English regions. &apos;   -(e) The assemblies would not necessarily effect a general take-over of; the work of the various non-industrial, non-commercial ad ad hoc authorities operating in their areas.(f) The assemblies&apos; relationship with local authorities in their areasmight well be different from that envisaged in Scheme B (seeparagraph 35 below).(g) Scheme C does not recommend any changes in the institutions of central Government.Main features of the scheme.31. Scotland, Wales and the eight English regions would each havean assembly of about 100 members directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation for a fixed term of four, years.Each assembly would administer with as much freedom as possible thelegislation and policies of the United Kingdom Parliament and Government.32. Functions would be conferred on the assembly by the amendmentof existing law and any new legislation relating to specific matters. acts of Parliament would lay down policy in broad terms, authorising theassembly to fill in much of the detail in some cases by statutory instruments.(13) Executive authority would be vested not in Ministers butin the assembly itself, which would delegate much of its authority tofunctional committees, as local authorities now do.(14) The transfer of functions would be a lengthy process, spread over many years. At first the assemblies would have a limited range of powers in matters such asstrategic planning, but these powers would be gradually extended as timev/ent on.(15) Most of the existing executive functions of the Scottish and welsh Offices would be devolved. Almost all subjects would offer somescope for regional involvement^16)33. The regional assemblies would not have any independent revenueraising powers. They would be financed out of United Kingdom fundsnegotiated direct with the central Government. Their total expenditure would ultimately be for the United Kingdom Government to decide. TheGovernment would also need to be satisfied that each assembly&apos;s proposed allocation of expenditure was broadly consistent with central policies.Subject to this the assembly would make its own expenditure decisions.(17)34. The scheme would not involve any change in Parliamentaryrepresentation, but it envisages that the separate offices of the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would disappear. There would be a minister with general responsibility for regional affairs^18)(^Majority Report, paragraph 1156.(**) Majority Report, paragraph 1165.(15) Majority Report, paragraph 1160.(16) Majority Report, paragraph 1157.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraphs 1157 and 1163.(18) Majority Report, paragraphs 1168 to.1169.
35. The relationship between the regional assemblies and local govern-ment could develop in a number of different ways.(&quot;) Three possible waysare described: (a) local authorities could be completely subordinate to the regional government and it would be for each regional government to decide on the distribution of functions between itself and its local authorities;(b) local and regional authorities could each be autonomous in functionsallocated to them from the centre, and could work in parallel; localauthorities would remain accountable for the proper performance oftheir functions to the United Kingdom Government;(c) the relationship between local and regional government could dependon what Parliament considered appropriate in each separate field oflegislation.36. The precise relationship between the regional assemblies andad hoc bodies would depend on a detailed review.(20)-; - -&apos;;      - &apos;i -&apos;.; &apos;: &apos; .-- -        :&apos;V. -v&apos;^&quot;&apos;-&apos;&apos; ;rj&apos;;yD. Welsh Advisory Council37. Three members who signed the Majority Report recommend theestablishment of a Welsh Advisory Council.(21)General description38. The reasoning behind this scheme is that Wales has derived great benefit from the comparatively recent appointment of its Secretary of State,and that the economic and other problems facing the Principality can best be dealt with through the development and retention of that office. So thescheme aims to reconcile the continued existence of the Secretary of Stateand the Welsh Office in its present form with the widely expressed desire for a directly elected assembly to act as the voice of Wales. Accordinglythere would be a directly elected Welsh Council to advise the Secretary ofState and to scrutinise the operation of Government policies and agenciesin Wales.Main features of the scheme39. The Welsh Advisory Council would be directly elected by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation and would consist ofabout 60 members. It would replace the existing nominated Welsh Council.It would have no legislative, executive or administrative powers. Its functions would be to scrutinise, debate and make representations to the Secretary ofState about Government policies and activities in Wales, including theactivities of the nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies operatingthere. It would inevitably be interested in, but would in no sense supervise,the activities of local authorities.(22)40. The CounciFs scrutiny would range over such matters as the Welsheconomy, employment, major road development and land use proposals,(&quot; Majority Report, paragraphs 831 to 833 and 1158.(20) Majority Report, paragraph 1159.(21)jThe&quot;scheme is set out in the Majority Report, at paragraphs 1174 to 1183.(^Majority Report, paragraphs 1175 and 1178.
public services and the Welsh language. It would also hold an annualdebate on the Governments expenditure proposals for Wales.(23) It would operate through standing committees and be financed from the UnitedKingdom Exchequer. It would also have the right to nominate some membersof ad hoc bodies operating in Wales.(2*)41. The Secretary of State and other Welsh Ministers would on invitationattend the Council to explain policy, answer criticisms and receive advice.Officials of the Welsh Office would also be invited to report to the Counciland to answer questions on their activities. Members of Parliament fromWelsh constituencies might attend and speak, but not vote, at the CounciFsplenary sessions.(25)E. A Scottish Council with Advisory and Legislative Functions42. One member who signed the Majority Report recommended theestablishment of a Scottish Council with advisory and legislative functions.(2B)General description43. There would be a directly elected Scottish Council which would havethe same advisory functions as proposed for the Welsh Council and sum-marised at paragraphs 38 to 41 above. In addition, however, the Scottish Council would have some powers in relation to Scottish legislation. thus it would take the Second Reading, Committee and Report stages of scottish bills referred to it by the House of Commons. Unless a Bill was thenrecalled by the Leader of the House, the Scottish Council would be ableto give it a Third Reading and submit it for Royal Assent without any reference back to the House of Commons and without any passage throughthe House of Lords.F. Regional Co-ordinating and Advisory Councils for the English Regions44. Eight members of the Commission recommended this scheme for english regional councils with advisory and co-ordinating powers.(27)General description45. The scheme is based on the view that it would not be right for theEnglish regions to be given any legislative or executive powers now exercised by central Government, and that it would be illogical (following the recent reorgunisation of local authorities) for them to take over powers from local government. Yet at the regional level it is believed that there isscope for more effective co-operation between local authorities and a needfor more open discussion and democratic influence on those matters affectingthe region which are decided by central Government or by ad hoc bodies.(23) Majority Report, paragraph 1176.(&quot;) Majority Report, paragraph 1178.^25) Majority. Report, paragraph 1177.(26)Thc scheme is described in paragraphs 1184 to 1187 of the Majority Report. It isbased on the proposals of the Scottish Constitutional Committee of the Conservative party which are discussed in paragraphs 966 to 975.(27)The scheme is summarised in paragraphs 1195 to 1209 of the Majority Report;paragraphs 920 to 965 discuss in more detail the implications of schemes of this kind.
To meet this need, and to give advice to the central Government on regionalproblems, there would be regional councils primarily composed of localgovernment councillors.      . -Main features of the scheme ,46. There would be eight English regions (Le. those that have alreadybeen established for economic planning purposes). Each region would havean advisory council which would consist of about 60 members. Four-fifths of the members of each council would be members of the local authorities inthe region and would be &quot; elected &quot; by those local authorities to membership of the regional advisory council. One-fifth of the members would be nominated by the central Government to secure representation from industryand commerce, trade unions, education and other interests.47. The regional advisory councils would have no legislative, executiveor administrative powers.  Their functions would be to:  (a) take over the functions of the present nominated regional economic planning councils;(b) advise on Government spending in their regions;(c) advise and make representations to central Government about government policies and activities generally in their regions, includingthe operations of nationalised industries and other ad hoc bodies(some of whose members they would nominate);id) have a mainly co-ordinating function in the field of local government.48. Under (rf) it is envisaged that the regional council would play an important part in the formulation of the broad economic and land usestrategy which would be the regional framework within which central andlocal government services would be provided. The structure plans of localauthorities would have to fit into this general strategy and would besubmitted for Ministerial approval through the regional council with itscomments. The council would by agreement promote and co-ordinate action by local government in the region. It would have no power of directionover local authorities in the region and would not itself administer services or undertake works.(28)49. In carrying out their functions the councils would ordinarily meet in public. They would elect their own chairmen.G.  A scheme for Co-ordinating Committees of Local Authorities50. This scheme is recommended for England by one member of theCommission^28)General description51. The scheme is based on the view that in England the best way ofdevolving power from the centre is to concentrate on strengthening thepower of the new larger local authorities.  It is envisaged that if this were(28) Majority Report, paragraph 1204.(29) It is outlined in paragraphs 1210 to 1214 of the Majority Report.
done the only need at regional level would be to co-ordinate the planningactivities of local authorities. Instead of the present voluntary co-operationbetween local authorities there would be established a formal system of regional committees. Each would consist entirely of indirectly elected representatives of local authorities and there would be no provision fornominated members. It would be mandatory for local authorities to submit their plans for the regional committee and obtain its comments before submitting them for Ministerial approval. The present economic planning councils would be abolished. It is envisaged that the scheme might be combined with regional committees of the House of Commons which mightvet regional plans and Government expenditure in the regions.(30)(30) The organisation of the House of Commons on these lines is discussed in paragraphs1050 to 1092 of the Majority Report.
