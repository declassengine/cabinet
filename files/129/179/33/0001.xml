THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC majesty*S government(74) 123 copr NO    301 November 1974CABINETSOCIAL SERVICES expenditure memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services.     We need to reach decisions .now about the improvements to1be made to social security benefits in 1975&quot;   My proposals which are set out below havebeen discussed with the Chancellor, whose paper on public: expenditure    //priorities (C(74) 120) assumes that the cost in 1975-76 and subsequent years   of the proposals on which I am seeking immediate decisions will beregarded as of the first priority.2.     With inflation at present rates we are bound to plan for two upratingsof social security benefits in 1975&apos;   During our Cabinet discussions beforethe Election (CC(74) 35th   Conclusions, Item 3) we were considering thepossibility of an uprating next March.   This would no longer be practicable.But a decision now and an announcement in connection with the Budget wouldenable us to set 7 April 1975 as the operative date.   I propose that weshould then increase pensions and other long-term benefits from the .present  10 single and  16 married to  11.60 and  18.50 respectively.Short-term benefits would be increased by  1.20 single and  2 married.The supplementary benefit scales would be increased correspondingly, withthe long-term rate going up by the same amount as the contributory pension.3.    These increases will be judged in the light of our commitment tolink increases in pensions with the rise in wages, and increases in short-term benefits with the rise in prices.   The amounts have been assessed by reference to the known movement of earnings and pricesover the latest period for which we have figures, corresponding in length to the period that will elapse between upratings.   I have&apos;&quot; - 1 &apos; . -     - &quot;
reluctantly accepted adoption of this &quot;historical&quot; method of assessing the increases because of the difficulties and uncertainties of basing the increases on a forecast of earnings and price movements to the date of the uprating,,   The April uprating should restore the purchasing power ofpensions to last July!s level, but it is unlikely to restore the pensionas a percentage of earnings at that date.   Wo method, however, can assure a constant relationship between the level of pension and the levelof earningso   The method I propose will mean that pensioners will do better under it as the rate of inflation abates,&apos;i   w4o     The cost of the April uprating would be  780 million in a full year at 1974 Survey prices.   Allowing for a second uprating in Decembersimilarly related to the movement of earnings and prices the additionto my public expenditure programme in 1975-76, compared with a singleuprating in July, would be about  200 million.   There would be no significant effort in later years if we can get back to annual upratings.   TheChancellor^ paper (c(74) 120) allows for only one uprating in thelate Autumn of each year after 1975*   On this basis, because of thebuoyant income from earnings-related contributions, no increase in therates of contribution will be needed beyond those included in the social security Amendment Bill which fell at the dissolution and which Ihave now reintroduced.5.    In view of the restraints on public expenditure, I am proposing nochange in the earnings rule this time, nor in maternity or death grants.But we are bound to move on the supplementary benefit disregards, which havenot been raised since I966.   This is an essential first step in our pledge to give greater financial support to one-parent families.   I propose thatthe disregards should be recast and roughly doubled in the course of next.. &apos; &apos; I i &apos; &apos;   &apos;&apos;&apos;:&apos;V&apos;     &apos; - . j ii     It:   V 7/summer. The cost in the first full year is  13 million with consequentialextra expenditure on rent rebates of  5 million. Some increase in heatingallowances - of an amount to be decided later - will also be necessary.6.    I would also propose to include in the Bill provision to make subsequentupratings by the affirmative resolution procedure, on the model of our predecessors&apos; 1973 legislation.   We cannot decide yet on the amount ofthe second uprating in 19759 hut I would see advantage in giving a
general indication of our intention as to timing, when the coming upratingis announced in connection with the Budget.   The statement could he onthe lines of the passage in the Annex.   The Chancellor takes the view thatthis would also he the time to say that bringing the pension ratesup-to-date towards the end of the year would obviate the need for aChristmas bonus j   but I fear that to say this now? rather than on some suitable occasion later on, would mean forfeiting some of the goodwillwe are gaining from the announcement of this year8s bonus, with its widercoverage than in previous years.7.     I propose that family allowances (FAM) should be increased from april 1975 hy 60p for second children and 50p for third and subsequent children, the increases being subject to normal tax.   This will give 1.50 Pe^ eligible child which will still be below the I968 value for thenon-taxpayer, and below the child credit figure proposed by the Tories.The cost to the Exchequer net of tax receipts (ie roughly the equivalent of the demand effect) will be about  100 million at 1974 Survey prices in1975&quot;&quot;76 5   the cost in public expenditure terms will be higher at about 150 million. //8.     I attach the highest priority to this 60p-50p increase of FAM nextyear.   It is because of this priority that, reluctantly, I have&apos;concurred in the postponement of the introduction of the full soheme of child allowance(OA), which includes the first child, until 1977J   though my understandingis that accommodation problems would in any event have made it very difficultto implement a full child allowance scheme in 1976.9.     In his paper the Chancellor has allowed for  CAto be introduced in 1977 at a net Exchequer cost of  120 million in1977-78, ie  20 million more than the cost in 1975-76 after an increasein FAM.   This implies an initial rate of CA of  2.16 in oash terms.   Ihad myself proposed a higher rate but have acoepted that the rate need notbe settled now and that provision in the public expenditure survey shouldmeanwhile be on the scale proposed by the Chancellor.   My position is, howevereserved on the initial rate of CA and the provision for uprating in thefuture.
10o   None of the above proposals will involve any increase in permanent staff beyond the complements already allowed for to enable my Departmentto discharge its commitments.11.    Conclusion.   I invite   my oolleagues to approve the proposals I have set out above on uprating contributory benefits, family allowances and supplementary benefits;   and for bringing up to date the supplementary benefit disregards;   and to note where we stand on the introduction of theCA scheme.1.1BACDepartment of Health and Social security london SE11 November 1974. //&apos;&apos; &apos;  &apos;:/-a4

PASSAGE FOR-PENSION STATEtfElITWe increased pensions less than fear months ago by almost JO par cent,to their present level of  10 and  16.   We are also proposing to pay a. Christmas bonus of  10 this year.   Vo are ctatutorily required to makea further general uprating not later than July 1975. /&apos; But in the light ofthe present exceptionally high rate of inflation, vo have decided to make. the next uprating early in April 1975* whereby the rates for pensionsand other long-term benefits will be increased by  1*60 and  2*50 to  1.1.60and  18.50 for the single and. married rates respectivelyt and. short-term benefits by  ,iv.20 single and  2 married.   The cost at an annual rate of thisi uprating will be about [  ] million for National Insurance benefits raid&apos;j       j million in total. &apos;&quot;,2.    We intend, however, to move once more to an annual cycle of upratingsas inflation is brought under control.   To this end and bearing in mind thatthe, late autumn is generally accepted as&apos; the best time at which to uprate. benefits, we are planning to make a further uprating in December 1975*On the foregoing basis it is not proposed to alter the rates of; fully-earnings-related National Insurance contributions which the Social Security(Amendment) Bill now before Parliament proposes for introduction from    - &apos;&apos;April 1975.        .. &quot;&apos; - --  ! 1 . &quot;&apos;SECRET
