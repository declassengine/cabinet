STRATEGY AND PRIORITIES        - -(Memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff)introduction the situation confronting Ministers is dangerously precarious.2.    The quadrupling of oil prices which followed the last round of fighting in the Middle East has created a very large imbalance in the world economy.,This has exacerbated the down-turn in world economic activity which began in mid-1973 and threatens to drive most industrial countries into recession,and to disrupt the economies of the poorer non-oil-producing countries,particularly in Asia.    The instability of the economic situation is creatingnew international political tensions between oil producers and oil consumers,between rich industrial countries and developing countries, and among theindustrial countries themselves.    These tensions are made worse by the increasing strains within NATO, by the uncertainties about the future of the eec, and the spread of nuclear weapons.3.    Against an international background which is both rapidly changing andpotentially unstable - and which the United Kingdom is increasingly unableto influence - Ministers are faced with a number of critical issues whichwill require immediate attention.     The most urgent of these problems areeconomic - inflation and the social contract;   the threat of bankruptciesand the loss of industrial confidence;   the uncertainties about unemployment;the danger that, with the balance of payments in such heavy deficit, any lossof foreign confidence could very quickly produce an unmanageable run on sterling and a serious depreciation of the exchange rate;   the difficulty of .bringing increased claims for public expenditure within the resources available.4.    But, while the immediate problems are, in appearance, economic, thereare no simple economic remedies which will produce easy or lasting solutions.If solutions are to be found they will need to be long-term in character,and they will have far-reaching social and political, as well as economic,implications.1
5.     In present circumstances, Minis-bors viill find themselves faoed with theneed to take decisions on a wide range of issues.     In many instances theywill he urged, or tempted, to take the kind of action which will ease theimmediate situation.    But action which is designed to ease difficulties inone sector will often add to the difficulties of other sectors;, . and measures which concentrate on the short term are liable, all too frequently,&quot;to exacerbate difficulties in the longer term.6.    For all these reasons Ministers need, at the beginning of. the new parliament, to take stock of the situation as a whole;   andt in the light&apos;of that stocktaking, to take a view of priorities and their strategy for achieving them. .7.     This paper is intended to provide the basis for such a review.     It isconcerned not so much with specific recommendations for immediate action,but rather to identify the main issues and to suggest how they might be approached and how coherent solutions might be developed.I - LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES8.    The Governments principal longer-term objectives may be set out asfollows -- to effect a major improvement in the United Kingdom?s rate ofeconomic growth;- drastically to reduce the differences in prosperity and unemploy-ment in different parts of the country;, - to reduce inflation to acceptable levels;- to secure a satisfactory balance of payments position;- to provide the basis for sustainable increases in both individualliving standards and publicly provided services;- to bring about, by fiscal policies and by the extension of public ownership a fairer distribution of income, wealth and power insociety.2
9.    The progress -that can he made towards these objectives during the next five years is necessarily limited, and&apos; in the next two years very limitedindeed. &apos; The object must therefore he to work out policies and prioritieswhich&apos;will form a basis for their achievement in the longer termj -and-for .moving in:the right direction in the medium term.10.   In particular, the achievement of a higher rate of economic growth,,which is essential if the other objectives are to be achieved, will dependon the successful development of investment policies to increase&apos; productivity and exports, and of manpower policies&apos; to make the best use of the manpoweravailable and remove the constraints to growth resulting from endemic. &apos;*shortages of the right kinds of skill. . : 1- II - THE. MEDIUM TERM;   ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT .-Resource Constraints &apos; ..:&apos; &apos;11.   Not all policies depend on increased use of resources.    But what&apos;Ministers can do, over the next five years,, is to a considerable extentdetermined by the resources at their disposal.    Projecting the growth of resources is a hazardous undertaking, but experience shows that any government which takes ah over-optimistic view about the rate of growth of resources - and its capacity to- increase the rate of growth of national resources - will soon find itself heading for a situation in which it is over-committed, it has to cut back in Crisis conditions,and its failure to achieve unrealisable objectives results in frustration and, demoralisation.12.1   The average rate of increase of national output over the past 15 years has been 2.8 per cent a year.    In only 4 of those. 15.years has the rate of growth, been much above 3 per cent, and those have been years when the economyhas- been recovering from a recession.    On the best assessment of trends in productivity and the growth of the labour force, the. rate of growth ofnational output over the next/five years might be put at 3t per cent perannum. &apos;-.&apos;..-,13.   In considering the claims on this extra output the main conclusions are - .\     ,  &apos;  &apos; .. .. ,    &quot; ^......./.a.    after taking into account all the. likely,gains from North Sea Oil,if we are to get out of deficit by 1978-79. we shall have to devote
about 20 per cent of the probable &quot;increase In national resources overthe next.five years to. the balance of payments;b. if we are to sustain our present modest rate of economic.growth and provide the capital equipment necessary for full employment inthe medium term, we, need to increase productive investment,: both public and private, by up to about 5 per cent a year:   this extra investment would, if achieved, pre-empt a further 25 per cent of the:.probable :increase in.resources up to 1978-795 &apos;c. in consequence, ; if the needs of the balance, of payments, and productive investment are to be met, little more than half the increasein resources over the next five years is likely to be available, for increases in public expenditure.and in the real take-home pay of wage and salary earners;d. if planning is based on a. rate of. increase of private consumptionwhich is unrealistically low, the public will respond by greater wage -demands;   given the inflexible nature of public expenditure programmes,such demands will be at the expense of exports and investment, and thewhole strategy of &quot;borrowing through to 1979&quot; could collapse;e. even if public expenditure is allowed to increase at.the 2f percent a.year illustrated in the Public Expenditure Survey, this impliesa rate of increase in average real take-home pay of about 1-g- per cent. a year, or less than half the expected rate of increase of output and incomes;   the achievement of this over a five year period will have.,serious implications both for the burden of taxation, and for theproblem of containing demands for excessive increases in pay;f. redistributive taxation of income and wealth will not release-sufficient resources on anything like the scale needed to make possibleboth faster increases in workers1 living standards and public expen-.diture than those shown above.     Redistributive fiscal action isimportant; in relation to social equity, but it cannot offer a signifi-cant source of extra resources for increasing public expenditure orraising real wages.     Resources will be released to the extent thattaxation reduces the current consumption of the better-off.     So faras income is concerned, only 10 per cent of families have pre-taxincomes in excess of twice average industrial earnings, and theseincomes are already pretty heavily taxed;   so far as wealth taxes are
concerned, the people affected are not very numerous, and are likely topay them by reducing their savings or selling assets, rather than by reducing their expenditure on goods and services very much, so thatthe resources released for other purposes will&apos;be very small.Economic Management and Priority Objectives14o   Even if private consumption and public expenditure are contained within these limits, it will be difficult to achieve the required increases in exports and investment.     The size of the present deficit and the loss ofcompetitiveness from inflation, mean that a further downward movement of theexchange rate will almost certainly be necessary if the balance of paymentsobjective is to be achieved.    Judging by past performance, exchange rateadjustments may not be enough,   and active policies of export promotion will almost certainly be required,,15,   With industrial profits depressed, and lack of confidence widespread,it will be very difficult to induce the private sector to put in handinvestment on the scale which the economy needs for longer-term growth.General measures of fiscal and monetary policy by themselves may well fail to induce the increases in investment and exports which the economy needs.The role of the NEDC and Planning Agreements in promoting exports aridinvestment therefore need to be examined urgently, and other forms of collaboration between the Government and the private sector explorod.Ill - INFLATION16,   On present trends, the increase in retail prices between the fourthquarter&apos; of 1973 and the fourth quarter of 1974 will probably be of theorder of 17-20 per cent, and the corresponding increase over 1975 perhaps18-21 per cent.17. The strains resulting from a 35 per cent increase in prices over two years.will be very serious. But the implications for the longer term are even more disquieting.    Judging by the way in which increases5
:&apos; in prices ,and earnings have tended -to follow one another in the past, one must expect increases in retail prices of the order of 15-20 per centduring 1976, and of 10-15 per. cent in 1977* even if&apos; import prices behavereasonably favourably.18.   In other words, unless some means can be found to alter the way inwhich increases in prices and increases in earnings interact, it couldwell be three or four years before the rate of inflation came down tosingle figures;   and during that period one could, expect something like a doubling of the price level and a halving of the purchasing power of 1the pound.19.   In tackling inflation, all the short-term arguments favour mainten-ance of very tight price control, and continuing to subsidise food and nationalised industry prices at an increasing rate.    But -i. if&apos; the price code is not relaxed soon, the damage to industryand future investment prospects will be unacceptable;ii. to keep exports competitive, some depreciation of sterling overthe next year or so is probably unavoidable, and the impact on the.   price level will have to be accepted;  .iii. subsidies are at best a temporary and expensive expedient forbuying time.20,   Up to now, no effective way has been found of combining full employ-ment, price stability and uncontrolled free bargaining.     It is illusoryto suppose that a solution can be found simply by giving priority to freebargaining and unemployment; since the resulting inflation would itselfmake the employment objective Unattainable,     If statutory controls andmass unemployment are both rejected as unacceptable, then the only hopeis to try and build on and strengthen the social contract,, and get itaccepted as a continuing institutional method of. relating individualpay settlements to the overall needs of price stability., -This requires6
thai Ministers should start considering the development of the social contract in a longer-term context, rather than accepting the &quot;take itgently for the moment&quot; approach of the TUG.    A lot of thinking andpersuasion will be required if this approach is to have any chance ofsuccess:   a start needs to be made soon.IV - ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT - SHORT TERM21.   The prospects for output and employment next year are, at present,very uncertain.     There is no sign yet of the rise in unemployment which some observers have been predicting.     Whether further reflationaryaction is required, and what form it might take, will need very careful thought.I!22.,   More immediately, a number of companies in the private sector arein serious financial difficulties.     The combination of inflation incompanies&apos; costs which is not adequately allowed for by the tax system,the effects of the Price Code and the slowdown in activity has meant that profits have been drastically squeezed.    At the same time the verylarge increases in prices of raw materials and oil have created a very heavy demand for cash for financing stocks and work in progress.     This,coming at a time when industry was only beginning to recover from the1971-72 recession, has brought a lot of firms, both large and small, tonear bankruptcy..23.   In this situation it is very difficult to devise short-term measuresconsistent with.the medium-term:objectives of economic management. -   the threat of impending bankruptcies and rising unemployment will require some reflationary action and measures to improve industrial profitabilityand cash flow.     But, with the prospect of stagnation or recession in therest of the world next year, it will be necessary to proceed with consider-able caution;   i. if our creditors considered we were reflating too rashly,loss of foreign confidence could be a serious embarrassment, and makeexchange rate management more difficult;   ii. we could easily overdo it,as on so many past occasions, and leave industry without the capacity to expand exports fast enough when the recovery of world trade comes;   iii.action to reduce unemployment must depend, at least to some extent, on how effectively the social contract can be established and extended. secret
..V - INDUSTRIAL POLICY:   PRIVATE SECTOR ..24.   The Government is committed to a. substantial extension of public ownership, to an interventionist industrial policy, and to the encouroge-ment, in a variety of ways, of worker participation and industrial democracy-.     These commitments, superimposed on the commitment to continuedprice controls,, the squeeze on profits, and the liquidity crisis facinglarge parts of the private sector have created an atmosphere of uncertainty and hostility in the private sector of industry.     Until this uncertainty and hostility are removed, the private, sector is unlikely to plan, for theexpansion of investment, output and exports which the situation requires.25.   A first priority, therefore, for an incoming Government must be to restore confidence in the private sector.. /26.   Even when the Government?s most far-reaching proposals for theextension of public ownership have been implemented, a very large partof economic activity will remain in.the private sector.    For the fore-seeable future, we shall be living in a mixed private/public sectoreconomy.     It will be quite impractical in the near future for selectiveGovernment intervention to make up for loss of confidence and inadequatefinance in the private sector as a whole.    This means that. - .-. a..    that part of the economy which is.to remain in.the private sector must be given the certainty that it will in fact remain.inthe private sector, and be given assurances that it can operate effectively, within - if need.be - defined guidelines;b.   ..such assurances will need to include explicit commitments toallow the private sector to earn an adequate rate of profit, tohave access to sufficient funds for new investment -whetherthrough undistributed profits, or access to capital markets - arid. ;     a self-denying commitment by the Government to refrain from.,.   arbitrary acts of intervention or policy changes which disrupt. sensible corporate planning;8
Co     so far as those parts of the private sector which will be takeninto public ownership are concerned, the present managements must be suffiently clear about the Governments intentions, to ensure thatuncertainties do not inhibit decisions about investment, productionand marketing strategies.VI - INDUSTRIAL POLICY:   PUBLIC SECTOR27.   If nothing is done, the situation of the nationalised industries willbe well-nigh hopeless;     Since 1971. at least, Ministers have been inter-fering with the nationalised industriesfi wages and salaries and prices,and with their decisions on investment, location and choice of technique.They have done so mainly in the hope of buying time.    But the effect hasbeen -a. to introduce large distortions into the price structure,particularly for energy and transport;b. to lead to. a large-scale misallocation of resources, and toremove the basis for rational investment decision-taking by theindustries concerned;c. to remove the&apos;basis for any sensible wage-bargaining:   thenotion that &quot;the State will pay&quot; any subsidies that are necessaryto maintain output and employment is incompatible with rationalwage negotiation - and the irrationality involved quickly spreadsround the economy as a whole; , ,d. to destroy the concept of managerial responsibility for theconduct of the affairs of the nationalised industries:   the morale of nationalised industries&apos; management is, in consequence,lower than it has ever been;   the chances of getting sensible. management decisions from&apos; or attracting good new recruits toboards of existing nationalised industries have been seriously ijprejudiced;   and the prospects for the industries which theGovernment proposes to bring into public ownership are similarlyin doubt.
28.   In particular, the Government needs -a.     to. work out a strategy for energy prices which hears somerelation to the realities of the situation;   &apos;at present, in orderto keep down domestic fuel costs for the poor they are obligingnationalised industries to pay disproportionately large subsidies to the rich (who consume much more electricity and gas than the poor);11&quot;&apos;; . . T .   .     i. &apos;b0 v\to work out a strategy for transport which does not involvearbitrary subsidies for haphazardly selected sectors of the rail and bus networks,29.   In the longer term, the Government will need to&apos;frame new guide-lines for the nationalised industries (both those now nationalised, andihoseto be taken into public ownership) which will enable those industries to conduct their operations on commercial lines consistent with sensible principles of resource   allocation, while taking accountOf the strategic objectives of Government policy.VII - PUBLIC EXPENDITURE30.   The constraints on resources have already been described inparagraphs 11-13.   The need for exports, investment, and a minimumincrease in private consumption to avert an uncontrollable pay explosionall indicate that public expenditure should not be allowed to increase over tho next five years by more than 2 - por cent a year in terms of direct demand on resources.31o   Even.after the Defence Review, the scope for increases in publioexpenditure will thus be very small,; and Ministers will find it extremely difficult to get their existing programmes within the over-all total.   This means that Ministers can only take on new commitmentsinvolving significant amounts of public expenditure over the next five years if they are able to find compensating savings on existing programmes, whether by cutting out existing activities, or by slowing down rates of investment and projected improvements in services.   the manpower increases proposed for the social services are incompatible10
with our near-static labour force   The constraints are such as torequire not merely a major re-appraisal of priorities across the board:they also constitute a major obstacle to the achievement of aspira-tions for social improvement which are shared by Ministers and a large body of public opinion.   The public have come to believe that what isdesirable is possible.   To convince them that this is not so willrequire a major effort in education and persuasion, directed notmerely at the public at large, but at pressure groups lobbying for particular interests, and at the professions - eg in architecture,health and education - whose views about standards are unrelated to thefacts of the economic situation.:&apos; !;SI WmMmiMM Silt I32.   Local authorities pose special difficulties for public expenditure control.   The Central Government has reasonably good controlof the majority of their capital programmes, but control of their current expenditures is very imperfect.   Unless moans can be found torectify this, Ministers are likely to find that their objectives and priorities are being frustrated by decisions of local authorities,,33*   Short-term increases in public expenditure may be suggested as a means of dealing with rising unemployment next year.   Most increases in public expenditure are so irreversible that to go any distance downthis road would be very dangerous.   All the evidence suggests thatattempts to use public expenditure as a means of dealing with short-termunemployments almost invariably backfire, and exacerbate the difficultiesof public expenditure control in the medium term,.     ....&apos;     &apos; VIII - HOUSING POLICY34*   Housing is one of the most politically sensitive areas of policy,and, in social terms, one of the most important.   In all its various forms, public expenditure on housing is running at some  3f000 million a year, or 50 per cent more than two years ago.11
35*   No post-war Government has found it easy to work out or implementan effective housing policy.   Given the general economic situation,the recent disproportionately rapid inflation in building costs, andthe.potential open-endedness of the commitments for better and more heavily subsidised housing, Ministers now need to work out a newstrategy for housing which, recognising the Importance of housingobjectives in.social policy, makes expenditure as effective as possiblIn this^ four questions are relevant, both for the public and theprivate sector:-. ./a.     what can the Government do toMensure that effort is concentrated on those areas and those types of dwellings whereshortages are worst?b.     can further steps be taken to ensure a steady output ofhouses at reasonable prices despite the difficulties now facing the building industry?   This will involve both greater collabora-tion between the Government and the building societies, and thedevelopment of the &quot;positive planning&quot; element of the landnationalisation proposals;Co     can financial assistance be concentrated on those whogenuinely need it?   A sizeable percentage of those enjoying thebenefits (eg of the holding down of mortgage rates, the rentsfreeze, and improvement grants) can probably afford to do withoutd.     can the ever-increasing polarisation of the housing marketbetween public sector and owner-occupied dwellings be reversedby, for instance, reactivating, or developing substitutes for,the private sector rental market?IX - BRITAIN AND THE EXIPINAL WORLD- - ;      ^   - ii36.   Domestic policies have to be developed in the light of the constraints imposed by the external situation.The Middle East and the Oil Situation37.   If the Arab/lsrael dispute is not settled, there is&apos; a continuingrisk that the Arabs will restrict or cut off supplies of Middle Eastoil, and there is little the industrial countries can do to stopthem.   The Americans clearly wish to put pressure on OPEC to reduoe12
oil prices., But this could provoko hostile reactions from the Arabs,and hence prejudice the prospect for any Arab/lsrael settlement.   TheUnited States is less vulnerable to cuts in oil supplies than other industrial countries, so that there is a risk that the adverseconsequence of any failure of United States policies will fall hardeston Western Europe and Japan.   All this suggests that we shouldcontinue to give maximum support.to. United States efforts to promote a Middle East settlement, but should do our best to prevent any immediate moves to excessive prossure on the oil producers.   this need not prevent us going ahead with; those aspects of the InternationalEnergy Programme which are advantageous to us.The^British Defence Review and European Security380   We shall be carrying through our own Defence Review at a timewhen Soviet   superiority over NATO forces^ at least in conventionalweapons, is increasing steadily and when the Alliance itself is already under severe strain, with Greece opting out, Portugal uncertain andother European countries as anxious as ourselves to cut their defencespending.   It is in our interest that the European Security Conferenceand the East/West negotiations on force levels in Europe should succeedand that the French should be given every encouragement to oce-operatomore closely in European defence.   Against this background the timing and the manner in whioh we negotiate our own reductions in defencespending could be of crucial importance in limiting adverserepercussions on the cohesion .of NATO.European Community    .39.   Renegotiation is taking place against a very different economicand political background from the earlier negotiations for entry.Moreover, the recent row over the CAP has greatly improved the prospectfor a successful renegotiation in this crucial area.   If we cansucceed in obtaining both changes in the CAP and an acceptable response to our (entirely reasonable) request for putting cur budget contribu-tion on a more equitable basis, it should prove possible to achieveimproved terms of membership which the Government can recommend thecountry to accept.
The &quot;Third&quot; and &quot;Fourth&quot;.Jforlds40*   The very rapid rise in oil and other commodity prices has created a gulf between those newly rich countries of the &quot;Third&apos;World&quot;,which are well endowed with oil or other valuable commodities, and the&quot;Fourth World&quot; of the poorer developing countries for whom the rise inoil import prices spoils catastrophe.   Countries such as India andBangladesh now face apparently insuperable difficulties in financingfuture development plans.   While there is a clear limit to what we can do on.our own&apos;to help these countries, some of which are members of theCommonwealth, wo can go on putting our weight behind internationalefforts to find ways of easing their problems, eg offering &quot;matchingaid&quot;, to prise out OPEC aid to non-raoslem &quot;Fourth World&quot; countries.The&apos;Spread.nof Nuclear Weapons41*   This represents a danger to the world as great or perhaps greaterthan the more immediate economic problems which confront us.   It mayalready be too late to prevent the accruisition&quot; of nuclear weapons by anumber of small and medium powers.   But Britain, as one of the originalsignatories of the Test Ban-Treaty, has a special responsibility inthis field and it should therefore remain high on the list of her^international priorities.X -  DISUNITY42.   The great majority arc tired of confrontations.. ;But a largenumber of groups have come to the conclusion that the only way tofurther, or protect, their interest is by the adoption of abrasive andmilitant /tactics.   Indeed, some may be drawing the worrying conclusionnot only that militancy pays, but that in practice increased militancymay be more rewarding than increased effort.   There is a widespread and growing sense of disunity and a major unresolved dilemma of how to avoid confrontations without giving in to pressures which are clearly inconsistent with the public interest.   Unless this growingsense of disunity, fragmentation and lack of respect, for the publicinterest can be reversed, the Government will find it impossible toget the support it   needs to make its policies effective.   A first.14. -SECRET
step is -to try, wherever possible, to mobilise the sensible majorityof public opinion in such a way as to isolate and expose extremists,of whatever complexion.   But, in a wider context, anew concept ofthe public interest, appropriate to the circumstances and aspirations of the 1970s needs to be established.   This will be relevant for boththe content and the presentation of the Governmenfs policies.43.   In this context, proposals for devolution need to be consideredvery carefully.   The experience of Germany, Australia and Canada,and other federal states shows that it is possible to combine effectivecentral Government with considerable devolution and local autonomy.On the other hand, it is possible, if things went wrong, or policieswere inadequately thought through, that the pressures from scottish and Welsh Nationalists for devolution could exacerbate the disunityof the country in ways which could impair the capacity of theUnited Kingdom Government to pursue effective policies.44.   It is also likely 4hat.devolution to Scotland and Wales will,in a fairly short time, provoke demands for  devolution to one or moreEnglish regions.   The Government needs to think out its, attitude tosuch demands in detail in advance, so that it does not find itselfmerely responding to pressures.XI - CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS45o   The foregoing analysis Is intended to provide a basis for ahacross-the-board review of Government strategy and priorities.   Thisfahal section sets out the main issues which we think Ministers need to consider.(l)   Longer-Term Objectives;   Economic Growth 11Improvements in growth performance require:-- active long-term manpower policies;- active policies to promote investment, productivity and exports;- joint action by Government and both sides of industry.Existing policies and institutions seem unlikely to proveadequate.   How can they be reinforced, by NEDC arrangements,Planning Agreements, or other means?
jjiflationInflation is not j-ust a ^omporaiy&apos; short-run problem:   if nothingeffective is done, the price level could easily double in the next four or five years.   We therefore recommend that Ministers,should -a.     accept that the problem is too large and on too long a timescalefor subsidies to? have much contribution to make - prices should beallowed to reflect costs;bo^    find means of developing and strengthening the social contract ona much longer-term basis,&apos;:Economic Management &apos;/(&apos;-&apos;&apos;The whole industrial world is in an economic downswing, and it will .not be possible for the United Kingdom in 1975 totally to insulateitself from this and expand at a rate compatible with full employment.But -a.     any short-term measures to alleviate stagnant output and risingunemployment next year must not run counter to the need to expandinvestment and exports in the longer term; in particular, there ispractically no scope for increasing public expenditure to reduce unemployment in the short termjbo     immediate monetary and fiscal action, and a loosening of the pricecode is required to improve the profitability and cash flow of theprivate sector;Co     the present and forecast deterioration in the United Kingdom&apos;international competitiveness means that further depreciation of theexchange rate is almost inevitable:   wo should try and do this&apos; as smooth!as we can, but a smooth adjustment may be very difficult to manage;Policies for Private Industry       .....   . - jlConfidence in the private sector will not be restored unless the candidates for public ownership are precisely defined, so that therest of the private sector can be explicitly relieved of uncertainty,and encouraged to plan ahead for expansion;   the role of profits in a mixed economy must be accepted.   How can Ministers most effectivelydo this?- : -- &apos; :      &apos; &quot;;i6-:     &apos;ii:zP. -----
Policies for Nationalised IndustriesA strategy is needed which will -a. bring prices back into proper relation with costs, and restoreadequate surpluses wherever possible;b. rethink pricing and investment policies for energy and transport in the light of the new situation;c. redefine the relationship between Government and nationalised industries in such a way that Boards and management have theincentives and degree of independence necessary to run their industries efficiently.public i c ^expenditure the whole strategy for economic recovery and containing inflation will almost certainly brook down unless the growth of public expenditure is kept within the limits already agreed by Ministers.   This will require -a. collective,assent by Ministers to difficult decisions in socialpriorities;b. a major and continuing effort in persuasion and education,to -get these priorities generally accepted;c. special attention to the problem of controlling local authority expenditure, particularly current expenditure.housing the housing situation is so tangled, and so politically charged, thata major re-examination is required which will identify the Governmentsprincipal social objectives in the housing field, and work out how theycan be achieved cost-effectively.Britaln^and tho EsrternalMWorlda.     it is strongly in our interest to do all we can to promote an early settlement of the Arab/lsrael disputes   at the same time we must try toavoid confrontation with Arab oil-producers, in order to minimise the risks of disruption to our oil supplies,   we, and the other industrial.countries, may need to press this view on the Americans; &apos;17

Public opinion is. coming to accept this,but has little real appreciation of the scale and   character of the problIt needs to be told much more clearly and in much more detail.   Moreover,there remains a widespread belief in the omnipotence of Governments toprovide quick and relatively painless solutions for the symptoms of whatis in fact a deep-seated and intractable malaise.   At the same time,there is a loss   of confidence in the ability of accepted democraticpolitical procedures to respond to specific needs.   In consequence thereis a spate of demands that the Government must act immediately to solvethis or that problem; and, at the same time a feeling that, the only wayto got Governments (or other institutions) to act is by abrasive andaggressive kinds of direct action and confrontation.   In consequence,the Government willlvfail to get its policies accepted,unless - .a. it takes explicit action to explain to. the public the facts ofthe situation, and the constraints on its room to manoeuvre:   a gooddeal of the present malaise is the result of political parties (of allcomplexions) promising to solve problems when they lacked the meansor instruments to solve them.b. it can find means either to channel sources of grievance and dis-content,back into existing democratic institutions; or, where existinginstitutions are inadequate, to develop now democratic institutions whichcan provide an acceptable forum for considering&apos;and redressing them;and, if they cannot be redressed, convincing those who are aggrievedthat they will have to wait;

This implies a major campaign of politicaland social education which will explain to the public not merely the objectives of policies, but the constraints and limitations on theGovernments ability to act.   The efforts and social responsibilities of individuals are no less important than the actions of Government,[- - li14 October 197419
