THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 953 September 1974COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP OF DEVELOPMENT land memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. At their meeting on 1 August the Cabinet approved in principle my proposals for community ownership of development land- but noted thattaxation and the public purchase price in the transitional period were beingfurther considered by an expert Working Party.PURCHASE PRICE AND TAXATION IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD2.        The report of the Working Party is being circulated separately(C(74) 96),    The &quot;Working Party considered the two approaches to taxationreferred to in the discussion on 1 August - acquisition at &quot;frozen market value&quot;, and buying net of a tax incorporating the last transaction costprinciple - and also other possible approaches.3. The Working Party concluded that no frozen market value scheme could be recommended, but that an approach under which local authorities would buy net of tax, with the existing tax arrangements adapted broadly onthe lines of the 1967 betterment levy, would satisfy most of the land policyobjectives, and more than any other feasible scheme.4. I agree that enabling local authorities to buy &quot;net of tax&quot; is the rightapproach.    I also accept the proposals that the Working Party considered for introducing flexibility, and thereby keeping down manpower require-ments (paragraph 29 of the report), subject to the following points:a. In the context of a scheme which is designed to achievespecial treatment of development value, it would be wrong to exemptowner-occupied plots of as much as half an acre (paragraph 29a); Ipropose therefore that the exemption should be restricted to quarter-acre plots,b, To allow an addition of 20 per cent to last transaction cost(paragraph 29c) is too generous.    I propose that the addition shouldbe restricted to 10 per cent.Both these modifications in the scheme are acceptable to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.copy NO nifCABINET
5.        It may be suggested that this tax approach is too like the bettermentlevy under the Land Commission Act 1967.    But there is really no alternative to the basic structure proposed (which is used also in thedevelopment gains charge); and taxing development value separately,rather than through the normal company/personal taxation system, is entirely justifiable on the basis of the special nature of development value as sbmething created by the community.    The incorporation of the amendments made to the betterment levy scheme in the Finance Act 1969,and of the further modifications in paragraph 29 of the report, will mean that the scheme will avoid the problems which brought the betterment levyinto disrepute. j / &quot;RATE OF TAXATION OF DEVELOPMENT GAINS6.        Paragraphs 32 and 33 of the report set out&apos; the difficulties thatarise on fixing the rate of the new tax.    Because of the importance of this for market confidence I have discussed this issue with the Chancellor, andI will report the outcome of further consideration of this I que stion at theCabinet meeting.THE DRAFT WHITE PAPER7,        I attach a revised draft of the White Paper.    Paragraphs 37-44 ofthis deal with the transitional problems discussed by the expert working party.    Other amendments to the text since the Cabinet discussion on1 August are either consequential on the proposed approach to taxation inthe transitional period or are of a detailed nature.conclusion.        I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement;a. to the arrangements for the transitional period referred toin paragraphs 2-4 above; and b. to the publication of the White Paper as soon as possible.A department of the Environment3 September 19742

Communnity Ownership of Development LandI. LAND OUR SCARCEST RESOURCE1. Of all the resources available in these islands, land is the one resource thatcannot be increased. By trading with other nations we can obtain more food,more oil, or more iron ore in exchange for those commodities of goods that wehave in abundance. But with land the supply is fixed. We live in a small densely populated country, so the supply of land is not only fixed, it is also scarce.This makes it doubly important that we should plan to use our land well. Forthe purpose of planning has rightly been stated to be &quot;to secure a properbalance between the competing demands for land, so that all the land of thei i country is used in the best interests of the whole people.&quot; Rt Hon Lewis Silkin \ Official Report 29th January 1947, Vol 432 Col 947)2. Our population is growing, and demands for land are growing faster still.We need more schools, more factories, more shops, more houses, more buildings of all sorts, ^nd we need open spaces, farms and forests, too. It is right that thesecompeting demands for the limited amount of land available should be metaccording to the priority of social needs in the community.3. It is not generally disputed that he community itself must control the develop-ment of land, and the planning system that has evolved has often been a potentforce in preventing development that is harmful to the community. But our system of planning control is largely a negative one. The community, via itselected local authority and in the final analysis, central Government, can vetoproposals for development, but the initiative is left largely in private hands.It does riot at present have sufficient power always to plan positively, to decide&apos; i where and when particular developments should take place. Public ownership of development land is designed to give this power to its rightful owner, thecommunity.4. Side by side with the need to secure positive planning, the nation has for dealwith another problem, that of land values. &quot;The growth in value, more especially of urban sites, is due to no expenditure of capital or thought on the part of theground owner, but entirely owing to the energy and enterprise of the community.____It is undoubtedly one of the worst evils of our present system of land tenurethat instead of reaping the benefit of the common endeavour of its citizens a community has always to pay a heavy penalty to its ground landlords for putting up the value of their land.&quot; (Rt Hon David Lloyd George Official Report29th April 1909, Vol IV Col 532).The public ownership of development land will secure these increments for thecommunity that has created them.H. EARLIER ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS5. The early attempts to introduce a system of town and country planning, fro m1909 to 1932, were frustrated by the problems of compensation and betterment.Local authorities, were required to pay compensaton if they prevented thedevelopment of land; but provisions designed to enable these authorities toreceive a share of &quot;betterment&quot;-the increases in value which accrued to landowners from public expenditure and planning control were largely ineffective.The result was that effective planing control was financially impossible.
6: The need for an effective national planning system was accepted by two major and complementary inquiries which took place in the late &apos;30s and early&apos;40s the Barlow, Commission and the Scott and Uthwatt Committees. - -The first attempt, 1947-54y. The Town and Country Planning Act 1947 drew substantially on the workof the Uthwatt1 Committee, which dealt specifically with compensation andbetterment, without precisely following its recommendations. The Act re-presented the first comprehensive approach to the related problems of planning,compensation and betterment. The key-as under the Uthwatt proposals wasthe effective transfer to the State for all development rights in land.8.  State ownership of development rights had three inter-connected effects:a.   planning permission was required for all development throughout the- countryb.&apos;  ho compensation was payable where planning permission was refused(except for development defined as being within &quot;existing use&quot; for com-:; pensation purposes)c. betterment accrued to the State through the imposition of a develop-ment charge which was payable to a Central Land Board before develop-ment commenced.9.. One consequence of the nationalisation of development value was that allland, was supposed to change hands at existing use value. This meant that localauthorities could acquire land cheaply for their own purposes. But the system was:criticised as removing any incentive for owners to bring forward land fordevelopmentbecause developers who were going to.have to pay development^charges should;in theory, not have paid more than existing use value when theybought the land. (In practice, land changed hands at more than existing use value,though at less than full market value). It is as likely that with-holding of land from the market may have arisen from the expectation that the system wouldbe adandoned if there was a change of Government. A second difficulty aboutthe development charge system was that the basic principle on which it was based was inadequately understood^ It is probable that, given time to settledown the, 1947 Act system could have been made to work. But it was abolishedbefore this could be tested.10. Two of the 3 basic&apos;principles of the 1947 Act have, however, survived,The planning system introduced by the Act, remains virtually untouched.Planning control still operates as under the 1947 Act; and the development plan system remains, (though changed by the introduction of structure andlocal plans in the Town and Country Planning Act 1968). And one of the mostimportant&apos;: aspects of.the 1947 nationalisation of development value the prin-ciple that in general compensation is not payable where planning permissionis refused-remains, with the result that the ability to prevent the realisation- of development value still rests with public authorities.11.&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos; Although the provisions of the 1947 Act dealing with betterment wererepealed fdllowihg the change of government in 1951, the Town and country planning Acts of 1953 and 1954 left untouched the provisions under which public authorities acquired land at a price excluding development value.
Pressure against this two-^price system led to its: abolition ;in 1959... Under;Town and Country Planning. Act 1959 full open-market value; including devel-opment value, was re-instated as the basis on which public authorities paid for land.The second attempt 1967-7013. Concern about rising land prices,.and large unearned gains, led the 1964Labour Government to set up the Land Commission.. ... .1. .Under the Land Commission Act 1967 development gains on land were subject^for a special flat rate tax the betterment levy set at 40 %. The Act, howeverdid not bring about any changes in the planning system. Broadly speaking,the Commission operated within the framework laid down by local plannningauthorities-in general, the Commission could buy land compulsorily only where.it had been allocated or in some other way accepted as ready for development..Nor did the system allow public authorities, other than the Commission, toacquire land, more cheaply. a14. The 1967 Act did not have as significant an effect on the land market as the.1947 Act system. There were transitional provisions in the Act which helped toavoid major disruptions while the system was being introduced. But the.betterment levy scheme did not make adequate provision for exemption ofsmall cases or for flexibility in operation. As with the 1947 Act system, it. isprobable that, given time and some extra flexibility (such as that.introduced.bythe Finance Act 1969), the system would have been workable.&apos;But, like the1947 Act, the 1967 Act was repealed, this time following the change of Govern-ment in 1970. This repeal came before the Land Commission had been giventhe wider powers of land acquisition which the legislation provided should beavailable to them after a &quot;second appointed day,&quot; so that the.commission were able to buy local on the scale originally envisaged.15. Despite their repeal neither Act was in vain. As paragraph 10 has indicated,two of the three principles of the 1947 Act form the basis or our presentplanning system. Moreover, the operation of both schemes provides valuableexperience from which the following lessons may be drawn:a. the key to positive planning, and to a successful attack on the problemof betterment, is acquisition of land by the community;b. a central agency is too far removed from people and from those; responsible for planning decisions; andHI. THE OBJECTIVES16. Some of the problems standing in the Way of an effective planning systemare still with us, Accordingly, the Government reiterate that their objectives&apos;areto establish a permanent means:a. To secure for the community by positive planning the ability to control. the development of land accordingly to the right priority of the cpmmunity&apos;sneeds, at the time when those needs arise, and at a fair price to the conmiunity^.b. To enable the community to acquire for itself the increased value of the.land which arises as a result of the efforts of the community.     .
ry. pqsitta^ plan^17,,..every:;physical,(development comprises two actions; at the same time that something new is created;what previously existed is destroyed,. One of theprincipal;.aims of planning, therefore, must be,simply to see that what iscreated is better attuned to the requirements of society than extinguished.The existence of any planning system constitutes an acceptance of theprincipal that the ;m&amp;market&apos; will&apos; not, itself, inevitably arrive at a -satisfactory conclusion as to how our land should be used. ...18, Our,existing:negatiye,planning.control provides a valuable check on themarket, and would at first sight seem capable of safeguarding pur heritage andresolving the conflict between private interests and the public good. But thedifficulties inherent in a patchwork quilt of land ownership, and the ^over-whelming financial problems-associated, with acquiring land mean that the bestusBipf land in not always.acheived.19.&apos; This is not to deny that plan making is a very valuable function of our localauthorities; it is rather to point out that the existing powers to implement their plans are restricted by the price that the market pits on some land, and by thefact,that the planners&apos; resource is in the, hands of private owners rather than atthe disposal of the community.20. Public ownership of development land puts control of our scarcest resourcein thehands of th6 community and enables it thereby to take an overall per-spective. In addition, by having this land available at the value of the presentuse,: rather than at a Value based on speculation as to its possible development,the community will be able to provide the public facilities it needs, in the placesthat it needs them but cannot presently afford because of the inflated price it hasto pay to the private owner. &apos;&apos;21. Market forces encourage concentration of commercial development in areas that seem to offer special advantages to particular firms; but what themarket does not consider are the side effects the breakdown of old-establishedcommunities and the increasing desertion of city centres, and their implications,not the least being possibly the effect on the transport system of requiring people to live so far from their work.places. These are cars involved, the cost of pro-Vidihg more roads, more trains and buses for example; there and are stresses,tod, on the individual who has to spend more time and money, probably in morecrowded conditions, travelling to and from work. These costs and stresses are not taken into account by the market,, but they shouldhe by the planning authorities.jt:is:impqrtant,that; they are,&quot;an^.this is why planning must be strengthened, and why.the community should buy the land and benefit from the developmentvalues created.V. ACQUISIHON OF LAND BY THE COMMUNITY:.22. It is necessary first to define what is meant by the word &quot;community&quot; inrelation to the Governments plans. The Government have considered whether to set up a central Government agency to acquire development and. Such anagenpy was, created in 1947 as the Central Land Board and in 1967 as the land commission. *&apos;
23. Undoubtedly a central agency has advantages; it cansrespon^with ease to?national decisions and it can cross local boundaries to assemble land which?ought to form one parcel. On the other hand, the citizen has never felt personally&apos; iinvolved, in the work of each agencies and local authorities have generally -felt/with some justice that they were more aware of their own problems than any;central organisation. ;  &apos; 1 :24. The Government believe that in England and Scotland the acquisitionLandi.disposal of development land is best left in the main to local authorities whichterm throughout this White Paper includes New Town Development Corpora-tions. will be supported by a back-up organisation to help and advise them andto act on the Secretary^ of State&apos;s behalf in default. In Wales, however, theacquisition and disposal of land for private development will be the respOn-sibility of an all-Wales body, which will also be able to provide local authorities with an advisory service. The precise kind^of support arrangements (possibly-ments in based in England and nationally based in Scotland) andthcarrange--regionaly Wales will be the subject of discussion, with the local authority associations.2.5. These proposals relate to land which is to be developed or redeveloped for.houses, shops, factories, roads for example. They are not concerned with land which is to remain in use for agriculture or forestry; and ho charge:isproposed in the existing arrangements relating to each land. The land to be acquired will be land which the community accepts as requiring development or redevelopment not more than ten years ahead. The acquisitions will be.monitored as part of a rolling programme as local authorities build up ihejfrjland banks. Ten years is the maximum period needed to ensure orderlydevelbp-Jment and create the requisite degree of certainty in the development industry, anclin agriculture and forestry. Care will continue to be taken to avoid the acquisitionof good quality agricultural land wherever possible.26. Much development land is already bought by the community for its own purposes. Local authorities also buy some land for private development underpowers in the Housing and Planning Acts. Local authorities, however, should been abled to do much more positive and comprehensive planning throughownership; and for this purpose they will be given new and very much wider powers to acquire land for development. Owners will also be given rights,; incertain circumstances, to require local authorities to acquire their land. These newpowers will be exercisable as soon a legislation is enacted. g   . -   ,27. Subject to the permanent exemptions from acquisition in paragraph^hs^ &apos;34and 35, and to the important transitional arrangements set out in paragraph&apos;36it is the Governments intention to lay a duty on local authorities to acquire;ailland required for private development, other than that to be acquired by new town development corporations. From the date that the duty is brought in, no developrment will be allowed to begin save on land owned by a public authority, or madeavailable by them for this purpose. Local authorities will;&apos;thefefo^buy/laridwhich in their opinion is suitable for development and will also be required to buy where the need for development (eg as indicated in a planning application)is accepted even though it may be a departure from the plan. The &amp;eh^rMVesting Declaration procedure set out in the Town and country planning&apos;Act1068 can apply to such acquisitions to secure speedy dispbsalfbr developmenT.
28; The new local authorityiacquisition powers and duties in respect of privatedevelopment in England wHLso far as possible, follow the split of planning functions: between County and District. Both Councils will as a result of landownership have new and positive roles in ensuring the proper development oftheir areas.&quot;The; tiers of local government already agree their respective fields&apos;of operation (within the broad context of legislation) through Development PlanSchemes; and. Development Control; Schemes, ft may be that CommunityLand Acquisition Schemes would be an appropriate technique: for detmihgtheir respective spheres of interest in relation to acquisition: This will be discussed with the Local authority associations so that the best form of local authorityco-operation can be achieved.29. In Scotland district councils are ljkely to be the main agents for acquiringlandj heeded for private development,&apos; ;&apos;but regional councils will have similarpowers: of acquisition, which may be exercised in pursuit of regional objectives.There will be consultations with local authorities in Scotland before the arrange-ments are finalised.30.&apos; The principle that all&apos;development land should be acquired by the comm-unity will have important implications\.&apos;Given the acceptance of this approachby Parliament, objection to the principle of public acquisition will no longer byah appropriate ground of objection to an individual compulsory purchase order,and the Secretary of State will be enabled to disregard objections put forwardoh this basis (as he can already do in relation to compulsory purchase orders made by new town development corporations). Special consideration will need to be given the implications of a situation in which the grant of planning per-mission makes land subject to compulsory acquisition, and the legislation will contain appropriate provisions to safeguard the position of owners and otherswith an interest in land. ;   /:VI. THE BASIS OF COMPENSATION31. Since 1958 the price paid by an acquiring authority for land which itpurchases has not been limited to the value of the land based on its current use,but may reflect any value due to the prospect of carrying out development.This may include the value for. the development which the acquiring authorityintend to.carry out. Moreover, as a result of the certificate of. appropriatealternative development procedure an acquiring authority may have to pay aprice includingsubstahtial development value even where they are acquiririgtheland foran unremuherative use, eg. public open space.32. The intended arrangements for the immediate future are set but in para-graphs 37-44 below.The Government propose that the ultimate basis on whichthe community will buy all land will be current use value that is to say themarket value of land for its. current use without adding any additional valuerepresenting the hope that it might be developed for any other purpose, except those covered by the permanent exemptions referred to in paragraphs 34-35.The Government also propose to amend at the earliest possible moment theprovision whereby an owner of land can require a certificate of appropriate
alternative development even though the owner (foiv example :of a -sports field which the authority wish to acquire for public open space)has no possibility of getting planning permission for the development set out in ithe:certificate.sonct;33.;; Some land may be derelict and have little or no market value in its eurrentuse. This may give rise to difficulties when land is &apos;to be acquired^at current; use-value;:A:special basis; of compensation will therefore be established to deal with--such cases. This basis will be specified for particular areas or types of land by the.Secretary of State by Order. - ; ,.;i;/-VH. PERMANENT EXEMPTIONS FROM ACQUISITION34., The,Government propose to exclude from the,scheme the building qfj$!house for owner-occupation on a singleplot which. was pwned,by Jhe; prospective,owner-occupier on the date of this White Paper (   September 1974).   .35. Other permanent exemptions from acquisition under the scheme will beset out in due course but they will include alterations and expansions to dwelling-houses; the building of a single house within the curtilage of a dwelling occupiedby the. owner at the date of this White Paper for occupation by the owner or amember of his family; buildings used in agriculture and forestry; and develop-ment related to the extraction of minerals. Consideration will.be given to theextent to which extensions to buildings and changes between use classes can be.exempted and the exemptions will also take acpunt of the need not to constrainimportant industrial development and expansion.VIII. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS36. The Government accept that with the shortage of skilled manpower it willnot be possible to move immediately to the new system in full. They therefore propose to defer the making of an order or orders laying; the duty ohi;local-authorities to acquire land for material development until they are in a positionto carry out this duty. In the meantime, local authorities will be encouraged tbacquire as much development land as the staff position permits up to the maxi-;mum of ten years&apos; needs, and the Government will use their best endeavours.tomake possible an early move to full implementation of the Scheme. In the transitional period both land with planning permission onWhite Paper ,&apos;ddyand land owned by builders on that date will normally be excluded fromacquisition under the Scheme. Developers will also be able to continue&apos;to rniike;planning applications and carry out developments as they do now (though&apos;there will be an opportunity for local authorities to consider whether to acquire and themselves before they grant planning permission); The-Governmentwill take powers to make this order laying a duty on local authorities either generally and in respect of all development or in relation to specific areas or&apos;types of development, and will have special regard to the existence of Structuresand Local Plans. &apos; ; nv    ,.i37.- The Government also accept that&apos;sensible development requires that theprice which public authorities pay for land should be reasonable not only to the
commi3inity;:lju$-a!so tO;landowners; At the time all local authorities have beengiven adutysto^ acquire land for deyel0pment.it will be right for the price to becurrent ruse value; as set oufeiffparagraph 31. But to move, over immediately: tothis basis of compensation would discourage landowners from bringing forwardlandifor development in the, transitional period before local authorities andreadytand have; been--given the duty-to acquire land for development. Besides,many present owners will hayefboughttheir land at a price reflecting a hope ofdevelopment that)is legitimate inthe market today, and the Government do not wish to penalise them.38i;during /the;.transitional period;the Government have the three-foldpriorities of. reducing.the cost of^landtp/local authorities; maintaining the flow ofland for development; and avoiding distortion and unfairness tq landowners.They have decided to do this by enabling local authorities to buy land net of the tax on idfevelopment.value (i;e- the increase in value attributable to the prospectof-development), that would have been payable by the vendor had he sold hisland privately. The community will benefit from increases in development value,the private owner Will realise the same amount whether he sells to the localauthority or to a private purchaser.39. To enable local authorities to buy &quot;net of tax&quot; it will be necessary to amend the arrangements for thetaxatibn Gf development gains introduced in the finance act 1974. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear, when he announced the intention to include in-the 1974 !Finanace Bill provisions based on those proposed by the previous&apos; government,&apos; that this&apos;was an interim measure inadvance of the Governments Own proposals for dealing with developmentland.       &apos;: &quot;:Vi-:&apos;:40. The development gains charge provisions will therefore be amended so that development value is subject to a &quot;development land tax&quot; at a flat rate outsidethe &quot;general arrangements for the&apos;taxation of companies and individuals, andapplying equally to those who trade in land and those who do not. The new taxWill gnerally be payable when development value is realised on a disposal ofland (including the granting of a lease), but any development value realised bythe carrying out of development will also be liable for tax.41. The development value on which tax will be charged will be the differencebetween disposal price (or market Valii^where tax is chargeable on the carryingd&apos;ut!6f deverdpirient) and aM&apos;base&apos;Value&quot; which will be whichever is the^highestof:&apos;&apos;-&apos;  K:&apos;; s&quot;&apos;ifCl&apos;; &apos; -        - &apos; isiffyiywa. the price paid for the land plus any increase in current use value since i. the,date of acquisition; &apos;&quot;.b. current us^,,- :c... the price paid for the land plus 10%. ,There will be allowance for expenditure (e.g. costs of sale), and for the cost offmptd^nients, where &apos;apprbp&apos;riate.&apos;;&apos;i&apos;::&apos;;&apos;;&apos;&apos; &apos;v42. Minor development, and development already regarded as being withinexisting use for compensation purposes (schedule 8 of the Town and country planning Actl971) will he defineckas falling within thecurrent use of land for the
purpose of assessirig liability to tax. No tax will be payable where development:-valuers&apos;realised.by a residential owner-occupier ori the sale or development of.i.his sole Or main residence or of land of up to one-tenth of a hectare (approxi-&apos;.niately  acre) occupied with his house as its garden or grounds; the&apos;types of:development by owner-occupiers exempted-from acquisition under the scheme(paragraphs 34-35) will also be exempt from the new tax without regard to size of plot. In addition, there will be exertiptiOri where disposals of land by an individual or a company in any year have a total value1 of  5.000 or less. .    /-/43. The rate of development land tax will be fixed by Order. The Government&apos;intention is to fix ah initial rate Of 00 per cent and to increase the rate progresskvely in step with the build-up of local authority programmes of acquisition and;disposal of land for development.&apos;     &apos;&apos;\&apos; &quot;       - &apos;  i:     *&apos;&apos;,    * 1      - &apos;44. The development land tax will notapply to realisations of ^development1value occurring before the date of Royal Assent to the legislation which theGovernment intend to introduce! /There! will be provisions in the legislation, to-guard against transactions in the period before the introduction of the newtax aimed at avoidance. -  -IX. FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TRIBUNALS45. When all the acquisitions by local authorities come to be made at currentvalue there may arise individual cases of (financial hardship of the sort that canoccur in any large scheme. The Government therefore propose to set up at theappropriate time tribunals throughout the counry which will have authority toconsider such cases and to award an additional payment.46. It is important that the Tribunals for, dealing with cases of this kind shouldbe informal and readily accessible to individuals;.affected. The. Government,will be considering the most effective form they should take for this purpose and.particularly whether they could be based on an existing body of group of bodies.X. SPECIAL CASES47. The Government seek to protect the residential owner-occupier, whetherof a freehold property or of one held on a long lease. Local authorities will.be encouraged to make land available for the building of houses for owner-occupation on the basis set put in paragraph 53 below.48. Where an owner-occupied house needs to be acquired by a public authority&apos;the owner will continue to receive its market value and &quot;will riot be liable for development land tax if he realises devdbpriient value on the sale or develop-ment of his house or ofpartof his gardepup to^ tenth of a hectare (see para,41 above). He will also continue to be entitled to thefuli range of. statutorypayments including compensation for disturbance, and where appropriate, hbineloss payments under the Land Compensation Act, 1973. i       i -49.  As indicated in paragraph 34 above; single house plots which were owned
by, the; prospective owner-occupier on White Paper day will not, becomesubject to public acquisition when that development comes to be carried out.Agriculture50. As explained in paragraph 25 above, the Government will ensure thatcare will continue to be taken to avoid the acquisition of good quality agricul-&apos;turalland wherever possible. Before introducing legislation, they will also con--sider whether the neW compensation terms set out in paragraph 31 means that&apos;any special provisions are needed to protect working farmers.Statutory Undertakers r51.. Statutory undertakers will be ableto acquire and develop land needed fortheir statutory functions without the intervention of local authorities. While the transitional arrangements described in, paragraphs 36 to 44 continue, these bodies will be able to carry, out development for their own operational use butthey will be liable for the tax when they dispose of any of their land whether before or after development. Local authorities will buy land from them net ofthis tax.XX. DISPOSAL OF LAND52. - The terms on which local authorities dispose of land acquired under these arrangements will need in general to ensure that the local community retain ashare of future increases in value. The disposal of land for commercial or industrial development.therefore will be on a leasehold basis with provision forrent revisions. In general, disposals, whether on a freehold or a leasehold basis,will be at the market value at the time,53. &apos; TheGovernment have made it clear that their public ownership proposalsdo not&quot;! seek to affect the provision of land on which houses can be built for owner^occupatioh. Land for housing can be disposed of in a variety of ways.Local authorities will be encouraged to offer it to builders on licence, with theplots being conveyed direct to the house purchasers. Plots for owner-occupationwill also be made available freehold.54. The operation of the: scheme will require close co-operation between localauthorities and developers; and the Government wish to see the skills and initiative-tivesofprivatedevelopers contribute to the needs of the community in a positiveway. Local authorities will, be encouraged to involve developers in their plans,and the method of disposal should encourage developers to make a contribution towards the overall design of each scheme.55. -In some instances developers.will,have special needs, e-g- an industrialistWith;land acquired for long-term,expansion, a wholesaler with a special sitingrequirement, a property developer who has assembled a developable site (or part of it); When the scheme is fully operative the land to be developed will pass through local authority hands, but there may be very good reasons why theparticular landowner/developer should be the one to whom the land is madeavailable for development.. In these circumstances, the owner or developer
would usually be given an opportunity to undertake the development, subject to agreement on financial terms. 1 &apos;XH. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS   &quot;    &apos;   &apos; : -56. The effect of these proposals will be that the community will enjoy thefull value created when land is developed. The community in general, i.e. the taxpayer, will have made a contribution towards the, acquisition of land and theGovernment propose therefore that the benefits from the scheme should be shared between Central and local government. The major part of the benefit will accrue to the taxpayer in general through the Exchequer; but a part willremain with the local community and a part will be ^distributed amongst localauthorities to help equalise the benefits&apos; of the scheme between ratepayers at large. The Government will consult with the Local Authority Associations inorder to arrive at a rational distribution of benefits. It is the government&apos;s intention that those buying their first homes should share in the benefits of thescheme. It must be recognised that because of the timelag between acquisition and disposal, it will be some time before benefits accure generally.57. Transfers of land between local authorities or the valuation of appro-appropriations within a local authority will be treated differently. The local communitywill benefit directly from the new proposals. Land to be used by them for councilhousing or other purposes will therefore be transferred or appropriated at thecost of acquisition. Adjustments will be made as appropriate in Exchequerfinancial arrangements.XIII. EMPTY OFFICE BLOCKS58. So far, the proposals outlined have been concerned with development land,but there is a related problem of land which has already been developed but withunsatisfactory results for the community. The problem is that of office premiseswhich have been standing empty for many years. The owners of these premiseswere given 6 months&apos; notice on 29th April 1974 of the Governmenfs intentionto deal with these premises in the legislation on development land.59. The Government intend that the Secretary of State shall have general powers to acquire such premises by compulsory purchase. His powers will relateto those offices with a floor space of over 50,000 sq ft which have never been substantially occupied for a period of at least 2 years from the date of construc-tion. These will be an opportunity for those affected to make representations asto why the acquisition should not take place. - -: m.: &quot;v60. The price to be paid will be the value that would have been payable had thepremises been acquired at the date of completion, taking account of any sub-sequent alterations to the building.      -/Mi
