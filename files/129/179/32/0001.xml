THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0(74) 122 COPY NO        881 November 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND SOCIAL PRIORITIESMemorandum by Secretary of State for Social Services1o    When we last discussed Public Expenditure in Cabinet, I was not alone in questioning whether we had sufficiently changed the expenditure plans whichwe had inherited to meet our Socialist priorities.   If we are to make room for the expansion of programmes which we, as socialists, regard as essential,we will have to face up to the need to make severe cuts in other programmes which are desirable but of lower priority.2.    I share with my colleagues an acute awareness of the paramount need toimprove the nationfs economic performance.   Top priority must be given tothis.   As regards the other programmes. I do not think that we have yetgot the balance right.  We must surely put ourselves in a position to claim in 3 or 4 years* time that our performance has been better than theTories in those areas to which we attach the greatest importance.   looking at the figures now before us, I do not think that they indicate prioritieswhich I would be willing to defend.  We would be strongly criticised by many of our supporters if the implied priorities were published in theirpresent form.   We surely do not want to justify our record of office byclaiming that we have built more roadB, more courts and more prisons thanHMBBPP &apos; itever before.3.    Cur priorities in public expenditure must support the social contractinsofar as this is possible.   We agree that there is limited scope Tor&apos;increases in real wages.   Indeed the real incomes of the higher paid willhave to mark time or fall.   It is therefore all the more important that public expenditure should add to the social wage in ways which can be clearly understood - in housing, education, pensions, child allowances, and in health and personal social services.
4*    We have already given maximum priority -bo housing - 32*1 per centextra in this current year.   I am sure that this was right.  What worriesme is whether we are planning to switch enough to education, health and personal social services, pensions and family support over the PESO period.5.    After 10 years of slow and hesitant progress, we must surely make a real success of the comprehensive education programme in this period of office.  We must also ensure that nursery education is extended and better provision is made for the neglected group of 16-18 year olds who cannotattend full-time academic courses and for late developers.  We start with the advantage that child numbers are falling over the period.6.    Similarly, as I said in the memorandum I put to Cabinet for 12 September(C(74) 107), there is now widespread awareness that the National health service is seriously underfinanced and we start with the disadvantage thatthe number of the aged is rising steadily.   It would be humiliating for all of us if our record of expenditure on the Health Service was worse thanthat of the last Conservative Government.   Under the Conservatives the average annual compound rate of growth (capital and revenue) in real terms was*2 per cent (between 1970-71 and 1973-74)*   The corresponding planned expansion in the Chancellor^ Memorandum (c(74) 120) for the period 1974-75to 1977-78 is only 2.8 per cent.   On the capital side the picture for thetwo throe*-year periods is even worse.   Under the Conservatives, Healthcapital rose by 28 per cent.   Under us it will fall by 4 per cent.7.     I have also made it clear that I would consider it disastrous if wecould do nothing for existing pensioners when our new scheme for futurepensions is introduced.   All we did last July was to restore the pension to about the same percentage of average earnings as in October 19^7*The level of short term benefits was last July lowerin relation to earningsthan in almost all of the years of our 1964-70 Government.   At some stagewe must narrow the gap between short term and long term benefits.   In thecase of child support the figures in the papers assume that we will be spendingless on child allowances and child tax allowances at the end of the PESCperiod than at the beginning and allow nothing for us to give extra help toonc*.parent   families.   How can we expect to hold the social contract, phaseout food subsidies or raise fuel prices unless we look after families.   secret
with children by providing an improved level of child support and relateour new child allowances to earnings?   The greater the help we give to families,&quot;the greater the cuts we can hope to&apos; make in food subsidieso8.    I appreciate that resources will be particularly tight next year.   Butwe need to decide now to phase down some programmes so that by the end ofthe PESC period we have resources in hand to make major social advances.When we have decided which programmes should be cut and how much they shouldbe cut, we can then turn to examine which social programmes should beincreased for each of the PESC years.,&apos;/It is for this reason that I havebeen unwilling to reach any final agreement with the Chancellor on mybudget - even for the year 1975-6.9*    I am disappointed by the figures proposed for defence.   But this isnot the only area where I think we should consider further cuts.   the others are roads, law and order and protective services, and food and fuelsubsidies.ROADS AND TRANSPORT10.   The Chancellor proposes that expenditure on roads willi throughout thePESC period be higher in real terms than during any period of the lastLabour Government - despite the substantial capital investment in motorwaysover the last decade.   Indeed the projected rate of growth (even excluding the possible  100 million local transport subsidy) - at 3.2 per cent - is higher than for health, at 2.8 per cent.  What has caused us to change ourpriorities in the last 10 years?  How strong is the economic case forfurther roads?   There is in my view less general public demand for roadsthan in the past and more public resistance on environmental grounds.While an improved road network reduces costs for the freight industry,it takes traffic from the railways and encourages private motoring whichthe better-off can afford most of all.   While part of the railways programmemay help to attract traffic, part of it consists of amenity improvements,which, however desirable, could be postponed, to make way for new construction and renovation of places where people have to spend large parts of their lives - schools, hospitals and residential homes.   How far is our wholetransport programme consistent with the need to save fuel?
LAW ORDER AND PROTECTIVE SERVICES11*   The Chancellor^ Memorandum proposes reductions in the capital programme for police, prisons^ and courts of about  25 million.   But this would still leave a rate of capital growth on these programmes of almost 40 per cent.I regard the replacement of Victorian hospitals and Victorian schools as of higher priority than the replacement of Victorian prisons.   Moreoverprovision for young offenders should in my view take priority over provisionfor older offenders.   As a result of the penal reform policy of the lastLabour Government, the burden of looking after young offenders was trans-ferred to the \personal social services.   But as the Home Secretary has said, the 1969 Children and Young Persons Act has never been properlyimplemented^   The secure community homes needed&quot;to care for the risingnumber of juvenile offenders have not been provided on anything like thenecessary scale.   As a result our reform is under severe attacks   We mustfind the money to put this right if we are to prove that our broad humanitarian-tarian policy was right, cut at the roots of criminal behaviour before they have sunk too deep and hopefully prevent the need for a vast programmeof prison construction over the next decades.FOOD AND FUEL SUBSIDIES12,  While food subsidies help to contain inflation, they do not discriminateaccording to social need.   The subsidies which would remain even afterthe tapering off proposed, could be much better used in distributionalterms in improved social security benefits.13.   I invite my colleagues to decide -a. to make a major shift of resources in favour of education, health,personal social services and social security during the PESO periods.f &quot; &apos; -    ! i       I! &apos;b, to make room for this expansion by further cuts in spending plans for roads and transport, law and order, and food subsidies.B A department of Health and Social security london SE11 November 1974
