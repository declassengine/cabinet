COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP OP DEVELOPMENT LANDPURCHASE PRICE AND TAXATION IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIODREPORT OP THE EXPERT WORKING party  introduction. 1 At their meeting on 1 August (CG(7^)31t Item 2) the cabinet approved in principle the proposals for community ownership ofdevelopment land, but noted that taxation and the publicpurchase price in the transitional period were being further dis-cussed by an expert Working Party set up following the discussion in the MISC 30 Committee on 30 July (MISC 30(7ij.)&quot;2nd Meeting,Conclusion 2 (ii)  ).2.   It is a fundaments.! objective of the scheme that the cost ofland to public authorities should be reduced, and should, after a transitional period, be based on current use value (cuv) - ie, the^amount that land is worth in its current use without any additionalvalue arising from the prospect of carrying out development (draft white Paper, para yt).3.   The new basis cannot be introduced immediately.    Paragraph 37 ofthe draft White Paper recognises that there will be cases in whichdevelopment value has already effectively accrued to landowners.Moreover, it has been accepted that, because of. manpower constraintsand the importance of maintaining essential development programmes,iirmqdiate acquisition of all development land will not be possible,have toand that, for a transitional period, the private market will/continue as a means of bringing land forward for development.\.   The draft White Paper contained alternative versions of the paragraph (para 38) dealing with the arrangements necessary to dealwith cases where development \ralue has already accrued and with thecontinuance of the private market in the transitional period.     the choice between these approaches was not resolved at MISC 30;    and itwas to study this question further that the Working Party was established.^References to oaraeranhs in the White Paper-relate to the draftcirculated to the MISC 30 Committee (MISC 30(71].)*!-).fefl%\ripr$x?r\ a g
fl f \ T- r&quot; fi V*T*j! f\ &apos;%II THE PRESENT SITUATION- 5*    The present basis of compensation (ie the price which public authorities pay for land) is market value.    Market value includes the full value attributable to the prospect of carrying outdevelopment;    but the development gains charge provisions inthe Finance Act 197U- provide for the taxation of developmentgains, and it may be useful to describe this present taxationsystem briefly as background to consideration of possible alter-native approaches.6.    The basis of the present system is that, when an individual or a company disposes of land, and realises a development gain(ie any value attributable to the prospect of...carrying out material development), a liability to development gains charge arises.Development gains realised by individuals are taxed as income(ie at rates up to 83$), whilst such gains realised by companies are subject to normal company taxation - this means a rate of$2% for open companies in general, and approximately 75$  orclose companies.    (In considering the rate of 52% for companies,it must be borne in mind that there is further taxation ongains realised by individuals who sell shares which haveappreciated in value as a result of the company&apos;s developmentgains.)7.    It is an essential feature of the development gains charge that gains are taxed within the context of normal company/personal taxation.    Under this approach the maximum possiblerate for taxing development gains is the current top rate forthe taxation of a company or an individual, as the case may be.&apos;  8.   An alternative approach, and the one adopted in the last labour government&apos;^ betterment levy, is to treat realisation of develoo-ment value as distinct from other capital gains   and to subjectthem to a special levy or charge outside the personal/companyI   taxation system.    This means looking only at the circumstancesof the individual transaction, and not at personal circumstancesor other aspects of the financial status of those x^ho realisedevelopment gains.    In principle, an approach of this kind allowsa higher rate of taxation of development gains (though the betterment levy, which was fixed at 1+0%, would generally have produced a lower rate of charge than the current developmentgains charge).
Ill  CRITERIA FOR SELECTING A NEW scheme.    There are a number of important criteria against which any scheme for pur-chase price/taxation in the transitional periodmust be tested.    Some of these arise from the nature of thelong-term scheme;    others relate to constraints, some of whichhave already been identified in earlier discussions of the mainscheme.    The criteria which the Working Party have considered are:from the question of avoiding excessive manpowerdemands which would make it harder for local autho-rities to staff themselves for increased acquisition^the main point here is that the transitional scheme should include a substantial incentive for localauthorities to build up their acquisition programmes, by reducing the net cost to them of buying land.b. transition to purchase at current use value.    The ultimate objective is that local authorities should pay only thecurrent use value of land.    So far as possible, a transi-tional scheme should provide for a smooth transition tothe new basis of compensation.c. continuance of development programmes.    The need to avoiddisruption of development programmes was one factor which led to the decision in favour of phased introduction ofthe total acquisition scheme.    The transitional arrange-ments must be consistent with the aim of ensuring a con-tinuing supply of land for development. ;id. market confidence.    In addition to firms which have a direct interest in development programmes, a wide range offinancial institutions have a stake in the property market,and may have, assets the value of which resides in theprospect of realising development value.    In the currentdepressed state of the market it is clearly important to frame the transitional scheme in such a way that anyfurther blow to confidence is avoided as far as possible,and that  financial institutions are not driven to look forproperty investments abroad.a.    contribution towards achievement of the ultimate aim of 100^ public acquisition.    It is clearlyimportant that any transitional arrangements shouldfit in withi the long-term aim of the scheme.    Apart
e.    avoidance of a 2-price system.    If a private market inland is to continue in the transitional period, land will need to continue to change hands at prices whichreflect development value.    Although the transitionalscheme needs to achieve an effective reduction in thecost of land to public authorities, it is important that the net amount that a landowner receives for hisland should be the same whether he sells privately orto a public authority.    If an owner thinks he can realisemore (after tax) by selling privately,, there will be in-creased resistance to all public acquisition (includingpurchases for existing statutory purposes - eg schools,roads), and this will make it more difficult to achieve a rapid build-up of local authority acquisition programmes.Moreoever, a 2-price system will lead to cases of hardshipand inequity, and this would almost certainly lead to an opposition commitment to repeal the legislation.manpower.    Shortage of skilled manpower has been accepted as a constraint on the speed with which full public acquisition can be introduced.    Any scheme involving achange in the basis of compensation or new tax arrangements is bound to lead to increased calls on manpower and, inparticular, on one of the most important categories -valuers.    A scheme involving a large extra requirement forvaluers will be impossible to implement in practice;    andany large extra call on valuers is likely to reduce the rate at which programmes of public acquisition can be built up.Measures to increase the supply of skilled manpower are bound to take some time to have full effect, and any scheme which does not recognise the immediate constraintwould be unwelcome.g, &apos; fiscal equity.    Any new taxation arrangements must conform to accepted standards of fiscal equity.k
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES!10.    The Working Party have considered a wide range of schemes.These fall into 2 broad categories, corresponding with the alter-,native versions of para 38 of the draft White&apos; Paper:a. approaches involving a change in the basis of compensation -the proposal in the first version of para 38 was that compen-sation on compulsory purchase should be limited to the valueof the land on the basis of the planning situation and landprices ruling at White Paper day - ie frozen market value (FMV);b. approaches under which the basis of compensation remainsor levymarket value, but the tax/due on the realisation of a develop-ment gain is computed and deducted from the price which thepublic authority actually pay - ie they buy net of tax/levy&quot;so that the cost to them is reduced whilst the amount .u that theowner receives is the same as if he had. sold privately. Thisis the second version of para 38.In addition, the Working Party have considered a third approach whichachieves broadly the same effect as (b) above, but in a simpler andmore open way:c. the basis of compensation remains market value, withrealisations of development value, whether on public or private sales, being taxed in the ^narraa-l way.    But the effective C03t of land to public authorities is reducedby the payment of specific grants.FROZEN MARKET VALUE SCHEME11.    The basis of the frozen market value approach is that theamount that public authorities pay for land should be restricted to a value based on the planning circumstances and level of valuesruling at the date of the White, Paper.    The attraction of this approach is that it would operate directly on the public acquisitionprice and that, as land which had established development value atWhite Paper day was used up, the&apos; price paid by public authorities would in time decline to cuv.    On this approach, the developmentgains charge would need to remain in operation to tax any develop-ment value included in prices based on FMV. ,
12,    If the FMV principle were applied only to purchases by public authorities a 2-price market would be created.    In theory,the price at which land would change hands on the open market shouldbe depressed by the&apos; imposition of the FMV ceiling on public purchaseprices, because purchasers would fear a loss if they paid more thanFMV.    But previous experience suggests that the market would not infact react in this way.    The private market would pay a price inexcess of FMV (especially where there had been a change in planningcircumstances -eg, the grant of planning permission - leading to alarge increase in value), and the amounts realised on public and private sales would therefore diverge.13.    The 2-price problem could be mitigated by changes in the tax system.    Thus, if there was a special levy of 100$ on realisationsof development value in excess of FMV the amount realised on aprivate sale would be brought down to FMV (subject to normal taxation of FMV whether this was realised on a private or a public sale).Annex 1 sets out a scheme on these lines.1Ij..    An over-riding objection to this approach is the manpowerrequirement involved in assessing FMV in all cases.    It is estimatedthat a scheme would require 800 additional valuers - there would beno off-setting savings because the existing tax arrangements would need to continue to deal with development gains which had accruedbefore the date of the White Paper, ie those included in FMV.15.    Moreover, even with modification of the tax system problems of equity would remain.    If land was purchased for whatever reason at aprice over FMV and then re-sold, the vendor would not be able torealise (after tax) more than FMV - ie he would always receive le3sthan he paid for- the land.    This would have serious implications forthe operation of the land market in the transitional period. &apos;Therewould be a serious risk that the land market would dry up completely;alternatively there might be large scale avoidance by means of illicitpayments from purchasers to landowners in order to escape the 100%levy above FMV.16.    The Working Party have therefore concluded that a system basedon purchase at frozen market value is impracticable because the need to avoid a 2-price system requires the. FMV concept to be brought intothe tax system, as well s.s being used as the basis for public purchase,and this makes impossible demands on manpower; and because, even withmodification of the tax system&apos;, problems of equity and disruption ofthe land market would remain.o
EXISTING TAXATION SYSTEM WITH NEW SPECIFIC GRANTS17.    The aims of reducing the net cost of land to local (authoritiesand avoiding a 2-price system could be achieved by retaining theexisting system of taxation and introducing a new specific grant towards the cost of land purchase at market value.    This would bean alternative - and arguably a simpler and better - way of achieving the transfer to local authorities of some proportion of de\relopment value, which might otherwise be collected by taxation.A possible scheme is set out in Annex 2.18.    It is an attraction of a gra.nts approach that it would makeit possible for benefits to be more rationally distributed.    Thus,grants could be given towards the cost of land purchase in urban areas where land costs to public authorities a,re bound to remainhigh because already-developed land has a higher current use value than farmland.    The fact that, under a grants scheme, taxation ofdevelopment gains x^ould remain on the present basis also hasadvantages in terms of market confidence.   And the scheme wouldalso put less of a burden on manpower(though some extra staff wouldbe required to run it, and there might be some effect on valuersbecause the introduction of specific grants towards the cost ofpossiblyland purchase might/require closer scrutiny of local authority landpurchases by District Valuers).19.     The fixing of a rate of grant would raise difficult issues&apos;and the&apos; decision would be bound to be somewhat arbitrary.   Moreover,if it w9.S assumed that the net benefit to local authorities generallybased onshould be/the amount that would accrue to them under the final scheme,allowing for the redistribution between central and local governmentreferred to in paragraph 52 of the draft White Paper, the rate of grant on specific purchases of development land might not be high/enough to encourage local authorities to operate the scheme.Certainly an approach under which the net cost of land purchasewas reduced (even if the benefit accruing on disposal of land for development was shared with central government) would seem more attractive to local authorities than a grant approach.20.    A grants approach is, therefore, feasible, and has advantages in terms of market confidence and manpower.    It seems doubtful^generally, and in relation to other grant systems (eg housing subsidies, transport block grants),
however whether it would be presentationally acceptable, given thelaclc of public awareness of the extent to which development value is subject to tax under existing arrangements;    and it is alsounlikely to be     very      attractive to local authorities.BUYING NET OP TAX/LEVY21 .    The second possibility in the draft White Paper (alternative2 of paragraph 38) is to retain market value as the basis of com-pensation, but to reduce the cost of land!to public authorities by providing that they should buy &quot;net of tax/levy&apos;1.    An approach of this kind requires new tax arrangements because the tax payable on development gains under the existing system is inextricably em-bedded in the total tax liability of the individual/company concerned and is not in any case calculated until well after the transaction onwhich the gain was realised.    Buying nnet of tax/levy&quot; thereforeinvolves putting the taxation of development gains ori! to a &apos;*levy!tbasis - see paragraph 8 above.Sales Tax Scheme22.    Because any system which depends on the separate identificationand assessment of development value in all cases involves heavycalls on valuers, the Working Party have considered whether itwould be feasible to devise a tax   the amount of which would bebased solely on the amount realised on a disposal of land.23c    A possible approach would be to impose a simple &quot;sales tax&quot;on the amount realised on any sale of land where development valuewas realised.    (The identification of cases where development valuewas present would not involve unacceptable demands on valuer man-power, provided that there was no requirement actually to assess theamount of the development gain.)   After payment of the sales taxthe gain left with a vendor would be subject to taxation under theexisting arrangements.    There would need to be provision for pur-chasers who had bought land on &apos;whieh sales tax had been paid to setas a creditthis off/against their own liability to tax.    iniblic authorities would pay for land net of the new tax, but not net of any othertaxation.   A scheme on these lines is sot cut in Annex 3.21]..    This approach, though feasible, ^is not recommended.    It failsthe iuSsiito isolate and tax/development gain /and is therefore crude and
arbitrary, by biting indiscriminately on the disposal price regard-&apos;less of its development gain content.    Moreover, by its nature, a&apos; tax of this kind would have to be set at a relatively low rate. Itwould be impracticable to introduce it at a rate in excess of 10$as there would otherwise be hardship to those who sold land forthe first time-.after the imposition of the new tax, and would notbe able to benefit from any arrangements for giving a credit forlevy already paid.    This approach would not therefore provide anysubstantial reduction in the cost of land to public authorities,and would not achieve a transition to purchase at cuv.Development Levy Scheme25.    A scheme which would achieve the objective of special treat-ment of development value is described in Annex Jj..   This followsbroadly the lines of the 1 967 Act betterment levy with somemodifications.    It would involve repeal of the 1971+ developmentgains charge provisions.26.    The principle of the &quot;development levy&quot; approach is that levyis charged on each realisation of development value (either on a&apos;ondisposal of land or/the carrying out of material development).Thus if A sells to B for  10,000 and realises a development gainof  9,000, A pays levy on this/sum.    If B then sells to C (or carrieout development), he can then use the amount that he paid for theland - the last transaction price - as a &quot;base value&quot; in the assessment of any further tax liability.    That is to say, any development gain in the  10^,000^ paving already been taxed on thesale from A to B, this figure/now provides the basis for the calculation of any further realisation of development value.    Theuse of this &quot;last transaction base&quot; is essential to any system ofthis kind in order to avoid double taxation.I -     . If&apos;&apos; &apos;27.    Public authorities would buy land at a price net of devolop-men t levy.    Thus, if the first sale described in the previous para-/graph was to a public authority, the amount that they would pay toA would be reduced by the amount of the levy chargeable on thedevelopment gain of  9,000.    Thus, with a rate of %0% the cost tothe public authority would be reduced from  10,000 to  5,500;    a rateof Q0% would bring the net cost down to  2,800.
28.    Because it is an essential feature of this scheme that alldevelopment value should be separately identified and assessed,it is bound to make substantial calls on valuer manpower.    even allowing for the saving arising from the ending of developmentgains charge, it is estimated that some  00 extra valuers wouldbe required to work a scheme following closely the lines of the betterment levy of the Land Commission Act 1967 (as amended bythe Finance Act 1969).29,    The Working Party have examined the possibility of reducingcalls on valuers by modifications to the original betterment levyscheme which would reduce the number &apos;bf cases to be handled.They have concluded that the extra valuer requirement could bebrought down to about   12 5   by a combination of the following modifications:-- M k ..   ;/ mma.    exemption of certain owner-occupied plots.    Most owner-occupiers would not come within the new scheme because mosthouses change hands at current use value.    Where there is a prospect of redevelopment however, the selling price of an owner-occupied house and garden can involve a realisation ofdevelopment value;    and owner-occupiers can also realise suchvalue by selling off part of their gardens for development.Owner-occupied plots of up to one acre (or more, if genuinelyrequired for the enjoyment of the dwelling) are exempt from capital gains tax and development gains charge.    To exemptplots as large as this would be too generous in the context of the new scheme.    It would however seem reasonable to exempt from the new levy owner-occupied plots of up to \ or \an acre.. b.    exemption of small cases.    The original betterment levyhad no significant de minimis exemption, and the pursuit ofa large number of small cases was one of the factors whichbrought the levy into disrepute.    In 1969 exemption forcases where the total disposal price was less than  1,500 was introduced (the  1 ,500 limit applied to all transactions byan individual/company, or related individuals/companies,within a year, in order to prevent evasion by fragmented. transactions).    Rises in land prices since 1969 would justify
an annual exemption limit of  5,000. This compares withdevelopment gains charge exemptions of  10,000 for indi-viduals and  1,000 for companies.c,    a flexibility margin in the calculation of base values.Betterment levy provided for a 10$ tolerance over currentuse value where this was used as base value in an assess-ment to levy.   Where a last transaction price was used asbase value there was no tolerance.    In the developmentgains charge there is a tolerance of 20$ over last trans-action price, and bringing this modification into the newlevy arrangements would produce an estimated saving of some15-20$ in the number of cases.    The effect would be &quot;thatif an owner bought for  10,000 and sold for.  12,000, therewould be no liability to levy (though the gain would stillbe liable to normal taxation);    if he sold for  15,000,levy would be payable only on  3,000 and not on  5,00030.    With these modifications the manpower requirements of a levyscheme could be reduced to something which should just be acceptable,though means would have to be found of reversing the drift of valuersaway from the Valuation Office.    But the scheme would still put a heavy burden on manpower resources, especially as local authorities with their own valuers and also the Valuation Office (who act for more than half the local authorities in land transactions) would need to be building up their staffs as progress was made towardsfull implementation of the acquisition scheme.31 .    The development^le^yy^pproach is, however, the onlyscheme which satisfies/the basic^principles of the White Paper schemeincluding a reduced price to local authorities without risk of a2-price system.    The scheme derives broe.dly from the betterment levyapproach of the 196? Act but it should be more acceptable publiclythan that scheme, given the incorporation of the modifications madeto it in the Finance Act 19&amp;9, &quot;the exemptions from the scheme generalalready referred to in the draft White Paper, and the further
modifications set out in paragraph 29 above.RATE OP LEVY AND MARKET CONFIDENCE32.    The fixing of the rate for the new development levy wouldhave important implications for market confidence.    With a levyof this kind, a single rate for all transactions would be required,and it would not be possible to distinguish between companies and individuals as the development gains charge does.    Any rate above$2% would therefore involve an increase in the tax liability of companies, and this effect would be the more pronounced becausethe development levy would have regard only to the circumstancesof each transaction, and not to other aspects of the company&apos;3financial situation - eg losses on other activities.33^    Prom the point of view.of confidence it would be undesirable to set a rate higher than the current effective tax - ie $2% - forcompanies (or indeed to indicate any early intention of an increase over this rate).    On the other hand, this could be more favourable to individuals and close companies than development gains charge.To avoid any significant reduction in tax liabilities for them the rate of a development levy would need to be set at &apos;80$.DATE FOR INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW SCHEME3^.    The development gains charge operated from the date of firstannouncement on 17 December 1973-    This was possible because thecharge was introduced as a modification of an existing tax whichwas to be put into effect in the next Finance Bill, and becauseassessment of liability to the new charge would not arise until some time after the announcement - ie after the end of the 1973/7H-financial year.. A development levy would, however, be a new anddistinct impost, involving assessment of liability at the pointof each transaction, and, wherry liability arose on the carrying outof development, a senarate system of notification*35*    In these circumstances it would not seem practicable to makethe new levy operate from the date of a White Paper.    The new arrangements would therefore need to apply to transactions (andthe.carrying out of projects of development) after Royal assent to the relevant legislation, and during the interim period betweenWhite Paper and the effective date, the present arrangements fortaxation of development gains would need to continue.    (Whether
anti-avoidance provisions would be needed for interim period trans-actions would depend on the rate of levy.)   This constraint doesnot however mean that the new levy would have to wait for legis-lation on the whole scheme;    it would be possible for the levy1 provisions to be introduced in a separate measure if necessary.yil   CONCLUSIONS36.    The Working Party&apos;s conclusions are as follows:a. We have not found a PMV scheme x-;hich can be recommendedas meeting the key criteria set out in paragraph 9. All thevariants that we have studied either are impossible in man-power terms, or vitally threaten the land market, or lead toa 2-price market, or produce a combination of these effects(paragraphs 11-16).b. A 2-price system could be avoided by public purchase at market value with grants from central government toxmrds thecost of land purchase; but there are political and etherdisadvantages to set against this approach&apos;s basic advantages of simplicity and openness and maintenance of confidence(paragraphs 17-20).c. A sales tax on all transactions including development value would have substantial disadvantages and x-;ould not contribute towards the achievement of the White Paper objectives(paragraphs 22-21].).d. A development levy 3cheme, based on.the 1967 Act bettermentlevy with the modifications considered in paragraph 29, isfeasible, avoids a 2-price market, and satisfies most of theland policy objectives and more than any other scheme we havebeen able to formulate (paragraphs 25-31).e. The fixing of the initial rate of development levy andstatements of intention about future increases would haveIfimportant implications for market confidence (paragraphs 32-33)f.

ANNEX I. SCHEME I - DESCRIPTIONSCHEME I  : FROZEN MARKET VALUEDESCRIPTION OF scheme.    In this scheme local authorities would buy at current use value or at Frozen Market value - i.e. value on the basis of the planningsituation and&apos;level of values ruling at White Paper day - if this was higher.   A private market would be permitted,, but a landowner selling 1privately would not be allowed to&apos;retain any part of the sale price which was in excess of FMV,  i.e. there would be a 100/2 levy on anyexcess above FMV.   The FMV amount would then be subject to normaltaxation (i.e. development gains charge,. capital gains tax, corporationtax or income tax).2.     A vendor who had paid more than FMV, either before or after the effective date, would have no means of getting his money hack except by developing the land himself.    If he sold to a public authority thecompensation would be restricted to FMV; if he sold privately anything that he received in excess of FMV would be taxed away by the 100% levy.

A flat rate &quot;sales tax&quot; on disposal proceeds of transactions wheredevelopment value present.   DG-T to continue to run on total gain, and sales tax allowed as credit (as far as possible) against DOT.   Localauthorities buy net of sales tax.2.   A flat rate tax would not necessarily have to be at a low rate,but special provisions (or a specially low rate) would be requiredfor the. first transaction after the effective date, for land held atthat date.   The special provision illustrated below does not workwhere there is insufficient DG-T (see (&apos;b)) nor for traders in land,gross funds and charities because they do not pay DG-T02.   The flate rate tax would apply whenever development value was present.   In the extreme case, and in the absence of any marginalprovisions (which would involve assessment of current use value)a sale at  100 ox land including only  1 of development value would attract  10 liability which could not be credited because there wouldbe insufficient DGT.4.   To the extent that there is insufficient credit, land withdevelopment value at the. effective date is immediately devalued byup to 10$ of its total value, regardless of the amount of the development value, ie even if the latter were 0.1$ the 10.fi sales tax would automatically apply to the total value.5.   The scheme does not work after a private sale after the effective  .date.   The question marks appear, &quot;in the third column because the figurindepends on whichever of the following courses is adopted.    If on the onehand credit is allowed on a subsequent transaction it is allowing thesame &quot;payment&quot; to be used as a credit twice.    If on the other hand anycredit is not allowed there will either be holding off or a sale at aninflated price to recover the acquisition cost at the very least.Further, if a credit is allowed it is of little or no advantage tolocal authorities because there is little or no sales tax for them to buy net of.

SCHEME 3 (SALES TAX)EVALUATION AGAINST KEY CRITERIAa.    Contribution towards achievement of ultimate aim of 100% public acquisition.b. Transition to purchase at current use value.c. Continuation ofa development programme s.Market confidenceLittle, because of oppositionto sales until market valuerises enough for vendors to recoup purchase price paidby them.    The higher the rateof sales tax the greater theopposition.Not achievedDistorts programmes because it discourages transactions and is inflationary atcommencement and/ wheneverrate of sales tax is raised.See comment on (a), &quot;To be considered separately^/e, Avoidance of a 2- pricesystem.f. Manpowerg.   Fiscal equityAchievedValuer need for ascertainingprescence of development- value would be minimal-.   But there might be substantialrequirement for special provisions for firsttransactions after appointeddate.    Computation, assessmentand collection of tax wouldrequire substantial executivestaff.Any flat rate tax on salesproceeds would not, in -IR1sview, be an acceptable basis for a tax on betterment.Such a tax, which takes thesame amount from salesproceeds regardless of whetherStyb or only 10p of thoseproceeds represents developmenvalue does not make fiscalequity or sense.
SCHEME 4 DEVELOPMENT LEVYDESCRIPTION OP SCHEME],   In this scheme there would be a flat rate percentage levy on allrealisations of development value (along the lines of the 1967 system).public authorities would buy.net of the levy.   The levy would be chargedonly on the &quot;development value&quot; element of a gain; the remainder of the11 the ilgain would then be subject to/normal capital gains tax, Corporation Taxor Income Tax as the case might be.   The sum on which levy was paidwould be allowable as&quot;a deduction from gains or. profit in computingthese taxes.   Thus the levy would be imposed on the development gain ata uniform rate and would be wholly separated from the normal tax system with its differential charges.2.   The tax position of those making a gain from a land transaction canthus be set out as follows:-Companies trading in landIndividuals trading in landCompanies nottrading in landIndividuals nottrading in land at presentWhole of gainsubject to 52%corporation taxWhole of gaintaxed at incomerates (up to 83%maximum)Under levyDevelopment element subjectto levy.   Remainder subjectto corporation tax at 52%.Effective overall rate ontotal gain therefore between52% and chosen rate of levy.Development element subjectto levy.   Remainder taxed asincome.   So overall tax ratebetween income tax rate andlevy rate.Development ele-    Development element subjectment charged atcorporation taxrate (52%);remainder at cap-it al gain rate(3Q%).   So overallrate between 30%and 52%.to levy. Remainder taxed atcapital gain rate (30-;). Sooverall rate between 30% andlevy rate,D ev e 1 o pm ent el e -ment charged atincome rate (max83%).   Remainderto capital gainstax at 30%.&quot; Sooverall rate between30% and income rate.Development element subjectto levy.   Remainder subjectto capital gains tax at 30%.So overall rate between 30%and levy rate.Scheme   ij.Description
3.   Realisation of development value would include the development ofhis property by a non-exempted owner occupier (although notransaction was involved),,4.   The development element Of a gain would be the proceeds of sale(or value when deve3.opment commences) less the highest of(i)   cost plus any increase in current use value; or(ii)   current use value -t- 10$ or(iii)   cost plus 20$.These bases are the same as those use(d for development gains tax anddiffer from those used for the 1967 Betterment Levy only in thatBetterment levy 1967 did not have &quot;cost plus 20$&quot; - but instead had&quot;cost&quot;.5.   There would be exemptions from the levy for:--(i)   the residential owner-occupier with a plot of up tot Z&quot;or 1-7 Siore(ii)   total annual disposals by a company or individual of lessthan  5,000.
