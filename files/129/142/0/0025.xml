(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. fig7th July, 1969CABINETAPJOC.E.EaOM THE ADVISORY GROUP ONTRANS PLANT AT ION PR OB LE MSMejmpj^ar^um by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesittha Secretary of State for wales the development of techniques for transplantation of humanorgans has led to the need for an increasing supply of organs.     Ithas also raised ethical and legal problems which aie very much amatter of concern to the professions and the public.2.     In 1968 the then Minister of Health called a Conference onTransplantation of Organs, which met twice and whose conclusions were made public on 6th May, 1968.3.     Early this year the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for social Services set up a Standing Advisory Group, from among thosewho had attended the conference, to advise on any problems in thefield of transplantation which are of public concern.    Their namesare at Annex 1.4.     Advice from the Group has recently been received, and a copy is at Annex 2 of this paper,5.     The Groupls recommendations are at paragraph 7 of the Advice,They are unanimous in their recommendations as to the safeguards to possible donors, set out in paragraph 5,     In our view these are whollyacceptable.     Of the possible courses of action a majority (6 out of 11)recommend a system of &quot;contracting out&quot;, i. e, unless a potentialdonor has indicated unwillingness to allow the use of his organs afterdeath then use for transplantation should be permitted - provided thatthere is an absolutely effective mechanism for recording and discoveringthe individuals view.6.     The minority (5 out of 11, but including the Chairman,Sir Hector MacLennan), recommend &quot;contracting in&quot;, i. e. unless the potential donor or his relatives have specifically agreed, organscannot be removed for transplantation.    This is basically the presentposition under the Human Tissue,Act, but the minority recommend theremoval of certain ambiguities in the Act, particularly with regard towho whould be consulted in the absence of any expressed wish by a potential donor.

7.      Both alternatives would involve legislation to amend the human Tissue Act, but the minority recommendation would involveonly a limited amendment.8.     We suggest that the Groupts recommendations as to safeguardsto possible donors should be accepted, but that before deciding whether any and if so what amendment of the Human Tissue Act would be appropriate we should allow an opportunity for opinion to clarify.Meanwhile, we consider that the Advice we have received should bemade public, as were the conclusions of the 1968 Conference, withan indication that we have some doubts about the wisdom at present of acting upon the more radical advice for &quot;contracting out&quot;.    we propose, if we can obtain the consent of each of them, to indicatewhich members of the Group subscribed to which parts of the Advice.Publication will enable firmer views to emerge on what course ofaction would be likely to find most general acceptance.    In view of the issues involved and the public interest aroused we are airraaging for publication in the form of a White Paper, and propose that a ministerial Statement should be made on the day of publication.Recommend^ti^ons^9.     We invite our colleagues to agree to(a) the acceptance of the safeguards recommended in paragraph 5of the Advice (at Annex 2)j(b) a Ministerial Statement at the time of publication in the sense of paragraph 8 above,R.

ADVISORY GROUP ON TRANSPLANTATION PROBLEMSAdvice on the Question of Amending the Human Tissue Act 1961Introduction1,      The Group was appointed by the Health Ministers in January 1969 to advise on any problems arising in the field of transplantation which are of public concern.   It has not been necessary for the Group to discuss purely medical aspectsof the development of transplantation within the National Health Service, uponwhich the Health Ministers are advised by the Advisory Committee on RenalTransplantation or to consider questions of research which a^e within the province of the Medical Research Council.   No formal terms of reference were set, however,so that the Group might range broadly over complex problems with medical, legal,and moral aspects.   As a first task, the Health Ministers invited the Group toadvise them urgently on any amendment of the Human Tissue- Act I96I which might bedesirable.background.      Status of Transplantation(a) Kia^e^^-^ansplantation has reached the development stage and is an established/measure.   Grafting of other organs is still in the research phase.   It maywell be that in the course of time surgeons will be able to use this tech-nique on a wider scale as a means for saving life by grafting other organs,but the best working assumption seems to be that the rate of development willnot be uniform.(b) Public ConfidenceIt is axiomatic that the public should be able to feel every confidence thatthe traditional ethical standards enjoining the medical and nursingprofessions to treat their patients to the best of their abilities are maintained.   The trust required by the doctor-patient or nurse-patientrelationship must remain a stable element in the situation of change broughtabout by the development of transplantation.   This situation raises manyquestions for doctors and nurses not themselves engaged in transplantation,and their reaction to this new kind of problem is the next factor in this situation.(c) Attitude towards transplantation in the medical and nursing professionsA doctor&apos;s or a nurse&apos;s obligation is towards his or her patient and it is anovel situation that some other patient might benefit from the use of thefirst patient1s organs.   Many doctors and nurses have felt perplexed by theproblems thus presented, and it is as requisite to the establishment oftransplantation as an accepted therapeutic technique that these doctors and/nurses4.

nurses can have complete confidence in the procedure governing transplantationas that the general public have confidence in the professions as a whole.There is a technical point of some consequence in this; the probability ofa good tissue match increases proportionately with the numbers of donors andrecipients.   To secure the best chance of success, hospitals undertakingtransplantation will need access to organs from patients who die in otherhospitals.   It is therefore necessary to widen the circle of those in the professions who collaborate.(d)    Uncertainties of the present le^al position the law governing the use of cadaver organs is the Human Tissue Act 1961which provides that organs can be donated for therapeutic purposes or researchby a decision in writing at any time or by an oral declaration in thepresence of two witnesses during a last illness.   The &quot;person lawfully inpossession&apos; of the&apos;body after death may execute such decisions by authorising the removal from the body of any part so donated.   The Act also provides,without prejudice to the case where the deceased has made an explicitdecision to donate organs, that the &quot;person lawfully in possession&apos; mayauthorise the removal of parts if &quot;having made such reasonable enquiry as maybe practicable&apos; he has no reason to believe there was objection on the part ofthe deceased before death or that the surviving spouse or &quot;any survivingrelative&apos; would object.   The phrases in quotation marks are not clear.   Who is&quot;the person lawfully in possession1?   In the period between death   and theclaiming of the body by executors or next of kin, is it the hospital, or doespossession by the executors or next of kin start at the moment of death?Is it permissible under the law to remove organs if no enquiry is practicable&apos;within the very short time after which organs become unusable?   Does the rightto object subsist literally in 1 any surviving relative&apos;, no matter how remotethe kinship?   Is the coroner or procurator fiscal obliged to require thatorgans should not be removed until hie own duties can be carried out?3*      General conclusions the Group all firmly conclude the following principles to be of cardinalimportance.(a)    A reputable and, in skilled hands, proven technique of saving life should notbe held back by obsolete law or by lack of information upon which the medical and nursing colleagues of transplant teams may form their attitudes as toco-operation./(b)5.

(b) The supply of organs for established forms of transplantation must beincreased to serve the dual aims of enabling surgeons to treat more patients and improving the prospect of longer survival of the patient because a goodmatch has been secured,(c) The public has the right to safeguards and has the right to know that thereare safeguards.   These must consist first of the traditional ethical standards of the medical and nursing professions, arid second of an effective right onthe part of an individual to make a binding decision as to whether his organsmay be used after death for transplantation.(d) Any changes should be capable of being applied to the transplantation of allorgans.   On the assumption that the major changes must take legislative form,this should applVj or be capable of being applied without amendment, to allorgans.(e) An individual&apos;s &quot;wishes as to the disposal of hia own organs after deathshould have absolute primacy and override all others.   This is broadly theposition under the Human Tissue Act 1961, but it is to be hoped that anyamending legislation would present this more definitely.(f) Publicity can distress recipient patients and relatives of donors andrecipient patients alike.   It has to be emphasised that recipients in thepost-operative stage still have a long way to go before recovery and shouldbe spared needless suffering caused by this.   The practice of hospital staffsin refusing to give the names of either recipients or donors and of the news-papers who respect privacy is commended.   Certain kinds of press interest maycreate problems as transplantation is being developed, but in the long runa3 it will become no more a matter for undue publicity than other establishedmedical and surgical techniques, the possibility of distress to individualswill diminish.   There can never, of course, be objection to thoughtfuldiscussion of the procedures and general issues without singling out the names&apos;    of individual patients.   This serves the- entirely proper and valuable purposeof informing the public of the potentialities of transplantation and their implications.(g) Co-operation of coroners and procurators fiscal is essential.   It should bemade clear that coroners can rely, in appropriate cases, upon authoratativepathological reports from hospitals.   This point is commended to theattention of the Brodrick Committee and of the Crown Agent in Scotland.A.6.

4,     While there were differences of view within the Group as to how some of theseends might be achieved, there was agreement on the array of options open to the health Ministers and on the nature of the professions responsibility to both donorand recipient.Specific conclusions.     Safeguards(a) Determination of DeathThe doctor clinically responsible for the care of a potential donor will always be different from the doctor clinically responsible for a prospectiverecipient.   Before organs are removed, death should be certified by two doctors -one of whom should be at least 5 years registered, each independent of thetransplant team and without regard to the possibility of a transplant.   Incases where resuscitation is being maintained by artifical means, the decisionto continue or discontinue such support must be reached without regard to thepossibility of a transplant.   Determination of death is a clinical matter,useful criteria are the absence of spontaneous vital functions includingparticularly circulation and breathing.   The observations of the two doctors who certify that life is extinct should be recorded at the time and furthera record form for this purpose should be provided so that each mayrecord his findings independently. Such forms should be retained with thecase notes on which there should be a contemporary record of subsequentaction. These records should be available to the Coroner or procuratorfiscal and this procedure should be followed when any tissue is removedwithin one hour of the end of lifei&quot;(b) Use of Live DonorsIt is expected that the use of vrolunteer live donors for one of a pair ororgans will eventually become less common with advance in medical techniqueperfecting the use of cadaver kidneys.   The propriety of using a live donoris a matter for the ethical judgement of the doctor in the circumstancesgoverning each individual case.(c) Ascertainment of the suitability of a potential donor1s organsThere is no objection to making use of part of a blood sample which itwould in any case be necessary to take for therapeutic purposes^ but if itis desired to undertake any other investigation the possibility of distressto the prospective donor or his relatives must be considered and excluded./(d)7.

(d)    Transplanting Organs which cannot at present be Sustained in ViableCondition outside the Human body in cases requiring transit between hospitals solely for tho purpose oftransplantation the only acceptable procedure is for the prortppo t. Ivnrecipient to be taken to the hospital where the? prospective donor is,The Options6.      To set the array of options in context, it is reiterated that two fundamentalobjectives are to be achieved.   First, each individual&apos;s right to decide whether he would wish his organs to be used after death must be respected.Second, transplant teams should have a readier and greater supply of organs.   the courses open fall into two categories: options of action, and options of reinforce-oent to follow through changes,(a)    Options of Action(i) No Change  .If the law can properly be interpreted in the interests of transplantation(that is, if the &quot;person lawfully in possession&apos; can be taken to mean thehospital or its officers for the critical time, if the &quot;reasonable enquiry as may be practicable1 can be held to be a flexible commonsense statement that doctors should try to obtain the consent of relatives but thatpracticability must pay regard to the extremely limited time available,and if &apos;surviving relatives&apos; can be taken to mean those in the immediatedegrees of kinship), then it could be said to be tolerable from the pointof view of surgeons engaged in transplantation to leave the law as it is.The merit of taking no action would appear to be flexibility; itsdisadvantages, the lack of clarity in which the general public and the professions would continue to find themselves and the risk of legal action against doctors who had acted in good faith.   In this regard theGroup has noted the extra-judicial opinion of an eminent    judge2.(ii) Limited AmendmentBy this is meant removing the ambiguities in the Human Tissue Act.   Itwould imply clarifying that the &apos;person lawfully in possession&apos; was thehospital authority during the time between death and the time when nextof kin or executors claim the body; defining the persons with a right to*be consulted who should be the next of kin; and defining the minimumprocedure of enquiry.Lord Justice Edmund Davies1 address to the Royal Society of Medicine, 5*5.69* In this connection, the clarity of definitions in the U.S. Uniform AnatomicalGift Act is commended.   Particular care should be taken to respect the individual1wishes in any nomination of a next of kin distinct from the legal connotation ofthe term.8.

iii) Double ContractBy this is meantt a si.ngl.e_ public and central register  br both consentsand objections recorded during life.   This would have the advantage, fromthe point of view of the public of recording their wishes either way, andof indicating the movement of public opinion to the further end of enabling the authorities to judge when any further action might be acceptable.   Its.great disadvantage is the uncertain position of those who neitherexpressed an objection to their organs being used after death, norindicated that they would be willing to donate parts of their body.It could, however, be associated with limited amendment,   ((ii) above)(iv) Contracting OutProvided that an effective mechanism for recording objection exists, thismeans that surgeons should be able to remove organs unless there weredefinite indications that the deceased had objected.   The Group isadvised that this would require a change in the law, but understandsthat certain other countries (Denmark, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and France)have legislation in this sense.   Implementation would depend on publicacceptance and on there being a register of information as in doublecontract to which transplant teams could have speedy access.Reinforcement(i) PublicityThe public needs information as to the procedures under existing lawon the use of human tissue and on the certification of death.   If it were decided that the basis of the law must remain as &quot;contracting in&apos; theprogress of transplantation would depend upon enrolling donors.Government sponsorship would be needed, and also delicacy of touch.   Theform of presentation should lay emphasis on the fact that the donation ofan organ can save life.   However, while making it clear that this is adecision for the individual, the Health Ministers could properly make itclear that in their view, this would be a laudable act.9.

(ii)    Identification of Potential Donors or Objectors  )This would have to be durable $ immediately recognisable, and unique.Ideally, the identification would be carried on the person at all times.   In the longer run, the public may come to accept thedesirability of carrying medical record cards with details of someother factors, e.g., allergy, of importance in a medical emergency.The uses of such a card are being considered by the Standing MedicalAdvisory Committee.   Voluntary addition of a record of willingness orunwillingness to use of organs after death, would help to put thisquestion in perspective.   A decision depends on other factors andmay not be favourable yet.(iii)   Enrolment of CohortsThe Group is advised that a person of years mature enough to form a proper judgement and of sound mind can give consent to the use oforgans after death just as consent can be given to operations stage 16.   This opens the way to approaches to groups of young peopleat school, college or university.   If contracting in were to be thebasis, this means might produce better results than unselectiveencouragement aimed at the general public,(iv)   The right to ObjectThe individual or his parent or guardians should have a right to objectwhich must be made effective.   If a register of objections is kept, thepublic must be aware of it and have access to it.   There would be a needfor publicity and postage-paid cards readily available at public officesso that the individual might contract out by the stroke of a pen, upongiving his personal details.   In addition, it would be necessary toprovide for automatic exemption of persons who could not give a validconsent such as persons under 16 and the mentally disordered,(v)   Professional Co-operationIt is for the professions concerned to consider whether they mightdisseminate information on transplantation and encourage informeddiscussion aimed at increasing the co-operation of those not themselvesflecommendatioe^aged 111 transplantation.7*(a)     The Group is unanimous in recommending safeguards as detailed inparagraph 5.I10.

CO NFS DENTS AL(b) Provided there  is an effective mechanism for discoveringwhether there  is prior objection and provided  it  is  obligatoryfor  transplant  teams  to search the register,   (6(a)(iv))  amajority of  the Group  (six members*)  would recommendcontracting out  (6(a) (iv)).       If  this were not possible oracceptable,   three of  these members** would advise as  in  (c)below.      The other  three would recommend no change  (6(a)(i)).(c) Five members***   recommend limited amendment   (6(a)(ii))  backed by publicity,   identification,   and cohort  enrolment(6(b)(i),   (ii)  and  (iii)) .(d) Despite  its difficulties,  double contract  (6(a)(iii))  wouldhave wide support  in  the Group as an experiment.June ,   196 9 .*Professor CalneMr. GarfieldProfessor PeartDr, ThurstonMiss WhitehornBaroness Wootton of Abinger**Mr. GarfieldMiss WhitehornBaroness Wootton of Abinger***Mr. CurrieProfessor DunstanSir Hector MacLennanDame Muriel PowellSir Michael Woodruff11.
