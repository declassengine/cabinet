Boundary Commission for EnglandReport on Second General Review of Parliamentary Constituencies under the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Acts, 1949 and 1958.to the right honourable james callaghan, m.p.Her Majesty &apos;s Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentCHAPTER ONEINTRODUCTION1- We, the Boundary Commission for England, are constituted by the House of Commons (redistribution of Seats) Acts, 1949 and 1958, &quot;for the purpose of the continuous review of the distribution of seats at parliamentary elections&quot; in England. We are required by these Acts to make periodical reports and in parti-cular to submit to the Secretary of State, not less than ten or more than fifteen years from the submission of the first periodical report, a report on the whole of England showing the constituencies into which werecommend it should be divided in order to give effect to the Rules for Redistribution of Seats in the second schedule to the 1949 Act as amended by the 1958 Act. These amended rules, which are reproduced inAppendix A, will be referred to as &quot;the Rules&quot; throughout this report.2. Minor alterations of the constituency boundaries in England as established by the Representation of thePeople Act, 1948 were made by Orders in Council following recommendations in reports of the commission under section 4(3) of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1944 and section 2(3) of the Act[of 1949. A list of these Orders in Council was given in Appendix A to the first periodical report of theCommission in November 1954 (Cmd. 9311). Constituency boundaries have since been altered by theOrders in Council listed in Appendix B to this report following the recommendations of the Commissionin the first periodical report and in reports (a) of the Commission under section 2(3) of the 1949 Act.;3. This is the second periodical report for the whole of England. Details of the contents of the 516 constituencies-uencies we recommend are given in Appendix C. Appendices D and E give the numbers of parliamentaryelectors in existing constituencies and in local authority areas respectively. A note on the maps whichaccompany the report forms Appendix F.Tuning of the General ReviewI. As the first periodical report was submitted to the Home Secretary in November 1954 we were requiredi to submit the second periodical report for the whole of England at some date between November 1964 and\ November 1969.I There were a number of factors which we considered before our intention to hold this second generalwiew was announced in February 1965. The 1954 review had taken some fifteen months from its announce-Mt to the submission of the final report to the Home Secretary, but it was clear that the second reviewwnld take much longer since the revised procedures introduced by the 1958 Act obliged us not only to holdleal inquiries in certain circumstances but also to publish any revised recommendations. It was thereforepessary for us to avoid too late a start in the statutory period.h We also had to bear in mind that it was undesirable that the growing disparity in constituency electoratesP allowed to continue. Four constituencies-Billericay C.C., Epping C.C., Hornchurch B.C. and Forts-ftouth, Langstone B.C-had electorates in excess of 90,000 and one of these, Billencay C.C., was about&apos;o exceed 100,000. At the other end of the scale the electorate of Birmingham, Ladywood B.C. was below30,000.I We had in fact been urged for some time to make an interim review of the constituencies in south-westpex where the electorates of the Billericay, Epping and Hornchurch constituencies had risen above 9u,UOU.a) H-C.227,Mar. 1956I  HC. 255, July 1959H.C.60, Feb. 1960I H-C25, Dec. 1963
But much as we sympathised with the difficulties in these constituencies we took the view that we could notconsider south-west Essex in isolation when there was a need to look at the balance of representation through-out England as a whole.8. Another important factor was that the new London boroughs had been established on 1st April 1965The boundaries of eighteen of the thirty-two new boroughs crossed constituency boundaries so that severalconstituency boundaries no longer met the requirement of the Rules that local authority boundaries befollowed as far as practicable. Moreover, as the London Government Act 1963 provided that elections to theGreater London Council would eventually be contested in single-member electoral areas based on the&apos;parliamentary constituencies established following the recommendations in our next review, there would be advantages in an early review of the London seats.9. Finally, we had to take into account the progress of the review of local government outside greater london. By the end of 1964 the Local Government Commission for England had submitted final reportsfor the West and East Midlands, the South West, Tyneside, the North East, West Yorkshire, York and theNorth Midlands but only in Luton and Solihull had effect so far been given to their recommendations. TheLocal Government Commission had also submitted draft proposals for Lincolnshire and East Anglia, andthey were working on draft proposals for the North West, South East Lancashire and Merseyside. the irreview of Southern and South Eastern England was not expected to begin before the autumn of 1965. Internalcounty reviews would follow indeed some had already been started and might also affect constituency boundaries. While some of the proposed local government changes would be approved in good time forthem to be taken into account in the review of constituencies, we saw no prospect of reflecting the completere-drawing of English local government boundaries. We concluded that our aim should be to embody in the review as many of the changes in local government boundaries as possible. Changes that escaped the reviewcould be considered later by way of separate reports for particular constituencies under section 2(3) of the1949 Act.10.   Early in 1965 the alternatives before us were either(1) to review Greater London, and the Home Counties affected by the Greater London changes, undersection 2(3) of the 1949 Act in advance of the second general review this would have looked afterGreater London and south-west Essex or(2) to deal with Greater London and the Home Counties as part of the second general review.It was by no means certain that the first alternative could have been completed in time for the 1967 greater london Council elections to be contested on the basis of single-member electoral areas. Nor was it certainthat a review of Greater London and the Home Counties followed by the second general review of the wholeof England-involving as it would a further look at London and the Home Counties could be completed by November 1969. The alternative of starting a general review had the merit that we could consider overallParliamentary representation, balancing the entitlement of London and the Home Counties against the restof England, though a general review could not be completed in time for the 1967 Greater London Councilelections.11. We concluded that the advantage lay with a general review. After consultation with the Commissionsfor Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, it was agreed that preparations should be made to begin thegeneral review in the Spring of 1965. All four Commissions announced their intentions on 16th February1965 and the Home Secretary informed the House of Commons of this in a Written Answer to a Parliamen-tary Question on 18th February. The statutory notice of the Commission^ intention was published in theLondon Gazette on 19th February 1965.Procedure of the Commission12. The Rules required us to conduct our general review on the basis of the parliamentary electorates exis-ting when we announced our intention. The General Register Office provided us with particulars of theelectorates of each administrative area as at 15th February 1965, the Ordnance Survey prepared for usmaps showing in detail all the administrative areas of England, and the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment supplied us with information on housing and development. With this information before uswe framed our provisional recommendations and published them locally.13. We did not invite suggestions before making our provisional recommendations. We considered thatit was better for us from our independent position to take the first step of preparing provisional recom-mendations based on the information available to us without regard to any conflicting suggestions we might receive. There still remained the possibility of unsolicited suggestions reaching us but we considered that,were we to take account of them, it would be unfair to those holding contrary opinions who had not chosen to put suggestions to us and we decided not to consider any ex parte suggestions sent to us prior to thepublication of our provisional recommendations. In the event, few such suggestions were received and thelocal inquiry procedure gave ample opportunity for the consideration of counter-proposals.14. As required by the 1949 and 1958 Acts, we published our proposals in local newspapers circulating inthe constituencies affected. We gave more publicity to our proposals than the statutes demanded and in all651 notices of our provisional recommendations were inserted in newspapers. We also issued a series of pressreleases describing with the aid of outline maps the general effect of our recommendations.15. Where our provisional recommendations involved changes in constituencies we arranged for a copy ofthe recommendations, with a map illustrating the boundaries, to be made available for public inspection at
a local authority office or other suitable place within the constituency. The addresses of the offices at whichinspection could be made were included in the local press notices. We are once again indebted to localauthorities and others who so readily gave their help in making these arrangements.16, After considering all the representations submitted against our provisional recommendations, wearranged for the holding of local inquiries where these were obligatory and, in the light of the reports onthese, published revised recommendations where we thought necessary. The procedure was then repeated representations against revised recommendations were considered, further local inquiries were held where we considered they were justified, and modified recommendations were published in some areas in the same manner as for provisional and revised recommendations. So we reached our final recommendations. In all,about 1,200 written representations and reports of 70 local inquiries were studied by the Commission inthe course of the 17 meetings presided over by the Deputy Chairman during the period of the general review.Local Inquiries17. The notices advertising our proposals included a statement that any representations relating to theproposals should be addressed to the Commission in accordance with the statutory provisions within one month of the date of publication. Under section 4(2) of the 1958 Act we were obliged to hold local inquirieswhere objections were lodged by a body of one hundred or more parliamentary electors in the affectedconstituency or by an interested local authority, and although this procedure added substantially to the time required to complete a general review, the local information which it produced was invaluable to us in reach-ing our final recommendations.18, At our request the Home Secretary appointed the twenty-three assistant Commissioners whose namesare given in Appendix G to hold inquiries on our behalf. We are most grateful to them for their highly in-formative reports and to all local authorities, political parties, local organisations and individual electors who appeared before them and enabled them to present us with the details of local conditions and opinions.19. Notices advertising the holding of local inquiries were published in local newspapers in exactly thesame way as the notices advertising our provisional recommendations. Copies of the representations addressedlo the Commission were placed on deposit for public inspection at addresses listed in the notices. Copiesof representations were also distributed to local authorities and other bodies who had shown an interest.As a result of the experience of the first batch of local inquiries, explanatory statements of the reasons forour provisional recommendations were made available at all subsequent inquiries.20, No statutory rules governed the conduct of the local inquiries. We took the view that, although onlycertain types of local representation could compel the holding of an inquiry, not only were we not precluded from considering other representations, but also it would be inconsistent with the objects of the inquiryprocedure if we restricted the scope of an inquiry to the examination of representations made by local electors,particularly since the matters to be examined might affect the allocation of seats throughout England as awhole. We therefore did not impose any limitation as to the persons who could be heard at local inquiries.21. Where we decided, after considering the report of a local inquiry, to revise our recommendations, itwas necessary under the 1958 Act for the revised recommendations to be published in exactly the same way as the original provisional recommendations. Copies of the assistant Commissioners report were depositedfor public inspection with the revised recommendations and a map. Where we adhered to our provisional recommendations after holding a local inquiry, copies of the assistant Commissioners report were madeavailable near the end of our review when it was clear that we would not be making any further recom-mendations for the area.22. In all, 70 local inquiries were held into our recommendations, including 7 second or re-opened inquiries.As a result of these, in 40 cases we decided to publish revised or modified recommendations.Discussions with Political Parties23. In 1942 the Committee on Electoral Machinery (Cmd. 6408) suggested that, apart from local inquiriesheld under the statutory arrangements, each Commission should also sit under its Deputy Chairman &quot;to hear any representations from the Chief or National Officers of the principal Party organisations with respectto the provisional proposals&quot;. It was made evident in the House of Commons during the Second reading debate on the 1958 Redistribution Bill that the three principal parties were anxious to see the suggestionadopted. Indeed the leaders of the parties wrote to the Chairman of the four Boundary Commissions express-&quot;ig the hope that the Commissions would be prepared to implement it. We adopted the suggestion and aMeeting with the chief officers of the parties represented in the House of Commons was arranged shortly after the announcement of the general review. A further 7 meetings were held with the chief officers as the review proceeded. We found these periodic discussions on our progress and procedure most helpful.Review by Groups24. We found it convenient to review England in six groups, each group consisting of several geographicalcounties, with Greater London treated as a county. This made it possible for us to phase the review to take account of local government changes. We were able to make early progress in areas where local governmentboundaries were either already settled or unlikely to be settled before 1969, but areas liable to early changewere held back. Details of our arrangements are given in Appendix H.
25 In May 1966 the Government announced the setting up of a Royal Commission to undertake a com-prehensive review of local government in England. As a consequence, the Local Government (Terminationof Reviews) Act 1967 provided for the dissolution of the Local Government Commission and for the removalof the duty of county councils to make county reviews under the Local Government Act 1958. The RoyalCommission were expected to report in not much more than two years (i.e. mid-1968 onwards) but it seemedto us that by the time their report had been considered and any local government changes made, it wouldbe too late to affect our general review report which had to be submitted to the Home Secretary not later than November 1969. The Government decided, however, that while any radical alteration of local govem-ment boundaries must be left until after the Royal Commission had reported, work would not stop altogetheron local government boundaries. Accordingly, effect was given to some of the proposals of the Local Govern-ment Commission e.g. the creation of the new county boroughs of Teesside and Torbay; and other smallerboundary changes Were made where the proposals on which they were based were agreed by the local aufhori-ties principally concerned or where the circumstances were special and urgent. We have been able to take account of local government boundary changes for which the Orders had been made, and if necessaryapproved by Parliament, by the end of 1968.
PRINCIPLES OF THE REVIEW26. The effect of the Rules is that the number of constituencies in England shall be not substantially greaterI oriess than 506 (see paragraph 42); that so far as practicable, and without causing excessive disparities betweenelectorates, each county, county borough and London borough is to have separate representation and isnot to share a constituency with another local government area; and that a non-county borough or urbanor rural district is not to be included partly in one constituency and partly in another. Subject to these requirements, the electorates of constituencies are to be as nearly equal as is practicable but a departure fromthese Rules is permissible if special geographical considerations make it desirable.27. The Rules embrace two principles of representative government, equal representation (Rule 5) and territorial representation (Rule 4), which are often difficult to reconcile. The more equality in constituencyelectorates is sought, the greater the likelihood of disrupting local government units. Conversely, the more the preservation of local government units is pursued, the greater is the disparity in electorates. parliament has given the Commission some guidance in resolving this difficulty. In their first periodical report of 1954the Commission said that there had been unanimity among all political parties in objecting to the Corn-mission^ proposals to give effect to Rule 5 equality of representation because they produced considerablelocal inconvenience. The Commission suggested therefore that it would ease their future labours and removemuch local irritation &quot;if Rule 5 were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not&quot; inconsistent with the broadintention of the Rules&quot;. Parliament accepted this suggestion and the following provision was made insection 2(2) of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958:  &quot;It shall not be the duty of a Boundary Commission, in discharging their functions under the said section two (of the 1949 Act), to aim at giving full effect in all circumstances to the rules set out in theSecond Schedule to the principal Act, but they shall take account, so far as they reasonably can, of theinconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies other than alterations made for the purposesof rule 4 of those rules, and of any local ties which would be broken by such alterations; and references in that section to giving effect to those rules shall be construed accordingly&quot;.The debates on the Redistribution Bill in 1958 showed, moreover, a broad measure of agreement that local ties were of greater importance than strict mathematical equality. Particular misgivings were expressed about the extent to which the 1954 review had recommended that parts of county boroughs should be joinedwith surrounding county districts. &quot;The effect of the Bill&quot;, said the Home Secretary,&quot;is to bring in a presumption-tion against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them&quot;.28. We therefore began the review with the iiitention of avoiding, where possible, proposals that wouldchange constituency boundaries for the sake of adjustments in the size of the electorates. We also considered it reasonable to assume that each existing constituency normally represents a community with its own distinctcharacter, problems and traditions. Ties of many sorts may exist within this local community and we believe it to be proper for these ties, whatever they may be, to be taken fully into account before a constituency isdisturbed. We were, however, not inclined to accept the argument put forward at some inquiries that &quot;localties&quot; could refer only to the specific ties of political life that would be broken by redistribution.Rural District Boundaries29. Rule 4(l)(a)(iv) requires that, so far as is practicable, &quot;no county district shall be included partly in oneconstituency and partly in another&quot;. Although it was our view that the division of rural districts betweenconstituencies should be avoided wherever possible, it was suggested to us in our discussions with the chief officers of the national parties that communications were sometimes more important than the boundaries of rural districts. For example, different parts of a large rural district might look to different towns and inthese circumstances the division of the district between constituencies could preserve community ties betterthan if the whole district were placed in one constituency.Ward BoundariesFor administrative convenience we decided to use ward boundaries for the division of boroughs intoconstituencies. In some boroughs we were urged to draw constituency boundaries through wards in order to eliminate polling difficulties such as those caused where wards were divided by busy main thoroughfares,or where blocks ,of flats had been built across existing ward boundaries. Some borough councils assured us&quot;tat in this type of case they would be prepared to re-draw their ward boundaries to follow any new con-stituency boundary which adopted a more natural line.3[. We took the view, however, that we ought not to depart from existing ward boundaries. Where pollingdifficulties existed, it was for local authorities to resolve them by ward reviews. If these were not resolvedduring the course of our general review, it would be open to us to bring constituency boundaries into linealtered ward boundaries by the procedure under section 2(3) of the 1949 Act which authorises us tosubmit from time to time recommendations for particular constituencies.
Size of Electoratesl1 In 1954 when the electoral quota was 57,122 the Commission did not recommend the creation of con-stituencies with electorates of less than 40,000 or more than 80,000, but by 1964 there were 19 constituencieswith electorates in excess of 80,000 and 15 with electorates below 40,000. The 1965 electoral quota for Englandcalculated in accordance with Rule 7 (i.e. the total English electorate of 30 025 849 dmded by 511, theexisting total number of seats) was 58,759. We decided that the limits of 40,000 and 80,000 used by theCommission in 1954 could reasonably be applied in this review, but while m.1954 eighty per cent of the constituencies recommended by the Commission fell within the range of 45,000 to 65,000 it was our aim,taking account of the higher quota, to concentrate constituency electorates between 50,000 and 70,000.Urban and Rural Electorates33. In their initial report of 1947 (Cmd. 7260) the Commission took the view that, in general, urban con-stituencies could more conveniently support large electorates than rural constituencies, and they recommendedan upper limit for urban constituencies of 90,000 electors, or about l  times the then English electoral quota.This recommendation was modified by Parliament, additional constituencies being created in a number ofthe larger boroughs. Nevertheless in their 1954 report the Commission saw no reason to recede from theview expressed in the initial report.34. The average electorate in borough constituencies in 1953 was 57,883. In county constituencies it was56,093 1,790 less. One result of the 1954 report was to increase this difference in favour of the countyconstituencies so that in 1955 the average electorates were 58,201 in borough constituencies and 54,952 in county constituencies a difference of 3,249. But population growth outside the cities and towns, combined with the effects of slum clearance, changed the position within a few years and by the time of the debates onthe 1958 Redistribution Bill the weighting in favour of county constituencies had almost disappeared. By1965 the average electorate of county constituencies had risen to 62,081 while that of the borough constituencies-cies had fallen to 56,208 a difference of 5,873 in favour of borough constituencies. While borough and county constituencies do not represent an exact division into urban and rural constituencies, the figuressuggest that whatever advantage the Commission had endeavoured to confer upon rural constituencies inthe 1954 review had disappeared.35. The 1954 general review did, however, perpetuate the situation whereby some rural counties were over-represented on a basis of strict numerical entitlement. Solely on the basis of its electorate Cornwall, forexample, had one seat more than its entitlement. Northumberland, on the other hand, containing the largestconstituency in England (Hexham C.C. 631,651 acres), had no more than its strict entitlement.36. We considered whether we should give some weighting in favour of rural constituencies and in particularwhether there were rural counties with special problems of their own that deserved more than their strictentitlement of seats. The Rules do not provide for any distinction between the size of electorates in rural and urban constituencies nor do they allow for the allocation of additional seats to rural counties. As we under-stand them, the Rules require a common electoral quota to be applied to all constituencies whatever theircharacter although Rule 6 does give us discretion to depart from the strict application of Rules 4 and 5where special geographical considerations make it desirable.37. It can be argued that extensive rural constituencies with possibly poor communications present problems for the Member of Parliament in representing his constituency, for the public in meeting their Member,and for local political party organisations. These problems, however, may not be so great today as in the past.On the contrary, it has been argued that a Member representing a borough constituency, more accessibleas he is to the electorate, may be faced with more community problems than a Member for a county con-stituency. Our discussions with the chief officers of the political parties led us to the view that the argumentswere evenly balanced and that there was no obvious case for deliberately seeking to create constituencieswith smaller electorates in the rural areas. We did, however, take account of Rule 6 (special geographicalconsiderations) in certain exceptional areas.Designation of Constituencies38. It was suggested to us in our discussion with the chief officers of the parties that wherever a constituencywas composed predominantly of boroughs or urban districts, it should be designated a borough constituencysince if this were done it was probable that parliamentary elections would be administered on a more localbasis. No guidance on the designation of constituencies is given in the Redistribution Acts. Our predecessorsin 1947 wrote,&quot;In many cases we have had occasion to consider whether a constituency should be designated a parliamentary borough. The rules contain no guidance on this somewhat difficult question. In general,however, we have had regard, in recommending that a constituency should be a Parliamentary borough,to density of population and the urban nature of the area. The fact that the area might not include amunicipal borough was not considered an obstacle to the recommendation.&quot;The Commission followed the same practice in 1954 though their report was silent on the matter. We took note that, apart from the possible advantages of election arrangements being handled on a more localbasis, the question of candidates&apos; election expenses was also involved. The permitted expenses in boroughconstituencies were id. less per elector than in county constituencies so that in a constituency with anelectorate of quota size candidates would be permitted to spend about  120 less if it were designated a
borough constituency. We were not disposed to adopt rigid criteria. Where constituencies were reasonablycompact and composed predominantly of urban units of government, we were prepared to designate them as borough constituencies in our provisional recommendations. But where constituencies contained morelljjn a token rural electorate, we generally preferred to leave them as county constituencies.Population movementH j9, We are not required by the Rules to pay regard to future population movement but in the 1954 reviewW 1^ Commission took some account of this factor where population change was &quot;imminent&quot;. The Rulesrequire the use of current electorates and do not ask us to make recommendations on the basis of electoratesas they will be in, say, five or ten years. We cannot, however, escape the fact that the intention of the present law is that a general review shall form the basis of constituency boundaries for at least the next ten yearsand it would therefore be desirable to make recommendations that would, so far as possible, cushion theiffect of gains or losses of electorate so far as they could be foreseen with some degree of certainty. Wejad in mind that New Towns had been a major cause of the growth of electorates in several constituencies; since the 1954 review.40, There is always room for speculation about possible changes in electorate, forecasts becoming lessreliable the further one advances from the present. While we recognised this, we were nevertheless of the opin-ion that population trends ought not to be ignored in border-line cases where constituency electorates weretlose to the upper and lower limits we had decided to apply.Unregistered population41, In some areas it was represented that certain elements of the resident population had escaped inclusionon the electoral register, and that we should make allowance for this as such areas merited special representa-tion. Though superficially attractive, this comes close to an argument that an area should be over-represented as compared to other areas because it is supposed to contain a larger number than usual of people who donot take steps to ensure that they are registered as electors. We did not feel that we should make recommenda-lions on the basis of this argument.Total number of seats42, Rule 1 requires the number of constituencies for Great Britain to be not substantially greater or lessthan 613. From this figure must be deducted the present 71 Scottish and 36 Welsh seats. Since it appearedunlikely that the Commissions for Scotland and Wales would recommend an alteration in representation,a balance of seats was left for England of not substantially greater or less than 506. The 1954 general reviewhad produced 511 English seats, five above the target, and under Rule 7 it was this figure that we were requiredlouse in calculating the electoral quota for the purposes of Rule 5.43. It was apparent to us that it would be necessary to consider an extensive redistribution, particularlyI inLondon and the South-East, as a result of population movement since 1954 and of local government bound-ary changes. The problems of redistribution would have been aggravated were we to have attempted totliminate the excess of five seats. Furthermore, Rule 7 required the electoral quota to be determined on thebasis of the present 511 seats, and this in itself was incompatible with the target of 506 seats.We therefore began our task with the objective of redistributing seats so as to preserve as nearly aspossible the existing total of 511 seats, although we recognised that we might be forced to go above that figure. There could, for example, be circumstances where a rigid adherence to the quota would lead toexcessive disruption of the existing pattern of constituencies, and the terms of section 2(2) of the 1958 Actencouraged us to avoid rigidity. It was however vital for us to remember that additional representation insome areas could only be met by reduction of representation elsewhere unless the total number of seatswas to be substantially increased.j location of seats45. Our predecessors in 1954 found it convenient at the outset of their review to allocate seats provisionallyI to areas comprising administrative counties and their associated county boroughs (that is, the geographicali tounties) on the basis of one seat for each complete unit of electors, the unit representing the electoral! quota. We also came to the conclusion that this was the best method of setting about our task. It guaranteedMr and consistent consideration of one area as compared with another, and ensured that our recommenda-tas for each area, would always be made with the eventual total of seats in mind.Theoretical entitlementj^. At the outset of our review we calculated the theoretical entitlement of seats for each geographicalcounty, treating Greater London as a county, by dividing the total electorate of each county by the electoralMa. Difficulty arose when the theoretical entitlement was mid-way between two whole numbers and infee border-line cases we considered the other factors which are mentioned above in deciding whether to commend the higher or the lower number of seats. Our provisional recommendations were for 515 seatsfor England.
Final recommendations47. The requirement in the 1958 Act to hold local inquiries and publish revised recommendations, coupled with the review of local government boundaries proceeding at the same time as our general review of con-stituencies, has meant that our review has taken four years to complete. One disadvantage of this was thatthe 1965 electorates on which we were required to base our review became increasingly out of date as the review has proceeded, and so we decided to re-appraise, in the light of the 1968 electorates, all the border-lineentitlements and claims for additional seats. This we did by calculating for these areas theoretical entitlementsbased on a 1968 electoral quota of 59,825 (a total electorate of 30,570,683 divided amongst 511 seats).48. We decided that on geographical grounds Cornwall and Cumberland should be left with their existingnumber of seats instead of each being reduced by one seat, as we had proposed in our provisional recom-mendations. Of the other English counties, Oxfordshire had the best claim for an additional seat, and in viewof the rate at which its electorate had grown between 1965 and 1968 (from 206,992 to 220,749) we decided toincrease our allocation of seats to this county from three to four. The effect of this was to increase the totalnumber of seats for England to 518, and in view of the limit on the total number of English seats we did notconsider that we could afford to allocate additional seats to any other English county.49. On the other hand, we felt obliged to consider whether the total number of English seats could be broughtcloser to the existing number of seats by reductions elsewhere. The provisional recommendations for York-shire, West Riding had proposed no reduction in the number of seats for the reason that we felt that altera-tion of constituency boundaries there should await the alteration of local government boundaries. Butthe county had one seat above its entitlement (43-00) and we decided that for the combined area of BradfordCounty Borough and Queensbury and Shelf Urban District (electorate 202,098 in 1965; 197,991 in 1968),with a 1968 entitlement of 3-31, three seats only were justified instead of the four which had been proposedin our provisional recommendations.50. Claims for the allocation of additional seats had also been made for certain London boroughs, but when we found that the electorate of Greater London had declined from 5,462,433 in 1965 (entitlement92-96) to 5,343,604 in 1968 (entitlement 89-32) we decided that not only could we not allocate additionalseats to this area but also that our provisional allocation to individual boroughs would have to be reviewed.(The claims of particular London boroughs are discussed more fully in Chapter Three.) We finally decidedthat our provisional allocation of 93 seats to Greater London should be reduced to 92.51. Our provisional recommendations for 515 seats were thus modified by the allocation of one additionalseat each to Cornwall, Cumberland and Oxfordshire, and by the removal of one seat each from Yorkshire,West Riding and Greater London. Our final recommendations are therefore for a total of 516 seats for england, five more than at present.
GREATER LONDON-GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSprovisional Allocation of Seats52, We had treated Greater London as a county in our calculation of theoretical entitlements but thisadministrative area, comprising 32 boroughs and the City of London, produced its own peculiar prob!emswhen we came to consider our provisional allocation of seats. Although by 1965 the electorate of england had increased by about 3 per cent since 1954, in Greater London the electorate had declined by about; per cent. In 1954 the electorate of the area was 5,887,688; in 1965 it was 5,462,433. Dividing the 1965i electorate by the quota of 58,759 gave a theoretical entitlement of 92-96 seats. We had no evidence that the! fall in the electorate had been stemmed and we contrasted the continuing decline in Greater London&apos;selectorate with the growth, sometimes spectacular, taking place in the electorates of the surrounding countiesTABLE 1Electorate, Entitlement and Number of Seats The London BoroughsLondon Borough (I)	Parliamentary electorate 1965 (2)	Theoretical entitlement (Quota 58,759) (3)	Number of Seats					Existing (a) (4)	Provisionally recommended (5)	Finally recommended (6)Barking	118,532	2-02	(b)	2	2Barnet	218,922	3-73	34-	4	4Bexley	151,186	2-57	2-h	3	3Brent	204,503	3-48	4	3	3Bromley	207.765(c)	3-54	34-   &apos;	4	4Camden	162,809	2-77	3	3	3Croydon	225.748(c)	3-84	34-	4	4Ealing	207,683	3-53	4	3	3Enfield	193,895	3-30	1+	3	3Greenwich	157,171	2-67	24-	3	3Hackney	170,212	2-90	2-f	3	3Hammersmith	140,136	2-38	3	2	2Haringey	178,784	3-04	3	3	3Harrow	146,843	2-50	3	3	3Havering	165,050	2-81	2	3	3Hillingdon	154,124	2-62	3	3	3Hounslow	144,777	2-46	3	2	2Islington	171,000	2-91	34-	3	3Kensington and Chelsea	148,102	2-52	3	3	2(e)Kingston upon Thames	103,939	1-77	2	2	2Lambeth	226,352	3-85	3-f	4	4lewisham	200,170	3-41	4	3	3Merton	135,099	2-30	24-	2	2Newham	179,076	3-05	44-	3	3Redbridge	176,147	3-00	34-	3	3Richmond upon Thames	129,163	2-20	2	2	2Southwark	209,027	3-56	4	3	3Sutton	120,027	2-04 &apos;	14-	2	tower Hamlets	136,187	2-32	24-	2	2   .fcltham Forest	175,269	2-98	34-	3	3Wandsworth	222,365	3-78	44-	4	4Westminster, City of (d)	182,370	3-10	4	3	3Greater London (Inc.

which were under-represented on the basis of the 1965 figures. We came to the conclusion that, if we were to preserve as nearly as possible the existing total of 511 seats for England and at the same time ensure fairrepresentation in the areas of rapid electoral growth, we had no option but to reduce the representation of greater London and we decided at the outset of our review to allocate 93 seats. Columns 2-5 of Table 1show the 1965 parliamentary electorate of each London borough, the theoretical entitlement of seats accordingto the electoral quota of 58,759, the existing number of seats and the number of seats allocated in our pro-visional recommendations.53 In no case did we propose that any constituency should include parts of more than one London borough.Not only did this respect the Rules but it also seemed desirable, both for political organisation and forelectoral administration, that constituencies in Greater London should conform with borough boundaries.Our discussions with the chief officers of the political parties supported this.54 We had difficult decisions to make on the number of seats to be allocated to some boroughs. Bexley,Bromley Ealing, Harrow, Kensington and Chelsea, and Southwark each had an entitlement slightly inexcess of 2\ or 3  seats; Brent and Hounslow had entitlements slightly below l\ and 2\ seats respectively.Our provisional recommendations allocated the number of seats shown in column 5 of Table 1. In deciding to allocate four seats to Bromley (entitlement 3-54), but only three each to Southwark (entitlement 3-56) andto Ealing (entitlement 3-53), we took account of the fact that the electorates of Southwark and Ealing hadbeen falling, whereas in Bromley the electorate was growing.55 Local inquiries were necessary in all but six London boroughs (Bexley, Haringey, Harrow, Islington,Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames). Each of the 26 inquiries dealt with the problems of asingle London borough. 18 were mainly concerned with the contents or names of the proposed constituencies,but in eight cases (Brent, Ealing, Hammersmith, Hounslow, Lewisham, Newham, Southwark and TowerHamlets) the inquiry was concerned with the number of seats we had provisionally allocated. Table 2 sum-marises the effect of our provisional recommendations in these eight cases, and gives the recommendations ofthe assistant Commissioners who held the inquiries.TABLE 2Inquiries into Provisional Allocation of Seats The London BoroughsLondon borough 0)	Existing number of seats(a) (2)	Theoretical entitlement 1965 (3)	Seats provisionally recommended (4)	Average electorate of seats provisionally recommended (5)	Assistant Commissioners recommendation (6)Hounslow	3	2-46	2	72,388	3 seats.Hammersmith	3	2-38	2	70,068	2 seats, but with modified boundaries.Southwark	4	3-56	3	69,676	Commission  should re-consider   proposed al-location.Ealing	4	3-53	3	69,228	3 seats, but with modified boundaries.Brent	4	3-48	3	68,168	3 seats, but with different names.Tower Hamlets	2+	2-32	2	68,093	No change.Lewisham	4	3-41	3	66,723	No change.Newham	44-	3-05	3	59,692	3 seats, but with different names.(a) A plus (4-) sign in column 2 indicates that the London borough also contains parts of one or more other existing con-stituencies.56. In reviewing our allocation of seats in the light of the reports of these eight inquiries, we took theview that any variation of the numbers of seats we had provisionally recommended had to take account of thefollowing considerations:  (a) The target of 506 English seats in the Rules was already exceeded by five seats and although there appeared to be little prospect of reducing the excess in our review, we were reluctant to increase itfurther.
(b) Greater London&apos;s electorate was falling and the 1965 figures justified no more than 93 seats if theneeds of Greater London were to be balanced with those of the rest of England.(c) The number of seats allocated was not a major issue in Lewisham. and it was not raised in four otherboroughs with average electorates higher than that of Newham, namely Merton (67,549), Enfield(64,632), Richmond upon Thames (64,581) and Sutton (60,013). There seemed therefore to be no case for considering the allocation of an additional seat to Newham. Very little separated the averageelectorates (column 5 of Table 2) of Hammersmith, Southwark, Ealing, Brent and Tower Hamletsunder our provisional recommendations, the highest (Hammersmith) being only 1,975 more thanthe lowest (Tower Hamlets) and Merton&apos;s average electorate being only 544 less than that of TowerHamlets. Hounslow&apos;s proposed average electorate, however, was 2,320 more than Hammersmith&apos;sso that Hounslow had the strongest case on numbers alone for a re-consideration of the numberof seats.(d) The assistant Commissioners&apos; reports showed the following position on population trends in the boroughs where the number of seats was an issue:  Hounslow The decline in the population appeared to have stopped and planned development should produce an increase of nearly 10,000 electors by 1971.Hammersmith No appreciable increase in residential accommodation appeared likely over thenext five years; the decline of population might continue but not so steeply as inthe past.Southwark While an increase of about 3,000 electors in parts of the existing Dulwich andPeckham constituencies might be expected over the next five years, there was some evidence that the overall population might decline.Ealing Planned development might produce some 2,000 additional electors.Brent No clear evidence of substantial population growth.Tower Hamlets No clear evidence of the likely population trend.Lewisham        Material increase of population was unlikely.Newham No evidence of substantial population growth.(e) In Bromley (207,765 electors, 4 seats proposed), which had been compared in representations withSouthwark (209,027 electors, 3 seats proposed), the information available to us suggested anincrease of some 16,000 electors in the next decade.57, We recognised that forecasts of future population trends left plenty of room for speculation and debate.Of the boroughs where the number of seats was in dispute, only Hounslow seemed likely on the evidenceof the public inquiries to undergo substantial growth in the immediate future. It was also the borough withike strongest claim numerically to an additional seat and we felt that if, notwithstanding the overall objective of 93 seats, a concession could be made, this was the borough deserving an additional seat. Hammersmith,Southwark, Ealing, Brent and Tower Hamlets, on the other hand, stood together numerically and none ofthem showed signs of population growth on the scale of that expected in Hounslow. Their electorates mightle expected to remain fairly static or in some constituencies to continue to decline. We therefore saw no possibility of making any concession in their case in so far as the number of seats was concerned. To concedein one would make it virtually impossible to deny a concession in the others and this would have taken ussubstantially above the 93 seats to which Greater London was entitled and in turn substantially above theEnglish target.hised recommendations i!. Following our review of our provisional recommendations in the light of the reports on the 26 inquiriesltd of subsequent Ward Orders and boundary changes, we published revised recommendations for 17 Londontroughs. Later those for Bromley, Havering and the Cities of London and Westminster were further modifiedaid we held second inquiries into the contents of constituencies we had proposed for Barnet, Havering andSouthwark.9. We again reviewed the position in the light of the 1968 electorate figures as soon as these became avail-&apos;Me, and found that the electorate of Greater London had continued its decline to 5,343,604, giving a 1968ffltitlement of only 89-32. As for the boroughs which had given us particular difficulty when we were makingwr provisional recommendations (see paragraph 54), Bromley showed the increase which we had anticipatedthe electorates of Bexley and Harrow showed little change since 1965; in the other boroughs thefetorate had fallen and had reduced the entitlement-Brent (3-48 to 3-31), Ealing (3-53 to 3-47), Hounslow(H6to 2-40), Kensington and Chelsea (2-52 to 2-38) and Southwark (3-56 to 3-34).This analysis satisfied us that we had been right in our provisional recommendations to allocate onlyfee seats to Southwark and Ealing whilst proposing four seats for Bromley, but it also drew our attention toJ5 relative positions of Hounslow and Kensington and Chelsea. The continued decline in the electorate ofheater London precluded our allocating an additional seat to any London borough, so we could not&quot;commend a third seat for Hounslow. On the other hand we could not ignore the fact that the 1968 electorate&quot;fHounslow (143,560) was more than that for Kensington and Chelsea (142,492), where we had provisionally&quot;Commended three seats. We therefore decided to publish modified recommendations for Kensington and*lsea, reducing its representation to two seats, producing an average 1968 electorate of 71,246 per seat.
An inquiry was held to consider the many representations against the proposed reduction and the assistant commissioner recommended that Kensington and Chelsea should continue to have three seats. However,we decided that we could not give special treatment to Kensington and Chelsea, and so we adhered to ourrevised proposal to recommend only two seats. Our final recommendations are therefore for a total of 92seats for Greater London as set out in column 6 of Table 1.Names of constituencies61. We considered that with the formation of the new London boroughs the borough names should appear in the names of the constituencies in the same way as the names of metropolitan boroughs had been in-corporated in the past. We also considered that, in general, existing names-some of them traditional-should be preserved as far as possible and could often appropriately be a suffix to the borough name. Ina few cases we recommended constituencies with the single name of the new borough to preserve the tradi-tional name: for example, Greenwich B.C., the other constituencies in the new borough being called Green-wich, Woolwich East B.C. and Greenwich, Woolwich West B.C.62. Our approach to this problem undoubtedly produced some long and unwieldy names in the provisional recommendations but we thought it likely that the prefixes would be dropped in everyday usage. Our discus-sions with the chief officers of the parties showed there was a general wish for short names allied with a desireto retain the traditional names where this was practicable. A suggestion by the Greater London Council that,in addition to the incorporation of the name of the London borough, each constituency should be prefixed by&quot;London&quot; met no support at the local inquiries. The assistant Commissioners who held local inquiries in theLondon boroughs gave particular attention to names. The local inquiries showed general support for thesystem we recommend although in some cases there was a desire to adopt compass-point names.63. We were urged by the Greater London Council to revise the proposals for constituencies in greater london which bore the name without qualification of the whole of the London borough of which theyformed only part. The Council had in mind the provisionally proposed borough constituencies of Barking,Barnet, Greenwich, Kingston upon Thames and Southwark. The CounciFs purpose was to prevent any possible confusion about the area which Members of Parliament and members of the Council would represent.It was our view, however, that we should treat each case individually in the light of the local representationsand of the advice tendered to us by our assistant Commissioners. We considered that it would have beenwrong for us to propose names for which there was no local support especially where there was a strong localdesire to retain a well-established name. In our final recommendations, we have retained the names of theBarking, Greenwich and Kingston upon Thames borough constituencies.
THE LONDON BOROUGHS54, in chapters 2 and 3 we explained the general principles of our review and the special considerations whichwe took into account in allocating seats to the London boroughs. In this chapter we deal at greater lengthffjth each London borough and the particular considerations which led to our final recommendations. the detailed administrative contents of these are set out in Appendix C.BARKINGThe 1965 electorate (118,532) entitled the borough to two seats and the borough was represented by partsdftwo constituencies the Barking and Dagenham B.Cs. Our provisional recommendations were:  7965 ElectorateBarking B.C..........   50,021Barking, Dagenham B.C.........    68,511A local inquiry was held to consider alternative proposals for a division into seats with more equal elector-ites, The assistant Commissioner found that our recommendations were preferable to the alternative proposalswhich split wards: under our recommendations the present boundaries were disturbed as little as possible and the imbalance in the electorates was likely to lessen with future development.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.BARNETThe 1965 electorate (218,922) justified slightly less than four seats. We considered that it would be reason-ible to allocate four seats, none of which would be unreasonably below the electoral quota. We suggestedno change in the boundaries of the Hendon North, Hendon South and Finchley B.Cs. and the electorate oftie substantial part of Barnet B.C. left within the borough was sufficient, we thought, to form a separateconstituency. Our provisional recommendations were:: 1965 ElectorateBarnet B.C......      .      .      .      .   48,768Barnet, Finchley B.C.Barnet, Hendon North B.C.Barnet, Hendon South B.C.67,36250,88251,910Representations were made that we should postpone our recommendations until a projected re-wardinglad been completed. We also received alternative proposals for the name of the Barnet B.C. and for anidjustment of the boundary between Barnet B.C. and the proposed South East Hertfordshire C.C. following local inquiry the assistant Commissioner suggested that we should defer further action until the boroughlad been re-warded. He also considered that a suffix was desirable for the Barnet B.C. and that &quot;HighBarnet&quot; would be preferable to &quot;Chipping Barnet&quot; but he did not consider that a suggested adjustment ofk boundary between Barnet and Hertfordshire was a matter for the Parliamentary Boundary commission i the first instance. We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice to await re-warding. Following thenaking of the London Borough of Barnet (Wards) Order 1967 revised recommendations were published asfollows: 1965 ElectorateBarnet, Chipping Barnet B.C.......    55,700Barnet, Finchley B.C........55,614Barnet, Hendon North B.C.......    50,329Barnet, Hendon South B.C.     .      .      .      .      .      .   57,279No representations were received against the name &quot;Chipping Barnet&quot; but objections were made that theTotteridge ward should be transferred from the proposed Chipping Barnet B.C. to the proposed FinchleySC. in exchange for the Friern Barnet ward and that a polling district of Colindale ward should be transferredtorn, the Hendon North B.C. to the Hendon South B.C. The question of the most appropriate constituencytoundaries had not been discussed at the local inquiry, so we decided that a further inquiry should be held.The assistant Commissioner found some justification, on grounds of history and affinity, for one part ofTotteridge ward to be associated with the Finchley constituency, but no grounds for dissociating the FriernBarnet ward from the Finchley constituency. The representations for the transfer of the polling district werenade on the grounds of possible housing development; he did not consider that a case had been made toMtify a departure from our general practice of keeping wards intact in constituencies. Altogether, he was^Pressed that our recommendations involved less interference with the existing pattern of constituencies&quot;an any other proposals.
BEXLEYThe 1965 electorate (151,186) entitled the borough to more than two and a half seats and was increasing.The borough contained two constituencies and part of another. We decided to allocate three seats. we suggested that the Erith and Crayford B.C. should be left unchanged except for some minor tidying-up to conform with ward boundaries. The rest of the borough was then divided into two constituencies usingRochester Way as the boundary between them. The electorate of the Sidcup B.C. was low but this seemed tobe the area with the greatest potential for growth. Our provisional recommendations were:-1965 ElectorateBexley, Bexleyheath B.C.......-    54&apos;070Bexley, Erith and Crayford B.C......    54,032Bexley, Sidcup B.C........43&apos;084As the only representations received from interested local authorities and bodies of electors during thestatutory period of one month supported the provisional recommendations, we decided that an inquirywas unnecessary. A local political party submitted alternative proposals over two months out of time, but since these came so late and our provisional recommendations appeared to command wide support, we werenot disposed to re-open matters by holding a local inquiry.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.BRENTThe electorate was declining and the 1965 figure (204,503) entitled the borough to less than three and a half seats (3-48). We felt that a division into three seats was an essential part of our scheme for allocatingseats in accordance with Greater London&apos;s theoretical entitlement of ninety-three seats. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateBrent, Wembley North B.C.......    68,569Brent, Willesden East B.C.......    67,942Brent, Willesden West B.C......      .    67,992There were objections to the proposed reduction in representation. We also received alternative proposalsfor a division into three constituencies. The assistant Commissioner who conducted a local inquiry reportedthat there was insufficient evidence to justify four seats. He considered that our recommendations werepreferable to the alternative proposals for the inclusion of Tokyngton ward in Willesden West in exchange for the inclusion of Barham ward in Wembley North. He reported a preponderance of local opinion infavour of using compass-point names for the Brent constituencies. A suggestion was also made at this inquirythat Brent and Ealing should be divided into seven constituencies of about 58,000 electors each.We decided that we could not recommend a fourth seat in Brent or contemplate a constituency crossing the borough boundary. Following the London Borough of Brent (Wards) Order 1967 we published revised proposals to take account of alterations in ward boundaries where they deviated from the boundariesadopted in our provisional recommendations. We also considered that local opinion justified a change in theproposed names and our revised proposals incorporated compass-point names. Our revised recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateBrent East B.C.........    67,942Brent North B.C..........    68,263Brent South B.C.    .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .    68,298Representations were again received that the Tokyngton ward should be transferred from Brent NorthB.C. to Brent South B.C. in exchange for Barham ward and various place names were suggested to replace the compass-point names which we had proposed. We considered, however, that these matters had alreadybeen examined at the local inquiry and that a further local inquiry would not be justified. We also observedthat the 1968 electorate (198,240) showed a further decline and reduction in entitlement (3-31).We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.BROMLEY1The 1965 electorate (207,765) entitled the borough to at least three and a half seats and its electorate hadbeen increasing steadily. The borough contained three whole constituencies and part of another. We consid-ered that the prospects of further growth in the electorate justified the allocation of four seats and we suggested the creation of a new Bromley, Ravensbourne B.C. containing parts of the present Beckenham and BromleyB.Cs. The rest of Bromley B.C. was joined with the part of Chislehurst C.C. left in the borough, and theBeckenham B.C. was reduced in size. Orpington C.C. was unchanged but was designated as a boroughconstituency. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateBromley, Beckenham B.C.       .      .      . .      .   49,888Bromley, Chislehurst B.C.....49^842Bromley, Orpington B.C.        .             .      . 55677Bromley, Ravensbourne B.C......&apos;    52^358
The allocation of four seats was not challenged but alternative proposals for the boundaries of the con-srituencies were considered at a local inquiry. The assistant Commissioner suggested that Shortlands wardshould remain in Beckenham B.C. on the grounds of its ties with that constituency instead of being includedin the Ravensbourne B.C. Moreover the effect would be to reduce the electorate of the Ravensbourne B Cahere there was likely to be greater development than in Beckenham B.C. He did not support proposalswhich would have crossed the boundary between Bromley and Bexley. We accepted the assistant Commis-sioner&apos;s suggestion and published revised recommendations as follows:-1965 ElectorateBromley, Beckenham B.C.......57,714Bromley, Chislehurst B.C.       .      .      .      .      .      .    49,842Bromley, Orpington B.C. 55,677Bromley, Ravensbourne B.C.   .      .      .      .      .      .    44,532Representations were made by one individual that the Shortlands ward should not be transferred from theSavensbourne B.C. to the Beckenham B.C., but we did not consider that a further inquiry was justified.We noted that the 1968 electorate (212,492) showed the continued growth which we had expected.We published a further revised recommendation for the Bromley, Orpington B.C. (54,791 electors) to lie account of the alteration of the local government boundaries, involving 886 electors, following thetransfer of the Knockholt area from Greater London to Kent under the Greater London, Kent and SurreyOrder 1968. No representations were received against this revised recommendation.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations as amended, as follows: 1965- ElectorateBromley, Beckenham B.C.......57,714Bromley, Chislehurst B.C.......    49,842Bromley, Orpington B.C.        .      .      .      .      .      .    54,791Bromley, Ravensbourne B.C.   ......    44,532CAMDENThe 1965 electorate (162,809) entitled the borough to three seats. We recommended no change in thetoundaiies of Hampstead B.C. and we proposed that the rest of the borough should be divided into twoconstituencies on the lines of the existing boundary with adjustments to take account of ward boundaries.Although this produced a disparity between Hampstead&apos;s electorate and those of the other constituencies in the borough, we preferred to avoid disturbing an established constituency simply on account of numbers.Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateCamden, Hampstead B.C.......67,918Camden, Holborn and St. Pancras South B.C. . . . 45,141Camden, St. Pancras North B.C......    49,750Some representations were made against the names proposed by the Commission but none against the boundaries. The assistant Commissioner who conducted a local inquiry found that the arguments forbrevity were outweighed by the desirability of retaining the existing constituency names and that the suggestedalternative names of &quot;Camden, Holborn&quot; and &quot;Camden, St. Pancras&quot; were not entirely appropriate.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.CR0YDONThe 1965 electorate (225,748) entitled the borough to four seats. The borough contained three boroughconstituencies and the major part of the East Surrey C.C. We decided to allocate four seats with boundaries!Uhe existing pattern except for minor alterations to conform with ward boundaries. Our provisional re-commendations were: 1965 ElectorateCroydon Central B.C........    56,288Croydon North East B.C.       .      .      .      .      .      .    56,508Croydon North West B.C.......    55,722Croydon South B.C........    57,230Representations ,were made about the details of our scheme, particularly the northern constituencies.^local inquiry was held but the assistant Commissioner did not find the arguments for a proposed transferAwards between the North East and the North West constituencies strong enough to warrant disturbingW provisional recommendations which followed existing constituency boundaries as closely as possible.Nor did he find any pressing case for changing the name of the Croydon South B.C. to &quot;Coulsdon and Purley&quot;.We later published revised recommendations to take account of the alteration of the local governmentboundaries, involving 1,365 electors, following the transfer of the Farleigh and Hooley areas from Greater^don to Surrey under the Greater London, Kent and Surrey Order 1968. The revised recommendations*e as follows:-
1965 ElectorateCroydon Central B.C........    56,288Croydon South B.C........    55,865No representations were received against these revised recommendations.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as amended, as follows: 1965 ElectorateCroydon Central B.C........    56,288Croydon North East B.C......      .    56,508Croydon North West B.C.......    55,722Croydon South B.C......      .      .    55,865EALINGThe 1965 electorate (207,683) entitled the borough to slightly more than three and a half seats (3*53)sbut the electorate was declining. With the objective- in our provisional recommendations of ninety-threeseats for Greater London, we decided that we could not allocate more than three seats to this borough. our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateEaling, Acton B.C.......      .    64,339Ealing North B.C.........71,410Ealing, Southall B.C........71,934Objections to the proposed reduction in representation were heard at a local inquiry but the assistant commissioner did not consider that the growth of electorate to be expected from housing developments andfrom increased electoral registration of Commonwealth immigrants would be sufficient to justify four seats.5He suggested, however, that the boundaries of the proposed three seats should be re-drawn not only to unite the Hanwell wards of Brent and Elthorne, which were separated in our provisional recommendations!but also to anticipate the growth of electorate in North Ealing and the decline expected in Acton. He con-sidered that this could be achieved by transferring Northfield ward from the proposed Southall B.C. toActon B.C. and Brent ward from Ealing North B.C. to Southall B.C., thus creating constituencies of Ealing;Acton B.C. (75,193 electors), Ealing North B.C. (61,694 electors) and Ealing, Southall B.C. (70,796 electors);It was our view, however,that it would be undesirable to create a seat with over 75,000 electors if it could be avoided, and that this outweighed the possible advantages of combining the Hanwell wards. Moreover^the shape of the Acton constituency with the Northfields ward added to it would become most awkward,We therefore let our provisional recommendations stand.When the 1968 electorates became available, we noted that the electorate of Ealing (207,541), in decliningslightly since 1965, then entitled the borough to slightly less than three and a half seats (3-47).We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.ENFIELDThe 1965 electorate (193,895) entitled the borough to less than three and a half seats and we recommendea division into three constituencies by apportioning between the Enfield East and the Southgate B.Cs. thiftpart of the existing Enfield West B.C. which lies within the borough. Edmonton B.C. would remain uri-changed except for minor alterations to conform with ward boundaries. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateEnfield East B.C.........   64,937Enfield, Edmonton B.C. .      . .      .      .    62^613Enfield, Southgate B.C.   .      .      .      .      .      .      .    66,345We received alternative proposals for the division of the borough into three constituencies. The assistanCommissioner who held a local inquiry found a strong case on grounds of communications and local tie&amp;for putting Chase ward in Enfield East B.C., rather than in Southgate B.C. as we had recommended. He con-sidered that a case could also be made for transferring West ward with Chase, as proposed at the inquiry, butthis could not be achieved without a wholesale and, to his mind, unwarrantable alteration to constituency boundaries in the rest of the borough. There was nevertheless no valid objection, in his view, to the transferof Grange ward from Enfield East B.C. to Southgate B.C. to offset the removal of Chase ward. He also coi-sidered that if Chase ward were transferred to Enfield East constituency, this should logically be called EnfieldNorth. We published revised recommendations based on the assistant Commissioners advice, as follows :f1965 ElectorateEnfield, Edmonton B.C. .      .      . ,    62,613Enfield North B.C.......[      &apos;    64&apos;,338Enfield, Southgate B.C........66^944No representations were made against these recommendations.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.
GREENWICHThe 1965 electorate (157,171) entitled the borough to three seats of rather less than average size but thejlectorate was expected to grow. We were also aware of plans for developing the Woolwich Arsenal sitewhich would eventually add a substantial number of electors. We considered that three seats should be allo-tated; our provisional recommendations were designed to do no more than bring the existing boundariesinto line with the borough and ward boundaries with the least disturbance. We proposed:  1965 ElectorateGreenwich B.C.........    52,694Greenwich, Woolwich East B.C.      .      .      .      .      .    49,618Greenwich, Woolwich West B.C.     .      .      .      .      .    54,859We received alternative proposals for the inclusion of St. George&apos;s ward in the proposed Woolwich Eastl,C, and St. magaret&apos;s ward in the proposed Woolwich West B.C. Following a local inquiry the assistant commissioner reported that our provisional recommendations were preferable to the alternative proposalsiiace fewer local ties would be broken. He endorsed suggestions that the Woolwich East and WoolwichfetB.Cs. would be more aptly named &quot;Greenwich, Woolwich&quot; and &quot;Greenwich, Eltham&quot;.We saw no reason to publish revised recommendations for the boundaries. Though there was some meritithe names suggested at the inquiry, the assistant Commissioner did not suggest any pressing reasons foriange and a considerable body of opinion supported the existing names which had stood for many years.Ilham, moreover, had been included in the Woolwich West constituency without giving its name to thesistituency.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.IACKNEYThe 1965 electorate (170,212) was sufficient for three seats of average size and we recommended a divisiontcordingly. Our provisional recommendations interfered as little as possible with the existing boundaries,le parts of Bethnal Green B.C. and Shoreditch and Finsbury B.C. lying within the new borough were joinedlib.wards from the Hackney Central B.C. in a new southern constituency. Our provisional recommendationsere:-1965 ElectorateHackney Central B.C.........   51,682Hackney North and Stoke Newington B.C. . . . 65,288Hackney South and Shoreditch B.C......    53,242We received alternative proposals for the division of the borough into three constituencies and a localiquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner considered that proposals submitted by the Hackney borough council, which placed Rectory and Wick wards in the Hackney Central B.C., with which they had betteris, and Dalston ward in the Hackney South and Shoreditch B.C., would provide more balanced electoratesid were preferable to our recommendations. No one opposed the Council&apos;s proposals at the inquiry. Wejiiblished revised recommendations based on the assistant Commissioners advice, as follows:  1965 ElectorateHackney Central B.C.......      .59,153Hackney North and Stoke Newington B.C. . . . 57,944Hackney South and Shoreditch B.C......53,115No further representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.iAMMERSMITH: The 1965 electorate (140,136) justified less than two and a half seats and was declining. We considered that&quot;could allocate no more than two seats to this borough in place of the existing three if we were to keep to.*objective in our provisional recommendations of ninety-three seats for Greater London. The electoratesi&apos;tbe two seats would be above-average size but we could not afford to create three below-average seats.kprovisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateHammersmith North B.C.......    72,809Hammersmith South and Fulham B.C.     ....    67,327^presentations were made against the proposed reduction in seats and we received alternative proposals &quot; dividing the borough into three constituencies. The assistant Commissioner who held a local inquirypPprted the allocation of two seats since it appeared to him that the great shortage of building land madel*stantial population growth unlikely; the electorate might even continue to fall. He suggested, however,AtAvonmore ward should be placed in the southern constituency with which its links were closer and that&quot;name of the constituency be changed to Fulham B.C.
We found ourselves unable to accede to the representations for a third seat, but we accepted the assistantCommissioners advice on the placing of the Avonmore ward and on the name of the southern constituencyRevised recommendations were published as follows:  1965 ElectorateHammersmith, Fulham B.C.    ......    72,780Hammersmith North B.C.       .&apos;.....   67,356Representations were made against the proposal to transfer the Avonmore ward, but as this proposal had been considered at the local inquiry we did not consider that a further local inquiry would be justified, mThe 1968 electorate (126,761) showed the decline which had been expected and that we had been right to resist the claims for three seats. Our revised proposals produced seats with electorates of 67,247 and 59514in 1968.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.HARINGEYThe electorate (178,784 in 1965) was declining but the entitlement exceeded three seats. We recommendedno change in the existing constituencies except to bring their names into line with our policy of using theLondon borough name as a pre-fix. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateHaringey, Hornsey B.C. ......    68,280Haringey, Tottenham B.C.......    55,893Haringey, Wood Green B.C.......54,611No representations were made against our provisional recommendations and so a local inquiry was unnecessary.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.HARROWThere had been an overall decline in the electorate since 1954. With an electorate of 146,843 in 1965 the borough was entitled to exactly two and a half seats, but to have divided it into two seats would have producedconstituencies with substantially over 70,000 electors in each. We considered that the existing three con-stituencies should be left unchanged, subject to minor adjustments to conform with ward boundaries.Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateHarrow Central B.C........   45,321Harrow East B.C.........   47,666Harrow West B.C.........    53,856No representations were made against our proposals for the internal division of Harrow but we receiveda suggestion that the boundary between the proposed Harrow East B.C. and the proposed South EastHertfordshire C.C. should be changed so as to include the whole of Elstree village, part of which is in Harrow,in the South East Hertfordshire C.C. We decided that this matter could conveniently be raised at the local inquiry into our provisional recommendations for West Hertfordshire. The assistant Commissioner con-sidered that the question of an adjustment of the boundary between Greater London and Hertfordshire wasnot a matter for us in the first instance and that the constituency boundary should not be changed in anti-cipation of any changes in the local government boundary. We accepted the findings of the assistant Com-missioner on this point.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.HAVERINGThe 1965 electorate (165 050) justified three seats compared with the existing two. Our provisional:tSSSS PrD; o flT ^ diVJding int0 tW0 constituencies the existing Hornchurch B.C. withthe additmn of the Gidea Park and Heath Park wards of the Romford B.C. Our provisional recommendations;were:  rIr     .     TT     ,     . 1965 ElectorateHavering, Hornchurch North B.C.   ... 52 298Havering, Hornchurch South B.C.    .      .      . &apos;    53411Havering, Romford B.C......&apos;      &apos;    50/341We received several alternative proposals for the division of the borough, and a local inquiry was held.The assistant Commissioner reported that the exclusion of the Gidea Park and Heath Park wards from theproposed Romford B.C. would violate community ties. He recommended the acceptance of an alternative;scheme which would include these two wards in the Romford B.C. and would transfer the Harold Hill area:(the Gooshays, Heaton and Hilldene wards) from Romford to Hornchurch North B.C., thus maintainingbalanced electorates. He also suggested the use of compass-point namesi
We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice about boundaries but we considered that the namesshould remain as we had originally recommended, since it was debatable whether compass-point nameswould be a significant factor in promoting unity within the borough. We published revised recommendations as follows :-1965 ElectorateHavering, Hornchurch North B.C......59,145Havering, Hornchurch South B.C.    .      .      .      .      .    53,411j Havering, Romford B.C........    52,494There were numerous objections to the revised recommendations. The need to place Gidea Park andHeath Park wards in one constituency with Central and Oldchurch wards was generally accepted, but themain point at issue was our proposed removal of the Harold Hill area from the Romford B.C. and its associa-lion with the Upminster and Cranham wards in the Hornchurch North B.C. There were also further representations about the retention of Hornchurch and Romford in the constituency names.After considering these further representations we decided to propose fresh boundaries for the proposedconstituencies of Romford and Hornchurch North and to adopt compass-point names for all three constituencies-aencies. Our modified recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateHavering North B.C.Bedfords, Collier Row, Gooshays,Harold Wood, Heaton, Hilldene andMawney wards .......    53,837Havering South B.C.Elm Park, Hacton, Hylands, Rainham, St. Andrew&apos;s andSouth Hornchurch wards     .      .      .      .      .      .    53,411Havering Central B.C.Central, Cranham, Emerson Park, Gidea Park, Heath Park,Oldchurch and Upminster wards   .....    57,802I It was our view that this modified scheme would be more acceptable since it placed the central wards ofRomford in one constituency; it avoided the juxtaposition of Harold Hill with Upminster and Cranhamin one constituency; it left unchanged the southern constituency, the boundaries of which seemed generally acceptable; and it produced more equal electorates.We received further representations after our modified recommendations had been published, somesupporting and some opposing them. Since the modified recommendations had not been specifically discussed at the local inquiry we decided it would be desirable to hold a further inquiry. The assistant Commissionerreported that the major problem in Havering was the Harold Hill area, which did not have a natural affinitylith any other area of the borough, and in both the revised and the modified recommendations the areamust unavoidably be a component of an unsatisfactory constituency. He considered, however, that under our revised proposals the other two constituencies Hornchurch South B.C. and Romford B.C. were bothgood constituencies and in his opinion this was preferable to our modified recommendations, which wouldresult in only one good constituency Havering South B.C. This advice endorsed that of the assistant Com-missioner who held the first inquiry and so we decided to revert to the boundaries proposed in the revised proposals and to adopt the names recommended by the assistant Commissioner who held the second inquiry.We therefore published amended recommendations as follows:  1965 ElectorateHavering, Hornchurch B.C.     .      ...      .      .    53,411Havering, Romford B.C.......    52,494Havering, Upminster B.C.       .      .      .      .      .      .59,145Representations were again received against the proposal to link the Harold Hill area with Upminster andCranham, but we considered that the boundaries of constituencies had been fully examined at the two localinquiries. There was no ideal solution in this area, but in all the circumstances our amended recommendations&quot;ere the best that could be devised.We recommend the adoption of our amended recommendations.HILLINGDONThe 1965 electorate (154,124) entitled the borough to more than two and a half seats and was increasingslightly. We recommended that the borough should continue to have three seats based as far as possible: on the existing constituencies but following the ward boundaries. To achieve a better balance in the size of constituencies we suggested the inclusion of South ward in Hayes and Harlington B.C. Our provisionalCommendations were: 1965 ElectorateHillingdon, Hayes and Harlington B.C.....51,672Hillingdon, Ruislip-Northwood B.C. . . . - 49,484Hillingdon, Uxbridge B.C.      .      .      .      . -   52,968
We received alternative proposals for the lateral division of the borough into what were suggested as being more compact and easily workable constituencies. A local inquiry was held and the assistant Commissionerreported that the alternative proposals would break the ties of the Colham-Cowley, Harefield and Yiewsleywards with Uxbridge and also those of the Belmore and Frogmore wards with Hayes. He also expressed doubts whether the breaking of these ties would, as was suggested at the inquiry, foster unity wnhin the bor-ou-m He therefore favoured our provisional recommendations which interfered as little as possible with existing constituency boundaries. Compass-point names were canvassed at the inquiry. He did not considerthat they would have any material influence upon the process of uniting the borough but he suggested shorter^We5 agreed with the findings of the assistant Commissioner as regards boundaries, particularly in viewof the omdance given in section 2(2) of the 1958 Act which encourages us to avoid unnecessary disturbanceof existing boundaries. We saw no strong reasons, however, for changing the provisionally recommendednames which were the same as the present names except for the addition of a prefix. We decided to make nomodification of our provisional recommendations.We published revised recommendations for the proposed Hillingdon, Hayes and Harlington B.C. to take account of the alteration of the boundary of the borough which had been made by the River Crane (LocalBoundaries) Order 1968. No electors were involved&quot; and no representations were received against theserevised recommendations.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, as modified by the minor boundaryalterations.HOUNSLOWAlthough the borough contained three seats, its 1965 electorate (144,777) justified less than two and halfseats (2-46). The electorate had been declining, a slight increase in the west being more than offset by a decreasein the east. We proposed a reduction of one seat. This was an essential part of our scheme for allocating seats in accordance with Greater London&apos;s theoretical entitlement of ninety-three seats. Our provisional recom-mendations were:  1965 ElectorateHounslow, Brentford and Isleworth B.C.....    74,854Hounslow, Feltham and Heston B.C.....    69,923Objections were made against the proposed reduction in representation and we received proposals fordividing the borough into three seats. The assistant Commissioner who held a local inquiry considered thatexpected housing development would cause the two constituencies we had proposed to grow unreasonablylarge within five years. He suggested that we should adopt the proposals canvassed at the inquiry for a division into three constituencies. As indicated in paragraph 59, we deferred consideration of this suggestionuntil the 1968 electorate figures became available. The electorate of Hounslow had fallen from 144,777 in1965 to 143,560 in 1968, reducing its entitlement to 2-40, but it still had the best claim of any London boroughto an additional seat (see para. 56(c)). Kensington and Chelsea, with a proposed allocation of three seats, hadan even smaller 1968 electorate (142,492) and entitlement (2-38). We decided that the most reasonable coursewould be to make no modification of our provisional recommendations for Hounslow, but to reduce the num-ber of seats in Kensington and Chelsea from three to two (see section on Kensington and Chelsea).We published revised recommendations for the proposed Hounslow, Feltham and Heston B.C. to take account of the alteration of the boundary of the borough which had been made by the River Crane (LocalBoundaries) Order 1968. No electors were involved. Representations were again made that Hounslow shouldbe given three constituencies, but we considered that with the electorate for the whole of Greater Londonshowing a steady reduction since 1965, the allocation of an additional seat to Hounslow would prevent a fairdistribution of seats throughout England as a whole.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, as modified by the minor boundaryalteration.ISLINGTONThe 1965 electorate (171,000) justified three constituencies and the borough contained three constituencies and part of another. We suggested that the borough should be divided laterally into three constituencieswith approximately equal electorates. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateIslington Central B.C........    56,934Islington North B.C.......      .    58,039Islington South and Finsbury B.C.   .....    56,027We received no representations against these recommendations from interested local authorities of electors and no inquiry was held.
KENSINGTON AND CHELSEAThe 1965 electorate (148,102) justified just over two and a half seats (2-52). We considered that the existingthree constituencies should be left undisturbed even though they all had less than average electorates. we did, nevertheless, propose slight changes in their names to bring them into conformity with our policy of usinglire London borough name as a prefix. Our provisional recommendations were: -1965 ElectorateKensington and Chelsea South B.C......    43,590Kensington and Chelsea North B.C. .... 49,179Kensington and Chelsea Central B.C.       .      .      . 55,333No representations were made about the proposed boundaries but there were objections to the names.\[ a local inquiry the assistant Commissioner found universal opposition to the names proposed by us andigeneral wish to preserve the existing ones. We accepted his findings and published revised recommendations as follows: 1965 ElectorateKensington and Chelsea, Chelsea B.C. . . . . 43,590Kensington and Chelsea, Kensington North B.C. . . 49,179Kensington and Chelsea, Kensington South B.C.       .      .    55,333The Borough Council submitted suggestions for shorter versions of these names but we were not disposed to depart from our policy of including the name of the London borough as a prefix to the constituency name.There were no other representations.As indicated in paragraph 59 we reviewed the allocation of the number of seats in the light of the 1968electorate. The electorate of Kensington and Chelsea had fallen from 148,102 in 1965 to 142,492 in 1968,reducing its entitlement to 2-38 and was less than that of Hounslow (143,560) where we had proposed thatthe number of seats should be reduced from three to two. In these circumstances and in view of the fact thatthe electorate for the whole of Greater London had declined between 1965 and 1968 we considered that wewould not be justified in allocating more seats to Kensington and Chelsea than to Hounslow and we decidedthat the most reasonable course would be for the number of seats in Kensington and Chelsea to be reduced from three to two. We therefore published modified recommendations as follows: 1965 ElectorateKensington and Chelsea, Chelsea B.C. .... 73,975Kensington and Chelsea, Kensington B.C. ....    74,127The 1968 electorates of these proposed constituencies were 73,883 and 68,609 respectively.There were numerous objections to the proposed reduction in representation, so we decided it would bedesirable to hold a further inquiry. The assistant Commissioner reported that argument against our proposed reduction in the number of seats centred on the problems of North Kensington where, it was claimed, our proposals thrust unnaturally together two greatly contrasting adjoining areas the Holland Park-QueensGate area, and the Notting Hill area. It was also argued that parity of representation would not be achievedwith the proposed two constituencies, since large numbers of Commonwealth immigrants in the boroughwere not on the electoral register. The Borough Council could see no justifiable grounds for objecting to theproposed reduction in representation, but they suggested that the Cromwell and West Cromwell Roads wouldprovide a better boundary between the two constituencies. The assistant Commissioner thought the areamerited our special consideration because of its peculiar problems, and he recommended the restoration ofthree seats to the borough, but suggested that if we adhered to our proposal for two seats, the boundaryshould be that put forward by the Borough Council.With the steady reduction in the electorate of Greater London in mind, we decided that we could neithergive special treatment to any one London borough, nor make recommendations based on the population ofan area rather than its registered electorate (see paragraph 41). We decided that we could not recommendmore than two seats for Kensington and Chelsea. As for the boundary between the two constituencies, were recognised the advantages of the Borough Councifs proposal, but we did not consider them enough for usto abandon the principle which we had followed that constituency boundaries should not divide wards.We recommend the adoption of our modified recommendations.KINGSTON UPON THAMESThe 1965 electorate (103,939) justified two seats although they would each have below-average electorates.&quot;8 recommended no change in the boundaries of the two existing borough constituencies but we suggestedflight change of name by prefixing the Surbiton B.C. with the name of the borough in accordance withour policy for naming the Greater London constituencies. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateKingston upon Thames B.C.   .      ...      .      .    58,697Kingston upon Thames, Surbiton B.C.     .      .      .      .    45,242No representations were made against these proposals and no public inquiry was held. We received a sug-Ststion at a much later stage that Kingston upon Thames B.C. should be given the suffix &quot;Kingston and
Maiden&quot; but in view of the apparent general acceptance of the names proposed in our provisional imendations and the fact that there was a proposed constituency named Maldon in Essex we were not dito pursue this suggestion.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.LAMBETHThe 1965 electorate (226.352) was declining but was sufficient for four seats. Since the borough includedparts of two existing constituencies in addition to the whole of three other constituencies, we found it necessary -sary to propose a major re-drawing of boundaries. We suggested that the existing Vauxhall B.C. should beextended to include Vassall ward; that the existing Lambeth, Norwood B.C. should be left unchanged exceptfor minor adjustments to conform with ward boundaries; and that the rest of the borough should be dividedinto two seats of about equal size. Our provisional recommendations were:-1965 ElectorateLambeth, Brixton and Clapham B.C......    55,700Lambeth. Norwood B.C.......    57,977Lambeth. Streatham B.C.......    58,094Lambeth, Vauxhall B.C........54.5SIWe received alternative proposals for the division of the borough into four constituencies and a local inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner found our scheme preferable to the alternative proposalswhich involved splitting the existing Lambeth, Norwood B.C. He recommended, however, that the proposedLambeth. Brixton and Clapham B.C. should be called Lambeth Central B.C., as suggested at the inquiry.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice and published revised recommendations accordingly.Only one objection was received, suggesting that Larkhall ward should be added to the Vauxhall B.C.instead of Vassall ward, and that the proposed Central B.C. should be re-named Lambeth, Brixton. Sinceboth these matters had been covered by the local inquiry and there was no other evidence of dissatisfaction,we adhered to our recommendations.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified by the revised recom-mendations for the name of the Lambeth Central B.C.LEWISHAMThe 1965 electorate (200,170) was declining and the borough was entitled to less than three and a halfseats. Bearing in mind the overall objective in our provisional recommendations of a total of ninety-threeseats for Greater London we decided that Lewisham, at present represented by four Members, should bere-divided into three seats. This necessitated a major re-drawing of constituency boundaries and we consideredthat this could be best achieved by extending Deptford B.C. so as to include the Ladywell and Brockleywards and by dividing the rest of the borough into a western and an eastern constituency. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateLewisham, Deptford B.C........    68,444Lewisham East B.C........    69,491Lewisham West B.C........    62,235There were some representations against the proposed reduction in representation as well as counter-proposals for the division into three seats, and a local inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner saw no justification for the claim for four seats and he found our provisional recommendations preferable to the counter-proposals on grounds of community ties.We recommend die adoption of our provisional recommendations.MERTONThe 1965 electorate (135,099) entitled the borough to less than two and a half seats. We recommended twoseats, adding the West Barnes, Cannon Hill and Priory wards to the Wimbledon B.C. and the Morden andRavensbury wards to the part of the Mitcham B.C. lying within the borough. As a consequence the existingMerton and Morden B.C. disappeared. Our provisional recommendations were: -... , 1965 ElectorateMerton, Mitcham and Morden B.C. ... 64 211Merton, Wimbledon B.C.        .... 7o&apos;888No representations were made against the allocation of two seats but we received alternative proposalsfor the transfer of Priory ward from the Wimbledon B.C. to the Mitcham and Morden B.C. in exchangetor Morden ward. The object was to achieve a better numerical balance between the two seats and to allowtor the increasing electorate in Wimbledon. It was the view of the assistant Commissioner who held a localiquiry that the alternative proposals would provide more balanced electorates, constituencies of better
shape and a more definite boundary between the two constituencies. Although they would divide the areaknown as Morden, there did not appear to be strong community tics in this area. The assistant Commissionerreported that the links of both Morden ward and Priory ward were with Wimbledon rather than Mitcham.His recommendations were for a MertOn, Mitcham B.C. of 65,122 electors, and a Morton, Wimbledon B.C.of69,977 electors.As far as the balance of the electorates was concerned, we considered there was little to choose between our provisional recommendations and the alternative proposals, especially as the local inquiry suggested thatMiteluiiu&apos;s electorate would tend to grow more than WimbledonY We considered that to include both Mordenami Priory wards in the Wimbledon B.C. would create too great a disparity. The arguments as to which ofthese wards should be included in theWimbledon B.C. were finely balanced. Since the alternative proposals would divide the districts of Morden and Merlon between two constituencies, we decided to let our provisionalrccommenda t ions stand.)Vi\ recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.NEWHAMThe 1965 electorate (179,076) was decreasing but was sufficient to justify three scats (entitlement 3-05).The borough is represented by four scats with small parts of two other constituencies. We saw no alternative but to reduce the number of seats to three. We considered that this could be achieved by keeping the presentEast Ham constituencies together as much as possible, dividing the rest of the borough into two. Our pro-visional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateNcwham, East Ham B.C.......65,142Newham, West Ham North B.C......55,178Newham, West Ham South B.C......    58,756Representations were lodged against the proposed reduction in representation; proposals for four seatswere submitted as well as alternative proposals for three seats. Following a local inquiry the assistant commissioner reported that he found no grounds for allocating four seats. Me considered that our scheme,which placed the whole of the riverside in one constituency, was preferable to the alternative proposals whichwould not only split the riverside but would also put Grcatfield ward in West Ham, with which it had noaffinity. He did, however, suggest shorter names. These excluded place names which did not, in his view,pretend to any great antiquity. We accepted the assistant Commissioners suggestion and published revisedrecommendations as follows:  1965 ElectorateNewham North-East B.C.......65,142Newham North-West B.C.......55,178Ncwham South B.C........    58,756Representations were received from the Borough Council urging us to allocate four seats. No otherrepresentations were made. We saw no possibility of acceding to the Borough Council&apos;s representations.IfNcwham were to have been given four seats, wc would had had little option but to allocate additional seats!o several other London boroughs with much stronger numerical claims than Ncwham where by 1968 the electorate had further declined to 178,412, giving an entitlement of 2-98.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.REDBRIDGEThe 1965 electorate (176,147), which was increasing, entitled the borough to three constituencies. the borough contained three constituencies and parts of two others. We decided to allocate three seats and inorder to achieve a better balance in the size of their electorates wc recommended that Clayhall ward should be transferred from the Ilford North B.C. to the Wanstead and Woodford B.C. Except for this and somei minor tidying-up to conform with altered local government boundaries, the Ilford constituencies would beI unchanged. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateRedbridge, Ilford North B.C.......    64,046Redbridge, Ilford South B.C.......    57,901Redbridge, Wanstcad and Woodford B.C. .      .      .      .    54,200Representation? were made against the details of our scheme, especially the transfer of Clayhall ward*nich, it was claimed, broke its ties with Barkingside ward. It was suggested that Fairlop ward should betransferred instead. Following a local inquiry the assistant Commissioner reported that Clayhail would fittetter into the Wanstead and Woodford B.C. than Fairlop, particularly because of communications. he considered that whatever the ties between Clayhall and Barkingside wards, they should not stand in the way0f our scheme. He did not favour another set of proposals for a complete re-drawing of boundaries involvingsplitting of wards.
RICHMOND UPON THAMESThe 1965 electorate (129,163) justified two seats and we recommended no change in the boundaries of theexisting constituencies. There was some disparity in the electorates of these seats but the use of the naturalboundary of the river Thames made this inevitable. We did, however, suggest a slight modification in the names to conform with our policy of using the London borough name as a prefix. Our provisional recom-mendations were:  1965 ElectorateRichmond upon Thames, Richmond B.C. .... 57,382Richmond upon Thames, Twickenham B.C.      .      .      .    71,781No representations were made against our provisional recommendations and no local inquiry was necessary.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.SOUTHWARKThe electorate was declining and the 1965 figures (209,027) entitled the borough to little more than three and a half seats (3-56). The borough is represented by four seats, but in view of our objective in the provisional recommendations of a total of ninety-three seats for Greater London, we considered that only three seatsshould be allocated. We suggested that this should be done by eliminating the Camberwell, Peckham B.C.and by bringing the boundaries of the Southwark and Bermondsey B.Cs. southward to meet the Camberwell,Dulwich B.C. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateSouthwark B.C.......      .      .    71,522Southwark, Bermondsey B.C......      .    68,805Southwark, Camberwell and Dulwich B.C.       .      .      .    68,700Objections to the proposed reduction of seats and representations about the proposed names of the con-stituencies were considered at a local inquiry. The assistant Commissioner suggested that the electoratemight increase by some 3,000 in Peckham and Dulwich and that, unless the electorate of Bromley (207,765)was going to grow substantially, it would be unfair to allocate four seats to Bromley and only three to South-wark. He suggested re-consideration of the proposed allocation. If three seats were allocated, the provisional recommendations were unsatisfactory because they divided communities and crossed main roads. He pre-ferred the counter-proposals submitted at the inquiry which would divide the existing Southwark B.C.,placing the Cathedral, Chaucer and Browning wards in Bermondsey B.C. and the Newington and Faradaywards in the Peckham B.C. with most of the existing Camberwell, Peckham B.C. This would produce con-stituencies of Bermondsey (72,562 electors), Dulwich (68,700 electors) and Peckham (67,765 electors). If wekept to our provisional recommendations, however, he suggested constituencies named The Borough,Bermondsey and Dulwich.Although the assistant Commissioner attached considerable weight to speculation about the possibleending of the migration of young people from the borough, evidence was given at the inquiry to the effectthat the boroughs population was likely to be less in the future. Comparisons had been drawn betweenBromley and Southwark but the information available to us suggested that any gain in Southwards electoratewould be more than matched by the growth expected in Bromley. As in the case of other border-line areas,we reviewed the matter in the light of the 1968 electorate figures. These showed that the electorate of South-wark had declined from 209,027 in 1965 to 199,990 in 1968, whereas the electorate of Bromley had increased from 207,765 to 212,492. Southwards entitlement had fallen to 3-34, whereas that for Bromley had risen to3-55. In these circumstances, we were unable to depart from the allocation of three seats to Southwark. we decided, however, to publish revised recommendations for three seats on the basis put forward at the inquirybut so as to take account also of the alteration of ward boundaries made by the London Borough of South-wark (Wards) Order 1968. Our revised recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateSouthwark, Bermondsey B.C......      .    65,683Southwark, Dulwich B.C..      .      .      .      .      .      .    64,379Southwark, Peckham B.C.......    78,965The 1968 electorates of these proposed constituencies were 63,452, 63,989 and 72,549 respectively.Representations were made about the disparity between the electorates of the Southwark, Peckham B.C.and the two other constituencies. As the interested parties had not had an opportunity to consider therecommendations for the composition of the three constituencies which the assistant Commissioner had put forward we decided to hold a further inquiry.The assistant Commissioner commented that the prediction made at the previous inquiry that the fall in population of the borough would be arrested had not been fulfilled. The schemes set before him at the inquiry were based on community of interests and amenities, traffic and communication difficulties, and likelynew development in the area, but he considered our proposals to be the most convenient and the leastdisrupting.
SUTTONThe 1965 electorate (120,027) justified two seats. We recommended that Sutton and Cheam B.C. should1)5 left unchanged, except for minor adjustments to conform with the ward boundaries, and that the remainingwards of the borough should form the second constituency. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateSutton and Cheam B.C........58,116Sutton, Carshalton B.C. .      .      .      .      .      .    61,911The allocation of two seats was not questioned but there were representations that the Carshalton SouthWest ward should be placed in Sutton and Cheam B.C. rather than in Carshalton B.C. to allow for housingdevelopment at Croydon Airport. However, the local inquiry which was held disclosed no pressing reasonto disturb the Sutton and Cheam B.C.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.TOWER HAMLETSThe electorate was declining, and the 1965 figure (136,187) showed an entitlement to less than two and a half seats (2-32). We considered that our objective in the provisional recommendations of a total of ninety-three seats for Greater London left us with no alternative but to divide the borough into two seats. our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateTower Hamlets, Bethnal Green and Bow B.C. . . . 66,786Tower Hamlets, Stepney and Poplar B.C. ....    69,401Representations were made for the allocation of three seats and alternative proposals for two constituencieswere submitted. A local inquiry was held but the assistant Commissioner found insufficient evidence tosupport the claim for three seats. There was also little evidence in support of the alternative division of the borough into two seats which involved placing the St. Mary&apos;s ward in Bethnal Green and Bow B.C. and theBromley ward in Stepney and Poplar B.C.We reviewed the position when the 1968 figures became available, and found that the borough&apos;s electoratehad fallen still further to 128,151, giving an entitlement of 2-14.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.WALTHAM FORESTThe 1965 electorate (175,269) justified three seats although there had been some decrease. The borough was represented by three constituencies and part of another constituency. We decided to allocate three seats.Leyton B.C. was not unreasonably above the electoral quota and we suggested it should be left unchanged.We proposed that the rest of the borough should be divided into two constituencies, one centred on Ching-ford and the other on Walthamstow. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateWaltham Forest, Chingford B.C.      . .      .    55,736Waltham Forest, Leyton B.C.......   66,301Waltham Forest, Walthamstow B.C......    53,232Representations were made about the boundary between the Chingford and Walthamstow constituencies and a local inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner reported in favour of alternative proposals forthe transfer of the Higham Hill and High Street wards from Chingford B.C. to Walthamstow B.C. in exchange for the Chapel End and Hale End wards. He considered that an undeveloped &quot;rectangle&quot; lying along thenorthern boundary of the Higham Hill ward would make a better boundary between the Chingford andWalthamstow B.Cs. than that provisionally recommended by us. We accepted the assistant Commissionersadvice and published revised recommendations as follows: 1965 Electorate- Waltham Forest, Chingford B.C.      .      .      .      .      .    54,767, Waltham Forest, Leyton B.C. .      . .      .    66,301Waltham Forest, Walthamstow B.C......    54,201Objections to these were based on the existence of plans for developing the &quot;rectangle&quot;. Some representa-5&apos;ons, however, supported the revised recommendations. We decided that this problem should be consideredia the light of existing circumstances, and that we could not pay regard to possible future developments,&quot;r any new local ties which might be engendered.
WANDSWORTHAlthough the 1965 electorate (222,365) had declined since 1954, it was still sufficient to justify four seats.We suggested that Fairfield ward should be removed from Wandsworth, Putney B.C. to avoid excessivedisparity between the constituencies and we proposed that the rest of the borough should be divided laterallyinto three reasonably equal seats. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateWandsworth, Battersea North B.C......    52,409Wandsworth, Battersea South B.C......    53,667Wandsworth, Putney B.G.......61,277Wandsworth, Tooting B.C.......55,012Representations were made about the name of the proposed Battersea South B.C. constituency and alocal inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner did not find this name inappropriate or that there weregeographical or historical reasons for adopting the suggested alternative of &quot;Wandsworth, St. James&quot;.Objections to the inclusion of the Balham ward in the proposed Battersea South constituency were not pur-sued. We accepted the assistant Commissioners advicesand held to our provisional recommendations.Later we published revised recommendations to take account of an alteration to ward boundaries, involving645 electors, made by the London Borough of Wandsworth (Wards) Order 1967, so as to bring the constituency boundaries into line with the altered ward boundaries. The revised recommendations were as follows:-1965 ElectorateWandsworth, Battersea South B.C......54,312Wandsworth, Putney B.C.......    60,632A representation was received that the boundary of the Putney constituency should be the new road fromWandsworth Bridge to Wandsworth Common but to have adopted such a boundary would have been con-trary to our practice of not dividing a ward between constituencies. Moreover, the effect would have been toincrease the electorate of the Putney constituency which was already the largest of the proposed constituencies.We did not consider, therefore, that a further inquiry was justified.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as amended as follows: 1965 ElectorateWandsworth, Battersea North B.C...... 52,409Wandsworth, Battersea South B.C.          .... 54,312Wandsworth, Putney B.C....... 60,632Wandsworth,&apos;Tooting B.C....... 55,012CITIES OF LONDON AND WESTMINSTERThe electorate (182,370 in 1965), which had been falling for some years, no longer justified four seats andwe recommended a reduction of one seat. Except for a minor alteration to follow a new ward boundary, we saw no reason to disturb the Cities of London and Westminster B.C. One possible way of dividing the restof the borough into two constituencies was to amalgamate the two Paddington constituencies, leaving theexisting Marylebone B.C. unchanged, but our provisional view was that the resultant disparity in electoratesshould be avoided if possible, especially as the decline in St. Marylebone&apos;s electorate was continuing. Wetherefore proposed the transfer of the Maida Vale ward from Paddington to St. Marylebone. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateThe Cities of London and Westminster B.C.      .      .      .    60,445City of Westminster, Paddington B.C.....    56,577City of Westminster, St. Marylebone B.C.....    65,348No representations were made against the proposed reduction of representation but we received alter-native proposals for the boundary between the proposed Paddington and St. Marylebone BCs. Some advocates-cated the amalgamation of the existing Paddington constituencies without the transfer of a ward; othersproposed the transfer of Hyde Park rather than Maida Vale ward. The proposed Cities of London and West-minster B.C. was free of objections.The assistant Commissioner who held a local inquiry reported that the Edgware road/Maida Vale boundarybetween the existing Paddington and St. Marylebone constituencies was much to be preferred. If, however,a ward were to be transferred, he considered it should be Hyde Park which had more in common with St.Marylebone than Maida Vale. However, he suggested that, although the decline in the Paddington electoratewould continue, imminent developments would arrest the decline in St. Marylebone&apos;s electorate, and indeedsome increase might be expected. It did not therefore appear necessary to transfer a ward to St. Maryleboneto achieve a better numerical balance.We did not feel able to accept these recommendations since they would give Paddington well over 70,000electors and St. Marylebone less than 50,000. However, we accepted the assistant Commissioners viewthat Hyde Park was a better ward than Maida Vale to transfer to the St. Marylebone constituency.
After the inquiry we received representations from the Westminster City Council about the name of the cities of London and Westminster B.C. which they suggested would be more accurately named &quot;The City ofLondon and Westminster South&quot;. We sought the views of the interested parties on this suggestion but as(here appeared to be a division of opinion we decided to leave the name unchanged and we published thefollowing revised proposals: 1965 ElectorateThe Cities of London and Westminster B.C.      .      .      .    60,445City of Westminster, Paddington B.C.....    59,279City of Westminster, St. Marylebone B.C.....    62,646We received numerous representations against the inclusion of Hyde Park ward in the Westminster, St.Marylebone B.C. on the grounds that it would be contrary to local community interests and natural bound-aries. There were also further representations about the name of the Cities of London and Westminster B.C.In view of the representations on boundaries we decided to publish modified recommendations in accordancewith the assistant Commissioners advice,,using the Edgware Road as the boundary between the proposedPaddington and St. Marylebone constituencies. Even on the 1968 figures there would still be a big disparityin the electorates of these two constituencies but there was evidence of growth in St. Marylebone and the trend in the figures supported the assistant Commissioners contention that the disparity would lessen. although there was justification on historical grounds for the existing name of the Cities of London and Westminster8,C. the name was not now entirely accurate. We decided therefore to propose re-naming it the City ofLondon and Westminster South B.C. The following modified recommendations were therefore published: 1965 ElectorateThe City of London and Westminster South B.C.      .      .    60,445City of Westminster, Paddington B.C.....    73,387City of Westminster, St. Marylebone B.C. .      ...      .      .    48,538Hie 1968 electorates of these proposed constituencies were 56,953, 68,587 and 46,033 respectively.Representations were received about the disparity between the electorates of the proposed Paddingtonand St. Marylebone constituencies and about the name of the other constituency. We gave these carefulconsideration but we reached the conclusion that a further local inquiry was not justified.We recommend the adoption of our modified recommendations.
CHAPTER FIVETHE ENGLISH COUNTIES65. In chapter 2 we explained the general principles of our review. In this chapter we deal at greater lengthwith each English geographical county and the particular considerations which led to our final recommend-ations. Table 3 shows the 1965 parliamentary electorate of each county, the theoretical entitlement of seatsaccording to the electoral quota of 58,759, the existing number of seats, and the number of seats allocated inour provisional and final recommendations.

BEDFORDSHIREThe 1965 electorate (267,886) entitled the county to more than four and a half seats. There were fourseats already and one of these, the South Bedfordshire C.C., had over 85,000 electors. We recommended thatthe enlarged county borough of Luton, which contained 98,615 electors, should be divided into two constituencies-uencies with as little disturbance as possible to the boundaries of the existing Luton B.C. This would providethe additional seat that seemed justified. The existing South Bedfordshire C.C., less the parts within Luton, but with the addition of electors from the former Linslade U.D., would then form a separate constituencyThe electorates of the Bedford and Mid-Bedfordshire CCs. were near to the electoral quota and, although some minor changes were needed to reflect local government boundary alterations, we saw no other reasonto disturb these two constituencies. Our provisional recommendations were:_Bedford C.C.Mid-Bedfordshire C.C.South Bedfordshire C.C.Luton East B.C.Luton West B.C.1965 Electorate. 60,080. 58,702. 50,489. 52,229.    46,386The basis of our scheme for Bedfordshire appeared generally acceptable but our division of Luton was criticised and alternative proposals were submitted. There were also representations about the name of theSouth Bedfordshire C.C.Following a local inquiry the assistant Commissioner reported that the arguments for our recommendations and for the counter-proposals were finely balanced in the case of Luton. Although our recommendations would cause the least disturbance to existing parliamentary boundaries and had some good topographicalfeatures, he suggested that the counter-proposals were marginally better since they would bring part of the&quot;focal centre&quot; of the borough within the western constituency, thereby giving it a centre for constituencyactivities. He also suggested that the counter-proposals should be modified by dividing Dallow ward along the Dunstable road. His recommendations were for a Luton East B.C. of 50,840 electors and a Luton WestB.C. of 47,775 electors. He found the arguments in favour of keeping the name South Bedfordshire stronger than those for a name consisting of, or including, Dunstable, especially as Dunstable had only 18,257 out ofa total of 50,489 electors and covered a small area of the constituency.We agreed with the assistant Commissioner that it was better to keep the name South Bedfordshire,la Luton however we considered that the advantages of adhering as closely as possible to existing constituency boundaries outweighed any possible benefits of the counter-proposals. Moreover, we were not prepared to contemplate the splitting of Dallow ward. We decided to propose no alteration of our provisional recom-mendations.Following the making of the Bedford (Borough of Bedford) Order 1967, involving 41 electors, we publishedrevised proposals for the Bedford and Mid-Bedfordshire constituencies so as to bring the proposed con-stituency boundaries into line with the altered boundary of Bedford borough. Our revised recommendations were:-1965 ElectorateBedford C.C.........60,121Mid-Bedfordshire C.C.........    58,661No representations were made against these revised recommendations.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations for the South Bedfordshire and LutonEast and West constituencies, and our revised recommendations for the Bedford and Mid-Bedfordshireconstituencies, as follows:  1965 ElectorateBedford C.C.        ........60,121Mid-Bedfordshire C.C.South Bedfordshire C.C.Luton East B.C.Luton West B.C.58,66150,48952,22946,386BERKSHIRE  -&apos;I The 1965 electorate (357,138) entitled the county to six seats compared with the existing five. WokinghamCC., which contained the new town of Bracknell, had an electorate of over 87,000. The electorate of thecounty borough of Reading (82,624) was too high for one seat but not big enough to warrant the boroughking given the additional seat to which the geographical county was entitled a solution which in any case*uld not have met the needs of Wokingham. Although we felt, therefore, that the continued association&quot;part of Reading C.B. with the surrounding county districts was inescapable we thought it preferable that^ association should be restricted to one constituency. Accordingly we proposed that the Tilehurst andNorcot wards, at present in the Newbury C.C., should be included in a Reading North B.C. whilst the four
wards in the south-east of Reading should be combined with parts of Wokingham R.D. to form a ReadingSouth B C (One of these wards was already associated with Wokingham R.D. in the existing WokinghamC C) Thus our scheme provided for a substantial reduction in the electorate of Wokingham C.C., it moder-ated the electorate of Newbury C.C., and it divided Reading C.B. between two instead of three constituenciesas at present We proposed no change in the Abingdon and Windsor CCs.; although their electorates werehigh, they did not exceed our proposed upper limit and we were not aware of any pressing reason to disturbthem. Our provisional recommendations were:-r 1965 ElectorateAbingdon C.C......... 71,299Newbury C.C......... 55,232Windsor C.C........ 67,412Wokingham C.C......... 50,511Reading North B.C........ 57,473Reading South B.C......... 55,211We received representations against our scheme, particularly as it related to Reading, and alternative proposals were submitted to us. There was also criticism of the proposed designation of Reading South as aborough constituency.The main alternative canvassed at a local inquiry would have (a) transferred the two Reading wards lyingnorth of the Thames to an Oxfordshire constituency leaving the rest of Reading to stand as one boroughconstituency; (b) created three county constituencies in the east, centred on Maidenhead, Windsor and Wok-ingham, and involved the transfer of the south-eastern parishes of Bradfield R.D. from Newbury C.C. to thenew Wokingham C.C.; and (c) transferred the southern parishes of Wantage R.D. from Abingdon C.C,to Newbury C.C. All five existing constituencies would be altered under this scheme and four rural districtswould be divided, whereas under our provisional recommendations only three constituencies would be changedand only one rural district divided. The assistant Commissioner considered that our recommendations werepreferable since the alternative would break several existing local ties, notably those of the six easterly parishesof Bradfield R.D. with the Newbury C.C. and those of the Binfield and Warfield parishes (EasthampsteadR.D.) with Wokingham. He did not favour the transfer to an Oxfordshire constituency of the Readingwards lying north of the Thames. Nor did he favour an alternative scheme which involved the inclusionof the parish of Tilehurst (Bradfield R.D.) in the Reading North B.C. He did, however, recommend there-naming of the Windsor C.C. as Windsor and Maidenhead C.C. and the designation of Reading south as a county constituency since a substantial portion of the proposed constituency was rural in character.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice and published revised recommendations for the namingand designation of these two constituencies.In the further representations we received there were objections from the Reading Borough Council to the designation of Reading South as a county constituency: they considered it would be preferable to let ReadingC.B. (82,624 electors) stand as a single borough constituency. The alternative scheme for Reading involving the transfer of the Tilehurst parish from Newbury C.C. to Reading North B.C. was again put forward.There was also a new suggestion that since Maidenhead had been added to the name of the Windsor C.C.,Bracknell should be added to the name of Wokingham C.C.We did not consider that there were any strong grounds for departing from our revised recommendations that Reading South should be designated as a county constituency, nor did we consider it desirable thatReading should form a single borough constituency with considerably more than 80,000 electors or that the parish of Tilehurst should be added to a Reading constituency. The name of the Wokingham C.C. had notbeen objected to at the original public inquiry and had been the subject of only one representation followingour revised recommendations. We were not disposed to propose the alteration of an existing name.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, modified by the change of name of Windsor C.C. to Windsor and Maidenhead C.C. and the designation of Reading South as a county constituencies-uency.BUCKINGHAMSHIREThe 1965 electorate (340,617) entitled the county to six seats compared with the existing five. The primary;object of our provisional recommendations was to reduce the excessive electorates in the county consti-ituencies of South Buckinghamshire and Wycombe (82,456 and 78,354 respectively). Beaconsfield, Chesham;and High Wycombe appeared to be the natural centres for dividing the southern area of the county into three:reasonably sized constituencies with a minimum of disturbance to existing constituency and local authority;boundaries. While our provisional recommendations reunited Amersham R.D. in one constituency wejfound it necessary to divide the large Wycombe R.D. The electorates of the Buckingham C.C. and the Eton!and Slough B.C. were well within the range we had proposed and we saw no pressing reason for changes ex-jcept for minor adjustments in the Buckingham C.C. to conform with altered local government boundaries/Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateAylesbury C.C.........59)917Beaconsfield C.C.Buckingham C.C.Chesham C.C.Wycombe C.C.Eton and Slough B.C52,29157,00153,57960,22757,602
We received alternative proposals for the division of the county into six constituencies, and there were^presentations that the name of the proposed Chesham C.C. should be Amersham C.C. The assistant commissioner who held a local inquiry reported that the basis of our recommendations was preferable tosome radical counter-proposals which would have (a) joined High Wycombe and Beaconsfield in one con-stituency; (b) divorced Eton U.D. from Slough and placed it in another constituency with Eton R.D. (exceptfor part of the parish of Wexham) and the four south easterly parishes of Amersham R.D.; (c) added partof the parish of Wexham in Eton R.D. to Slough; (d) created a constituency from the rural areas surroundingligh Wycombe; and (e) left the Aylesbury C.C. largely unchanged. There were nevertheless valid objections,flhjs opinion, to the details of the division of Wycombe R.D. proposed by us and he suggested that theparishes of Hughenden and West Wycombe Rural should be included in the Wycombe C.C. in view of theirInks with High Wycombe, and also that Ibstone parish should be in the Aylesbury C.C. with Radnage anditokenchurch parishes. Finally, in order to produce less disparate electorates, he recommended that theHedsor and Wooburn parishes in Wycombe R.D., whose ties were with Beaconsfield rather than HighVycombe, should be placed in the Beaconsfield C.C. this would split Wycombe R.D. three ways but thefieiv was expressed at the inquiry that it was no more difficult to administer elections with the rural districtdivided into three constituencies than with it divided into two. The assistant Commissioner considered thatikenames we had proposed were acceptable with the exception of Chesham for which he suggested Amersham,principally because of possible confusion between Chesham and Chester.We decided to publish revised recommendations for the boundaries suggested by the assistant Com-nissioner. As regards the name of the proposed Chesham C.C., although we recognised the strength of theiocal case for the use of Amersham, we did not think it would be appropriate to exclude Chesham. Welidded to adopt the name &quot;Chesham and Amersham&quot; in our revised recommendations, which were pub-isled as follows:  1965 ElectorateAylesbury C.C......... 53,247Beaconsfield C.C......... 57,944Buckingham C.C......... 57,001Chesham and Amersham C.C. ...... 53,579Wycombe C.C.      .             ...... 61,244Eton and Slough B.C........ 57,602There were no representations against the revised boundaries but we received a number of suggestions aboutsiistituency names. In particular it was represented that the proposed Chesham and Amersham C.C. shoulds known as East Buckinghamshire C.C. and that the proposed Beaconsfield C.C. should be known asSouth Buckinghamshire (or South Bucks) C.C. Other representations, however, supported the name Cheshamid Amersham and in view of the lack of local unanimity we preferred to keep to our revised recommenda-ions.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND ISLE OF ELYThe 1965 electorate (187,945) justified three seats. As a result of local government boundary changes, partlithe existing Isle of Ely C.C. lay within the new county of Huntingdon and Peterborough, whilst thekndaries between Cambridgeshire C.C. and constituencies in neighbouring counties no longer conformedrtrely with local government boundaries. We considered that the new county of Cambridgeshire and IslelEly should be represented by three constituencies on the existing pattern but with adjustments to bringJar boundaries into line with the altered local government boundaries. We proposed no change to theCambridge B.C. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateCambridgeshire C.C........    67,069Isle of Ely C.C.      .      .......59,714Cambridge B.C.........61,162to representations were received.I We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.1CHESHIREi The 1965 electorate (976,460) entitled the county to seventeen seats compared with the existing sixteen. Weasidered that the existing Cheadle C.C. (89,758 electors) could not be left unchanged and that the existing;*irral C.C. (81,087 ejectors) should be reduced. Our provisional recommendations were for an additionalttUo be known as the Hazel Grove B.C. (54,024 electors), in the north-east. This would reduce the Cheadle*tituency to 56,576 electors, and consequential changes would also reduce the size of Knutsford andtwlesfield CCs. We proposed a re-arrangement of constituencies in the north-west to reduce the size of* electorates in the Wirral C.C. and Bebington B.C. We recommended that Cheadle and Wirral CCs.:*uld be designated as borough constituencies since they would consist entirely of urban areas. We saw nopon to suggest changes elsewhere other than a few adjustments to conform with altered local authorityi^ndaries. We appreciated that our recommendations would still leave disparities in electorates but ourf visional view was not to disturb the City of Chester and the Runcorn CCs., which were of good size,i rtne sake of achieving more equal electorates throughout the county.

The assistant Commissioner reported asfollows:  RuncornHe agreed with us that the additional seat to which the county was entitled should be given to the north-east of the county despite the strong claims of the north-west to increased representation. He suggested thatthe problems of the north-west could be met by dividing the Runcorn C.C. Ellesmere Port M.B., RuncornU.D. and the western parishes of Runcorn R.D. would form an Ellesmere Port and Runcorn B.C. The restof Runcom R.D. would be transferred to the Northwich C.C. and Lymm U.D. to the Knutsford C.C.Birkenhead and The WirralHe proposed a modification of our proposals for Birkenhead by putting the Upton ward into the WirralB.C., and the Bebington, Mersey, Egerton and Devonshire wards into a Bebington B.C., the remainingwards of Birkenhead forming a separate B.C. He did not favour the designation of the Wirral as a countyconstituency but he agreed that &quot;Port&quot; should be included in the name of any constituency bearing the name&quot;Ellesmere&quot;.North-East CheshireIn order to satisfy strong local ties in the north-east, he suggested that Alderley Edge U.D. and CongletonM.B. should be transferred from the Cheadle B.C. and the Knutsford C.C. respectively to the MacclesfieldC.C. He did not favour alternative proposals for the creation of a new constituency based on Maiple U.D.He also advised against the designation of the Cheadle and Hazel Grove B.Cs. as county constituencies and the re-naming of the Nantwich C.C. as Winsford.We were not prepared to disturb the growing Runcorn C.C., which contained the new town of Runcorn,as suggested by the assistant Commissioner in order to meet the problems of the Wirral. Nor were we disposed to leave Wirral C.C. unchanged with over 81,000 electors. We decided to adhere to our provisional recomjmendations for this area. In the north-east we decided to publish revised recommendations, as suggestedby the assistant Commissioner, for the retention of Congleton M.B. in Macclesfield C.C. and for the transferof Alderley Edge U.D. to the same constituency. However, since we proposed no change in Runcorn C.C.the transfer of Lymm U.D. to Knutsford C.C. did not seem to arise. Our revised recommendations gaveKnutsford C.C. a low electorate (43,507) but there was evidence that the northern parishes in the constituencywould grow and there were cogent arguments for maintaining the status quo as regards Congleton and forrespecting strong local wishes about Alderley Edge. We saw no reason to change the name of Nantwich C.C;but we agreed that &quot;Port&quot; should be added to &quot;Ellesmere&quot; in the name of the proposed Ellesmere and Bebingfton B.C.

Some urged the transfer of Lymm U.D.Lri Runcorn C.C. to Knutsford C.C. as recommended by the assistant Commissioner and our attentiontas invited to a proposed merger of Lymm U.D. and Bucklow R.D., the latter already being within the Knuts-[ord C.C. Disappointment was expressed at our decision to leave the provisional recommendations forijoundaries in the north-west unaltered; we were also asked to consider the restoration of county constituencystatus to the proposed Wirral B.C. There were representations that the proposed Ellesmere Port and Bebing-ton B.C. should be called Bebington and Ellesmere Port B.C. There was a suggestion that Nantwich C.C.should be called Nantwich and Winsford C.C.We were prepared to publish modified proposals for the inclusion of Lymm in Knutsford C.C. once thelocal government change had taken place, but we were subsequently advised that the proposed amalgamationus not being pursued. We decided it would be undesirable for us in these circumstances to recommend thetransfer of Lymm U.D. to Knutsford C.C. A small boundary change was, however, needed to cover thetransfer of a part of the parish of Little Stanney, with 14 electors, from Chester R.D. (City of Chester C.C.)to Ellesmere Port M.B. (proposed Ellesmere Port and Bebington B.C.). Apart from this we proposed nosrther modifications to the boundaries we had recommended. We agreed to propose the designation of theWirral B.C. as a county constituency and the re-naming of Ellesmere Port and Bebington B.C. as Bebingtonmd Ellesmere Port B.C. We were not disposed to adopt the suggested addition to the name of the NantwichC.C. Modified recommendations were published to give effect to these changes. No further representationsitre received.IVe recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations, as subsequently modified, as follows:  1965 ElectorateCity of Chester C.C........ 60,161Crewe C.C.......... 52,676Knutsford C.C......... 43,507Macclesfield C.C......... 66,479Nantwich C.C.......... 46,669Northwich C.C......... 44,324Runcorn C.C.        . .      .      .      .      .      . 53,774Stalybridge and Hyde C.C....... 55,788Wirral C.C........... 76,131Altrincham and Sale B.C..      .      .      .      .      .      . 66,427Bebington and Ellesmere Port B.C.   .      .      .      .      . 67,721Birkenhead B.C......... 67,650Cheadle B.C.......... 53,791Hazel Grove B.C......... 54,024Stockport North B.C........ 51,643Stockport South B.C........ 45,743Wallasey B.C......... 69,952CORNWALLThe 1965 electorate (247,551) entitled the county to four seats compared with the existing five. Theread been little increase of electorate since 1954 and rapid growth did not appear likely. All the existingJnstituencies had electorates below the electoral quota, the highest being the Truro C.C. with 57,851 electors,these circumstances, and bearing in mind the limit on the number of English seats, we proposed that the unity should be divided into four county constituencies with reasonably equal electorates. Our provisionalMrnmendations were:  1965 ElectorateBodminCC.......... 61,402Fahnouth and Truro C.C.       .      .      .      .      .      . 66,260Launceston C.C......... 56,425St. Ives and Camborne C.C....... 63,464There were many objections to the proposed reduction in representation and a local inquiry was held..^ assistant Commissioner considered that the county had a very strong claim on geographical grounds^retaining its representation of five seats and that if possible the area of Fowey, which had been united with11 Austell in one municipal borough, should be transferred from the existing Bodmin C.C. to the Truro C.C.kquestion of transferring the parishes of Hayle and Gwinear-Gwithian in the West Penwith R.D. fromttFalmouth and Camborne C.C. to the St. Ives C.C. was also considered at the local inquiry.We deferred consideration of the assistant Commissioners advice until we were in a position to reviewclaims for additional representation. We then accepted the assistant Commissioners advice that ongraphical grounds Cornwall should retain five seats; that Fowey should be transferred from Bodmin C.C,
to Truro C.C. and that the area transferred to Cornwall from Devon by the Cornwall and Devon (Broadwbod-widger) Order 1965 should be included in the North Cornwall constituency.

All the existing constituencies had electorates below the electoral quota of 58,759; the largest, thePenrith and The Border C.C., had only 50,948 electors. The electorate had shown little growth since 1954.In these circumstances and in view of the limit on the total number of English seats our provisional recom-mendations divided the county laterally into three county constituencies, absorbing Carlisle C.B. in a newnorthern constituency. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateCarlisle and The Border C.C.......    68,449Mid-Cumberland C.C........    60,978Workington and Whitehaven C.C.    . .      .      .    67,015Many objections were made to the proposed reduction of the county&apos;s representation and a local inquirywas held. The assistant Commissioner concluded that the balance of advantage lay in leaving the existingfour constituencies unaltered. He considered that the Rules required the retention of Carlisle C.B. as aseparate constituency. He endorsed representations that the proposed Mid-Cumberland C.C. would be unsatisfactory.As in the case of Cornwall, we deferred consideration of the assistant Commissioners recommendationsuntil we were in a position to review all the claims for additional representation. We then decided to accept this advice and published revised recommendations for the purpose of retaining the existing four constituencieswithout change, as follows: 1965 ElectoratePenrith and The Border C.C.......    50,948Whitehaven C.C.    . ......    47,093Workington C.C......      .      .      .    49,298Carlisle B.C. ........49,103No representations were received against these.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.DERBYSHIREThe 1965 electorate (590,707) entitled the county to no more than its existing ten seats. We consideredthat the boundaries of North East Derbyshire C.C. and South East Derbyshire C.C. should be brought into line with the altered local government boundaries. This would reduce the electorate of North East DerbyshireC.C. to a reasonable size but it would still leave disparities in electorates elsewhere in the county, notably inBelper C.C. and South East Derbyshire C.C. However, we proposed no other changes as we were aware of proposals for an extension of Derby C.B. which, if they were eventually approved by Parliament, might make it necessary for us to publish revised proposals. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateBelper C.C...... -      - 16&apos;425Bolsover C.C.        .      .      .,..... 49&apos;856High Peak C.C......... 48*921Ilkeston C.C.......... 69&apos;30^North East Derbyshire C.C.    .      .      . &apos;    .      -      - 56,497South East Derbyshire C.C....... 72,076West Derbyshire C.C........ 44.604Chesterfield B.C......... 67*244Derby North B.C......... 53&apos;702Derby South B.C...... - 52&apos;077Representations were made that we should defer consideration of our proposals until decisions hadtaken about the extension of the county borough of Derby. We adopted that suggestion and, following
making of The Derby Order 1968, we published revised recommendations for the four constituencies affectedus follows:-1965 ElectorateBelper C.C..........    60,898South East Derbyshire C.C.......   46,968Derby North West B.C. ......    74,078Derby South East B.C........    72,336Representations were made about the disparity between the electorate of the South East Derbyshire C.C.on the one hand and that of the Derby North West and Derby South East B.Cs. on the other. It was also suggested that confusion would arise because of the similarity of the names South East Derbyshire and DerbySouth East. A local inquiry was held and the assistant Commissioner reported that the alternative proposals put to him involved the transfer of wards from the borough to the South East Derbyshire C.C., but he didnot consider that the disparity of electorates was great enough to justify the association of part of the countyborough with the adjoining county area. He did consider, however, that the co-existence of a DerbySouth East B.C. and a South East Derbyshire C.C. would be confusing, and he recommended that thecounty constituency and the two borough constituencies should retain their existing names.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice and published modified recommendations naming thetwo proposed constituencies in the county borough as Derby North and Derby South.Representations were again made about the disparity between the borough constituency electorates andthe South East Derbyshire electorate. This matter had already been fully considered at the inquiry and we decided that a further inquiry was not justified.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, as amended by our revised and modifiedrecommendations, as follows: 1965 ElectorateBelper C.C.......... 60,898Bolsover C.C.        .   -....... 49&apos;8;*High Peak C.C......... ^8,921Ilkeston C.C.........- &quot;9,305North East Derbyshire C.C....... 56-4J7South East Derbyshire C.C....... 46-968West Derbyshire C.C........ 44.604Chesterfield B.C......... 67,244Derby North B.C......... 74-078Derby South B.C..... -DEVONThe 1965 electorate (587,111) entitled the county to no more than its existing ten seats. We had, however,to take account of several changes in local government boundaries in particular a major extension toPlymouth C.B. One possibility was to divide the enlarged county borough into two borough constituencies,each with some 78,000 electors, but we considered that such high electorates should be avoided. We therefore proposed the division of Plymouth into three borough constituencies containing an average of 52,000 electorseach. This left seven seats for the administrative county which at present has eight seats. The balance ofTavistock C.C., after the transfer of Plymstock and Plympton to a Plymouth borough constituency, was too small to stand as a separate constituency (only 30,640 electors) and we proposed its amalgamation with partsof the present Torrington C.C. This led us to recommend the transfer of credit on U.D. and R.D. fromTorrington C.C. to Tiverton C.C.; and the transfer of Bideford M.B. and R.D. and Northam U.D. fromTorrington C.C. to North Devon C.C. We also proposed some consequential changes elsewhere to bringconstituency boundaries into line with altered local government boundaries, notably in Exeter and Torbay.We recommended that the name of Torquay B.C. should be changed to Torbay B.C. Our provisional\ recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateHoniton C.C. ...             ..... 59,265North Devon C.C......... 61,116Tiverton C.C.......- ?W?o;ttccc ------ : : ZllTotnes C.C.....-      -      - &apos;   ,Exeter B.C.......... 61,153Plymouth Central B.C........ f/1&apos;Plymouth, Devonport B.C. ^,348Plymouth East B.C. yTorbay B.C.   .      .      ;
We received several representations about our provisional recommendations. The assistant Commissionerwho held a local inquiry reported as follows: PlymouthHe considered our proposals for Plymouth, which were based on traditional bonds and natural boundaries,preferable to alternative proposals considered at the inquiry. He suggested, however, that the proposedPlymouth Central B.C. and Plymouth East B.C. should be renamed Plymouth, Drake B.C. and Plymouth,Sutton B.C. respectively.The County ConstituenciesAn alternative scheme involving the disruption of the Totnes C.C. was considered at the inquiry but the assistant Commissioner recommended that, notwithstanding certain unsatisfactory features of the proposedTorrington C.C., our provisional recommendations were the most satisfactory method of dealing with theproblem created by the need to eliminate one county constituency. He suggested, however, that the proposedTorrington C.C. should be called West Devon or, alternatively, Okehampton C.C.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice about the naming of the constituencies, preferring thename West Devon in the case of the Torrington C.C., and we published revised recommendations accordingly :-1965 ElectorateHonitonCC......                          - 59,265North Devon C.C........ 61,116Tiverton C.C......... 58,227Totnes C.C.......... 68&apos;259West Devon C.C......... 48.986Exeter B.C.......... 61,153Plymouth, Devonport B.C....... 56,348Plymouth, Drake B.C........ 48,327Plymouth, Sutton B.C........ 51,619TorbayB.C.....                                 - 73&apos;811Representations were again made about the proposed boundaries and names, but we decided that as thematters raised had already been considered at the local inquiry, no further local inquiry was justified.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.DORSETThe 1965 electorate (224,351) justified the continued representation of this county by four seats. As theelectorates of the existing constituencies were of reasonable size and within the range we thought desirable,we saw no reason to propose changes. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateNorth Dorset C.C.........51,137South Dorset C.C.........    60,476West Dorset C.C.........   45,346Poole B.C..........   67,392We received alternative proposals designed to reduce the disparity in the size of the electorates in the threecounty constituencies and a local inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner found our provisional recommendations preferable to the alternatives which would not only disturb the existing ties of SturminsterR.D. and Wareham and Purbeck R.D. but would also make West Dorset C.C. undesirably large in area.We accepted his advice.Later it became necessary to publish revised recommendations for minor changes in the North and WestDorset CCs. to take account of alterations in the county boundary between Devon, Somerset and Dorset,involving 72 electors, under the South Western Counties Order 1965. The revised 1965 electorate for thecounty was 224,423. Our revised recommendations for the constituencies affected were:-1965 ElectorateNorth Dorset C.C.........51 137West Dorset C.C.......&apos;      &apos;   45^418No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as revised, as follows:-1965 ElectorateNorth Dorset C.C.........51,137South Dorset C.C........ 60476West Dorset C.C.   ........   45^418Poolc B.C.     .      .      &quot;,:.-.(,,.*      .      .      .      , 67,392
DURHAMThe 1965 electorate (930,849) entitled the county excluding the parts transferred to the new county bor-ough of Teesside to no more than sixteen seats. We considered that we should propose as little disturbanceas possible to constituency boundaries in the north of the county, especially on Tyneside, in advance of any changes resulting from the Royal Commission^ review of local government in England. It was, however,necessary for us to take into account the extension of Sunderland C.B. which we proposed should be dividedinto two borough constituencies. The electorates of these constituencies would exceed the electoral quotabut not only was Sunderland&apos;s electorate too small to justify three seats but we could not spare an additional&apos;seat for Sunderland within Durham&apos;s total entitlement. As a consequence of the changes recommended forSunderland we proposed a substantial revision of Houghton-le-Spring C.C. by adding to it parts of the exist-jig Durham and Easington CCs. In the south we took into account the creation of the Teesside C.B. we proposed that the part of Sedgefield C.C. which lies outside Teesside should be divided between the proposedBishop Auckland, Durham and Easington CCs. and that the Spennymoor U.D. and the parish of Brancepethshould be transferred from Durham C.C. to North West Durham C.C. In Hartlepool we proposed that the constituency boundary should conform with the new county borough boundary. We also recommendedthat the Blaydon and Consett constituencies should be designated as borough constituencies in keeping with our recommendations for similar constituencies elsewhere in England.

Although there were objections to the transfer of the six:orthem parishes of the Easington R.D. from Easington CC. to Houghton-le-Spring C.C., he consideredjat the proposed Houghton-le-Spring CC. would be a compact and workable constituency and that theInclusion of all six parishes would in effect join together in one constituency areas which were all miningimmunities. While the proposed Easington CC. comprising Stockton R.D. and the remainder of EasingtonID. would be long and narrow there was no evidence to suggest that it would be unduly difficult to manage,tte assistant Commissioner considered that an alternative proposal for a Durham CC. comprising DurhamM.B., Durham R.D., Brandon and Byshottles U.D. and Spennymoor U.D. (electorate 62,806) had meritl&apos;hen considered in isolation but it did not allow for changes which had to be made elsewhere and, in particu-h would leave North West Durham CC. with only 34,945 electors. He also considered that the proposed:fehop Auckland CC. would not be unmanageable in spite of its large area. Accordingly he consideredfat the provisional recommendations were preferable to the alternative proposals considered at the inquiryM he recommended no alteration of the boundaries we had proposed.fortlepoolHe recommended that The Hartlepools B.C. should be named Hartlepool B.C. to agree with the name ofknew county borough.pmsettWe had recommended that the Consett constituency should be designated a borough constituency, but* assistant Commissioner pointed out that there had been no material change over the last fifteen years&quot;we mainly rural character of the constituency.
We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice and published revised proposals designating Consetta county constituency and substituting the name Hartlepool B.C. Representations were again made aboutthe proposal to eliminate the Sedgefield C.C., but we did not think that a further local inquiry would be justified as the matter had already been considered at the earlier inquiry.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, as amended by the minor changes inrespect of Hartlepool and Consett.ESSEXThe 1965 electorate (804,992) justified fourteen seats. There were ten seats in the county together with the major parts of the Chigwell and Epping CCs. which had been divided by the Greater London boundary.In the east, the South East Essex C.C. had an electorate of 82,362 and the Chelmsford C.C. had an electorateof 72,357.In the west, the Billericay C.C. containing the new town of Basildon had an electorate of 100,010; theEpping C.C. had an electorate of 96,594, a small part being within Greater London. Our provisional recom-mendations provided for two additional seats, one in the&apos; east and the other in the west.In the east our proposals sprang from the need to divide the South East Essex C.C. We proposed thatRochford R.D. should be removed from the constituency and placed with Maldon M.B. and R.D. andBumham-on-Crouch U.D. in a new Maldon C.C. The balance of the existing Maldon C.C. Braintree andBooking U.D., Witham U.D. and Braintree R.D. was then put with the northern parishes of ChelmsfordR.D. in a new Braintree C.C. This reduced the electorate of the Chelmsford C.C. In the west the nub of our recommendations was the division of Billericay C.C. by the creation of a new Basildon B.C. comprising the whole of Basildon U.D. (65,506 electors). Brentwood U.D., which comprised the rest of the presentBillericay C.C., was joined with a number of parishes of the Epping and Ongar R.D. to form a BrentwoodC.C. The Epping C.C., less the part within Greater London, was divided into two new constituencies-Epping and Chigwell C.C. and Harlow C.C. We considered that the lower electorate of the proposed HarlowC.C. would allow for expected growth. Our provisional recommendations left the Thurrock C.C. unchangedwith an electorate of 72,550 but the constituency consisted of an entire urban district. It was clearly not large enough for two seats and in the light of the Rules we were not disposed to transfer any part of it to anotherconstituency. We proposed no changes in the Colchester and Harwich CCs., or in the two Southend B.Cs.Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateBraintree C.C.........   45,866Brentwood C.C.Chelmsford C.C.    .Colchester C.C.Epping and Chigwell C.C.Harlow C.C. .Harwich C.C.Maldon C.C. .Saffron Walden C.C.South East Essex C.C.Thurrock C.C.Basildon B.C.Southend East B.C.Southend West B.C.48,08161,94263,76054,24646,16868,99649,27450,64257,19372,55065,50655,91064,858We received many representations about the proposed boundaries. We held two local inquiries: one&apos;dealt with the proposed Braintree, Chelmsford, Maldon and South East Essex constituencies and the otherwith the proposed Basildon, Brentwood, Epping and Chigwell, and Harlow constituencies.Braintree, Chelmsford, Maldon and South East EssexThe assistant Commissioner who conducted the first inquiry found that the exclusion of the northernparishes of Chelmsford R.D. from the Chelmsford C.C. would break local ties and they would no longer be&apos;able to look to Chelmsford as a constituency centre. Local ties and geographical considerations also militatedagainst the inclusion of Rochford R.D. in the proposed Maldon C.C. No alternative proposals were canvassedat the inquiry but the assistant Commissioner considered that a scheme suggested by the Rayleigh U.D.:Council which was received after the inquiry might contain the basis of a useful alternative. We arranged forthe inquiry to be re-opened so that alternatives to our provisional recommendations could be examined.The assistant Commissioner found, however, that our provisional recommendations were not only preferable to the Rayleigh U.D. Councils alternative proposals but also were more widely acceptable. There was, hesuggested, a possible variation of our recommendations which would transfer four parishes of ChelmsfordR.D. (5,916 electors) from Chelmsford C.C. to Maldon C.C. but its only advantage would be an improve-;ment in the figures.We accepted the assistant Commissioner^ findings and decided to adhere to our provisional recom-mendations for central and east Essex.1Basildon, Brentwood, Epping and Chigwell, and HarlowThe assistant Commissioner who held the other inquiry found no justification for a proposal to divide
Basildon U.D. He also supported our recommendation that the twenty Ongar parishes in the Epping andOngar R.D. should be associated with Brentwood U.D. in the Brentwood constituency but suggested thatit be re-named Brentwood and Ongar. He considered there were objections to our proposal for afurther division of Epping and Ongar R.D. between the Epping and Chigwell and the Harlow constituencies.Although the arguments were finely balanced, he suggested that Harlow with an electorate of 36,481 should form a separate constituency. He also suggested that Epping and Chigwell C.C. should be called EppingForest.We did not feel able to recommend the creation of a Harlow constituency with so low an electorate and we decided to adopt our provisional recommendations subject to the re-naming of constituencies suggested bythe assistant Commissioner. We also decided to propose that in keeping with our recommendations elsewhere the Thurrock C.C. should be designated as a borough constituency. Our revised recommendations were published accordingly.We received several representations against our decision to leave unchanged the provisionally recommendedboundaries for the Harlow and Epping Forest CCs. It was urged that, even if we were not disposed to letHarlow stand on its own as a constituency as recommended by the assistant Commissioner, the parish ofEpping Upland (554 electors) should be transferred from Harlow to Epping Forest in view of its close tieswith Epping. This would reduce Harlow CCs electorate to 45,614 and increase Epping Foresfs to 54,800.We also received an objection to the inclusion of Rochford R.D. in the Maldon C.C.We did not consider that the electorate of Harlow U.D. had yet reached a size for it to stand on its own asa constituency. We were, however, impressed by the strength of the representations concerning the parish ofEpping Upland and we published modified proposals for its transfer from Harlow to Epping Forest C.C.We saw no reason to disturb our recommendations for the Maldon C.C.Representations against our modified proposals were again made on the ground that Harlow should standon its own as a constituency but we did not consider that there was any reason to change our view that itwas too small to form a separate constituency.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as subsequently modified, as follows: 1965 ElectorateBraintree C.C.       .....             . 45,866Brentwood and Ongar C.C......- 48,081Chelmsford CC......... 61,942Colchester CC......... 63,760Epping Forest CC........ 54,800Harlow CC.......... 45,614Harwich CC......... 68,996Maldon CC.......... 49,274Saffron Walden CC........ 50,642South East Essex CC........ 57,193Basildon B.C......... 65,506Southend East B.C........ 55,910Southend West B.C........ 64,858Thurrock B.C......... 72,550GLOUCESTERSHIREThe 1965 electorate (694,442) entitled the county to no more than its existing twelve seats. Some changes inconstituency boundaries were necessary following alterations to local government boundaries but we also considered that we should try to overcome the disparities in the electorates in Bristol, particularly the lowelectorate in Bristol Central B.C. (39,547) which continued to decline. A reduction of South GloucestershireCCs electorate (72,027) was also desirable. We therefore proposed the creation of a new county consti-tuency of Kingswood consisting of Kingswood U.D. and Mangotsfield U.D. (both of which are at presentincluded in Bristol constituencies) and Warmley R.D. (at present included in the South GloucestershireC.C.). This enabled us to comply with Rule 4 and divide Bristol CB. into five borough constituencies withelectorates reasonably close to the quota and without the inclusion of any surrounding county districts, as isnecessary with the existing six borough constituencies. We proposed no change in the Cheltenham B.C. Our! provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateCirencester and Tewkesbury CC.     ..... 63,516Kingswood CC......... 50,101South Gloucestershire CC....... 57,118Stroud CC.......... 58,432West Gloucestershire CC......      - 57,270Bristol North East B.C........ 56,850Bristol North West B.C........ 59,147Bristol South B.C.         ....... 57,510Bristol South East B.C........ 64,068Bristol West B.C......... 59,548Cheltenham B.C......... 54,967Gloucester B.C......... 55,915
There were representations about our recommendations, including an objection to our proposals forboundaries within Bristol C.B. The assistant Commissioner who held a local inquiry did not consider thatobjections which had been made to the inclusion of the parish of Brockworth in the West GloucestershireCC. were strong enough to justify any change in our recommendations. As regards Bristol, he did not con-sider that a sufficient case had been made out for the transfer of the Hengrove ward from the Bristol SouthB.C. to the Bristol South East B.C. in exchange for Windmill Hill and Knowle Wards: such a transfer wouldhave involved a departure from existing boundaries.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.HAMPSHIREThe 1965 electorate (940,604) entitled the county to sixteen seats compared with the existing fourteen. we considered that the existing Portsmouth, Langstone B.C. (94,859 electors) and the growing Gosport andFareham B.C. (84,193 electors) could not be left unchanged. Havant and Waterloo U.D., if removed fromthe Portsmouth, Langstone B.C., made a seat of reasonable size (55,291) and we decided to recommend this.Portsmouth C.B. (141,842) made two rather large constituencies but the available information suggested thatthe decline in the borough&apos;s electorate might continue. A division into three constituencies would thereforeonly be possible if Gosport could be associated with part of Portsmouth in a new constituency but thenatural barrier of Portsmouth Harbour seemed to preclude this. On the other hand, Gosport M.B. could not continue to be combined in a constituency with Fareham U.D. in view of the size of the electorate of the constituency and of the substantial growth of electorate expected in Fareham. In these difficult circumstances,and having regard to the Rules relating to local authority boundaries, we proposed two seats in Portsmouthand one seat each in Fareham and Gosport. We considered that the disparities in their electorates wouldprobably lessen as the electorates of Gosport and especially Fareham grew.In the south-west we took account of the growth of electorate in the Eastleigh, New Forest, BournemouthEast and Christchurch, and Bournemouth West constituencies: two of these constituencies already exceeded70,000 electors and further substantial growth was expected. We suggested an additional seat in this area by dividing the existing New Forest CC. and creating a Christchurch CC. and a Lymington CC. we considered that the borough constituencies in Southampton C.B. should be left unchanged; admittedly theywould have above-average electorates but the electorate, slightly less than that of Portsmouth, was in-sufficient to divide into three.Substantial growth of electorate was also expected in the north; the electorates of the existing Aldershotand Basingstoke CCs. were already high but that of Winchester was below-average. We therefore felt that,allowing for expected growth, we should aim to reduce the disparities between these three constituencies.Petersfield CC was of average size (59,079 electors) and we saw no cause to disturb it. Our provisional recommendations were:  	1965 ElectorateAldershot CC......	.    55,989Basingstoke CC.    ....	.    62,108Christchurch CC.....	.    58,895Eastleigh CC......	.    57,021Lymington CC.     ....	.   47,214Petersfield CC.....	.    59,079Winchester CC.....	.    65,042Bournemouth East B.C.   .	.    56,352Bournemouth West B.C. .	.    58,090Fareham B.C.        ....	.   43,273Gosport B.C.         ....	.    40,920Havant and Waterloo B.C.	.    55,291Portsmouth North B.C.   .	72,288Portsmouth South B.C.   .	.    69,554Southampton, Itchen B.C.	.    73,129Southampton, Test B.C.  .	-.    66,359Numerous representations were made, including some for a third additional seat on the grounds of the increasing electorate in northern Hampshire. The assistant Commissioner who held a local inquiry reported as follows:  Portsmouth, Gosport and FarehamHe recognised the &quot;insuperable barrier&quot; of Portsmouth Harbour, and saw no alternative to the proposeddivision of Gosport and Fareham. As Portsmouth&apos;s electorate was not likely to increase he did not recom-mend a third seat for the borough, nor did he support a proposal to put the Farlington ward of Portsmouthinto the proposed Havant and Waterloo B.C.The New ForestHe favoured alternative proposals for retaining the New Forest R.D. and the Ringwood and FordingbridgeR.D. in a New Forest CC. since, unlike our provisional recommendations, they did not divide the New
Forest community. He therefore recommended that the boroughs of Christchurch and Lymington, with tlieaddition of the parish of Christchurch East in the Ringwood and Fordingbridge R.D., should form a newconstituency.BournemouthSome local importance was attached to the seafront of Bournemouth being divided equally.between the borough&apos;s two constituencies. The assistant Commissioner recommended a scheme to achieve this whilstslill keeping balanced electorates.SouthamptonThe assistant Commissioner considered that no action should be taken on a suggested adjustment of the boundary between Southampton, Test B.C. and Eastleigh C.C. to take account of an agreed transfer of land to Southampton until an alteration of the local government boundary had been made.Northern HampshireThe assistant Commissioner considered that it would be premature to form an additional constituencybased on Andover in north-west Hampshire until expected population increases had taken place. He alsoadvised against transferring Fair Oak parish from Winchester C.C. to Eastleigh C.C. before any alterationof local government boundaries. Accordingly, he suggested no change in our provisional recommendations for the Basingstokc, Winchester and Eastleigh CCs. other than an adjustment of the boundary between theBasingstoke and Aldershot CCs. where he considered that, because of local ties, Yateley parish should beleft in Aldershot C.C. instead of being transferred to Basingstoke CC. as we had recommended. He did not support a representation that Eastleigh should be designated as a borough constituency.We accepted all the assistant Commissioners recommendations except for his suggestion that the parishof Christchurch East should be included in the proposed Christchurch and Lymington B.C. In this instance\te did not consider that we could accept his recommendation to separate this parish from the other parishesin Ringwood and Fordingbridge R.D. and to combine it in a constituency with areas with which it had notbeen previously associated, especially in face of the strong opposition of the Rural District Council, and thefact that the assistant Commissioner had not recommended it in respect of a similar suggestion which hadbeen made in respect of the parish of Sway. Moreover, the electorate of Christchurch and Lymington B.C.without Christchurch East would be higher than some of the other proposed constituencies in the county.All his other recommendations we adopted in revised recommendations published as follows:  1965 ElectorateAldershot CC.      .      .             ..... 60,376Basingstoke CC......... 57,721Eastleigh CC.......... 57,021New Forest CC......... 62,173Petersfield CC......... 59,079Winchester CC......... 65,042Bournemouth East B.C........ 56,119Bournemouth West B.C........ 58,323Christchurch and Lymington B.C..... 43,936Fareham B.C......... 43,273Gosport B.C......... 40,920Havant and Waterloo B.C....... 55,291Portsmouth North B.C........ 72,288Portsmouth South B.C........ 69,554Southampton, Itchen B.C....... 73,129Southampton, Test B.C........ 66,359We received a number of representations about our revised recommendations. These showed a markeddivision of opinion in Bournemouth, where there was equal support for the provisional recommendations and for the revised recommendations. There was also a suggestion that the parishes of Hum, Sopley andChristchurch East (Ringwood and Fordingbridge R.D.) and the parish of Sway (New Forest R.D.) shouldbe transferred from the New Forest CC. to the proposed Christchurch and Lymington B.C. The AndoverBorough Council considered there should be no change in parliamentary boundaries until the intentions ofike Government with regard to local government reorganisation were made known. It was also suggestedthat Petersfield C.C..(59,079 electors) was too extensive.The arguments in, Bournemouth were finely balanced and we decided to keep to our revised recom-mendations. The suggested transfer of four parishes to the Christchurch and Lymington B.C. was contrary tothe Rules governing local authority boundaries and would no doubt be opposed by the rural district councilsconcerned. The Andover Borough CounciPs suggestion was Impracticable in view of our statutory obligation[ocomplete a general review by November 1969. As for Petersfield C.C., it was not exceptionally large either11 acreage or in electorate. We therefore decided to make no change in the basis of our revised recommenda-tions,Later we published modified recommendations for the boundary between the Eastleigh and Southampton,Test constituencies to take account of a change in the local government boundary, involving 83 electors,
under the Hampshire and Southampton (Boundaries) Order 1967. This produced for the two proposed con-stituencies electorates of 56,938 and 66,442 respectively. A minor modification was also recommended to reflect the inclusion of two offshore forts within the boundaries of the City of Portsmouth, but this did not affect the City&apos;s electorates. There were no further representations.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations, modified as described in the preceding paragraph.HEREFORDSHIREThe 1965 electorate (89,776) justified about one and a half scats. Tt was too large for one constituencybut both the existing constituencies, which do not conform entirely with the present county boundary, werebelow the electoral quota Hereford CC. (50,756) and Leominster CC. (38,980). We considered various possibilities of achieving better-sized electorates. One was to combine Herefordshire with parts of neighbour-ing counties but this would not only offend the Rules regarding county boundaries but, in our view, would cause inconvenience and break local ties. We were also of. the opinion that an adjustment to provide twoconstituencies of about 45,000 electors each within the county would not only involve the transfer to Lcomin-ster CC. of areas at present in Hereford CC. which were likely to regard Hereford as their natural centrebut would also enlarge a constituency that was already large in area. We came to the conclusion that Leo-minster CC. should be left with less than 40,000 electors. Minor boundary changes were necessary, however,to bring both Hereford CC. and Leominster CC. into line with altered local government boundaries. our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateHereford CC.........    50,796Leominster CC.........    38,980We received alternative proposals designed to produce more equal electorates in the county and a local inquiry was held. The alternative proposals would transfer to Lcominster CC five parishes (1,224 electors)from Hereford CC. The assistant Commissioner reported however that the ties of these parishes were withHereford CC. He supported our proposals and we accepted his findings.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.HERTFORDSHIREAs a result largely of new town developments at Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Stevenage and WelwynGarden City, the 1965 electorate (546,463) entitled the county to nine seats compared with the existingseven. The electorate of Hitchin CC. was 89,745 while that of Hemel Hempstead CC. was 83,881. EastHertfordshire CC. and South West Hertfordshire CC. both had electorates in excess of 75,000. We proposedone additional seat in the east and another in the west.In the east we proposed that Stevenage U.D. should be taken from Hitchin CC. and joined with HertfordM.B., Ware U.D. and some parishes of Hertford R.D. and of Ware R.D. in a new Hertford and StevenageCC. Welwyn Garden City U.D., Hatfield R.D. and Welwyn R.D. with the six southern parishes of Hert-ford R.D. would form a Welwyn CC. this would have the desirable effect of putting the new towns ofWelwyn Garden City and Hatfield in one constituency. East Hertfordshire CC. would be reduced by thetransfer of Ware U.D. and five parishes of Ware R.D. to the proposed Hertford and Stevenage CC.In the west we proposed the creation of a South East Hertfordshire CC. comprising Potters Bar U.D.,Elstree R.D., the parish of Aldenham (Watford R.D.) and the three southern parishes of St. Albans R.D.-St. Stephen, London Colney and Colney Heath. South West Hertfordshire CC. would be reduced by the lossof the parish of Aldenham. Harpenden U.D. and the parishes of Harpenden Rural and Redbourn (St.Albans R.D.) would be transferred to St. Albans CC from Hemel Hempstead CC-this would reduceHemel Hempstead CCs electorate and leave that of St. Albans CC. reasonably near the electoral quota.We proposed no change for Watford B.C.Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateEast Hertfordshire CC........ 65,683Hemel Hempstead CC........ 67,014Hertford and Stevenage CC....... 59,264Hitchin CC.......... 59,159St. Albans CC......... 60,168South East Hertfordshire CC....... 55,317South West Hertfordshire CC...... 66,621Welwyn CC.......... 59,589Watford B.C.......... 53,648We received representations against the details of our proposals but not against the allocation of two additional seats. In the east alternative proposals were made to avoid the proposed division of the Hertfordand Ware R.Ds. In the west the proposed removal of Colney Heath and St. Stephen parishes from St. AlbansCC. was criticised. So too was the name of the proposed South East Hertfordshire CC. Two local inquirieswere held, one dealing with the east and the other with the west. The western inquiry also dealt winobjections in respect of Harrow East B.C. (see page 18).
last HertfordshireThe assistant Commissioner did not find in favour of the alternative proposals which would have separatedthe new towns of Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City, not only because they would break the links between these new towns, but also because they would have left East Hertfordshire C.C., where less electoral growthbis expected, with a below-average electorate. They would also have placed the growth areas of Hatfield,Stevenagc and Welwyn in constituencies with above-average electorates. He suggested, however, that weshould meet the wishes of the Councils of Hertford R.D. and Ware R.D. for the whole of their districts to&apos;he put within the proposed Hertford and Stevenage CC. and the East Hertfordshire CC. respectively. he did not support the proposal of the Potters Bar U.D. Council for an exchange of areas between the proposedSt. Albans, South East Hertfordshire and Welwyn CCs. He also suggested that there was a strong case foradding Hatfield to the name of the proposed Welwyn CC.We considered that the scheme suggested by the assistant Commissioner, which avoided the splitting ofniral districts, was preferable to our own provisional recommendations, especially in view of the probable(tends in the electorates. We were also prepared to accept his suggestion to add Hatfield to the name of theproposed Welwyn CC.Vest HertfordshireThe assistant Commissioner found a strong case for the retention in St. Albans CC. of three wards fromthe parishes of St. Stephen and Colney Heath. He did not think it would be advisable lo divide these parishes,(specially in advance of any alteration of local government boundaries. On the other hand, to transfer the(hole of the parishes, together with the London Colney parish which would otherwise be separated from allthe other parishes in St. Albans R.D., would produce a big disparity in electorates St. Albans CC. wouldlave 73,441 electors and South East Hertfordshire CC. 42,044. The assistant Commissioner accepted thatPotters Bar might have a good case for the extension of their boundaries into the southern parishes of HatfieldID. but such an alteration of local government boundaries should not be anticipated in dealing withconstituency boundaries. He suggested there were similar objections to the proposed adjustment of the boundary between Harrow East B.C. and South East Hertfordshire CC. He considered that we should adhere10 our provisional recommendations but recommended that the South East Hertfordshire CC. should bere-named South Hertfordshire.The alternatives facing us were either to keep to our provisional recommendations, subject to South EastHertfordshire CC. being re-named, or, in view of the evidence of the close association of large parts of the st, Stephen and Colney Heath parishes with St. Albans, to leave them and the London Colney parish in St.Albans CC. despite the disparity in the electorates that would result. We considered that this was an instancewhere numerical considerations should probably be given greater weight and in the light of the assistantCommissioners advice we decided that it would be preferable to leave the provisionally recommendedboundaries unchanged.We published revised recommendations as follows: 1965 ElectorateEast Hertfordshire CC........ 69,368Hemel Hempstead CC........ 67,014Hertford and Stcvenage CC....... 58,592Hitchin CC.......... 59,159St. Albans CC......... 60,168South Hertfordshire CC....... 55,317South West Hertfordshire CC...... 66,621Welwyn and Hatfield CC....... 56,576Watford B.C.......... 53,648No representations were received in respect of the revised recommendations for the east of the county butin the west there were objections from the residents of the Colney Heath parish and of the areas of ChiswellGreen, Park Street and Bricket Wood, all of which are located in St. Stephen parish, to their removal from st Albans CC.We considered these further representations. While we recognised that the three parishes of St. Stephen,London Colney and Colney Heath had strong links with the present St. Albans C.C., we were not disposed to create a new constituency of only 42,000 electors if this could be avoided. The disruption of local ties isPile price that sometimes has to be paid in areas where additional representation is proposed. We did notconsider that any of these three parishes could be singled out for separate treatment.Ife recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.HUNTINGDON AND PETERBOROUGHWith an electorate in 1965 of 106,649 the county of Huntingdon and Peterborough was entitled to two&quot;nstituencies. We decided that one should be based on the Huntingdonshire CC. with consequential&quot;ranges to conform with the altered county boundaries; and that Thorney R.D. (which had been transferredlrom the old county of the Isle of Ely) and the area of the old county of the Soke of Peterborough should*n a revised Peterborough B.C. Our provisional recommendations were: 
Huntingdonshire CC.....Peterborough B.C ......No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.1965 Electorate54,342.    52,307KENTThe 1965 electorate (868,891) justified fifteen seats compared with the existing thirteen. The electorate ofthe Isle of Thanet CC. was already over 80,000 and six other constituencies had electorates exceeding 70,000We considered that two additional seats should be allocated one in the east and the other in the west.In the east we considered that we could not leave the Isle of Thanet CC. unchanged, particularly in viewof the further development expected in the area, but it did not seem likely that any proposal to combine it with neighbouring areas would be generally acceptable. We provisionally decided to divide it into two con-stituencies with small electorates, one being below our lower limit of 40,000. We recognised that the electorateof Canterbury (70,486), a growing constituency, was left rather high but we felt that this constituency couldstand unchanged in the present review. We also proposed no change in the county constituencies of Dover,Faversham, and Folkestone and Hythe.In the west we proposed that Northfleet U.D. should be removed from Gravesend CC for the purpose of reducing the electorate of the constituency from 73,198 to 56,938. Northfleet was then included with DartfordM.B., Swanscombe U.D. and five northern parishes of Dartford R.D. in a Dartford CC. with a reducedelectorate. We proposed that the remaining parishes of Dartford R.D. should be joined with the urban and rural districts of Sevenoaks in a Sevenoaks CC. with a reduced electorate; and that Mailing R.D. should beremoved from Sevenoaks CC. and put with Tonbridge U.D. and the two northern parishes of TonbridgeR.D. in a new Tonbridge CC. The rest of Tonbridge R.D. with Royal Tunbridge Wells M.B., SouthboroughU.D. and Cranbrook R.D. would form a new Royal Tunbridge Wells CC. We recommended that MaidstoneM.B. and Maidstone R.D. should form one constituency in view of the growth of electorate. HollingbournR.D. could then be added to the Ashford CC. to offset the loss of Cranbrook R.D. We proposed no changein the borough constituencies of Gillingham, and Rochester and Chatham.Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateAshford CC..........    58,495Canterbury CC.Dartford CC.Dover CC.    .Faversham CC.Folkestone and Hythe CC.Gravesend CC.Maidstone CC.Royal Tunbridge Wells CC.Sevenoaks CC.Thanet East CC.Thanet West CC   .Tonbridge CC.Gillingham B.C.Rochester and Chatham B.C.70,48668,76665,49761,93054,31156,93857,95159,98461,14241,52138,72753,80051,19168,152While the need for additional representation in the east did not appear to be disputed there were objections jto the creation of the small constituencies in Thanet. In the west, the representations we received were mainly jabout the removal of Northfleet from Gravesend CC, the division of Dartford R.D. and the transfer ofHollingbourn R.D. to Ashford CC. We decided to hold two inquiries one in the east and the other in thewest.East KentThe assistant Commissioner found strong opposition to suggestions which were put forward for thetransfer of parts of Bridge-Blean R.D. from Canterbury CC to the proposed Thanet West C.C., but in his view there seemed to be no considerations, geographical or otherwise, to prevent the inclusion in this con-stituency of Sandwich M.B. and a further six parishes of Eastry R.D. to produce a Margate and SandwichCC. of 46 157 electors. Dover CC, which he suggested should be re-named Dover and Deal C.C., would thus be reduced to 58,067 electors. The assistant Commissioner did not suggest any reduction of Canterbury;CC; there was no evidence of discontent with the size of the present constituency or concern with the!probable disparity between its electorate and that of the Thanet constituencies. He suggested that the proposed!1 hanet East CC. be designated as a borough constituency.We decided to adopt the boundaries recommended by the assistant Commissioner as they would aa Thanet West constituency with less than 40,000 electors, but we considered his proposed Thanet east would be more appropriately called Ramsgate B.C.
West KentThe assistant Commissioner did not find that a sufficient case had been made on the grounds of incon-venience or of local ties to justify a departure from our provisional recommendations for the removal ofNorthfleet from the Gravesend CC. For reasons of local ties, however, he supported proposals for leaving the existing Maidstone CC. unchanged by restoring to it the Hollingbourn R.D. which we had suggested should be placed in Ashford CC. This would increase the electorate of the Maidstone CC. to 70,680 whilstreducing that of the Ashford CC. to 45,766. He advised that the other boundaries we had recommended infewest should stand but he found in favour of Mailing being incorporated in the name of Tonbridge CC.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice about the composition of constituencies. We weretonscious of the size and growth of the electorate of the existing Maidstone CC but as it was no bigger thanthat of the Canterbury CC. and there were strong local feelings against the removal of Hollingbourn R.D.,ieconsidered the existing constituency could be left unchanged. We did not think there were strong grounds for incorporating Mailing in the name of Tonbridge CC.We published revised recommendations as follows:-1965 ElectorateAshford CC.......... 45,766Canterbury CC......... 70,486Dartford CC......... 68,766Dover and Deal CC........ 58,067Faversham CC......... 61,930Folkestone and Hythe CC....... 54,311Gravesend CC......... 56,938Maidstone CC......... 70,680Margate and Sandwich CC.    ...... 46,157Royal Tunbridge Wells CC....... 59,984Sevenoaks CC......... 61,142Tonbridge CC......... 53,800Gillingham B.C.            .      .      .      .      .      .      . 51,191Ramsgate B.C......... 41,521Rochester and Chatham B.C....... 68,152There were numerous representations against our revised recommendations. Many were concerned withie proposed transfer of Sandwich M.B. and the further six parishes of Eastry R.D. from Dover CC. to theimposed Margate and Sandwich CC. There were also several representations about our decision to leavelie provisionally recommended boundaries for Dartford, Gravesend and Sevenoaks CCs. unchanged. Thesparation of Gravesend and Northfieet was again strongly opposed. There was a proposal that we shouldieturn, at least in part, to our provisional recommendations for the Ashford and Maidstone CCs. The claimsif Mailing for recognition in the name of the Tonbridge CC. were renewed. After considering these rep-ratations we concluded that it would be of advantage to give a further opportunity for the public consider-ilion of our revised recommendations and a further local inquiry was held.Ess/ Kent Further InquirySeveral possible alternatives for East Kent were discussed at the inquiry but it was the opinion of the assis-pt Commissioner that the River Stour constituted a barrier separating the Isle of Thanet from the rest ofSe county. He considered that the five northern parishes of the Eastry R.D., which had close ties with the:ban areas in the Isle of Thanet, should be associated with those areas for parliamentary purposes; that thescentral parishes, i.e. the parishes immediately south of the River Stour, should remain in the Dover andPal constituency rather than be placed in a Thanet constituency with which they would feel no affinity;althat the eleven southern parishes had ties with Dover and Deal which should not be broken. He recom-fiided that we should revert to our provisional recommendations and abandon the revised proposalsssed upon the findings of the original inquiry.Although our revised recommendations for East Kent had produced constituencies with electorates of.stter size than the provisional recommendations, we accepted the assistant Commissioner^ advice that theretre cogent reasons for returning to our original proposals and we decided to publish modified proposalsprdingly. We considered it would be logical to give these constituencies the names of Thanet East andHianet West. They had been designated county constituencies in our provisional recommendations but we-ffiidered it would be in keeping with our recommendations elsewhere to designate them as boroughWituencies in our modified proposals.Jot Kent Further InquiryThe assistant Commissioner reported that the major problem in West Kent was the separation of GravesendM Northfleet proposed in our provisional recommendations. He considered that these towns should be&quot;Wed in the same constituency if at all possible. He reviewed the possible alternatives:  i (i) simply to transfer Northfleet from the proposed Dartford constituency to the proposed Gravesendconstituency this would give Gravesend 73,198 electors and Dartford 52,506; or* (ii) to adopt an alternative scheme involving radical changes which would inter alia let Gravesend,Northfleet and Swanscombe form a separate borough constituency and place the Strood and MailingR.Ds. in a Medway constituency; or
(iii) to adopt a further alternative scheme which would inter alia make Dartford R.D. a constituencyon its own with 36,830 electors but would give Kent a third new seat instead of the two to which itwas entitled.On balance the assistant Commissioner recommended that we should adhere to our provisionally recommen-ded boundaries. He did not consider the large electorate of the Gravesend constituency produced by (j)could be accepted even though the case for keeping Gravesend and Northfieet together was very strong.There was evidence of opposition to (ii) and the allocation of an additional seat under (iii) was not justified.The assistant Commissioner recommended that the proposed Tonbridge constituency should be named Tonbridge and Mailing and that the Hollingbourn R.D. should remain in the Maidstone constituency.We considered that (ii) had definite attractions, not least in the creation of an urban constituency consistingof Gravesend, Northfieet and Swanscombe. Elsewhere, however, the consequences were less satisfactory;in particular the constituency comprising Sevenoaks R.D. and Tonbridge R.D. would be awkward in shape and would bring together areas which had little in common. It was our view that the choice must lie betweenwhat the assistant Commissioner had described as the two evils of either letting the provisional recommenda-tions stand, thereby severing the close ties between Gravesend and Northfleet or leaving Northfieet withGravesend and thereby creating a considerable disparity between the electorates of the Dartford and Graves-end constituencies. The assistant Commissioner had favoured the second of these alternatives if it could possibly be done within the directions of the Redistribution Acts but he had rejected it because of the size of the proposed Gravesend constituency (73,198 electors). We had proposed constituencies elsewhere with at least as many electors as Gravesend under this alternative and many of our proposed constituencieshad electorates below Dartford&apos;s (52,506). Moreover the provisions of the 1958 Act encouraged us to avoid the severance of local ties even if this led to a departure from the normal rule for the size of constituencyelectorates. We concluded that it would be better to re-unite Northfieet and Gravesend in spite of the dis-parities in electorates and even though this would be contrary to the advice of both assistant Commissioners.We also accepted the assistant Commissioners recommendations that the Hollingbourn R.D. should remainin the proposed Maidstone constituency and that the Tonbridge constituency should be named Tonbridgeand Mailing CC.Modified recommendations were published to give effect to the variations proposed in certain constituencies-cies as follows:  Dartford CCDover CC    .Gravesend CC.Tonbridge and Mailing CC.Thanet East B.C.    .Thanet West B.C.   .1965 Electorate. 52,506. 65,497. 73,198. 53,800. 41,521. 38,727Representations were again made against our modified proposals for constituency boundaries but we saw no justification for making any further changes in boundaries. A representation was also made that the nameof the Dover CC. should be changed to Dover and Deal CC. and we accepted this suggestion. Further pro-posals were published for this purpose and also to take account of a minor local government boundarychange made by the County of Kent (Mailing and Strood Rural Districts) Confirmation Order 1968 affectingthe proposed constituency boundary between Gravesend CC. and Tonbridge and Mailing CC No electorswere involved in this change. No representations were received against these further proposals.Finally, we published a further amendment to our proposals to take account of the transfer of the Knock-holt area to Kent on 1st April 1969 under the Greater London, Kent and Surrey Order 1968. This involved886 electors, and increased the electorate of the proposed Sevenoaks CC. to 62,028, and of the County ofKent to 869,777. No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations, as modified, as follows:  1965 ElectorateAshford CC......... 45,766Canterbury CC......... 70,486Dartford CC......... 52,506Dover and Deal CC.      .      .      .      .      .      .      . 65,497FavershamCC.......      -      - 61,930Folkestone and Hythe CC....... 54,311Gravesend CC......... 73,198Maidstone CC......... 70,680Royal Tunbridge Wells CC....... 59,984Sevenoaks CC......... 62,028Tonbridge and Mailing CC....... 53,800Gillingham B.C......... 51,191Rochester and Chatham B.C....... 68,152Thanet East B.C......... 41,521Thanet West B.C......      .      .      - 38,727
LANCASHIREThe 1965 electorate (3,453,779) entitled the county to fifty-nine seats compared with the existing sixty-two.Liverpool and Manchester each had nine seats but they were entitled to no more than eight. The county&apos;selectorate had decreased by 101,496 since 1954 and in the Liverpool and Manchester constituencies by 64,792and 67,499 respectively. We proposed that Liverpool and Manchester should each be re-divided into eightseats. Our proposals envisaged the elimination of the Liverpool, Scotland B.C. (41,180 electors) and in Man-chester the amalgamation of the constituencies of Cheetham (36,794 electors) and Exchange (32,244 electors)We considered that the existing Huyton CC. (87,379 electors) could not be left unchanged and our provision-al recommendations reduced the size of its electorate by transferring Kirkby U.D. to Ormskirk CC. Thecompensating adjustments which we proposed involved the transfer of areas from the existing Ormskirk CC.to the Crosby and Ince constituencies, and the addition of Litherland U.D. to Bootle B.C. where the electoratehad declined in recent years. We also proposed that Crosby B.C. should become a county constituencysince in our proposals it was extended to include some 16,000 electors living in a rural district. In the remain-parts of Lancashire, all the constituencies fell within the proposed upper and lower limits-Newton CC.was the largest (74,035 electors) and Lancaster CC. the smallest (44,142 electors). We felt that it would be. desirable to embark upon the far-reaching redistribution that would be necessary to achieve a reductionof one further seat in advance of any changes in local government boundaries. Nevertheless we suggested thatFarnworth, Heywood and Royton, and Middleton and Prestwich CCs. should be designated boroughconstituencies since they were composed wholly of urban authorities. Our provisional recommendations forsixty seats were as follows: ChorleyCC. .Clitheroe CC.Crosby CC. .Darwen CC. .Huyton CC. .Lancaster CC.Morecambe and Lonsdale CC.Newton CC.

There were also representa-tions about the details of our Manchester scheme and about the proposed designation of the Heywood andRoyton CC. and the Middleton and Prestwich CC. as borough constituencies. We held two inquiries-one into the provisional recommendations for Liverpool and south-west Lancashire, the other into Manches-ter and the proposed designations as borough constituencies.Liverpool and South-West LancashireThe assistant Commissioner who reported on Liverpool and south-west Lancashire recognised that therewere considerable objections to the inclusion of Kirkby U.D. in the hitherto predominantly agricultural:Ormskirk CC, but he could not advise in favour of either of the two major alternative proposals canvassedat the inquiry. One, which would create a new constituency from the Kirkby and Rainford U.Ds., the parishof Simonswood in the West Lancashire R.D. and the parishes of Eccleston, Knowsley and Windle in WhistonR.D, would produce an additional seat in a county already over-represented by one seat in the provisional:recommendations. The other, which would put Kirkby in a constituency with wards of Liverpool, was strong-ly opposed at the inquiry on the grounds that Kirkby&apos;s identity should not be lost in an association withLiverpool. The assistant Commissioner therefore supported our scheme on the ground that the presentHuyton CC. could not be left unchanged with 87,379 electors. He thought it preferable, however, thatRainford U.D. should be left in Ormskirk CC. (with a consequent electorate of 73,002) rather than be!transferred to Ince CC. (electorate 55,269 without Rainford U.D.) where the electorate would grow rapidly:on account of the new town of Skelmersdale. He advised against accepting a representation to the effect thatCrosby should continue to be designated as a borough constituency. In Liverpool he considered that the;Exchange B.C. should be re-named Scotland Exchange B.C.We agreed with the assistant Commissioner that neither of the alternative proposals canvassed at the local inquiry was acceptable. We accepted his advice that Rainford U.D. should be left in Ormskirk CC. and thatthe Crosby constituency in its new form was more appropriately designated as a county constituency. Wejagreed that the proposed Liverpool, Exchange B.C. should be re-named Liverpool, Scotland Exchange.Manchester and Designation of ConstituenciesThe assistant Commissioner who held the Manchester inquiry suggested that we should adopt counter-proposals for the transfer of St. George&apos;s ward from the proposed Cheetham and Exchange B.C. to MossSide B.C. Not only would this produce more equal electorates (56,683 and 59,814 respectively) but it would put St. George&apos;s ward in the same constituency as the All Saints&apos;, Moss Side East and Moss Side Westwards which, like it, appeared to be part of the Hulme redevelopment area. He also reported unanimoussupport for the re-naming of the Cheetham and Exchange B.C. as &quot;Central&quot;.He also suggested that Heywood and Royton, which was very scattered and included large areas of moor-;land, should continue to be designated as a county constituency, but he recommended that the proposeddesignation of Middleton and Prestwich as a borough constituency should stand.We accepted the advice of the assistant Commissioner as regards the boundaries of the proposed Cheethamand Exchange and Moss Side B.Cs. in Manchester, and that Cheetham and Exchange should be re-namedCentral. We also agreed that Heywood and Royton should continue to be designated as a county constituency.Our revised recommendations made the following modifications to our provisional proposals:-Heywood and Royton CCOrmskirk CC.Ince B.C.....Liverpool, Scotland Exchange B.C.Manchester Central B.C.        .Manchester, Moss Side B.C    .1965 Electorate62,39773,00255,26954,45856,68359,814
Following the publication of our revised recommendations the representations objecting to the proposedOrmskirk CC. were renewed.We also received representations urging the designation of Crosby as a borough constituency. We saw nopurpose in holding a further inquiry since the issues as regards boundaries had already been thoroughlydiscussed and in our opinion there was no practicable alternative to our proposed boundaries without creatingan additional seat in a county where we had already proposed one seat above the theoretical entitlement,or without placing Kirkby in a Liverpool constituency, a proposal which was subject to strong local objectionsfland would be contrary to the Rules. We therefore decided to adhere to the boundaries in our revised recom-mendations. We decided nevertheless to accede to the representations about the designation of Crosby as aborough constituency particularly as the existing Crosby constituency was a borough constituency.Our revised recommendations for Manchester were the subject of representations objecting to the transfer0fSt. George&apos;s ward from the proposed Central B.C. to Moss Side BC. We considered there was no justifica-lion for departing from our revised recommendations which were based on our assistant Commissionersreport following examination of the local issues involved.We published modified recommendations designating Crosby as a borough constituency, and took theopportunity to propose a number of minor changes in the boundaries of the proposed Bootle (65,176 electors),Crosby (67,146 electors), Ince (55,333 electors), Ormskirk (72,925 electors) and Westhoughton (60,959 elec-lors) constituencies to take account of local government boundary changes for the extension of Bootle(and for the constitution of the new urban district of Skelmersdale and Holland.: Representations were again made about the size of the proposed Ormskirk constituency, and the KirkbyU,D. Council themselves put forward as a possibility the proposal to link Kirkby U.D. with two wards of liverpool in a separate constituency. We decided that in view of the rapid growth of the electorate of theproposed Ormskirk CC. which was due to development in the Kirkby U.D. this proposal merited furtherconsideration and we decided to re-open the inquiry.The assistant Commissioner was impressed by the argument put forward at the inquiry that not only[irkby U.D. but also the Walton area of Liverpool, which was involved in the proposed linking, shouldiave characters of their own. Nevertheless, as the proposed alliance was likely to be only temporary untillirkby was large enough to form a separate constituency, he recommended the linking as the best way of avoiding excessive disparity between electorates of neighbouring constituencies.In considering the assistant Commissioners recommendation, we decided that we ought not to departfrom Rule 4 merely as a temporary measure in this case and that we should let our revised proposals stand,laving Kirkby U.D. in the proposed Ormskirk CC.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations for sixty Lancashire constituencies,amended by our revised and modified recommendations as indicated above in respect of the following ninetoristituencies: 1965 ElectorateHeywood and Royton CC......      . 62,397Ormskirk CC......... 72,925Westhoughton CC........ 60,959Bootle B.C.......... 65,176Crosby B.C.......... 67,146Ince B.C.......... 55,333Liverpool, Scotland Exchange B.C.   ..... 54,458Manchester Central BC.        .      .      .&apos;     .      .      - 56,683Manchester, Moss Side B.C....... 59,814LEICESTERSHIREThe 1965 electorate (476,941) entitled the county to no more than the existing eight seats. If the areasnnsferred to the Leicester C.B. on 1st April 1966 were included in the four Leicester BCs. and excludedpi the Harborough and Melton CCs. which encircle Leicester, Harborough&apos;s electorate would be reducedm 83,847 to about 79,500 and Melton&apos;s from 79,046 to about 73,500. The electorates of the LeicesterICs, would increase but they would still contain only some 50,000 electors each. We did not consider thatPch disparities should continue, especially with such high and growing electorates in Harborough andHelton. In our provisional recommendations we suggested that the county should be divided into eightonstituencies with more balanced electorates by (a) removing Oadby U.D. from Leicester South East B.C.P dividing Leicester into three seats instead of the existing four; and (b) creating a South Leicestershirei   1C. to reduce the size of the electorates in the Harborough and Melton constituencies. We saw no reasonI   * alter the Bosworth and Loughborough CCs. other than to recommend minor changes to bring their.   ^undaries into line with altered local government boundaries. Our provisional recommendations were:-1965 ElectorateBosworth CC.       .      ....... 67,940Harborough CC......      .      .      . 47,560Loughborough CC.       .      .             .      .      .      . 55,808Melton CC......... 67,279South Leicestershire CC....... 47,880Leicester East B.C.         ....... 58,415Leicester South B.C.       .      .      ...      .      . 69,479Leicester West B.C.......      . 62,580
The major issue raised in representations appeared to be the proposed reduction of the number of seats in Leicester C.B. from four to three. A local inquiry was held and the assistant Commissioner reported infavour of alternative proposals designed to create more equal electorates and to avoid the loss of a Leicesterborough constituency. Under these proposals Oadby and Wigston U.Ds., both included in Harborough C.C.under our provisional recommendations, would be placed in Leicester borough constituencies. The proposedSouth Leicestershire CC. would then be merged with the balance of Harborough CC. in a revised Harbor-ough CC. (69,594 electors) and a fourth borough constituency would be restored to Leicester. He also repor-ted no objection to a suggestion that, should we adhere to our proposal for a South Leicestershire C.C., itj?should be called Blaby CC. &apos;&apos; &apos;1In considering the assistant Commissioners report and the proceedings of the local inquiry we were im-pressed by the local objections to the inclusion of Oadby and Wigston U.Ds. in Leicester borough constituencies-cies. It was also our view that, wherever circumstances permitted, it was preferable to separate county boroughsfrom administrative counties for the purposes of parliamentary representation. Not only did this meet therequirements of the Rides but, in the case of Leicestershire, the resultant disparities in constituency electorateswere not excessive. We therefore decided to leave the provisionally recommended boundaries unaltered butto publish a revised recommendation re-naming the proposed South Leicestershire CC. as Blaby CC.Except for an isolated objection to our proposal to give the South Leicestershire CC. the name of Blabyall the further representations against our revised recommendations consisted of objections to our decision not to adopt the boundaries suggested by the assistant Commissioner. We were not disposed to vary the boundaries we had recommended as this was a clear instance where a county borough could be given itsown representation separate from the administrative county without creating excessive disparities in the size of electorates. We saw no reason to vary the name of Blaby which appeared to have been generally accepted.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified by the revised recom-mendation for the name of the Blaby CC.LINCOLNSHIRE AND RUTLANDRutland&apos;s electorate in 1965 (14,834) was not enough for a separate constituency and we saw no reason to disturb its association with Lincolnshire (Parts of Kesteven) for parliamentary purposes. The combinedelectorate of Lincolnshire and Rutland in 1965 (521,237), entitled them to their existing nine seatsThe position was:  (a) The Parts of Holland were represented by the Holland with Boston CC. (71,345 electors) and,although the electorate was high, it was insufficient to justify a second seat. We recommendedonly minor adjustments to conform with alterations to the county boundary.(b) The Parts of Kesteven and Rutland were entitled to their existing two seats (106,853 electors). Therewas some disparity in the size of the electorates of these seats but we saw no pressing reason to propose changes. Minor changes were, however, necessary to bring the constituency boundariesinto line with altered local authority boundaries.(c) The Parts of Lindsey were entitled to their existing six seats (343,039 electors). There was a big dis-parity between the largest constituency, Brigg CC. (77,402 electors) and the smallest, HorncastleCC. (43,341 electors) but drastic alterations would be necessary to achieve better parity. We con-sidered it undesirable to embark on this in advance of any local government changes especially since the disruption of local ties and general inconvenience would be contrary to the guidancegiven to us by section 2(2) of the 1958 Act. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 Electorate, -    n n                                                          .      . 77,402BnggCC.     .      .      -      -      -      - . &apos;  qGainsborough CC.........  maGranthamCC......-      -      - %&apos;\fHolland with Boston CC.......

There was also a represen-tation that the Holland with Boston CC should be made into two constituencies. The assistant Commis-sioner who held a local inquiry found strong arguments for introducing Scunthorpe (43,282 electors) intothe name of the Bngg CC. and he recommended that the constituency should be re-named Brigg andScunthorpe CC He did not, however, consider it would be appropriate to introduce Skegness into the nameof the predominantly agricultural Horncastle CC, nor did he find a case for dividing the Holland withBoston CC. into two constituencies with fewer than 40,000 electors each.We accepted the assistant Commissioners findings and we published revised recommendations re-namingBrigg CC as Brigg and Scunthorpe CC. We also published revised recommendations modifying theboimdaiies of the Grantham, Gainsborough and Lincoln constituencies to conform with an alteration in local government boundaries under The Lincoln Order 1967 which had transferred parts of North KestevenR.D. and Welton R.D. to Lincoln C.B., involving 457 electors and producing a 1965 electorate for Parts ofKesteven and Rutland of 106,827 and for Parts of Lindsey of 343 065
There was an objection to the re-naming of the Brigg constituency but the objectors did not appear to appreciate that the name of Brigg would be retained in the constituency name and we decided to adhere toour revised recommendations. The objectors were informed accordingly. There were no other representations.Later we published revised proposals for the Grimsby B.C. and the Louth CC. to take account of TheGrimsby Order 1967 and to bring the proposed constituency boundaries into line with the extension made toGrimsby C.B., involving 928 electors. No representations were received against this proposal.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as subsequently modified, as follows: 1965 ElectorateBrigg and Scunthorpe CC.      ...... 77,402Gainsborough CC.        .      .      ..      .             -      - 51,758Grantham CC......... 63,803Holland with Boston CC....... 71,345Horncastle CC......... 43,341Louth CC.......... 56,060Rutland and Stamford CC....... 43,024Grimsby B.C......... 62,979Lincoln B.C........              - 51,525NORFOLKThe 1965 electorate (390,677) entitled the county to no more than seven seats compared with the existingeight. Central Norfolk CC. (63,160 electors) was the largest; the remaining seven constituencies were allbelow the electoral quota. In these circumstances and bearing in mind the limit on the total number of english seats we considered there should be a reduction of one seat. We decided to propose a re-distributionbased upon the elimination of the Central Norfolk CC. We recognised that our provisional recommendationsproduced a disparity between the electorates of the two borough constituencies in Norwich, where we proposed no change, and those of the three proposed county constituencies surrounding the county borough.The county borough electorate of 82,685 was, however, too high for a single constituency. Our provisional recommendations were:  King&apos;s Lynn CC.North Norfolk CC.South Norfolk CCSouth West Norfolk CC.Yarmouth CCNorwich North B.C.Norwich South B.C.1965 Electorate55,30570,16165,66853,69263,16639,69842,987Representations were made against the reduction from eight to seven seats and we decided to hold a local inquiry. Before the inquiry was held the Minister of Housing and Local Government announced his decisions on the proposed extension of Norwich. The former Local Government Commission had proposed majoradditions to Norwich but the Ministers proposals added an electorate of less than 500. We asked our assis-lant Commissioner to place this information before the local inquiry. We also let it be known at the inquirythat on the basis of the progress of our review elsewhere in England it appeared unlikely we would be ableto leave Norfolk with its existing eight seats and we expressed the hope that the inquiry would devoteparticular attention to the boundaries we had recommended for seven constituencies.In his report, the assistant Commissioner expressed sympathy with representations for the retention of eight seats and did not advise against this if we felt able to accept it. He considered however that the case forleaving the county with eight seats was based on emotion rather than logic. He reviewed the following alternative proposals which had been made for achieving seven seats: (i) our scheme based on the elimination of the Central Norfolk CC. and the distribution of its con-stituent parts among the remaining county constituencies;(ii) a proposal to combine the Norwich constituencies into a single borough constituency of about82,000 electors leaving the existing six county constituencies unchanged (average 50,000 electorseach);(iii) a subsidiary proposal based on the division of Norwich North, Norwich South and Central Norfolkinto two constituencies (one of about 75,000 electors and the other of about 63,000 electors);(iv) a proposal tranferring certain &quot;built-up areas&quot; into the Norwich constituencies but otherwise leaving the county constituencies unchanged.He reported unanimous support for the continued association of the Marshland R.D. with King&apos;s Lynn(Marshland R.D. was transferred to South West Norfolk CC. under our provisional recommendations) andhe recommended that, since the greater part of Marshland R.D. was accessible only through King&apos;s Lynn, itshould be transferred from South West Norfolk CC. to King&apos;s Lynn CC. increasing the latter&apos;s electorate&apos;067,245 and reducing the former&apos;s to its existing 41,752. He also recommended that King&apos;s Lynn CC. shouldho re-named North West Norfolk CC. Apart from these modifications he recommended that if Norfolk ould not be left with its present eight constituencies then our proposals were preferable to the others whichhad been considered at the inquiry.
We reviewed the number of seats for Norfolk in the light of the claims for additional seats which had beenmade throughout the rest of England but we came to the conclusion that we would not be justified in leavingNorfolk with eight seats; the theoretical entitlement was 6-78 seats and with the proposed allocation of sevenseats it would, as a whole, have more than average representation. We decided to accept the assistant Com-missioned suggested modifications to our proposals for seven seats and we published revised proposals forthis purpose The revised recommendations, which also took account of minor extensions which had beenmade to the boundaries of Norwich under The Norwich Order 1968, involving 315 electors, were as follows:-North Norfolk CC.North West Norfolk CC.South Norfolk CC.South West Norfolk CCYarmouth CC.Norwich North B.C.Norwich South B.C.1965 Electorate.    69,88967,24565,625. 41,752. 63,166. 39,970.    43,030Representations were again made about the size of some of the county constituencies and also that theYarmouth CC. should be re-named East Norfolk. We did not consider that we should be justified in holding further local inquiry to consider the question of boundaries. Nor did we consider that there was a case foraltering the name of the Yarmouth CC.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.NORTHAMPTONSHIREThe 1965 electorate (279,970) gave a theoretical entitlement of 4-76 seats compared with the existing fourseats. As a result of the extension of its boundaries on 1st April 1965, Northampton CB. contained 84,116electors. In view of this and the further growth of electorate expected in the county borough, we proposedthat the borough should be divided into two constituencies and that the remainder of the county shouldbe divided into three county constituencies. Brixworth R.D. was transferred to South Northants CC. toreduce the disparity in the electorates of the county constituencies. Other changes brought the constituency boundaries into line with the altered county boundary. Our recommendations involved a large disparity between the electorates of the proposed borough constituencies and those of the county constituencies butit was our provisional view that this was preferable to a departure from local authority boundaries whichwould be necessary if a scheme for five constituencies with more equal electorates were to be devised. our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateKettering CC......... 69,344South Northants CC........ 59,074Wellingborough CC........ 67,436Northampton North B.C........ 41,218Northampton South BC....... 42,898Representations were chiefly directed at the disparity between the electorates of the borough and countyconstituencies. These representations and proposals for the creation of a fourth county constituency were considered at a local inquiry. The assistant Commissioner reported no local objection to the boundary we hadchosen for dividing Northampton into two constituencies. He did not consider that the allocation of anadditional seat to the county would be justified at present. If there were to be only three seats for the admini-strative county, he supported our scheme subject to South Northants CC. being re-named Daventry, or possibly West Northants. If, notwithstanding his advice, we decided to create a fourth county constituencyhe suggested it should be on the lines suggested at the inquiry.We agreed with the assistant Commissioner that an additional county constituency was not justified atpresent and we published revised recommendations for re-naming the proposed South Northants CC. asDaventry CC.We received some comments about our revised recommendations: in particular it was suggested that our recommendations did not take sufficient account of the likely growth of electorate in Corby. In our opinion,however, there was no possibility of our allocating an additional seat to the administrative county and, unlessthe boundaries of the county borough were crossed, some disparity in the electorates of the borough and county constituencies seemed inevitable.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified by the revised recommenda-tions for the name of the Daventry CC.NORTHUMBERLANDThe 1965 electorate (552,284) entitled the county to 9-40 seats compared with the existing ten seats. we proposed that, pending the outcome of the Royal Commission^ review of local government in England,the seven borough constituencies should be left unchanged in spite of the disparities in their electorates. Atthe same time we took note that the total electorate in the borough constituencies fully justified the present
seven seats. The area of the existing three county constituencies contained 139,092 electors so that we couldeither divide it into two constituencies of about 70,000 electors each, which would give the county a reducedallocation of nine seats, or we could leave it unchanged with three constituencies averaging 46,000 each. Ifthere were only two seats they would each contain about 615,000 acres and it was our provisional view that itwould be undesirable to propose constituencies with such high electorates and acreages in this area. we accordingly proposed no change in the existing parliamentary constituencies in Northumberland, subjectto a further review of the situation when the pattern of local government had been settled. Our provisionalI recommendations were:  &apos; 1965 ElectorateBerwick-upon-Tweed CC.       ...      .      .      .    39,767HexhamCC.Morpeth CC.BlythB.C.Newcastle upon Tyne Central B.C.Newcastle upon Tyne East BC.Newcastle upon Tyne North B.C.Newcastle upon Tyne West BC.Tynemouth B.C.WallsendBC.No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.54,82244,50363,21340,55847,89742,20563,92475,73079,665NOTTINGHAMSHIREThe 1965 electorate (622,028) gave a theoretical entitlement of 10-59 seats. With one exception (CarltonC.C., 74,182 electors) the electorates of the existing constituencies were well within our suggested inner range of 50,000 to 70,000 and we proposed that the county should continue with its present allocation of ten seats.The Ashfield, Bassetlaw, Mansfield and Newark CCs. were left unchanged. So too was RushclhYe CC. otherthan to bring its boundary into line with the altered local government boundary. Since Carlton&apos;s electoratehad grown substantially since 1954 and the growth was expected to continue we proposed that Arnold U.D.should be removed from the constituency and be included, like Hucknall and West Bridgford CDs., in aNottingham constituency by altering the boundaries of the North, Central and West BCs. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateAshfield CC......... 62,309Bassetlaw CC........      . 61,069Carlton CC         ........ 54,089Mansfield CC.      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      . 59,817Newark CC......... 58,950Rushcliffe CC......... 64,914Nottingham Central B.C....... 63,111Nottingham North BC........ 67,856Nottingham South BC.   .      .      .      .      .      .      . 65,325Nottingham West BC.    .      .      ...      .      . 64,588Many representations were made against these provisional recommendations. The inclusion of Arnoldin a Nottingham constituency was criticised and we received alternative proposals for the creation of anadditional county constituency.The assistant Commissioner who held a local inquiry considered that the number of seats was the underlyingissue. The moderate growth of electorate since 1954 and the absence of areas of abnormally large anticipateddevelopment led him to recommend ten rather than eleven seats. He suggested that the choice was between our own provisional recommendations and a possible alternative scheme dividing the administrative countyinto seven county constituencies of about 60,000 electors each and the City into three borough constitu-encies of about 68,000 electors each. The principal advantage of the latter scheme would be the exclusion from the borough constituencies of any county districts, but the assistant Commissioner found in favour ofour provisional recommendations because, as he saw it, they would involve the minimum of changes in existing constituencies and less disparity in the electorates. The assistant Commissioner did not supportproposals for the transfer of some western parts of Newark CC. to Mansfield CC. He saw no alternative to the proposal in* our provisional recommendations to transfer Radford ward from Nottingham CentralB.C. to Nottingham West B.C. notwithstanding a petition from the electors in Radford. He reported thatthe names we had proposed were acceptable but that if a seventh county constituency were created the constituency to the south of the county including Bingham R.D. should be called Rushcliffe, and the constituency to the west of Nottingham should be called Beeston. He recommended that the proposed Not-tingham North and Nottingham South borough constituencies should continue to be designated asborough constituencies.We concluded that, whether ten or eleven seats were allocated to the county, it would be preferable to separate the county borough from the administrative county for the purposes of parliamentary representation.We also noted that under the alternative scheme for ten seats mentioned by the assistant Commissioner,
Nottingham would have three constituencies of about 68,000 electors each which did not compare unfavour-ably, for example, with Sunderland where two seats of about 71,000 each were proposed. Moreover, with anelectorate of 204,005, Nottingham&apos;s entitlement to four seats was not as strong as Coventry&apos;s with an elec-torate of 213,057. We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice that some western parts of Newark CC.should not be transferred to Mansfield CC. We deferred the publication of revised proposals until we werein a position to consider all the claims for additional seats which had been made throughout England as awhole but we found that in comparison with the electorates of other counties we would not be justified in recommending more than ten constituencies for Nottinghamshire. We accordingly published revised recom-mendations for separate representation of the county and of the county borough. We allocated seven seats to the county and three to the county borough, taking account of the alteration of ward boundaries made byThe City of Nottingham (Wards) Order 1967. Our revised recommendations were:-Ashfield CC.Bassetlaw CC.Beeston CC. .Carlton CC .Mansfield CC.Newark CC. .Rushcliffe CC.Nottingham East B.C.Nottingham North B.C.Nottingham West B.C.1965 Electorate67,33261,06962,81658,13759,81758,95049,90268,02567,77268,208Our revised proposals received a large measure of support but representations were made about the re-drawing of the boundaries of some county constituencies and the preservation of the name of the RushcliffeCC. Representations were also received about the division of the existing Nottingham South constituencybetween the proposed East and West constituencies, but the alternative proposals also involved the re-drawing of the boundaries of some of the proposed county constituencies and the allocation of anotherSeat to the geographical county. We considered that these matters had been sufficiently examined at the inquiry and that a further inquiry would not be justified.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.OXFORDSHIREThe 1965 electorate (206,992) gave a theoretical entitlement of 3-52 seats. The electorate of the countyborough of Oxford (67,059) had declined slightly since 1954 and was too small to make two seats; therest of the county, if divided into three, would produce constituencies of below-average size. In view of this and of the limit on the total number of English seats we proposed no change in the three existing constituencies-cies for the geographical county. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateBanburyCC.....- .      .      .      .72,192Henley CC.   .      .      .......    67,741Oxford B.C.........      .    67,059Representations were made against our provisional recommendations largely on the grounds that theygave the county inadequate representation. Following a local inquiry the assistant Commissioner reportedthat the present size of the electorate and the prospects of population growth justified an additional seat. Hesuggested that the two existing county constituencies, if left unchanged, would each have electorates sub-stantially in excess of 80,000 by the mid-1970s. Although he accepted the general basis of some alternative proposals for four constituencies, he did not support the proposed inclusion of a ward of Oxford and twowards of Reading in Oxfordshire county constituencies.We deferred consideration of the assistant Commissioners suggestions until we were in a position to con-sider all the claims for additional seats which had been made throughout England as a whole. The 1968 elec-toral figures revealed that, with an electorate of 220,749 (entitlement 3-69) and an average electorate of73,583 with three seats, Oxfordshire had the best claim for another seat. The electorate had grown so rapidlythat it was higher in 1968 than that of Shropshire (214,262), Barnet (218,886), Bromley (211,558), Coventry(214,969), Lambeth (215,414) and Wandsworth (216,294) where in each case we had proposed the allocation of four seats. We decided to recommend four seats for Oxfordshire on the basis and with the names suggestedby the assistant Commissioner. We published revised recommendations as follows:  1965 ElectorateBanburyCC........      .    51,077Henley CC..........   45,052Mid-OxonCC.      ........   43,804Oxford B.C.   . .......   67,059No representations were received about the boundaries of these four proposed constituencies but it wassuggested that the name Mid-Oxon should be altered to Central Oxfordshire and that the Banbury and
Henley constituencies should be named North Oxfordshire and South Oxfordshire respectively. Howeveranother suggestion was made that the Banbury and Henley constituencies should be named North Oxonand South Oxon respectively. We considered these suggestions but decided to adhere to the names recom-mended by the assistant Commissioner.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.\ShropshireThe 1965 electorate (205,010) gave a theoretical entitlement of 3-49 seats compared with the existing four.The biggest was The Wrekin CC. (56,017) and the smallest Ludlow CC. (48,348). We considered various possibilities of providing better-sized electorates but we came to the provisional conclusion that, in view of the substantial growth expected in the electorate especially in the new town of Dawley and of the provisionsof section 2(2) of the 1958 Act, Shropshire should be left with four constituencies. The constituency boundar-ies, however, needed adjustment to bring them into line with altered local government boundaries. our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateLudlow CC..........42,116Oswestry CC.Shrewsbury CC.The Wrekin CC.50,50950,08062,305No representations were received against our provisional recommendations but there were subsequentalterations in local government boundaries under The Salop (No. 2) Order 1966, involving 1,129 electors, asa result of the Shropshire county review. These involved small transfers of electorate between all the fourconstituencies we had provisionally recommended but they did not oblige us to change the basis of ourscheme. Revised recommendations were published as follows:  1965 ElectorateLudlow CC..........    42,599Oswestry CC......Shrewsbury CC.    .....The Wrekin CC.    .....Again there were no representations.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.49,89050,72661,795SOMERSETThe 1965 electorate (430,082) entitled the county to no more than its existing seven constituencies. we considered that the existing constituency electorates were of reasonable size and that only a few minor changes,including the extension of Bath B.C, to bring constituency boundaries into line with altered local governmentboundaries, were needed. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateBridgwater CC.     ...                                   - 58,523North Somerset CC      1             ..... 69&apos;514Taunton CC......... 54&apos;973Wells CC.......... 58-705Weston-Super-Mare CC.        .      .      -             -      - 66-601YeovilCC.......... 62,688BathB.C......                            - 59*078We received alternative proposals for the division of the county and a local inquiry was held. The assistant commissioner reported that as the alternative proposals would involve a drastic re-arrangement of the constituencies of North Somerset, Wells and Weston-Super-Mare our provisional recommendations werepreferable: except for the minor alterations to conform with altered local government boundaries, our pro-visional recommendations left the existing constituencies unchanged.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.STAFFORDSHIREThe 1965 electorate (1,176,646) entitled the county to twenty seats compared with the existing nineteen.There had been radical changes in local government boundaries in the West Midlands. On the basis of their new boundaries the county boroughs of Dudley, Walsall and West Bromwich were entitled to two consti-constituencies each and Stoke-on-Trent and Wolverhampton were entitled to three each. We proposed that thecounty boroughs should be divided accordingly, keeping wherever possible to existing constituency boundaries.We also suggested that the new Aldridge-Brownhills U.D. with an electorate of 52,105 should constitute a
single borough constituency. We considered that Newcastle-under-Lyme M.B. should continue to be corn-bined with Newcastle-under-Lyme R.D. in a borough constituency with minor changes to conform, withaltered local government boundaries. This made a total of fourteen borough constituencies.We recommended that the rest of the county with its growing electorate should be divided into six countyconstituencies, bringing the total number of seats to the entitlement of twenty. In detail, we suggested thatthe balance of the existing Brierley Hill CC, i.e. Seisdon R.D, should be joined with Cannock R.D. to forma South West Staffordshire CC.; and that Cannock and Rugeley U.Ds. with some northern parishes of Lich-field R.D. should form a revised Cannock CC. This would avoid the high electorate (70,992) that would result if the existing Lichfield and Tamworth county constituency were simply brought into line with the extensionof Tamworth. Burton CC. and Stafford and Stone CC, both of which had electorates very close to the electoral quota, needed no alteration other than a minor change to bring Stafford and Stone CC. into line with an altered local government boundary. Even after allowing for changes to conform with new localgovernment boundaries, Leek CC. still had almost 70,000 electors, but in view of the considerable disturbancethat would result from any scheme to transfer parts of it to neighbouring constituencies we considered that itshould be left unchanged except for some minor alterations consequential on local government boundarychanges. Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 ElectorateBurton CC.......... 59,753Cannock CC......... 47,326Leek CC.......... 69,543Lichfield and Tamworth CC....... 56,959South West Staffordshire CC....... 45,555Stafford and Stone CC         ...... 63,699Aldridge-Brownhills B.C....... 52,105Dudley East B.C......... 57,734Dudley West B.C.   ........ 61,020Newcastle-under-Lyme B.C.     .      .      ...      . 65,175Stoke-on-Trent Central B.C....... 61,150Stoke-on-Trent North B.C....... 58,331Stoke-on-Trent South B.C....... 67,014Walsall North B.C......... 62,408Walsall South B.C......... 58,093West Bromwich East B.C....... 54,492West Bromwich West B.C....... 60,205Wolverhampton North B.C....... 54,345Wolverhampton South East B.C...... 61,966Wolverhampton South West B.C...... 59,773We received representations about the boundaries we had chosen for the division of Walsall, West Bromwichand Wolverhampton. There were several representations about the provisional recommendations for theSouth West Staffordshire, Cannock and Lichfield and Tamworth CCs. A proposal was also made for thetransfer of Kidsgrove U.D. from the Leek CC. to the Stoke-on-Trent North B.C. Following a local inquirythe assistant Commissioner reported as follows: Cannock and LichfieldThere were local objections to our provisional recommendations for the transfer of seven parishes ofLichfield R.D. to the proposed Cannock CC. and several alternatives were proposed. The assistant Com-missioner favoured the one which would transfer only one parish-Brindley Heath which lies betweenCannock U.D. and Rugeley U.D. He did not support a proposal for the transfer of the polling district of little Aston in Lichfield R.D. from the Lichfield and Tamworth CC. to Sutton Coldfield B.C. in War-wickshire.Leek and Stoke-on-TrentThe assistant Commissioner did not support a proposal to transfer Kidsgrove U.D. from the Leek CC.to Stoke-on-Trent North B.C.South West StaffordshireThere were objections from the parishes of Huntingdon, Cheslyn Hay, Great Wyrley and Essington inCannock R.D. to our proposal to separate them from Cannock U.D. but the assistant Commissioner saw no alternative to the inclusion of all the parishes of Cannock R.D. in the proposed South West StaffordshireCC.WalsallThe assistant Commissioner recommended that we should accede to what appeared to be a general wishfor the transfer of Willenhall South ward from the proposed Walsall South B.C. to Walsall North B.C. tokeep the whole of Willenhall in one constituency. To compensate for this a ward-either Hatherton orBirchiUs-would have to be transferred from Walsall North B.C. He recommended the transfer of Hathertonward.
West BromwichThe assistant Commissioner did not support the Borough Councils alternative proposals for a division of,l,e borough into two constituencies by a boundary running from east to west since this would be too radicala departure from the existing parliamentary boundary. He did however recommend that Friar Park wardshould be transferred from West Bromwich East to West Bromwich West in view of Friar Park&apos;s affinitieswith Wednesbury, and that Lyng ward should be transferred from the West B.C to the East B.C. to balance the electorates. On balance he did not recommend the suggested suffixes of Dartmouth and Brunswick inthe names of the West Bromwich constituencies.WolverhamptonHe supported alternative proposals for the transfer of Eastfield ward from the proposed WolverhamptonSouth East B.C. to the proposed Wolverhampton North B.C to utilise a trunk road boundary which was already a constituency boundary. He also recommended the name of Wolverhamplon North East for theproposed North B.C.We agreed with the assistant Commissioners suggestions for the boundaries of Cannock CC. and Lich-fekl and Tamworth C.C., and we saw no reason to modify our provisional recommendations for Leek C.C.,South West Staffordshire CC. and the Stoke-on-Trent B.Cs. In Walsall, we agreed to the boundaries sugges-tcd by the assistant Commissioner to enable the Willenhall wards to be together in the North constituency,[n West Bromwich, however, we preferred to keep to our provisional recommendations. We did not favour the Borough CounciPs proposals which were intended to avoid the perpetuation of old boundaries withinthe borough; on the other hand we did not consider that we should pursue the assistant Commissionersproposals for the exchange of Friar Park and Lyng wards since this did not appear to have been put forwardivith wide support at the local inquiry. In Wolverhampton we accepted the assistant Commissioners propo-sals for the boundaries, and also for the re-naming of Wolverhampton North BC. as WolverhamptonNorth East. We published revised recommendations as follows:  Burton CC. .Cannock CC..LeekCC.Lichfield and Tamworth CC.South West Staffordshire CC.Stafford and Stone CC.Aldridge-Brownhills B.C.Dudley East B.C. .Dudley West B.C. .Newcastle-under-Lyme B.C.Stoke-on-Trent Central B.C.Stoke-on-Trent North B.C.Stoke-on-Trent South B.C.Walsall North B.C. .Walsall South B.C.West Bromwich East BC.West Bromwich West BC.Wolverhampton North East B.CWolverhampton South East B.CWolverhampton South West B.C.1965 Electorate59,753. 43,532. 69,543. 60,753. 45,555. 63,699. 52,105.    57,73461,020. 65,175. 61,150.    58,33167,014. 62,904.    57,59754,492.    60,20562,442. 53,869.    59,773of Cannock CC. and Lichfield and Tam-sparity in electorates produced by the revisedWe received representations against the revised boundariesI worth CC. There were objections in particular to the greater drecommendations and some people expressed a preference for our provisional recommendations. opinion in Walsall was divided about the revised recommendations. There was a similar division of opinion in WestBromwich about the proposed boundaries; there were also suggestions that the proposed East and Westconstituencies should be named Dartmouth and Leabrook. There were some objections to the revised propo-salsfor Wolverhampton.i It was our view that all the points raised in these further representations had been covered at the local in-I luiry and that no fresh considerations had emerged to justify either a departure from our revised recom-wndations or the holding of a further inquiry. In regard to the names of the West Bromwich constituencies* considered it preferable to use the East and West designations rather than adopt locality names for whichthere was no general support.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.SUFFOLKThe 1965 electorate (327,662) gave a theoretical entitlement of 5-58 seats. The existing five seats were ofrcasonable size except for Ipswich B.C. with an electorate of 78,811. The alternatives were either to letWich B.C. remain with a high electorate or to divide it into two seats of less than 40,000 electors. Future
development would strengthen the city&apos;s claim to an additional seat but it appeared that this would take placerelatively slowly. We considered that until it had materialised it would be preferable to leave the constituencyunchanged especially as there was some likelihood of local government boundary changes. Our provisional recommendations were:  Bury St. Edmunds CC.   .Eye CC.Lowestoft CC.Sudbury and Woodbridge CC.Ipswich B.C .No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.1965 Electorate63,17758,12262,235 I65,31778,811SURREYThe 1965 electorate (631,870) justified eleven seats. There were nine seats in the county together withparts of the Carshalton and East Surrey CCs. which had been divided by the Greater London boundary.We decided to allocate eleven seats in our provisional recommendations. We considered that the amalgama-tion of Caterham and Warlingham U.D and Godstone R.D. in a new East Surrey CC. was an almost in-inevitable consequence of the Greater London changes and this led to our proposal that Reigate M.B.and Ban-stead U.D. should be combined in a new Reigate CC. We suggested that Epsom and Ewell M.B. should standon its own as a borough constituency and that Leatherhead U.D. should be put with Esher U.D. in a newEsher CC. Walton and Weybridge U.D, separated from Esher, could then be joined with Chertsey U.D.inanew Walton and Chertsey CC. This would enable Frimley and Camberley U.D. to be taken from WokingCC. with its large electorate and joined with Egham U.D. and Bagshot R.D. in a new North West SurreyCC. We proposed no changes in the Dorking, Farnham, Guildford and Spelthorne CCs. Our provisional recommendations were:  Dorking CC .East Surrey CC.Esher CCFamham CC.Guildford CC.North West Surrey CC.Reigate CC .Spelthorne CC.Walton and Chertsey CCWoking CC. .Epsom B.C.1965 Electorate54,42749,51368,50553,88260,87154,93664,45760,18560,00057,55847,536Representations were received, and following a local inquiry the assistant Commissioner reported that therewere three main problems, as follows:  LeatherheadThere was much concern over the proposed association of Leatherhead with Esher, but the assistant commissioner reported that neither of the alternative proposals for Central Surrey to leave Leatherheadin Epsom B.C. or to include it in Dorking CC, transferring parishes of Guildford R.D. to Esher C.C.-was preferable to our scheme.BansteadThere were suggestions that it would be better to place Banstead with Caterham and Warlingham in anewconstituency rather than disturb Reigate CC, but the assistant Commissioner found strong reasons, bothof community of interest and communications, against this proposal. He saw some ground for Reigate CC.being re-named Reigate and Banstead CC.Walton and Chertsey CC.There were objections to the name of the proposed Walton and Chertsey CC. The assistant Commissionerthought it should be named Chertsey and Walton because Chertsey was an established parliamentary name;he also thought the constituency might be designated as a borough constituency but as this had not beencanvassed at the inquiry he suggested no change.In the light of the assistant Commissioners report we were not disposed to depart from the provisionallyrecommended boundaries. Leatherhead, although not big enough to form a constituency on its own, was not likely to lose its identity by being joined with Esher. Its association with Dorking was undesirable because,as indicated by the assistant Commissioner, it would necessitate the consequential transfer of certain parishes
of Guildford R.D. to the proposed Esher constituency. We did not consider there were compelling reasons for including Banstead in the name of the proposed Reigate constituency but we agreed with the assistant Com-missioner that Walton and Chertsey CC. should be re-named Chertsey and Walton. Finally we consideredthat, in keeping with our recommendations elsewhere, Chertsey and Walton, Esher, Reigate and Spelthorneconstituencies should be designated as borough constituencies. We published revised recommendations ac-cordingly-The major issue in the further representations we received was our decision to make no change in our pro-visional recommendation that Leatherhead should be removed from Epsom CC. and put with Esher U.D.in a new Esher B.C. We were urged to let Leatherhead remain in the Epsom CC Also, although the design a-tion of Reigate and Spelthorne as B.Cs. appeared to be welcomed, there was some opposition to similardesignations for Esher and Chertsey and Walton. Banstead U.D. Council renewed their claim for inclusion in the name of Reigate B.C.In the light of strong and general local objections to the removal of Leatherhead from the existing Epsomconstituency, we decided to modify our recommendations. We proposed that the boundaries of the presentEpsom CC. should stay unchanged but designated as a borough constituency and re-named Epsom and well and that Esher LJ.D. should constitute a borough constituency on its own. We recognised that the electorate of the proposed Esher B.C. (42,920) would be lower than that of Epsom and Ewell B.C. as originally proposed (47,536) but the representations indicated that there would be more growth of electorate in Esherthan in Epsom and Ewell. We were not disposed to disturb Dorking CC. as a means of solving the problemof Leatherhead. Nor were we persuaded to change our recommendations, which conformed with our generalpolicy, for the designation of Esher and Chertsey and Walton as borough constituencies; or to change thename of Reigate B.C. We published the modifications of our recommendations for the Esher and the Epsomand Ewell constituencies.While there were still some local objections in Epsom and Ewell to the proposal to leave the boundaries of the Epsom constituency unchanged our modified recommendations were generally welcomed.Finally, we published further modifications to our recommendations for the Reigate and East SurreyCCs. to take account of the effect of The Greater London, Kent and Surrey Order 1968, involving 1,365electors, under which on 1st April 1969 the Farleigh and Hooley areas were returned from Greater london to Surrey, producing a 1965 electorate for the county area of 633,235. No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, as amended by our revised and modifiedrecommendations, as follows:  1965 ElectorateDorking CC.......... 54,427East Surrey CC......... 49,584Farnham CC......... 53,882Guildford CC......... 60,871North West Surrey CC........ 54,936Woking CC.......... 57,558Chertsey and Walton B.C....... 60,000Epsom and Ewell B.C........ 73,121Esher B.C.......... 42,920Reigate B.C.         ........ 65,751Spelthorne B.C.......              - 60,185EAST SUSSEXThe 1965 electorate (507,763) justified nine seats compared with the existing eight. We understood that large increases of electorate were expected in the East Grinstead, Lewes and Rye constituencies and con-sidered that an additional seat should be allocated. Rye CC. and the four borough constituencies were leftunchanged in our provisional recommendations but East Grinstead CC. was reduced by removing CuckfieldU.D. and the northern parishes of Cuckfield R.D. and combining them with Burgess Hill U.D. and the restof Cuckfield R.D. in a new Cuckfield CC. The electorate of Lewes CC, without Burgess Hill and thesouthern parishes of Cuckfield R.D. but with the addition of several parishes of Hailsham R.D, was reduced.The transfer of the parishes of Hailsham R.D. to Lewes CC also moderated the electorate of EastbourneCC. We recognised that Hailsham R.D, at present split between two constituencies, would be split between three if our proposals were adopted. On the other hand our proposals re-united Cuckfield R.D. in a singleconstituency.Our provisional recommendations were: 1965 Electorate. Cuckfield CC.........   49,030Eastbourne CC.East Grinstead CC.Lewes CC.RyeCC.Brighton, Kemptown B.C.Brighton, Pavilion B.C.   .Hastings B.C.        .  ......Hove B.C.     .      .      .60,98344,06256,19859,90361,52156,01050,01770,039
There were representations about the details of our scheme but its general basis appeared acceptable,especially the creation of a Cuckfield constituency. Electors in East Saltdean (Lewes CC.) urged the inclusionof their area in Brighton, Kemptown B.C We also received alternative proposals for the naming of theCuckfield CC. Following a local inquiry the assistant Commissioner reported objections to the threewayssplit of Hailsham R.D. but he considered this was necessary to achieve balanced electorates. He did not support the proposed inclusion of East Saltdean in a Brighton constituency as this would depart from the boundary between Brighton and East Sussex. It would, moreover, widen the discrepancy between theelectorates of the Kemptown and Lewes constituencies. While he considered that there might be somejSmerit in a proposal to detach West Hoathly parish from Cuckfield R.D. and place it with East Grinstead,!he supported our recommendations which avoided splitting the rural district. Finally, he considered thatthe representations for naming the proposed Cuckfield constituency as Mid-Sussex were well-founded.We saw no reason to depart from our provisional recommendations save to propose the re-naming ofCuckfield CC. as suggested by the assistant Commissioner and a revised recommendation was publishedaccordingly. Objections to the inclusion of East Saltdean in the Lewes CC. were renewed, but we did notconsider we would be justified in departing from the boundary between Brighton and East Sussex in advanceof any local government boundary changes.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified by the revised recommen-dation for the name of the Mid-Sussex CC.WEST SUSSEXThe 1965 electorate (313,991) justified five seats compared with the existing four. Horsham C.C., which contained the new town of Crawley, had 87,945 electors and Arundel and Shoreham CC. had 86,393. we suggested the creation of an additional seat to reduce the electorates in these two constituencies. We recom-mended that Midhurst R.D. and Petworth R.D. should be removed from Horsham&apos; CC. and put withChichester M.B. and the western parishes of Chichester R.D. in a Chichester CC. The balance of ChichesterR.D. with Arundel M.B., Bognor Regis U.D., Littlehampton U.D. and the western parishes of WorthingR.D. would form an Arundel CC. The balance of Worthing R.D., with Shoreham-by-Sea U.D., SouthwickU.D. and Chanctonbury R.D. would constitute a Shoreham CC. Worthing BC. was left unchanged. our provisional recommendations were:-Arundel CC. .Chichester CC.Horsham CC.Shoreham CC.Worthing BC.1965 Electorate57,91755,12368,42566,41766,109Representations were made against the details of these recommendations, especially the disturbance ofHorsham CC. and the proposed division of the Chichester and Worthing R.Ds. There were suggestions that Crawley should be included in the name of the proposed Horsham CC. and that Bognor and Little-hampton should be adopted as names for the Arundel CC. Following a local inquiry the assistant Com-missioner reported in favour of our scheme for Horsham in spite of some local objections to the removalof Petworth R.D. from the constituency, but he recommended the inclusion of Crawley in the constituency&apos;s Name. He supported the unanimous representations for the inclusion of the six parishes of Worthing R.D.lying to the west of Worthing in the Arundel CC. rather than the Shoreham CC. He also supported, despiteobjections from the Chanctonbury R.D. Council, representations for the inclusion of the parish of Amberleyin the Arundel CC in view of its ties with the parish of Houghton. He did not consider that our scheme,which broke the parliamentary association of Bognor and Chichester and created a new one betweenBognor and Littlehampton, was unsatisfactory on grounds of local ties. There were, however, strong links between the parishes of Oving and Westhampnett and Chichester M.B. and he supported the suggestionthat these two parishes and a further six neighbouring parishes should be left in the Chichester CC. he saw no reason for including Bognor and Littlehampton in the name of the Arundel CC.We decided to adopt the boundaries suggested by the assistant Commissioner subject to one modification.We were reluctant to split the Chanctonbury R.D., which was left intact in our provisional recommendations,by putting the parish of Amberley in Arundel CC. Moreover, most of the electors in Houghton live close to Amberley and went there to vote. We considered that the best course would be for Amberley andHoughton parishes to be together in the Shoreham CC. We published revised recommendations accordingly,as follows: Arundel CC. .Chichester CC.Horsham and Crawley CC.Shoreham CC.Worthing B.C.1965 Electorate65,02357,77468,42556,66066,109We received only one representation asking us to re-examine our recommendations to take account of theexpanded housing programme in Crawley and the growth of electorate this would produce. It was argue that Petworth R.D. should be left in the Horsham and Crawley CC. so that when in due course Crawley
Ijp, became a separate constituency a substantial area would be left to form another constituency. Thepresent effect would however be that Horsham and Crawley CC. would have 75,377 electors and we did not feel able to accept this for a growing constituency.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.WARWICKSHIREI The 1965 electorate (1,335,577) entitled the county to its existing twenty-three seats. However, Birmingham,which had lost electors since 1954, was entitled to only twelve seats compared with the existing thirteen. in coventry on the other hand the local government boundaries had been extended and four seats instead ofthe existing three were justified. Our provisional recommendations provided for the transfer of one seat fromBirmingham to Coventry. In Birmingham we suggested the elimination of the Ladywood B.C. with itselectorate of 27,205, the lowest of any constituency in England. We also suggested that the Erdington wardof Birmingham, at present included in the Sutton Coldfield B.C., should be included in a Birmingham cons-tituency. In Coventry we used existing constituency boundaries as far as possible.Elsewhere we saw no reasonto propose boundary changes other than to bring constituency boundaries into line with altered local govern-ment boundaries. The resultant constituencies all had electorates within the limits we had suggested. Werecommended that the Nuneaton CC, which consists entirely of a municipal borough and an urban district,should be designated as a borough constituency. Our provisional recommendations were:-Meriden CC. .Rugby CC. .Stratford CC..Warwick and Leamington CC.Birmingham, All Saints B.CBirmingham, Edgbaston B.C.Birmingham, Erdington B.C.Birmingham, Hall Green B.C.Birmingham, Handsworth B.C.Birmingham, Northfield B.C.Birmingham, Perry Barr B.C.Birmingham, Selly Oak B.C.Birmingham, Small Heath B.C.Birmingham, Sparkbrook B.C.Birmingham, Stechford B.C.Birmingham, Yardley B.C.Coventry North East B.C.Coventry North West B.C.Coventry South East B.CCoventry South West B.C.Nuneaton B.C.SoIihullBC. .Sutton Coldfield B.C.1965 Electorate58,27351,19756,79967,13456,72167,61855,98459,94356,88563,26253,02057,88967,87256,39256,11156,52257,68548,27448,82758,27162,36465,77652,758Representations were received and a local inquiry was held in 1966. The assistant Commissioner reportedis follows: &quot;tinningham. Representations were made against the reduction from thirteen seats to twelve; there were also alternative proposals for the division of the City into twelve constituencies. The assistant Commissioner supported our proposed allocation of twelve seats. He agreed with an objection that Newtown ward fitted inconvenientlyinto the proposed Small Heath B.C, and that there were arguments for placing Soho, Deritend and Astonlards elsewhere, but he concluded that our provisional recommendations created less problems, especially&quot;lien regard was paid to expected population growth. He recommended, however, that the name Ladywoodtould be used instead of All Saints.Gentry] There were objections by the Coventry City Council to the allocation of four seats, and alternative pro-jposals were made for retaining the existing three seats. The assistant Commissioner saw no alternative to our^visional recommendations for four sets.patford-on-AvonTheassistant Commissioner supported a proposal that the Stratford CC. should be given the name of-&apos;-wtford-on-Avon CC.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice, and published revised recommendations re-naming the^Saints B.C. as Ladywood B.C, and the Stratford CC. as Stratford-on-Avon CC. In Coventry we main-
tained our view that the allocation of four seats was justified, and the Coventry City Council informed us in1967 that they were in agreement with this proposal.We received representations about the re-naming of the Stratford constituency. The objectors urged us toadopt Stratford-upon-Avon instead of Stratford-on-Avon. Since the borough of Stratford-upon-Avon wasonly part of a constituency covering a much wider area we did not consider that the constituency neednecessarily take its name from the borough and we considered we should keep to our revised recommendations which were based on the advice of the assistant Commissioner.Towards the end of our review we received representations about the rapid housing development beinmcarried out in the Chelmsley Wood area of the Meriden CC, and the effect this would have on the futurwj)electorate of the constituency, but we decided that the development was not sufficiently advanced for us tomake adjustments to take account of it in this review. The matter could be reviewed under section 2(3) of the1949 Act when this appeared necessary.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified by the revised recommend-ations for the name of the Birmingham, Ladywood B.C. and the Stratford-on-Avon CC.WESTMORLANDThe county was represented by one constituency with an electorate in 1965 of 47,228. This was notun-reasonably below the quota, and in view of the special geographical features of this area we saw no reasonto suggest a change. Our provisional recommendation was: 1965 ElectorateWestmorland CC.........   47,228No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendation.ISLE OF WIGHTThe 1965 electorate (70,479) was above average, but not big enough to make two constituencies. we proposed no change, and our provisional recommendation was: 1965 ElectorateIsle of Wight CC .......    70,479There were no representations but we subsequently published revised recommendations to take account ofthe inclusion of two offshore forts within the administrative boundaries of the Isle of Wight. No electoratewas involved. Again there were no representations.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendation, as amended to include the offshore forts.WILTSHIREThe 1965 electorate (283,550) justified the existing five seats. The electorates of all the constituencies were of reasonable size and we found no cause to disturb them except for some minor changes to bring theirboundaries into line with altered local government boundaries. Our provisional recommendations were:-1965 ElectorateChippenham CC......... 56,108Devizes CC........... 57,666Salisbury CC......... 53,766Westbury CC......... 57,445Swindon B.C......... 58,565No representations were received.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations.WORCESTERSHIREThe 1965 electorate (441,984) justified seven seats compared with the existing six. As a result of localgovernment changes, a new county borough of Warley had been created with an electorate that was sufficient for two seats. Our provisional recommendations provided for an eastern and a western constituency in thisborough. The electorates of Stourbridge and Halesowen were not big enough to enable each borough to &apos;(stand as a separate constituency and we proposed that they should be combined in a single borough consti-   ^tuency. We proposed that the rest of the county should be divided into four constituencies on a basis of lo-minimum disturbance, the constituencies merely being brought into line with altered local government ^boundaries. We recognised that this left the Bromsgrove CC. with over 70,000 electors but there were ^
insufficient electors for two seats. Moreover, the neighbouring Kidderminster, South Worcestershire andWorcester constituencies all had electorates close to the quota and there was no pressing reason to disturbthem. Our provisional recommendations were:  1965 ElectorateBromsgrove CC.......             - 71&apos;837Kidderminster CC........ 61,624South Worcestershire CC....... 60,626r,                    Halesowen and Stourbridge BC...... 69,067Warley East BC......... 59/95Warley West BC......... 58&apos;356Worcester BC.      .      .There were no objections to the boundaries in our recommendations but we received alternative proposalsfor the names of the Bromsgrove CC. and the Halesowen and Stourbridge B.C. We arranged for these representations to be considered at the local inquiry into our Warwickshire proposals. The assistant Com-missioner reported a preponderance of opinion against giving Halesowen and Stourbridge the name NorthWorcestershire but he recommended the re-naming of Bromsgrove as Bromsgrove and Redditch. we accepted the assistant Commissioners findings and published a revised recommendation for the name of theBromsgrove and Redditch CC. We received no further representations.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified by the revised recommen-dation for the name of the Bromsgrove and Redditch CC.YORKSHIRE, EAST RIDINGThe 1965 electorate (359,812) entitled the East Riding to its existing allocation of six seats. In general theelectorates of the constituencies were of reasonable size and we saw no reason to propose changes except inKingston upon Hull, where we proposed a redistribution of wards which would not only reduce the existingdisparity in the size of electorates but would also utilise the natural boundary of the river. We were aware of proposals for an extension of Kingston upon Hull C.B. but we decided to proceed with our provisional recommendations for the whole of the county: the proposed extensions to Kingston upon Hull could betaken into account when they had been approved by Parliament. Our provisional recommendations were:  Bridlington CC.Haltemprice CC.Howden CC. .Kingston upon Hull East B.C.Kingston upon Hull North B.CKingston upon Hull West BC.1965 Electorate55,97560,48648,56667,15465,08162,550We received representations about our recommendations for Kingston upon Hull but deferred further action until the extension of the county borough had been implemented by The Kingston upon Hull OrderI, when we published revised proposals based on the new local government and ward boundaries. we also modified the boundary of the Howden CC. to conform with an alteration in local government boundariesunder The York Order 1967 which had transferred part of Derwent R.D. to York C.B., involving 1,141electors and producing a 1965 electorate for the county area of 358,671. Our revised recommendations were:  Bridlington CC.Haltemprice CC.Howden CC.....Kingston upon Hull Central B.C.Kingston upon Hull East B.C. .Kingston upon Hull West B.C.1965 Electorate55,64960,34147,42566,09167,62561,540Representations were made and an inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner reported that there waswily one counter-proposal, involving the division of the combined area of Haltemprice U.D. and Kingstonupon Hull CB. into four constituencies. He saw no grounds for the departure from the Rules which thisonld entail, and he recommended the rejection of the proposal. We accepted the assistant Commissionersidvice.We recommend the adoption of our revised recommendations.YORKSHIRE, NORTH RIDINGThe 1965 electorate (445,890) entitled the North Riding, including the new county borough of Teesside,to7.59 seats, as compared with the existing six seats. Teesside CB. was entitled to four seats and we proposedH allocation accordingly. We suggested that so far as possible the boundaries of the proposed Teessidetrough constituencies should follow the existing parliamentary boundaries. In the case of the proposed
Teesside, Stockton B.C. we recommended that the natural boundary of the river should be used notwith-standing the resultant disparity in electorates. We recommended that the administrative county should be divided into four county constituencies. The electorate of each of these constituencies would be below the electoral quota but it was our provisional view that it would be unreasonable to propose the division of this large rural area into three constituencies with electorates averaging 67,500 each. Our provisional recom-mendations for eight seats were: 1965 ElectorateCleveland and Whitby CC....... 47,177Richmond (Yorks) CC. .      .      .      .      -      -      - 48,608Scarborough CC......... 50,922Thirsk and Malton CC........ 56,672Teesside, Middlesbrough B.C....... 56,555Teesside, Redcar B.C........ 51,621Teesside, Stockton B.C........ 74,947Teesside, Thornaby B.C...... 59,388We received representations about the boundaries proposed for the Teesside constituencies, and a local inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner reported that he did not consider there was a sufficient case for adopting alternative proposals for Teesside which would have involved the transfer of Gresham wardfrom the Teesside, Thornaby B.C. to the Teesside, Middlesbrough B.C. in exchange for Marton ward. Sug-suggestions had been made that the Teesside, Redcar B.C. should be named Teesside East or Teesside, EstonandRedcar, but the assistant Commissioner recommended no alteration of the name we had proposed.Later we published a revised recommendation modifying the boundary of the Thirsk and Malton CC.(54,974 electors) to conform with an alteration in local government boundaries under The York Order 1967which had transferred z part of Flaxton R.D. to York CB, involving 1,698 electors and producing a 1965electorate for the county area of 444,192 (entitlement 7.56). No representations were received against thisrevised recommendation.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations as modified in respect of the Thirskand Malton constituency.YORKSHIRE, WEST RIDINGThe 1965 electorate (2,523,733) entitled the county to 43 seats compared with the existing 44. None of theexisting constituencies appeared unreasonably large or small in electorate except for Leeds South East B.C.(36,184). It was our provisional view that, as in the case of Lancashire, it would be better to leave the countywith one seat more than its theoretical entitlement rather than propose a radical re-drawing of constituency boundaries in advance of any changes resulting from the Royal Commission^ review of local government inEngland. We therefore recommended no change other than a re-arrangement of boundaries in Leeds toreduce the disparities in the electorates and some minor consequential changes arising from local governmentboundary alterations, notably the extension of Sheffield. We were aware of proposals for an extension of the boundaries of the York CB. which would affect our provisional recommendations.

Other rep-resentations were considered at a local inquiry. The assistant Commissioner reported as follows: SheffieldHe considered that our proposals for the division of Sheffield were preferable to alternative proposalswhich were based on the transfer of Dore ward from Hallam B.C. to Heeley B.C.: to transfer the ward as suggested would involve consequential alterations to other proposed constituencies.Pontefract and CastlefordThere were representations that the Pontefract B.C. should be re-named Castleford B.C. The assistant commissioner recommended that, as Castleford was the largest borough in the constituency, the constituencyshould be re-named Castleford and Pontefract.We accepted the assistant Commissioners advice and published a revised recommendation accordingly.We also published a revised recommendation for York B.C. to take account of The York Order 1967 and tobring the proposed constituency boundary into line with the extension made to York C.B. The effect was totransfer 2,839 electors to York B.C. (74,324 electors) from Howden CC. in the East Riding and from Thirskand Malton CC. in the North Riding, producing a 1965 electorate for the county area of 2,526,572.Following the making of The City of Bradford (Wards) Order 1967 and The City of Leeds (Wards) Order1968 we published revised recommendations for constituencies based on the new ward boundaries. our proposals were for the retention of six seats in Leeds, but in the combined area of Bradford C.B. and Queens-bury and Shelf U.D, which had an electorate of 202,098 and four existing seats, we proposed an allocation ofthree seats. This would give the county its proper entitlement of 43 seats. (Our reasons for proposing this reduction are set out in paragraph 49.)BradfordNo representations were received against our proposals for Leeds but representations were made against our proposal to reduce the number of seats in the combined area of Bradford and Queensbury and Shelfand a local inquiry was held. The assistant Commissioner was impressed by arguments that a reduction in theCity&apos;s parliamentary representation would diminish its prestige at a crucial stage of its redevelopment, but henoted that the continued reduction in the electorate of the area (197,991 in 1968) made it difficult to justifytie continuance of four constituencies, and that there did not appear to be any other area in the West Ridingwhere a reduction could be made if the county was to have its proper entitlement. It was also argued at the inquiry that account should be taken of the large number of immigrants in the area who were not on the electoral register. We concluded that, although we had provisionally decided to leave the county with oneseat more than its, theoretical entitlement, in view of the continued reduction in that entitlement (42.59 in1968) and of the number of seats we had allocated to other areas with a comparable electorate we would not justified in allocating more than three seats to the Bradford area. We did not consider, for the reasons give in paragraph 41, that we could take account of the number of unregistered immigrants. Accordingly,we decided to adhere to our revised recommendations for the area.Representations were also received against the proposed order of names in the Castleford and Pontefractconstituency, and there was a request for the inclusion of the name of Featherstone in the name of the con-stituency. We thought it would be undesirable to lengthen the name by the inclusion of the name of an urban
district, but we decided that as the constituency had long been known by the name Pontefract, it should nowbe named the Pontefract and Castleford B.C. We published a modified recommendation accordingly.Representations were received against this proposal, but we decided to adhere to our modified recommenda-tion.We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations, as amended by the various revised andmodified recommendations, as follows: 1965 ElectorateBarkston Ash CC........ 60,891Colne Valley CC......... 52,616Dearne Valley CC.        .      .      .      .      .      .      . 59,446Don Valley CC.    ........ 75,151Goole CC.......... 55,234Harrogate CC.......... 55,941HemsworthCC......             .      . 64,959Normanton CC.    .      .      .             .             .      . 51,611Penistone CC......... 55,577RiponCC.......... 42,123Rother Valley CC......... 75,540Shipley CC.......... 46,250Skipton CC.......... 47,972Sowerby CC......... 49,726Barnsley BC.......... 70,239Batley and Morley B.C........ 56,954Bradford North BC........ 72,534Bradford South BC........ 65,736Bradford West B.C........ 63,828Brighouse and Spenborough B.C...... 55,924Dewsbury B.C......... 55,492Doncaster B.C......... 57,076Halifax BC.......... 63,983Huddersfield East B.C........ 51,161Huddersfield West B.C.   ....... 50,391Keighley B.C......... 48,440Leeds East B.C......... 55,495Leeds North East B.C........ 53,451Leeds North West B.C........ 55,731Leeds South BC......... 58,613Leeds South East BC........ 60,188Leeds West B.C......... 59,831Pontefract and Castleford BC...... 55,009Pudsey BC.......... 55,633Rotherham BC......... 57,805Sheffield, Attercliffe BC....... 67,900Sheffield, Brightside B.C........ 55,657Sheffield, Hallam B.C........ 67,017Sheffield, Heeley BC........ 60,597Sheffield, Hillsborough B.C....... 60,114Sheffield, Park BC........ 63,397WakefieldB.C......- 61,015York BC.......... 74,324
THE EFFECT OF THE recommendations the Total Number of Seatsh We began our review with the object of avoiding, as far as possible, any increase in the existing total of511 seats (paragraph 44). In the event, circumstances have compelled us to recommend the creation of afurther 5 seats, making a total of 516 English seats. However, the provisions of section 2(2) of the 1958Act seem to us to permit some latitude in applying the Rules, including Rule 1, when changes of parliamentaryboundaries would be inconvenient or would break local ties.67, Under Rule 1, the Scottish Commission must aim at &quot;not less than 71&quot;, the Welsh Commission at&quot;not less than 35&quot;, but we must aim at the residue of Great Britain&apos;s allocation of &quot;not substantially greater or less than 613&quot; after Scotland and Wales have taken at least 106 seats. So, as the Rules stand, it is open tothe Scottish and Welsh Commissions to recommend additional seats, but every additional seat they recom-mend must reduce the English target. In theory, then, we cannot know our target until the Scottish and welsh Commissions have made their recommendations, but in practice we knew at the start of our reviewthat our target should be &quot;not substantially greater or less than&quot; 506.(8. At future reviews the question of the permissible total number of English seats may raise even more serious problems than it has in this review. 506 seats is one target at which we must aim. The other targetis the electoral quota. If the electorate was divided by 506, then the targets would coincide. But in order todetermine the electoral quota for England we are directed to divide the English electorate not by 506 but by thelumber of seats in existence at the time of the commencement of the review. This was 511 and if our recom-mendations are accepted it will be 516 at the time of the next general review. Thus the targets drift further and further apart. Success at aiming at one is less and less compatible with getting near the other. For example,with a 1965 electorate of 30,025,849 the quota to be applied to arrive at a total of 506 seats would be 59,340;the quota we used, based on 511 seats, was 58,759; calculated on a basis of 516 seats, the quota would be58,190. This, combined with the natural reluctance to concede a reduction in seats (especially in the light ofsection 2(2) of the 1958 Act) as opposed to the comparative ease of creating new seats, means that, under thepresent Rules, there is a built-in tendency for the number of English constituencies to increase.iwidance of Major Changes69. It was our aim to avoid so far as possible proposals that would change constituency boundaries forthe sake of adjustments in the size of the electorates (paragraph 28). In the Schedule of Recommendations(Appendix C) we have set out against each constituency the nature of the changes we propose. Of the 511existing constituencies, we have recommended major changes in 271 (53 %); in 75 constituencies (15 %) onlyminor changes are recommended to take account of local government boundary changes; in 165 constituencies-cies (32%) we have recommended no changes in the existing boundaries.She of Electorates70. We had decided to apply limits of 40,000 and 80,000 electorates for our recommended constituencies,whilst concentrating on producing electorates between 50,000 and 70,000 (paragraph 32). Table 4 compareshe electoral size of existing constituencies when we started our review with the size of our recommendedconstituencies.

Our proposals eliminate the five very small existing constituencies with electorates of lessthan 35,000 and 21 large constituencies with electorates of more than 80,000. The smallest constituencywe propose is Thanet West (38,727), the largest is Wallsend (79,665).71. We have been aware of the continuing growth of the English electorate which is now reflecting post-warbirth rates. On the basis of expected population increases alone, and without taking account of any reductionin the voting age, the English electoral quota in 1981 may be some 6,000 more than in 1965, with the im-plication that the acceptable range of constituency electorates would be from 45,000 to 85,000, comparedwith the 40,000 to 80,000 which we have adopted. Seats with over 70,000 electors would become more usualthan they are in our present recommendations; similarly, seats which now have about 40,000 electors but which do not keep pace with the growth in national electorate would be in jeopardy.Urban and Rural Electorates72. We had decided that there was no obvious case for deliberately seeking to create constituencies withsmaller electorates in the rural areas (paragraph 37). Although borough and county constituencies do not represent an exact division into urban and rural constituencies, the figures in Table 5 give a general impression of the differing sizes of such constituencies over the past 15 years.Table 5Average Electorates in Borough and County Constituencies 1953-1968	1953 (2)	Existing Constituencies			Recommended Constituencies	(1)		1955 (3)	1965 (4)	1968 (5)	1965 (6)	1968 (7)Borough Constituencies County Constituencies	57,883 56,093	58,201 54,952	56,208 62,081	55,314 65,698	58,824 57,283	58,500 60,315Difference (Borough-County)	4-1,790	-f 3,249	-5,873	-10,384	4-1,541	-1,815
These figures indicate that any deliberate attempt to differentiate between urban and rural constituenciesmight soon be nullified by the movement of population. Our proposals, based on the 1965 electorate, hadthe effect of giving the advantage of smaller electorates to the rural areas, but by 1968 the advantage lay with the urban areas.73. It is not for us to make recommendations for the purpose of resolving the problems which we have mentioned in this Chapter. We have however thought it proper to draw attention to them in this report,so that Parliament might be aware of the Commission^ increasing difficulty in applying the total number of seats rule, and also of the implications of the expected growth in electorate.74. We record with very deep regret the death of one of our Joint Secretaries, Mr. John Murray, on 13th May1968. Not only did we find his assistance, advice and guidance of the greatest value during the general review,but at our suggestion he prepared a running draft for this Report, using our current comments as we arrivedat our provisional decisions. This has made it possible for the draft to grow, expand and ripen into thisReport in the year of 1969 when he was no longer with us.75. During the whole period we have had the benefit of Mr. Eddy&apos;s assistance; we appreciate the tremendoushelp that this has been to us and we are most grateful to him and also to Mr. Jeffery, who took over from thelate Mr. Murray in June of 1968, for all that they have done.76. We also record our gratitude to our Assessors, the Registrar General and the Director General, for all their advisory work and to Miss Tyler and the other staff of the Commission in respect of the preparation ofthe material involving every constituency and the wards and districts therein. This material was requirednot only for our own use but also for the numerous publications that were required and for the public localinquiries.77. The Chairman of the Commission is the Speaker of the House of Commons. For previous generalreviews, he nominated one of the members of the Commission to be Deputy Chairman, but since 1958 theI Deputy Chairman of the Commission has been a Judge of the High Court appointed by the Lord Chancellorunder the provisions of section 1(1) of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958. All theCommission^ meetings have been presided over by the Deputy Chairman, but throughout this general review Mr. Speaker has been kept informed of the progress of the review.Gerald Thesiger, Deputy ChairmanG.

Some minor alterations of constituency boundaries in Wales as established by the Representationof the People Act, 1948, were made by an Order in Council (Statutory Instrument 1951 No. 1390)following recommendations in a report of the Commission under section 2(3) of the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949. Constituency boundaries have since been altered by the Orders in Council listed in Appendix B to this report following the recommendations ofthe Commission in the first periodical report in November 1954 (Cmd. 9313). As we have not found it necessary to submit any reports under section 2(3) of the 1949 Act since then, the boundariesrecommended by the Commission in 1954 have remained unchanged.3. This is the second periodical report for the whole of Wales. Details of the contents of the 36constituencies we recommend are given in Appendix C. Appendices D and E give the numbers ofparliamentary electors in existing constituencies and in local authority areas respectively. A note on the map which accompanies this report forms Appendix F.Timing of the General Review4. Since the first periodical report had been submitted to the Home Secretary in November 1954,we were obliged to submit the second periodical report for Wales at some date between November1964 and November 1969. It was for us to decide exactly when to make our report but we agreedthat it would be convenient if we could report, as in 1954, at about the same time as the otherCommissions.5. Towards the end of 1964 we were approached by the English Commission who indicated that,subject to the views of the other Commissions, they wished to begin their general review in the spring of 1965. Although there appeared to be no need for us to begin work so early as the EnglishCommission, since we had to review far fewer seats, we agreed to fit in with their timetable. Allfour Commissions announced their intentions on 16th February 1965 and the Home Secretaryinformed the House of Commons of this in a written answer to a Parliamentary Question on18th February. The statutory notice of the Commission^ intention was published in the LondonGazette on 19th February 1965.6. By the Spring of 1966 the English Commission had made substantial progress and as we expectedthat the new procedures introduced by the 1958 Act would entail more work than the last reviewwe decided to publish our provisional recommendations for Wales as early as possible in 1967.A review of Welsh local government was in hand but it seemed unlikely that any alteration of localgovernment boundaries as a result of this review would be implemented before we were due to submitour report. However, an Order extending the boundaries of the county borough of Newport came into operation in February 1966 and another extending the City of Cardiff in October 1966. Theseextensions were reflected in our provisional recommendations for the whole of Wales which were published in March 1967.
Procedure of the Commission7. We have held 6 meetings since notice was given of the general review. The General RegisterOffice provided us with particulars of the electorate of each administrative area as at 15th February1965; the Ordnance Survey prepared maps showing the administrative areas of Wales; and the welsh Office provided an assessment of developments that might affect the future size of electorates.On the basis of this information we formed our provisional recommendations and published themlocally.8. We decided against inviting suggestions from outside bodies before making our provisional recommendations since we considered it was better that we should take the initiative from ourposition of neutrality, using such facts and figures as were available to us. We also decided notto pay regard to any unsolicited suggestions that might be sent to us as this might have given theirauthors an unfair advantage over people who had not written to us.9. Our provisional recommendations were advertised in newspapers circulating locally, includingWelsh language newspapers. In all, some 53 notices were published representing a more generouscoverage than the strict requirements of the Acts. We also issued a general press notice giving a brief account of the effect of our proposals. Where our provisional recommendations involvedchanges we arranged for a copy of the recommendations, together with a map, to be made availablefor inspection by the public at a local authority office or other suitable place within the constituency.The addresses of the offices at which inspection could be made were included in the press advertise-ments. We are once again indebted to local authorities and others for their ready co-operation inmaking these arrangements. Our recommendations were published in both Welsh and Englishexcept in Monmouthshire, where they were published only in English.Local Inquiry10. The notices advertising our proposals included a statement that any representations relatingto the proposals should be addressed to us, in accordance with the statutory provisions, within one month of the date of publication. Under the 1958 Act we were obliged to hold local inquirieswhere objections were lodged by a body of one hundred or more parliamentary electors affectedby the recommendations or by an interested local authority. As a result of representations made against our provisional recommendations we decided that a local inquiry should be held inGlamorgan.11. In accordance with the Act of 1949 we requested the Home Secretary to appoint an assistant commissioner to hold the inquiry. Mr. Breuan Rees, Barrister-at-Law, was appointed but owingto his sudden death in August 1967 it became necessary for the Home Secretary to appoint Mr.Hugh Eifion Pritchard Roberts, Barrister-at-Law, in his place. We are grateful to Mr. Robertsfor his reports which proved valuable in helping us reach our conclusions.12. Notices advertising the holding of the local inquiry were published in the same way as thenotices advertising our provisional recommendations. Copies of representations addressed to uswere placed on deposit for public inspection at addresses listed in the notices. Copies of representa-tions were also sent to interested bodies of electors and local authorities. After considering Mr.Roberts&apos; report we decided to revise our recommendations and in accordance with the 1958 Actwe published our revised recommendations in exactly the same way as the provisional recommenda-tions. Copies of the report were placed on public deposit with the revised recommendations anda map.13. Representations were received against our revised recommendations, so we decided to re-open the inquiry. After studying Mr. Roberts&apos; report on this, we decided to make another amendment to our proposals, and we published modified recommendations accordingly. These too were thesubject of representations, but we decided that a further inquiry was not justified.Discussions with Political Parties14. It appeared from the Second Reading Debates on the 1958 Redistribution Bill (House ofCommons Official Report, 11th February 1958) that the parties were in favour of the suggestion of the 1942 Committee on Electoral Machinery (Cmd. 6408) that the Commission should sit under its Deputy Chairman &quot;to hear any representations from the Chief or National Officers of the
principal Party organisations with respect to the provisional proposals&quot;. We decided that we should meet the representatives of the political parties contesting Parliamentary elections in Wales and wehad helpful discussions with them at meetings in July 1966 and June 1967.Rules for Redistribution of Seats15. The Rules require that the number of constituencies in Wales shall be not less than 35 (atpresent there are 36); that so far as practicable without causing excessive disparity between electorates,each county and county borough shall have separate representation and shall not share a con-stituency with another county or county borough; and no non-county borough or urban or rural district shall be included partly in one constituency and partly in another. Subject to these requirements, the electorates of constituencies shall be as nearly equal as practicable but a departure from these rules is permissible if special geographical considerations make it desirable.16. We have been given further guidance by Parliament in section 2(2) of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958: &quot;It shall not be the duty of a Boundary Commission, in discharging their functions under thesaid section two (of the 1949 Act), to aim at giving full effect in all circumstances to the rulesset out in the Second Schedule to the principal Act, but they shall take account, so far asthey reasonably can, of the inconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies otherthan alterations made for the purposes of rule 4 of those rules, and of any local ties whichwould be broken by such alterations; and references in that section to giving effect to thoserules shall be construed accordingly.&quot;The purpose of this provision, as explained by the Home Secretary to the House of commons on the Second Reading of the Redistribution Bill in 1958, was to bring in &quot;a presumption againstmaking changes unless there is a very strong case for them&quot;; and there was evidence in the debate that members felt that local ties were often of greater importance than mathematical equalities:We considered that in applying the Rules we should do our best to avoid departing from localgovernment boundaries and from breaking local ties, and that we should recommend changes only where there was good reason for them. Above all, we should refrain from recommending changessimply to make small adjustments in the size of electorates.Total number of seats17. Wales, as we have mentioned, has one seat above the minimum of 35 provided by the Rules.This additional seat was allocated following the Commission^ recommendations in their initialreport in 1947. Our predecessors in 1954 concluded that &quot;while no increase in the presentrepresentation was necessary, no substantial change had occurred since the last review which would afford justification for recommending a reduction of seats&quot;.18. In order to achieve reasonable equality of constituency electorates we are required under theRules to make the electorate of each constituency as near as practicable to the &quot;electoral quota&quot;,i.e. the total parliamentary electorate on the electoral register in force at the time of the announce-ment of the Commission^ intention to make a general review (1,813,203 in 1965) divided by thetotal number of existing seats (36). This gave an electoral quota of 50,367 for Wales for this general review. We noted that had we been required to calculate the quota by reference to the statutoryminimum of 35 seats, the quota would have increased to 51,806.19. The total electorate of Wales had fallen from 1,814,300 in 1954 to 1,813,203 in 1965. TheEnglish electorate, on the other hand, had increased from 28,923,119 in 1954, to 30,025,849 in 1965.In the light of these figures we considered that, while it might prove impossible to produce an acceptable scheme for the elimination of one Welsh seat, there was certainly no case for a further increase in the total number of seats.Allocation of Seats20. At the outset of our review we calculated theoretical entitlements for each Welsh county and Mormiouthshire both on the existing basis of 36 seats and on the basis of the statutory minimumQf 35 seats. The table on page 6 shows our calculations.

While these calculations of entitlement served as one of our main guides, we recognised that other factors had to be taken into account in determining the number of seats to be allocated toa particular county. There was moreover the possibility of further changes in the pattern of localgovernment in Wales. Although any changes resulting from the review of Welsh local governmentcould not be taken into account in our own general review, there might well be changes within afew years of the submission of our report. We therefore concluded that we should disturb existingconstituency boundaries as little as possible. On the other hand, bearing in mind the provisions ofthe Rules, we considered it to be our duty to remove any divergences between parliamentaryboundaries and local government boundaries which had already been caused by the alteration oflocal government boundaries. This consideration applied mainly in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.Unchanged constituencies22. We saw no reason to propose changes in the boundaries of the fourteen existing constituencies inthe counties of Anglesey, Brecknockshire and Radnorshire, Caernarvonshire, Cardiganshire, Carmarthen-shire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Merioneth, Montgomeryshire, and Pembrokeshire. With the exceptionof Merioneth and Montgomeryshire, the allocation of seats in all these counties was not seriouslyout of line with the theoretical entitlement shown in paragraph 20 nor did any of the constituenciesappear to us to have electorates that were exceptionally large or small. As regards Merioneth andMontgomeryshire, the numerical over-representation of these counties had been accepted by theCommission in their initial report in 1947 and endorsed by our predecessors in the 1954 general review report. We agreed that there were special considerations which justified separate representation for these counties. In any case we did not consider that proposals for the merger of Merioneth andMontgomeryshire for parliamentary purposes could be entertained while a review of local govern-ment was in progress.23. Accordingly we published provisional recommendations for no alteration of constituency boundaries in these eleven counties. In Carmarthenshire we proposed in addition that the spellingof the Llanelly CC. should be altered to Llanelli, in accordance with the change approved for localgovernment purposes by the Secretary of State for Wales.24. We received one representation about the southern areas of Brecon and Radnor C.C., butthis was later withdrawn. We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations forthese eleven counties.Monmouthshire25. The 1965 electorate of Monmouthshire (300,672) entitled the geographical county to theexisting six constituencies. The enlarged county borough of Newport with 72,798 electors was notbig enough to make two constituencies and we proposed that the boundaries of the existing NewportB.C. should be extended to conform with the altered boundary of the county borough. We examined the possible alternative of making radical alterations of constituency boundaries involving the
association of part of the county borough with the surrounding county districts but we did notconsider that this would be opportune in advance of any further local government changes.Moreover such an arrangement would have been contrary to the requirement in the Rules that sofar as practicable no county or any part of it should be included in a constituency with the wholeor part of a county borough. Our provisional recommendations for Monmouthshire were :--1965 ElectorateAbertillery CC............... 36,894BedwelltyCC.......       ........ 45,130EbbwValeCC............... 37,481Monmouth CC............... 60,361Pontypool CC............... 48,008Newport B.C................. 72,79826. No representations were received. We recommend the adoption of our provisionalrecommendation s.Glamorgan27. Our decision that the total number of seats for Wales should not-be increased left 16 seatsavailable for Glamorgan (1965 electorate 836,413). We concluded, after much deliberation, that wewould not be justified in recommending the continuation of two constituencies in the borough ofRhondda where the total electorate had declined from 76,273 in 1954 to 67,910 in 1965. We therefore proposed that the two Rhondda constituencies should be amalgamated into one borough con-stituency. In making this proposal we took note that the electorate of the proposed constituencywould still be less than that of the proposed Newport B.C. in Monmouthshire. On the other hand,the area covered by the existing Cardiff and Barry constituencies contained 248,211 electors andwas entitled to nearly five constituencies instead of the existing four. We therefore proposed thatthe enlarged City of Cardiff (188,461 electors) should have four constituencies; and that PenarthUrban District should no longer be included in a Cardiff constituency but should be transferredto the Barry county constituency in exchange for the areas added to the City of Cardiff under thelocal government changes. This accorded with the requirements of Rule 4. Our provisional recommendations for Glamorgan were: 1965 ElectorateAberavon CC........... - - 57&apos;360Barry CC................. 59&apos;759CaerphillyCC............... 46,250Gower CC................. 49&apos;6^Neath CC................. 50&apos;327Ogmore CC................. 59&apos;419Pontypridd CC............... 54&apos;644Aberdare B.C. .............. 47&apos;254Cardiff Central B.C............... 46&apos;504Cardiff North B.C........... 47&apos;37*Cardiff South B.C............... 44&apos;79^Cardiff West B.C............... 49&apos;190Merthyr Tydfil B.C............... 40&apos;215Rhondda B.C. .............. 67&apos;9^Swansea East B.C............... 55&apos;3&quot;2Swansea West B.C............... 59&apos;74928. The representations which we received objecting to these provisional recommendations were concerned with the proposed merger of the two Rhondda constituencies, the proposed division ofCardiff C.B., and the boundary between the Barry and Caerphilly CCs. As mentioned in paragraph12, a local inquiry into these representations was held by Mr. Eifion Roberts. In his report he supportedour proposal to amalgamate the two Rhondda constituencies. As regards Cardiff, he reportedthat there was general acceptance of the proposal that Penarth Urban District should no longer be included in a Cardiff constituency, but in view of the expected growth of the electorate in thenorth of Cardiff, he recommended that the Rumney ward should be transferred from the proposedCardiff North B.C. to the proposed Cardiff South B.C. so that from 1970 onwards there would be greater parity between the electorates of these constituencies than there would be under our provisional
recommendations. He also considered that there was a good case for transferring the parish ofVan in the Cardiff Rural District from the proposed Barry C.C. to the Caerphilly C.C. not onlyon geographical grounds but also because the urban growth of the parish had increased its dependence on and its community of interest with Caerphilly. He did not consider, however, that the transferof a further six parishes from Barry C.C. to Caerphilly C.C. would be justified.29. We accepted the recommendations in Mr. Roberts&apos; report and we also considered that thetransfer of the Rumney ward to the proposed Cardiff South B.C. would make it appropriate forthe constituency to retain its present name-Cardiff South East. We published revised recommenda-tions accordingly in July 1968.30. Counter-proposals were put forward by the Cardiff City Council. While they accepted ourrevised recommendations for Cardiff South East B.C. and Cardiff West B.C., they suggested analternative boundary between the two proposed constituencies in the north of the city which wouldhave the effect, inter aha, of including the Whitchurch and Rhiwbina wards in the same constituencyand of avoiding the use of an unnatural boundary referred to as the &quot;Gabalfa finger&quot;. We decidedto re-open the inquiry specifically to consider the City CounciFs scheme. In his report, Mr. Robertsrecommended that the City CounciFs suggestions should be adopted. We accepted his recom-mendations and published modified recommendations accordingly in January 1969.31. A representation was received against our modified recommendations on the ground thatthey did not take account of proposed road developments in Cardiff. We considered, however,that the proposed primary highway network within the City had been fully discussed at the re-openedinquiry.32. Another representation was made which involved the alteration of the boundaries of all thefour constituencies proposed in our modified recommendations. The contents and electorates ofthe constituencies suggested in these representations were as follows:-Wards 1965 ElectorateCentral       ..      ..

Canton        ........      49,335ElyGrangetownLlandaffPlasmawrThe 1965 electorates of these constituencies would be more evenly balanced than those in ourmodified recommendations, but from 1972 onwards it appeared that our modified recommendations would take better account of the contingent development in the north of the City. The representations,like our modified recommendations, met the views which had been expressed at the inquiries thatthe Rhiwbina and Whitchurch wards should be included in the same constituency. But a disadvantage of the proposals in the representation was that the Riverside ward would be separated from therest of the Central constituency by the River Taff: such an arrangement had been the subject ofobjections at the first part of the local inquiry. Another disadvantage was that the &quot;Gabalfa finger&apos;would remain. We did not consider that a further local inquiry would be justified, and after carefulconsideration we concluded that on grounds of community ties and natural boundaries our ownmodified recommendations produced the best boundaries from all the suggestions that had beenmade since we first published our provisional recommendations in March 1967.
33. We recommend the adoption of our provisional recommendations for Glamorgan, as revised and modified, as follows: Aberavon CC.Barry CC.Caerphilly CCGower CC.Neath CC.Ogmore CC.Pontypridd CC.Aberdare B.C.Cardiff North B.CCardiff North West B.CCardiff South East B.CCardiff West B.C.Merthyr Tydfil B.CRhondda B.C.Swansea East B.C.Swansea West B.C.1965 Electorate57,36059,26046,74949,68350,32759,41954,64447,25438,24741,89358,53149,79040,21567,91055,38259,749Final recommendations34. We reviewed all our recommendations for Wales in the light of the 1968 electoral figures whenthey became available, but we found no cause to make any further changes. Our final recommenda-tions are therefore for a total of 36 seats for Wales, as at present.35. We record with very deep regret the death of one of our Joint Secretaries, Mr. John Murray,on 13th May 1968. We found his assistance, advice and guidance of the greatest value during thegeneral review.36. During the whole period we have had the benefit of Mr. Eddy&apos;s assistance; we appreciate the tremendous help that this has been to us and, like the members of the Boundary commission for England, we are most grateful to him and also to Mr. Jeffery, who took over from the late mr.. Murray in June of 1968, for all that they have done.37. We also record our gratitude to our Assessors, the Registrar General and Colonel E. P. J.Williams who has represented the Director General of the Ordnance Survey, for all their advisorywork and to Miss Tyler and the other staff of the Commission in respect of the preparation ofthe material involving every constituency and the wards and districts therein.38. The Chairman of the Commission is the Speaker of the House of Commons. For previousgeneral reviews, he nominated one of the members of the Commission to be Deputy Chairman,but since 1958 the Deputy Chairman of the Commission has been a Judge of the High Courtappointed by the Lord Chancellor under the provisions of section 1(1) of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958. All the Commission^ meetings have been presided over by the deputy Chairman, but throughout this general review Mr. Speaker has been kept informed of theprogress of the review.VINCENT LLOYD-JONES, Deputy ChairmanGWILYM FFRANGCON WILLIAMSJOHN LYON CORBETT-WINDERK.
