/? SECRETITHIC DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;^ GOVERNMENT)bC(69) 53 COPY NO.14th May, 1969CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND; INFORMATION ON POLITICAL and social QUESTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department at the meeting on 7th May (CC(69) 21st Conclusions, Minute 2)I was invited to consider measures that might be taken within myDepartment to provide an intelligence appreciation, including a politicaland social analysis of the situation in Northern Ireland.2.      I have further considered posting a liaison officer in Belfast inorder to be supplied with the kind of information we receive, as a matterof course, from our posts overseas.    I indicated on 7th May that I sawdisadvantages in tiiis course, and on further reflection I still feel that thesame result can better be met by other means, for the time being at anyrate.    If an officer were posted as liaison with the Cabinet Office in that particular part of the United Kingdom, we might lose many of theadvantages of the very close liaison cn Government business that hasbeen established between the Home Office and the Northern IrelandCabinet Office, and would create suspicions in the minds of the NorthernIreland Government.    An alternative would be to post a liaison officer to the staff of the Governor, but this would lead to suspicions that theGovernor was going beyond his constitutional functions, and a liaison officer at Government House wotild be ill placed to supply any valuableinformation tts us.    In general I think we would lose more than we would gain at present by posting a liaison officer, but I shall keep the possibilityunder review.3.       In the meantime, t prefer to develop the existing sources in theHome Office.    We already possess, or can bring to bear, sources ofinformation which should provide us collectively with che information we need as a background to our decisions; and, with the help of the CivilService Department, I have arranged for the immediate establishment ofa new Division to deal exclusively with Northern Ireland affairs.    one section will deal with current intelligence requirements, a second willlook after contingency planning and deal with current operational problems,and a third will deal with day to day work that always arises e.g. on agricultural questions and employment in Government establishments, etc.-1-

secret.      With these resources it will be my object to circulate fairly-frequent summaries of political information;  the first summary will come out this week.    Our discussions on 7th May, however, indicated the necessity for backing information summaries with more permanentmaterial against which the summaries can be read.    To this end, I shallshortly be circulating to my colleagues some printed matter which willgive information about social welfare, education, planning, industry,transport, agriculture, employment, finance and so forth.    In addition,within the next few weeks I would intend to circulate monographs on whatappear to be the more important background questions;  the first of these will deal, as the Cabinet asked, with the question Whether the StormontParliament is genuinely representative of the electorate.    I must,however, make what I feel sure will be a readily understood reservation.We shall fall into ea?ror if we reach a degree of dogmatic certitude aboutpolitical and social attitudes in Northern Ireland, especially as we would never be able to do so about political and social attitudes in Great Britain.L, j. C,Home Office, S.W.1,14th May, 1969
