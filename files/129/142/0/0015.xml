J.Treasury Chambers, S. W.1,10th June, 1969

Ninth Report of the Standing Advl a or;/- C oi:unit tooon the Fay of the Higher Civil: ServiceIntrofluo t i on1.     In our Eighth Report, we made recommendations for the salaries ofAssistant Secretaries and other grades whose pay fell wholly or partiallybetween the maximum of the Assistant Secretary pay-scale and the Under-Secretary rate, together with a small interim increase in the Under-Secretaryrate to permit some immediate casing of the problem of differential&quot;, inother grades immediately below this rate.     We said that in order tc dealwith the problem of adequate differentials in Higher Civil Service pay andfor other reasons, we proposed to embark as soon as possible upon a general review of the pay of&apos; the Higher Civil Service, taking into account thereport which the National Board for Prices and Incomes would be makingon top salaries in the private sector and the nationalised industries..2.     In a letter of 2nd August 1968 conveying the Government1s acceptanceof the recommendations in the Eighth Report, the Prime Minister took note of the Committee&apos;s intention to conduct a general review, taking accountof the report by the National Board for Prices and Incomes.Present Hates of I[jgher Civil. Service salaries3.     The rates of pay for the Higher Civil Service as a whole were lastrevised in September 1965, on the basis of the recommendations in ourSeventh Report.    We then said that, because we had taken special accountof the economic problems confronting the country at the time, we hadmodified the views which we would otherwise have held on the pay of thehigher grades of civil servants.     We believed that our recommendations would establish a pattern of salary relationships which would be workableand tolerable for the time being;   but the rates which we recommended didnot fully reflect our assessment of what would constitute fair and reasonable remuneration for the grades in question,     We said that those concerned ought not to be indefinitely penalised by a decision taken in thelight of a particular economic situation and that wo therefore intended, to review the salaries of those grades earlier than would otherwise be done.-1-

L.     In the event, we have not since, then revised the rate of pay forgrades above the level of Under-Secretary and the Under-Secretary ratehas been altered only by the small amount recommended in the Eighth ..Report as an interim measure.5.     The rates for Assistant Secretaries, and for grades whose pay fallswholly or partially between the Assistant Secretary maximum and the under-Secretary rate, have increased since September 1965 following a survey by the Pay Research Unit for the Administrative and Executiveclasses for the period from 1st January 1968.     Our Eighth Report related to the payment of increases on this account, in two stages, from 1st January 1968 and froin 1st January 1969.6.     Table I, annexed to this report, shows the rates of pay for theAdministrative grades in the Higher Civil Service, as recommended by theRoyal Commission on the Civil Service 1953-55 (the Priestley Commission)and since that date.     In considering differentials in the Higher CivilService, it must be borne in mind that there are grades in other Classeswhich overlap or fall between the Administrative grades and thatdifferentials in other Classes are often significantly less than those shown in the table.Basis for Fixing Higher Civil Service Salaries7.    The principle of &quot;fair comparison&quot; was recommended by the PriestleyCommission as the basis for determining Civil Service pay generally, andwas accepted by the Government at that time.    More recently, the argumenthas been advanced &quot;that broad comparability is ..... a contributory cause&quot;of inflation and that there should be an &quot;attempt to break the endlesschain of increases because others have had increases&quot;*   (Paragraphs 37 and38 of the Report No.98 by-the National Board for Prices and Incomes.)

It accordingly seems worth recalling what the Priestley Commission said on this subject in their report -&quot;97. &quot;Pair comparison&apos; as the primary principle is fair to thecommunity at large for two reasons.     First, it looks after theordinary citizen&apos;s interest as a taxpayer.     If the Governmentwhich represents him pays what other responsible employers pay foe comparable work, the citisen cannot reasonably complain that he isbeing exploited.     Equally we consider that he would agree that hecould not, in the long run, obtain an efficient service by payingless.98. Secondly, the principle safeguards the Civil Service from political pressures ........99. Wage and salary negotiations today are conducted in a socialframework which, at least by implication, recognises and accepts theexistence of variations in standards of living according to positionin the social hierarchy.     Proposed changes in this structure, thatis to say narrowing or widening of variations in living standards,must raise social and, as we think in the last analysis, political considerations.     Tho question of salary &quot;differentials&quot;, so verymuch before-e the public eye, is an example, since it is directly bound up with the pattern of income distribution, which is essentially apolitical question.    We arc satisfied that it is right and proper,and it is implicit in the principle of fair comparison, that civilservice pay structure should reflect such changes as take place inthe outside world.     If, however, changes were proposed in the CivilService with the intention of giving a lead on such matters to thecountry as a whole in order to- further a political or social objective,civil service pay negotiations would become involved with political issues and the non-political character of the Service might well be impaired.     For the Service to give a lead to the outside world wouldbe incompatible with the principle of fair comparison, and we thereforebelieve that for this reason also the principle, is a vital and effective safeguard, of a non-political Civil Service.&quot;8.     The report of the Committee on the Civil Service 1966-60 (the FultonCommittee) made one comment on the pay implications of their proposedstructure -&quot;The proposal does not in our view imply a departure from the principleof &apos;fair comparison with the current remuneration of outside staffs. employed on broadly comparable work&apos; which was established by the..Royal Commission on the Civil Service 1953-1955.     In our view this principle remains valid and will continue to be necessary to theefficiency as well as to the contentment of the Service.     jJut if our recommendations for a unified grading structure are accepted, we should expect the outside comparison to be made as part of the process of job evaluation:   assessing the importance of the job to the work of theService and establishing the rate for jobs of similar responsibilityoutside the Service.&quot;-3-

9.     In our own studies of pay rates for the Higher Civil Service in thecurrent general review, we have not relied upon a generalised comparisonor an automatic formula but have made specific evaluations of the ratesbeing paid for jobs of recognisably similar character and at similar levels of responsibility.    We have accordingly followed the line recommended bythe Fulton Committee as the new method of applying the continuing principleof fair comparison.10.   In addition, we have considered the structure of the Civil Service asa group of major organisational units in which the differentials for separate grades should provide, at the higher levels as well as below,adequate opportunity to reward performance and encourage ambition.     Theseare needed by any organisation of the size of a Government Department.We have recognised however that there are other rewards than pay in theHigher Civil Service, such as a proper pride in the significance of thework done and the extent of its consequences, and the prestige whichattaches to the most senior positions in the Civil Service.Method of Standing Advisory Committee&apos;s Review11,   In making our review, we have had available to us the information on top salaries in industry and commerce contained in the report by theHational Board for Prices and Incomes Ho.107, and we have supplementedthis by further enquiries of our own.     The Civil Service Department gave us information about rates of recruitment and retirement, differentialsamong grades in the Higher Civil Service and the special arrangements for settling the pay of recruits brought in at the Higher Civil Service levelin the course of the last few years, as well as on other aspects ofCivil Service conditions.12, &apos;We have also had informal discussions with a number of well-informedprople who have a special knowledge of the workings of the Higher CivilService and of the higher levels of management in industry and commerce;these included the Chairman of the National Board for Prices and Incomes.-4-

13.   At our request, the Civil Service Department commissioned aspecial study by a management consultancy to show the relative levels of responsibility in a number of the different grades of the higher civil Service as compared with the current levels of pay for thosegrades.    The management consultancy was sone of those employed by theNational Board for Prices and Incomes in its survey of top salaries in industry, and the job evaluation system used has been employed in studies of a wide variety of firms in British industry.Conclusions on Present Pay14.   We have formed conclusions about present levels of pay in the higher civil Service by comparison with industry and commerce in this countrybut have not made direct comparisons with pay for what might be consideredsimilar jobs in other sectors, for example the universities.   We considerthat the activities of the Civil Service at the higher level and themeasurement of performance against standards generally recognised can bemore realistically compared with industry and commerce than with academiclife.    The preference which we are giving, in this comparison, to thehigher levels of industry and commerce accords with the line adopted bythe Priestley Commission (see paragraphs 364-366 of their Report).   Forthe purpose of our comparison, we have concluded on the basis of advice from several quarters that other elements of remuneration and conditionsof employment (such as superannuation charges and benefits, hours of work,leave entitlements and other fringe benefits) are, taken together,approximately equal as between the Higher Civil Service on the one handand industry and commerce on the other;   so that a fair comparison can bemade in terras of salaries alone.     On this basis we find that in general in the Higher Civil Service the pay at Assistant Secretary level comparesadequately with work of similar responsibility elsewhere, but that above that level the differentials fall short of recognising the greaterresponsibility assumed and at Permanent Secretary level the pay, considered in terms of the responsibility exercised, is seriously out of line withprevailing salaries in industry and commerce.     This comparison is not limited to the highest paid or the largest companies in British industry but applies to a variety of organisations of different sizes.-5-CONFIDENTIAL

Likely Changes in the Structure of the Higher Civil ..Service15.   In undertaking our review we have had in mind the changes which may occur in the structure of the Higher Civil Service as a result of theHecommendations of the Committee on the Civil Service headed by Lord Fultonwhich reported in 1968.    For our purposes the most significant recommendationhas been that on the creation of a unified grading structure for all thevarious Civil Service classes.16.   The Civil Service Department have given us information about thepossible effects of this change upon the sector of -the Civil service with which we are concerned.    The present pattern is that theAdministrative Class from Under-Secretary upwards consists of threegrades, with a number of posts in the professional grades at the samesalary levels but many at a wide variety of intermediate flat rates.We have however been told that the intention in future is to do away withthe large number of intermediate rates.    Although final decisions will depend upon the outcome of detailed studies yet to be undertaken, it isalmost certain that the number of grades in the new structure will be fewand that three of them will correspond to the existing administrative class grades of Under-Secretary, Deputy Secretary and Permanent Secretary.These would provide the key points around which any intermediate gradescould readily be fitted and an appropriate rate of pay determined.17.   This information has two important implications for our review.First it means that we can, as in the past, formulate our recommendations in terms of the present main Administrative grades of Under-Secretary,Deputy Secretary and Permanent Secretary.     Secondly it means   that atsome time&apos; soon it will be necessary to determine appropriate levels of pay for the new grades to be created by assimilation of the posts whichcurrently fall at intermediate levels.     This in turn has certainimplications for the differentials between the present main Administrativegrades, which if the operation of inserting the new grades is to be successfully performed must be wide enough to give a reasonable&apos;marginboth above and below them.    We consider later, in paragraphs 29-3.3, theseveral arguments (of which this is one) for increasing pay differentialsin the Higher Civil Service.-6-

18.   The Civil Service Department have also invited us to consider thequestion whether flat salary rates should be laid down for the different levels in the proposed new structure, as is done at present, or whether there should be a salary range for each level,,     The Pulton Committeefavoured the latter alternative, although the majority of the committee did not consider that there was any satisfactory alternative to flat rater;at Permanent Secretary level.    We agree with the Pulton Committee&apos;?preference for ranges, except at Permanent Secretary level, on the emphaticpremise that the new arrangement is to be used solely to relate salary toperformance, and not at all to provide incremental progression.     Atpresent the only way in which exceptionally good performance in theHigher Civil Service can be recognised in a monetary form is throughpromotion.    This is satisfactory as far as it goes, but we think itwould be desirable to add the possibility of relating pay to performanceeven while the individual concerned remains in his existing grade.19.   Our concept of the new arrangement in operation is that an individualwould move within the salary range determined for* a grade or stay at thesame rate, according to his performance, as assessed by his superiors.Even/one on promotion to a grade would normally start at the bottom ofthe range, although the starting point could occasionally be above the bottom when the particular post to which an individual had been appointedinvolved a level, of responsibility markedly higher than most posts withinthe grade.     Only the range, and not the individual salary positionswithin it, would be published;   this would avoid giving rise to invidiouscomparisons (and possibly claims for additional pay) where differentamounts were being paid for work in equivalent posts.20.   Since we have recommended that an individual&apos;s position within the range laid down for his grade should be determined by his superiors, itis clear that a problem arises at Permanent Secretary level.     It seemsto us, unfair to expect either the Minister of the Department or the Headof the Civil Service to take on the burden of assessing a permanent secretary&apos;s performance in relation to that of other Permanent Secretaries.-7-

Ministers do not in general spend long enough in one Department to boable to make such an assessment;   and the Head of the Civil Service cannotbe expected to be sufficiently familiar with the circumstances of every single Department to be able to carry the burden.    We therefore considerthat the pay of Permanent Secretaries should be, as at present, a flat rate of salary,21.   In addition to the question of relating the pay of individualPermanent Secretaries to their performance, we have also considered whether their pay should be varied so as to reflect the importance oftheir particular posts.     At present all Permanent Secretaries receivethe same rate of salary,  6,600, except for the Head of the Civil Service,the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary to the cabinet who have a lead of .K600.     The majority of the Pulton Committee consideredthat all Permanent Secretaries should in future receive the same rate of salary except for the Head of the Civil Service whose lead should be ofthe order of  1,000.22.   Our enquiries on this question have left us in no doubt that thereare considerable variations in the importance of the different permanent secretary posts;   and, like the Royal Commission on the Civil Service(1953-55) we think that there is a case in logic for reflecting thosevariations in the salaries paid.     But we have, like the Royal Commissionand the majority of the Fulton Committee, concluded that this wouldinvolve serious practical difficulties, which would greatly outweighany advantages.     We therefore believe that Permanent Secretaries should,in general, continue to be paid a common flat rate of salary as atpresent.23.   The recommendation of the majority of the Pulton Committee that onlythe head of the Civil Service should in future receive, a lead over otherPermanent Secretaries is still under consideration by the Government.However we see no reason to withdraw the differential from two of thethree existing holders, and we would not quarrel with a Government decisionto extend it to possibly one more post.-8-

Pay rates recommended24.   The present pay of the Assistant Secretary grade results from the findings of the Pay Research Unit on the level of salaries paid foe comparable duties outside the Civil Service as at 1st January 1968.We think that the level i3 about right.    However there will have been some movement in the level of outside salaries since 1st January 1968,and to this extent the pay of the Assistant Secretary.grade can be saidto be out of date.     In this respect the Assistant Secretary grade is inthe same position as the other grades whose pay is based on the findings of pay Research Unit Surveys related to the circumstances of 1st January 1968,and in particular the grade of Principal.     This situation has in the past been dealt with by means of a central pay increase of an amount consistent with the Government1s incomes policy;   and we have been informed that theStaff Side of the National Whitley Council have submitted a claim for a central pay increase.25.   We do not recommend any change in the pay of the Assistant Secretarygrade at present, but consider that if the Government should agree to a central pay increase for other grades which were covered by Pay Research .Unit Surveys related to the circumstances of 1st January 1968, including in particular the grade of Principal, the increase should also apply tothe grade of Assistant Secretary.   - In the circumstances we would thinkit appropriate for this to be done on this occasion without further reference to us.26.   For the grades of Under-Secretary, Deputy Secretary and permanent secretary we recommend the following rates of salary:Under-Secretary  6,750Deputy Secretary  9,000Permanent Secretary  14,000**See also paragraph 27.- -9-

If and when it In decided to introduce ranges of pay for the grader of under-Socretary and Deputy Secretary, we recommend that these rate:.- shouldb*%cor.e \&apos;c.h bace for the ranges j   and tha levels selected reflect theassumption that this will be done.     We expect to be consulted about thncharacter of the proposed range-pay system, as well as the figures to boadopted for the individual ranges.2/.   The differential between the standard Permanent Secretary rate andthe rate for the posts which are singled out should in our view be .21,000.This agrees with the recommendation made by the majority of the PultonCommittee of the appropriate differential for the Head of the Civil Serviceover all other Permanent Secretaries.28.   In the circumstances of this review we would not think it appropriate for any central pay increase which may be agreed within the next 12 monthsf or the grade of Principal- to be extended to the grade of Undersecretaryor,- of course, the grades above, even although we have recommended that itshould be extended to the grado of Assistant Secretary,     The reason forthis difference of treatment is that the rate which we are recommendingfor the grade of Under-Secretary is that which we think appropriate inpresent circumstances, whereas the current rate of pay for the assistant secretary grade is that which was considered appropriate in the light ofevidence relating to the circumstances of 1st Januaxy 1968.Ourmjreaspns29.   The increases which we are recommending are substantial, and it istherefore necessary that we should set out with some care why we consider them justified.30.   As wa have already stated in paragraphs 9 and 10, we have proceededmainly on the basis of specific evaluations of the rates being paid in industrial, commercial and financial concerns for jobs similar in nature and In responsibility.     In doing so, we have recognised that&apos;the highestsalaries paid in. the private sector - and there are numberous post:-, ratedabove  20,000. a year - often reflect considerations which are not-10-

necessarily applicable to the Civil Service.     They may still tend to reflect what was the pattern of differentials in owner-directed businesses, ,when the allocation of profits between dividends and salaries was somewhatarbitrary;   or they may result from the achievement of success in anentrepeneurial capacity.     In many large organisations they may reflect the fact that, more often than in the Higher Civil Service, promotionstend to involve moving house or some other form of dislocation;   whichnecessitates a large rise in gross salary for staff subject to the highestrates of tax if there is to be any net benefit after the expenses of the dislocation have been covered.     Moreover, although the qualities ofintellect and judgement required of, in particular, Permanent Secretariesare at least as high as those expected in the top industrial executives,the final responsibility for the affairs of their Departments, and theconsequences of mistakes, are carried by Ministers.     In dealing with the salaries of Permanent Secretaries we have therefore excluded from ourcomparison many of the salaries in the higher ranges to&quot;which-we have referred.31.   We cannot, however, ignore as a minimum the salaries of those in private industry and commerce who rise in a competitive career structurebased on merit to the most senior positions underneath the Boards of largecompanies.    These men are generally recruited from the same sources asthe Administrative Class of the Civil Service;   and they are the type of people who might in future be interchangeable with a more &quot;open&quot; CivilService at the earlier stages of their careers.     Under any system of&quot;fair comparison&quot; we should find it hard to justify, for example, paying the Secretary to the Cabinet materially less than the Secretary of one ofthe dozen major industrial and commercial groups in this country, or theHead of the Civil Service less than the senior men.in charge of personnelwork in the leading industrial firms or in the major banks.     We believefailure to achieve these minimum standards may lead to a progressivediminution of the appeal of a Civil Service career to the most able individuals;.and that while the effects of this- might not become apparent for a long time,they would, by the time that they became apparent, have gone so deep as to beirreversible except over a period of many years.-11-

32&apos;.   7/e have also taken into account the fact thai where people have been recruited into the Civil Service from commerce and industry to undertaketasks which are considered to correspond to tinder-Secretary or deputy secretary level, it has often been necessary to sv*k,e special salary arrange?ments which have involved their receiving more than the permanent Secretarytheir Department.     ]?or example, in order to recruit certain people for aspecial purpose and for a limited period of time, it has been found necessarto pay salaries at substantially higher rates than would be indicated by tncbroad application of Civil Service grading standards and it has even then been necessary for the permanent employers to pay more than half&apos; of the menadditional amounts of from , 2,000 to  5,000 in order to preserve) the levelof their previous total remuneration.    We do not think it is eitherreasonable or in the public interest that this type of situation should bomultiplied or allowed to persist for long;   and we consider that this point is given added importance by the recommendation of the Pulton Committee thatthere should in future be increased mobility between the Civil Service andother employments,33.   We have already referred in paragraphs 10 and 17 to the need for our recommendations to take account of the changes which are contemplated inthe structure of the Higher Civil Service.     These changes will require asubstantial widening of the present differentials if they are to be carried through satisfactorily.     We think moreover that there would bo good groundsquite apart from the direct evidence of outside comparison;., for asubstantial widening of differentials in any caao.     Table X shows that amarked compression has occurred since the report of the Royal Commission.We do not consider that the additional rewards at present attaching to thehigher posts are sufficient to compensate for the wider responsibilities which their holders carry and the greater demands which arc made upon them,especially when allowance is made for the narrowing of the differentialswhich in practice is produced by the incidence of taxation at these levels.It is relevant in this context that in paragraph 363 of their Report, theRoyal Commission indicated that an early review of the salary rates whichthey recommended fox&quot; the Higher Civil Service might well bo needed.     Thissuggests that they regarded their recommendations in this area as beingpitched on the low side;   and reinforces the case for an improvement now.-12-

Incomes Policy34.   The White Paper on Productivity Prices and Incomes Policy in 1 960 andceiling of 3t por cent per annum &quot;where there is widespread recognition thatthe pay of a certain group of workers has fallen seriously out of lino withthe level of remuneration for similar work and needs in tho national interest to he improved&quot;.    We regard this criterion as fully satisfiedin the case of the Higher Civil Service.     We have found among those withknowledge of the Higher Civil Service and of industry and commerce a recognition that the levels of Higher Civil Service pay have fallen seriouslyout of lino.    We believe that it is in the national interest for this situation to be improved, for the reasons which we have given.     Althoughparagraph 38 of the White Paper lays down that the comparability criterionquoted above must be applied selectively, we have no doubt that its use is justified in this case, particularly since the increases proposed are lessthan could be justified on grounds of comparability,35.   The increases which we have recommended oro those which we consider appropriate in the circumstances of nid-1969 and make no allowance for future developments outside the Civil Service.     Incomes policy aside, therefore,our hopo would be that they should be implemented with as little delay aspossible.    But wo appreciate that the&apos;Governnont nay find it necessary tohavo regard to the coiling and to consider whether ovr recomnendationsshould be implemented by stages.     Since tho grades of Permanent secretary and Deputy Secretary received their   last increase on 1st September 1965. the ceiling for an increase talcing effect on say 1st July 1 969 is 13.4 per cent.Por the Under-Secretary grade it is appropriate to take the sane figure of13.4 per cent but to deduct from this the interim increase of 4.8 per cent which was given last year, making 0.6 per cent.     With the appropriaterounding this would result in tho following figures with effect from 1st July 1969:1969 (Cmnd. 3590) permits increases of amounts within the incomes policyCurrent Rate1!Ceiling&quot; RateUhder-SecrotaryDeputy SecretaryPermanent SecretaryHead of the Civil Service,Permanent Secretary to the treasury and Secretary of the cabinet,5006,3008,6006,0007,1009,0009,20010,400-13-

36.   Paragraph 43 of Grand. 3590 permits exceptions to the coiling when majorreorganisations of wage and salary structures can be justified on productivity and efficiency grounds.     Our recommendations are intended to permit there organisation of the grading structure of the Higher Civil Service and theintroduction of a system of pay ranges, and we consider that this provision is applicable to them.     Indeed, since it is our purpose to adjust the paydifferentials in the Higher Civil Service, it would frustrate the main objectof our recommendations if no more than the normal incomes policy ceiling wereto be paid to the grades in question.     We accordingly recommend that afterpayment of the first stage increases shown in paragraph 35, the balance shouldbe paid in two equal instalments at intervals of one year.     This follows thecourse proposed by the National Board for Prices and -Incomes in somewhat similar circumstances in paragraphs 93 and 94 of Report No. 1 07, and would produce the following pattern:First      Second third stage      Stage StageCurrent 1st July 1st July 1st July	rate	1969	1970	1971	 	 	&amp;	 Under-Secretary	5,500	6,000	6,375	6,750Deputy Secretary	6,300	7,100	0,050	9,000Permanent Secretary	0,600	9,000	11,900	14,000Head of the Civil Service, Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and Secretary to Cabinet	9,200	10,400	12,700	15,00037.   We must emphasise that we recommend this degree of staging with considerable reluctance;    and we hope that if any developments in incomes policy in the course of the nest two years make it possible to contemplate any more rapid implementation of our proposals, the Government will actaccordingly.Summary30.     We regard the salary levels which we have recommended in paragraphs 26and 27 as being justified primarily on the basis of &quot;fair comparison&quot; withoutside&apos; salaries.     However, even taking account of the non-monetary rewardsof a Civil Service career, which are mentioned in paragraph 30, ve-14-

have not followed the full implications of the outside comparisons&apos;.Instead we have recommended salary levels which do no more than achieve the minimum standards of comparability dcr.cri.bed in paragraph 51; theseIsvels are in our judgement also about&apos; the minimum which will avoid therisk in the long terra of unduly reducing the attraction of a Civil Servicecareer to the most able individuals and which will enable the structuralchanges to which we have referred to be carried through in a satisfactorymanner.     If, however, the Government is not able to accept these recommendations in full, we propose in paragraph 36 a method of stagingthe increases.-15-
