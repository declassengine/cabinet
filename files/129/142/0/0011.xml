00C(69) 61 COPY NO.__6th June, 1959CABINETRHODESIANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsThe Ministerial Group on Rhodesia have explored certain proposals for action by Her Majesty13 Government if the referendum in rhodesia on 20th June results, as expected,, in a clear &quot;Yes&quot; vote for a&quot;Republic&quot; and for the Rhodesian Front constitutional proposals.    Forthe information of my colleagues and for their covering approval I attachat Annex A a note of the conclusions we reached.2.      It will be seen that these conclusions do not involve immediate action.    We can only finally determine our policy when the referendumresults are available.    If, contrary to expectations, the regimensproposals were rejected, or if they were only marginally endorsed,there would be a prospect of a change of leadership in Rhodesia and a quite different reaction might bo called for on our part.    In particular,the Governor would almost certainly wish to remain at his post and,while he did, we would probably not wish to withdraw the ResidualMission.3,      My colleagues will be aware that on 31st May the regimepublished a White Paper, giving their summarised version of ourcontacts with them since the Tiger talks.    On 3rd June we publishedour own White Paper which reproduced the exchanges that had takenplace since the Salisbury talks, and set them in their proper context,making clear the vital differences of principle which had led to thefailure of the attempts to reach a settlement.4.      On 10th June I shall be making a public speech on Rhodesia, inwhich I shall re-emphasise that our attitude has been based throughouton the Six Principles, and that it is the regimens refusal to accept these principles which has prevented agreement.1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)

5.      Subject to the agreement of my colleagues, I think that,, in response to the urgent representations of the Governor, I should Include a passage in that speech which, without committing Her Majesty^s Government tosupport of the Centre Party proposals, or to any specific modificationof the Fearless terms, would encourage Mr. Smithes opponents in thecoming referendum and do as much as can be done to help them to reducethe support he receives in it from the electorate.    I attach a draft ofthis proposed pasaage at Annex B0M. S0Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S,W,1.5th June, 196912&quot;

RHODESIA:  POST-REFERENDUMACTIONConclusions reached by Ministerial Group on RhodesiaStatus of Fearless proposals we concluded that the following would be the right line to take inthe event of the expected &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum;&quot;(i) Her Majestyts Government reserve full freedom of action andregard the Fearless proposals as having been rejected by the regime.(ii) Her MajestyT3 Government stand by their principles and willhave no truck with the new constitution.(iii) It will remain British policy to achieve an honourablesettlement when there are people in power in Rhodesia whogenuinely accept our principles.    The Fearless terms wouldthen be available as a point from which discussions could begin.(iv) The need for any settlement to be dependent on &quot;the democraticallyascertained wishes of the people of Rhodesia as a whole&quot; (in the language of the Commonwealth Conference communique) would continue to be overriding&quot;,British policy on n. i.b.m. r. would continue to be based on theCommonwealth Conference Communique.    Although we could not hold out a period of direct British control as the exclusive aim of our Rhodesianpolicy, we might be able to represent it as one possible solution to the rhodesia problem if those in power in Rhodesia should later come toaccept it as the best way out.Position of the Governor after the Referendum2.      In the event of a clear &quot;Yes&quot; vote the Governor is himself likelyto wish to resign.    (He is thinking of making a public statement to this effect before the referendum).    We came to the conclusion thatHer Majesty^s Government should not stand in his way and, in certaincircumstances, might even encourage him to resign.    No successorwould be appointed and the Governorship would be left in abeyance.-3-SEGRJET

Rhodesia House, London^ and the United Kingdom Residual mission in Salisbury3.      If the Governor resigns we believe that it would be right towithdraw the United Kingdom Residual Mission (we could then try to persuade other countries to close their consular missions in Salisbury)and close Rhodesia House.    If te. staff of Rhodesia House - who are notaliens - refuse to co-operate, we may have to consider introducing anOrder in Council under the Southern Rhodesia Act, but this requiresfuither examination.The Royal Connection4.      Some Rhodesian bodies bear the title &quot;Royal&quot; and others enjoyroyal patronage.    We came to the conclusion that no action should betaken until the purported declaration of a &quot;republic&quot; (which we will ofcourse be bound to regard as invalid).    We should then see whether,as might be expected, the regime themselves remove the royal titlefrom the Rhodesian Air Force and the Rhodesia Regiment.    The removalof marks of Royal Favour from bodies and individual serving the regimecould then be considered with the Palace.Rhodesian Public Servants5,      We decided that, in the event of a clear &quot;Yes&quot; vote, a time limit of two to three months should be imposed on the acceptance of freshbeneficiaries into the scheme of assistance for loyal Rhodesiau public servants, and that this should be announced by means of an inspiredParliamentary Question.    In answer to enquiries we should let it be known that we did not consider that public servants need continue to feelthemselves bound by the Governor^ advice to them in 1965 to stay attheir posts.    We also decided that officials should discuss inter-de part men tally how the scheme might best be &quot;wound up&quot; altogether inthe months following the referendum.Sanctions6.      We agreed that there was no practical alternative in theimmediate future to our maintaining existing sanctions and to continuing to support the efforts of the United Nations Sanctions SupervisoryCommittee to enforce these.    If the Afro-Asians put forward new andextreme demands for the extension of sanctions we might have to use the veto.    But the implications of doing so would depend on the particularproposition facing us.

S :.&apos;^&apos;&apos;7Draft: insertion for speech on Rhodesiaby Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&quot;I have seen it suggested that, if Mr. Smith were to secure theresult he v/ants at his referendum on 20th June, he might then makewhat he would call tone last effort to reach a settlement with Britain5,On his own terms, of course,Such an attempt cculd not really be -x starter,    Mr. Smith hasmade unmistakeably clear his complete and deeply-rooted abhorrenceof the principle that, after due preparation over whatever period ofyears proved essential, majority rule should be allowed to come about.In the circumstances which I have just mentioned, the Rhodesianelectorate - it represents of course a tiny minority of the people - wouldhave demonstrated their agreement with Mr, Smith and their determina-tion to screw down the safety valves and to take the risk of the resultingexplosion.    There could be no useful talks on that basis.But there are other possibilities.    There are people In Rhodesiawho have come forward on the political platform in opposition toMr, Smith.    They are taking a very different line from his on theessential need for proper guarantees against the creation of obstacles in the way of the countryfs progress to majority rule.    The people I amspeaking of realise that the future safety and prosperity of PJiodesiadepend on the electorate choosing now to follow a course which will permit the countryrs tremendous potential for material development andharmony betv/een the races to be fully realised.In a v/ord, these people genuinely accept the need for an effective protection against retrogressive changes in the Constitution - the sort ofprotection which we call the second safeguard.    H the referendum on20th June results in the rejection of Mr, Smithes proposals^ and if the others of whom I have spoken can show that they have effective support in Rhodesia, we could certainly have talks with them.    In such talks,dealing as we should be with people who accepted the principles to whichwe adhere, we--should not need to be rigid on details, on form or even -within reason - on timing.    That is the phrase I used in the House ofCommons on 21st May, and I repeat it here today.    What would, ofcourse, always be essential would be to adhere to the Six Principles,including the need to ascertain whether any proposed settlement was infact acceptable tc the people of Rhodesia as a whole&quot;.
