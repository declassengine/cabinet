/ INCREASES IN NATIONAL INSURANCE contributions in summing up the discussion in Cabinet last week, the PrimeMinister said more time was needed to study the details of the proposals about contributions, particularly the burden on the lower-paid.2.     It was proposed in C(69)50 that the employed man&apos;s flat-rate contribution six-aid go up by 1s. 6d. and the graduated contribution on earnings between  18 and  30 per week from iffo to 2j^o,   The paperexplained that the yield of these increased contributions was theminimum needed for the safety of the Fund.The flat-rate contribution3,     At the last twc upratings, in 1965 and 1967? the man&apos;s own flat-rate contribution went up by 2s, at times when earnings were lower thanthey are today,,    The increase was kept down to this level by chargingthe employer more than the employee (jdf/ 3s. 3d- in 1365 and 2s. 3d. in1967)5 but this course has been ruled out on the present occasion.Because of emerging deficits a further 6d., had to be added to the man&apos;national insurance contribution in May 1968 and a further 6d. was addedto the health service contribution,4.     The proposed increase of 1s0 6d. is an increase of 11$ on thepresent flat-rate contribution for national insurance and industrial injuries.   This is the same proportionate increase as in benefits ata time when a good deal more than the extra cost of the higher benefitsneeds to be found.   Taking the employee&apos;s share of the total stamp(including N.H.S.) , the increase is 9%.   It is true that, if weinclude the 1s, increase in the employee&apos;s contribution last May,his share of the stamp will have gone up by about 16$ since October 1967whilst average earnings, on the latest treasury: forecast, will have risen about 13?$, but I think this is perhaps of* less significancethan the proportionate increase next November.   EcPr a man earning 15 a week the increase will then by 1$ of his gross pay, and it isestimated that only about one million men working full&quot; time areearning, less than that.

5.     In view of the formidable sum to be raised, I do not think an increaseof Is. 6d. is unreasonable.   And there is something in the point that, solong as we have a flat-rate scheme, the real impact of the rising cost shouldbe brought home by an appreciable increase in the contribution which every-body pays.    I nevertheless go on to consider alternative ways in which themightmoney/be raised so as to lighten the burden on the lower paid.6.     Possible ways of reducing the f3.at-rate contribution.     Given theamount we must raise in contributions, and that the burden is to be equally shared by employer and employee, we can only get less from thelower paid by raising still more from the higher earneThe following table compares the effect of three possible variants onthe proposals put forward in c(69)50-   Each of the variants would produceabout the same contribution income in 1970/71 and 1971/72 (within  1 million or so) as the proposals in C(69)50 and might yield a little more if earningsrise by more than the 3 per cent assumed.    Because of the time-lag incollecting graduated contributions, the deficit in 1969/70 would be increasedby up to about  6m.   It is assumed that no reduction in the self-employed and non-employed contribution would be justified merely because more ofthe employed contributions were earnings-related.Contributions of male employees not contracted out(including lv.K, S. and^industrial in^ries&quot;^&quot;&quot;PresentcontributionIncrease in contributionsABC	s.	d.	s.	d.	s.	d,	s.	d.	s.	d. 10	17	10	1	6	1	3	1	0	1	0 15	22	7	1	6	1	3	1	0	1	3 20	25	4	2	9	2	8	2	6	2	9 25	26	0	4	10	5	0	5	1	5	1 30	26	5	6	11	7	3	7	7	7	kA   (as in c(69)50)Add Is, 6d. to flat-rate contributionAdd 2^ per cent to contribution on earnings of  18-30B   Is. 3d. on flat rate2-g- per cent on  18-30 (making 3 per cent).&quot;C   Is. on flat rate2^ per cent on  18-30 (making 3;? per cent)D   lid. on flat rate5 per cent on  9-18 and 2^- per cent on  18-30(making 5 per cent on  9-18 and 3 per cent on  18-30).

7,     The alternatives considered all bring the increase . or the man earning 30 a week to well over 7s.   Because of this and the considerations setout in paragraphs 3 and 4* I do not think any of the variants is to be preferred to our original proposals, though variant B would&apos; perhaps betolerable.   This would add about  3 million to the deficit on the Fundthis year, wuich at an estimated  93 million is already uncomfortablylarge.8-     Postponement of part of the increase.   One question which has been raised is whether there would be any advantage in postponing part of theincrease until next year,9,     During the de&quot; ate on 15th May, the Secretary of State told the house that we had decided not to leave part of the increase over to next april and this announcement met with some approval and no complaint.   Therewould be obvious difficulties in having a separate, large increase next spring, without any increase in benefits.    Purely at the mechanical level,frequent changes in contributions would mean trouble for employers andothers, especially if the graduated increase had to be divided.10.   Nor do I think we could wait so long for any worthwhile part of themoney.   By last December the National Insurance Fund was down to thedanger level of just over  100 million.   We had to go the House, for thefirst time ever, to get authority to transfer  200 million from theReserve Fund merely to keep the National Insurance Fund at a safe workinglevel.   Nevertheless, by the end of March the Fund was down to  240 million and, ieven if we take the full contributio s increase in November, itwould be down to about  150 million by next March.   This is without allowing for the chance that experience will once more prove worse thanthe estimate.    If we postponed, say, one quarter of the increase until next April, the Fund would be depleted by a further  30 million -  40million this year and there would be a serious risk of having to go backto the Commons for authority to make a further withdrawal from theReserve Fund.11.   Apart from all this, the Chancellor ha,s made his Budget calculationson the understanding that the full increase in contributions would besecured this year.12.   For all these reasons, I am sure it is right to take the full amountat once in November.Department of Health and Social Security,19th May 1969
