S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 72 COPY NO. -4th-July. 1969CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: DISTRIBUTION OF reductions in 19?0-71Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the public expenditure programmes which count against the target for 1970-71 which we announced last February are shown in the 1969Survey (SEP(69) 64, paragraph 25) as amounting to  16, 902 million - 160 million above the target figure of  16, 742 million.    Of the 160 million excess,  36 million arises in the defence sector (mainly due to changed estimates by United States manufacturers of progress on aircraft which are on order) and  124 million in the civil sector(SEP(69) 64, paragraphs 27-30),    The Cabinet have decided thatreductions shall be made to bring the programmes back at least to the target of  16, 742 million,2,      In the light of the economic prospect over the next few years,the Cabinet have also invited me to work out with my colleagues proposalsfor reducing expenditure in the public sector (including in this case thecapital expenditure of the nationalised industries) by a total of  400million.    The reductions of  160 million in the public expenditure programmes to which I have referred in the previous paragraph would fall within this total,3,      I have undertaken to circulate a paper showing the scale of reductions required on this basis in the various programmes, withvariants,    I look for a substantial contribution from the Defence budget and the capital investment programmes of the nationalised industries,taken together.    Putting this contribution at  150 million, there wouldbe  250 million to be found from the remaining programmes.4,       The attached table shows three alternative patterns of distribution of this  250 million.    They all assume that we shouldnot look for a contribution from social security payments in 1970-71,Scheme I iliustr ates the eflec t of c oneentraiing the r eductions onthe programmes which are shown in the Survey to be growingmost rapidly, so that none grows more than 3 per cent,-1-

Scheme II shows the effect of a straight percentage reduction(2. 3 per cent) on all the programmes (apart from social security which is treated as exempted and the Defence Budget and thecapital investment of nationalised industries whose contribution is shown separately).Scheme III shows how Scheme II could be varied to halve the reductions on education and health and welfare.R.H.
