(THIS DOCUMENT- ISJTHEPROPERTY^0&quot;F,HER-.BRITANNICJi-AJESTYGOVERNMENT)CENTRAL PAY,INCREASE FOR THE NON-INDUSTRIALCIVliTpRVICB&quot;&quot;Memorandum.by.....the Lord Privy Se-alIn my memorandum (P.I.(69)17) I proposed the followingoffer in reply to the National Staff Side&apos;s claim for a centralpay increase (CP. I.):-(i) an increase of ki% from 1st July 1969 for the 385,000staff who had pay research settlements from 1st January 1968, but whose increases were staged intwo instalments with the second taking effect withoutretrospection on 1st January 1969 (Croup 1);(ii) an increase of 3% from 1st July 1969 for the 275,000staff whose last pay adjustment was a CP.I. on1st July 1968 (Group 2).2.     The Committee approved the proposed offer to Group 2, butdecided that, since Group 1 had received a staged pay increase on 1st January 1969, they could not have another from 1st July1969 but must wait until 1st January 1970 when they mightinstead have a 7% increase.    It was made clear in P.I.(69)17that the denial of a CP. I. for either Group would be unacceptable to the Staff Side and would create a most serious situation.    I therefore reserved my position, and that of thePrime Minister, on the Committee&apos;s decision.3.     At that time the various annual staff association confer-ences were about to begin.    It became clear that if we made theoffer approved by the Committee, it would not only be rejectedbut would cause great indignation at the conferences and thusprejudice, perhaps irrevocably, the chances of a negotiated1

settlement.    On the other hand, an early meeting with theNational Staff Side was essential &quot;before the Conference seasonboth to allow them to deploy their case in full and to enablethem at least to tell their conferences that negotiations had begun.Staff Side Viewsk.     Although for the tactical reasons described above no offer was made at this meeting, the attitude of the various staff associations fully confirmed the Department&apos;s view that theoffer approved by the Committee would be completely unaccept-able.    The main points made were the following:-(i) the effect of incomes policy in 1967 had been to deprive Group 1 of a CP.I. in that year with theresult that their rates fell even further behind than usual.   The-1st January 1968 pay research increases for this Group were therefore larger than they would otherwise have been and had to be staged in twoinstalments at heavy cost to the staff concerned.It would be intolerable if, as a further consequenceof these two penalties, a third was added by denyingthese grades a CP. I. until two years after their last review.   The Government must stop discriminatingagainst its own employees;(ii) the staging of the 1st January 1968 pay researchincreases was a unilateral abrogation by the Governmentof the 1967 Pay Agreement, which provides that the operative date of pay research settlements should bethe 1st January of the relevant year;(iii) the majority among the Group 1 grades was low paid(e.g. Clerical Officers and Clerical Assistants) and could not afford to wait another six months for a pay increase when their current rates were already18 months out-of-date and they saw the wages index andthe cost-of-living continuing to rise sharply;(iv) if the Government insisted on a 1st January 1970date for the Group 1 grades, the most serious situation would arise with the likelihood of militant action onan unprecedented scale.    In such a situation the staff2

COMF1DEMT1ALassociation Secretaries, including the secretary general of the National Staff Side himself, would feel it their duty to lead rather than to restrain.5.     My officials undertook to resume negotiations and to putforward concrete proposals at a further meeting on 22nd May.In view of the attitude adopted by the National Staff Side, andthe fact that this has since been fully, confirmed by the rank and file at the annual conferences of the Civil ServiceClerical Association (C.S.C.A.), the Society of Civil Servants(8.C.S.), the Institute of Professional Civil Servants(I.P.C.S.), the Civil Service Union (C.S.U.)    and not least theUnion of Post Office Workers, it is more than ever clear thatthe offer approved by the Committee could not be made withoutthe most damaging results.    I therefore thought it right toinform the Prime Minister of the situation and, with his agreement, to ask my colleagues to reconsider their previous decision.6.     In my memorandum P.I.(69)17, I explained why I thought myproposed offer was justified on merits.    My main concern here is to emphasise the importance of what is at stake in this claim.Militancy7.     The C.S.C.A.  annual conference has just endorsed themilitant policy proposed by its leaders.   There is no doubt that industrial action of some kind will follow if a reasonable of the CP.I. claim is refused.   While general strike action by the whole membership is perhaps unlikely, theC.S.C.A. would probably select certain sensitive areas in which to ban overtime, work to rule, or go slow.   The effects on government operations could be serious;-t1) Essential operations not directly involving the publicrevenue collection by Customs and Excise could bebadly affected, especially if the C.S.C.A. secured thesupport of departmental unions.   There could bedelays in the work in the surtax offices of the inland Revenue and, if the Inland Revenue StaffFederation (I.R.S.F.) members took eapporting action3

(as is likely), in tax collection, GIRO and national Savings could also &quot;be affected.(ii) Operations directly involving the -publicassuming, as is quite likely, the support of theMinistry of Labour Staff Association, there could bedisruption of the unemployment service and paymentof benefits.    If local office staff of the Departmentof Health and Social Security refused to work onFridays, payment of supplementary benefits could be seriously disrupted; and there would be delays oreven stoppage of payment of short-term benefits ifpunch card operators took part.These are only some examples of the likely effects of militantaction by the C.S.C.A. , whose lead might be followed by other staff associations (or their members) such as the Civil ServiceUnion and the Society of Civil Servants.   Clearly, therefore,the direct effects could be very damaging.   A list of likelysensitive areas for militant action is annexed.Staff Relations in General8.     I believe that the indirect effects of a confrontation onthis issue would be even more damaging and perhapsirreparable.    Staff relations in the non-industrial CivilService have so far rested on certain assumptions which have grown up within the Whitley system.   The most important is thatthe relations between the two sides should, in principle, be regulated by negotiation and consent.   This necessarilyimplies the honouring of agreements by both sides and thesettlement of disagreements by arbitration.   This system has reserved both the country and the Civil Service extremely well.It has unfortunately already been weakened in the Post office by the recent case of the Overseas Telegraph Operators.   If we now push the non-Post Office Staff Associations into militancyover the CP.I. claim, it is very likely that Whitleyism, aswe know it, vail not survive and that Civil Service staffrelations will henceforward be as liable to &quot;strife&quot; as anyothers.   This would be deplorable both in itself and in the context of the Governments attempts to bring some kind of orderk

into industrial relations generally.   I must emphasise alsothat it would &quot;be very harmful to all our efforts to increasethe efficiency and reduce the cost of the non-industrial civil Service by means of improved working practices and staffeconomies.   The worst result of all would be to stand by the agreed offer and then to capitulate in the face of industrial action.The^Staff Side&apos;s Case9.     It is important to remember that the Staff Sidejustifiably do not regard the present arrangements for deter-mining pay as giving civil servants a privileged position.The pay research system relates Civil Service rates to themedian of the rates paid to people engaged in comparable workoutside;  and because of the three-year period between reviewsthe resulting Civil Service rates lag significantly behindeven the median for most of the time (as the objective test of recruitment often confirms).    In spite of this, theNational Staff Side have never so far tried seriously to mitigate this situation by claiming CP.I.&apos;s which are closely related in amount to outside pay movements.    It is entirelyunderstandable, therefore, that they should strongly resent any attempt to increase this built-in lag by making largenumbers of staff, many of them comparatively lowly paid, wait for two years between substantive pay improvements.    I do not see how it would be possible to defend the denial of a1st July CP.I. against the charge that it discriminatedagainst the Civil Service, and was a unilateral breach of the1967 Pay Agreement.Xncomes Policy10.   An offer of up to 5?.% (i.e. 1  times the annual ceiling)from 1st July 1969 would be in my view consistent with theWhite Paper and with the way in which incomes policy has been applied so far to the Civil Service.    It is true that theWhite Paper prescribes a minimum interval of 12 monthsbetween settlements, but it does not specify how this shouldrelate to staged increases.    In the case of the clearing banks staff, the First Secretary stipulated that there could5

be no farther, increase within 12 months of a staged pay increase.But there is an important dilTerence between imposing thisinterpretntion of the 12 months&apos; rule for the future as one part of a package settlement and attempting to apply it longafter the settlement to which it would relate.    It was not,of course, explained to the Staff Side when, with the verygreatest reluctance, and after three meetings with theChancellor of the Exchequer they acquiesced in staging in 1968,that any further increase would be ruled out until 12 monthsafter the date of the second stage.    It is in fact very doubtful whether, had they known this, they would have accepted staging at all.    I think therefore that a validdistinction can be drawn between these two cases.Conclusion11.    Both the merits of the claim and what is at risk for thewhole future of Civil Service staff relations make it essential,in my view, to offer a CP.I. to Group 1 from &quot;1st July 1969.I originally proposed kifo rather than the 5-$% permitted by theannual ceiling because I thought that such an offer might justbe negotiable if made immediately and that a settlement at lessthan the ceiling would help with any presentational difficultiesin relation to incomes policy.    The atmosphere has sincefurther deteriorated as a result of the national conferences and it is clear that we could not now hope to settle for lessthan the oquivalent of an annual rate of 3-g$.   This would,moreover, be consistent with the interim offer of 3^% to industrial civil servants.    I therefore ask the Committee toagree to an offer of 5% for Group 1  and 3^% for Group 2, both with effect from 1st July 1969.12.    It is not certain that these amounts will be accepted andthe U.P.W. in particular may be inclined to press for higherincreases to match more nearly the rate of increase in non--Civil Service rates and earnings.   But I would not regard it as reasonable to go beyond this offer.   If it did not prove6

acceptable to the Staff Side I would accept that we mustthen defend our position at arbitration.S,Civil Service Department, S.W.1.20th May, I969
