I  Industrial Relations legislation The First Secretary invited the General Council in December todiscuss with her changes that the Government considered should bemade in the industrial relations system and in the law relating to tradeunions. Both at meetings with the First Secretary and in a statement(reproduced in an Appendix to this Report) which they adopted onJanuary 7, even before publication of the White Paper In Place ofStrife, the General Council made clear the strength of their objectionsto the proposal by the Government to take powers to impose statutoryfinancial penalties in certain circumstances on trade unions and onworkpeople. In subsequent discussions with the Government, and in afurther statement issued on April 23 after the Government had announced that it intended to expedite the introduction of legislation,the General Council continued to emphasise the opposition of theMovement to some of the Governments proposals, and its concern atthe precipitate way in which the Government was acting.2 The General Council had already in their statement Action onDonovan, which was published in November 1968, endorsed the centralconclusion of the Royal Commission that the best way of promotinggood industrial relations was through the medium of voluntary collec-tive bargaining. They had welcomed its considered rejection of sugges-tions that the criminal law should be brought into the field of industrial relations, and had accepted with some reservations about recommend-ations that appeared to be inconsistent with the Royal Commission^basic analysis the proposals that it put forward for reforming theindustrial relations system.3 The General Council recognised that a number of the changessuggested by the Government in the White Paper could help tostrengthen collective bargaining, and thus to improve industrial rela-tions and promote trade union objectives. These are the aims that theGenera] Council have constantly had before them in examining changes which should be made in collective bargaining arrangements and in trade union activities. They have sought, so far without success, to persuade the Government that the introduction of punitive measures would militate against the achievement of those aims.4 The proposals to which the General Council object in particularare those that would empower a Minister to impose a 28-day &quot;concilia-tion pause&quot; where in his opinion this is required, and to enforce it by
the Industrial Board imposing fines on workpeople who do not complywith an Order to return to work; would give a Minister the right to force (a) union again where he decides that it is necessary and again under the threat of financial penalties to conduct a ballot before calling an officialstrike, and, moreover, to conduct the ballot on the basis of a questionfinally decided not by the union but by the Minister; would give an outside agency (the Industrial Board), acting under an Order that a minister has in his opinion judged to be necessary, the power to imposefinancial penalties on a union which refused to comply with a recom-mendation that it should, in the case of an inter-union dispute overrecognition, be excluded from recognition; and would, again underthreat of a financial penalty, compel trade unions to register their rules and to include in those rules provisions that would have to be approvedby an outside agency (the Registrar). The General Council alsodissent from the Governments view that the Industrial Board should operate as the Governments agent for the purpose of imposingfinancial penalties on individuals and trade unions, and should overseerelations between trade unions and their members. The government proposes that this Board should include the trade union members ofthe Industrial Court; the General Council do not believe that any trade union representative would be prepared to serve on a body whichwas responsible for deciding that trade unionists should be fined for industrial activities.5 The General Council set out in detail (in the statement reproducedas an Appendix to this Report) the reasons why, while welcoming manyof the proposals in the White Paper, they object to these aspects, andhave sought to impress these reasons on the Government at meetings with the Prime Minister and. with the First Secretary.6 They have pointed out that the Government has greatly exaggeratedthe effects that stoppages of work have on Britain&apos;s economy. All stop-pages of work taken together strikes and lockouts, official andunofficial strikes, constitutional and unconstitutional strikes, inter-union stoppages, those caused by disputes about pay and those arisingfrom dismissals or victimisation, those which are initiated by work-people and those which are caused by an employees action in totallead to the loss, at the most, of a tenth of one per cent of production.This should be compared with the loss of production caused by such factors as industrial injuries, sickness, or unemployment.7 Nevertheless the General Council accept that every effort shouldbe made to reduce the number of stoppages of work and also recognisethat for the most part disputes are symptoms of underlying deficiencies in industrial relations that in some industries may well impede Britain&apos;economic advance in more significant ways. It is therefore necessary to
identify and eliminate the root causes of those deficiencies. That unions and employers have in fact been getting down to the job is evidenced bythe development in many industries of new bargaining machinery,procedures and methods (notably productivity bargaining). The extentto which unions are engaging in fundamental reappraisals of the indus-trial relations system was made clear in the published reports of the six post-Donovan conferences covering all affiliated unions and all industries that the General Council convened earlier this year to discussthe reform and extension of collective bargaining.8 The Royal Commission insisted and indeed the Government has said that it accepts that the improvement of collective bargainingarrangements, and of industrial relations generally, can only be secured by thorough discussion leading to agreement between trade unions and employers. The Government claims that its proposal to take discretion-ary powers under which it could impose limited sanctions as a last resort would assist this process. The General CounciPs experience, and first-hand knowledge of how improvements are made in the practicalworld of industrial relations, convince them that the Government isprofoundly mistaken if it believes that the threat of punishment willaccelerate the introduction of necessary changes; indeed it would haveprecisely the opposite effects. The Government in particular appears tohave ignored the damaging effect of an attempt to enforce payment of a fine in the last resort by sending bailiffs to distrain a man&apos;s goods longafter the original dispute has been settled.9 The Government is either assuming that it will achieve its pur-poses by merely being seen to possess such powers, and that it will there-fore never need to use them; or it is prepared, as a last resort, to exercisethem. If the former, then it is foolhardy for a Government to assume that it will never be put to the test; if the latter, then as the general council have previously emphasised the use of punitive measures wouldembitter, not alleviate, industrial difficulties; would impair, notstrengthen, the authority of trade unions and their representatives; andwould sap, not reinforce, the procedures for avoiding and settlingdisputes.10 The General Council therefore still hope that the Government willreconsider its decision to press forward with legislation involving theuse of penal clauses on unions and workpeople. Even if it is not moved by the fundamental opposition of all sections of the trade union Move-ment to the intrusion of punitive legislation into industrial relations, itshould surely be influenced by the consideration that the controversythat its ill-judged proposals have caused will divert attention from deal-ing with the causes of industrial relations problems.
II  A Trade Union Programme11 For their part the General Council intend to get on with the jobthat they already have in hand in the three main areas in which problemsarise and action is needed. These are:relations between unions and employers;relations between unions themselves;relations within unions.The Royal Commission put forward some useful recommendations for action in all these fields, and some of the proposals made in the white paper are relevant and welcome. But (he General CounciTs starting-point for examining these three areas is not the Industrial Relations bill and its penal provisions, nor the While Paper, but the realities of theindustrial situation in the light of the Donovan Report. In putting forward, for the consideration of Congress, proposals for action in these three areas the General Council are concerned with the positive purposeof finding genuine and workable solutions to real problems and ofadvancing trade union objectives.RELATIONS BETWEEN UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS12 The first requirement for improving relations between unions and employers is acceptance by employers that their employees have theright to join and to be represented by trade unions, and willingness to afford trade unions full recognition for the purpose of collective bar-gaining. These points were strongly emphasised at the tuc&apos;s post-Donovan conferences, mainly though by no means exclusively by representatives of non-manual workers. The General Council welcome the proposals made in the While Paper for action to ensure that workerscan in practice exercise their basic rights but believe that these proposals should be clarified and strengthened. The General Council alsowelcome the Confederation of British lnduslry&apos;s agreement, expressedin the joint TUC-CBI statement on the Donovan Report (sec appendix to Action on Donovan), that managements should show a greater readiness-ness to recognise the functions of trade unions and to facilitiatc tradeunion membership, and that this should be matched by a union endcav-our to achieve a more effective organisation at plant level. The Commis-sion on Industrial Relations will have a useful part to play in ensuring that trade unions secure recognition.
13 The next fundamental requirement is adequate machinery Tornegotiation and proper procedures for the settlement of disputes.14 The General Council have in Action on Donovan emphasised theneed for unions and employers to examine their present collective bargaining arrangements, and in particular to consider whether company or factory bargaining should be more systematically developed in par-ticular industries and what this implies for the role of their industry-widenegotiating bodies. A high priority is being given to these related issues,as was shown by the response to the questions (he General Councilposed to unions at the tuc&apos;s post-Donovan conferences.Unconstitutional strikes15 In the present context the General Council are more immediately concerned with procedures for resolving disputes and settling strikes,and in particular with (he question of unconstitutional strikes. It iscommonly asserted that it is essential to &quot;do something&quot; urgently aboutunconstitutional strikes. But there is no case for anyone deciding to do anything without first making a clear analysis of the problem and itscauses. Above all it is impossible to separate the question of unconsti-(utional strikes from that, of deficiencies in existing formal procedures.Procedure agreements at the present time are often narrow in scope andone-sided in operation, not imposing status quo obligations on managc-mcnt to match those imposed on workpeople. Nor does the fact that most unconstitutional strikes arc also unofficial imply (hat the respon-sibility for the problem is primarily that of trade union leadership; theinitiative for the reform of procedures lies very much with theemployers.16 Too often the background of industrial relations on the workshopfloor is an outdated insistence by managements on (heir prerogatives tomake decisions unilaterally, which in practice leaves workpeople with no apparent alternative to applying sanctions in the form of strike action. Workplace representatives do not regard procedures that auto-matically exclude many matters on grounds of managerial prerogativeas reflecting the realities of the industrial situation.17 The only satisfactory method therefore is to adopt procedures which arc agreed by both sides as providing a realistic basis for good relations, and which stale clearly the matters which have to be taken through the procedure, with the status quo applying until agreement has been reached. Such procedures should include arrangementsfor shop stewards to carry out their work; there arc still far too many instances where even minimum arrangements are not accepted.18 Where strike action is taken which conflicts with the procedure thereason is often that, from the workpeoplc&apos;s point of view, the pro-
cedure itself is unsatisfactory. Where this happens the procedure itself should be reviewed to see whether the contention that it is unsatis-factory is justified.19 Disputes can be categorised as those which arise from action takenby the management, and those which result from action taken by thetrade union side. These need to be examined separately.Disputes which result from action by the management side20 Where the dispute arises from an action by management (examples are speed-up of work; dismissal; manning arrangements; redundancy),it is only where the procedure covers these points, and incorporates a status quo provision, and where there has been a failure to agree withinthe machinery at that stage, that a stoppage can properly be described as unconstitutional.21 If the procedure does not provide for the status quo on important points such as those mentioned above it is in need of reform, and to describe any action by the workpeople as unconstitutional is misleading.In these circumstances a temporary and immediate ad hoc change in theprocedure should be made, in the form of a decision by the employer toreturn to the position which existed before the dispute arose, so that the workpeople can return to work, followed probably after settlementof the immediate issue by examination of the procedure itself.22 This example illustrates the need to incorporate in the procedure aprovision that the status quo should be maintained and that changes should be made only after negotiation; this is much more important,and more conducive to industrial peace, than securing a return tothe status quo after men have stopped work.23 If there is provision for a change to be negotiated and the manage-ment has already taken action without first raising it within the pro-cedure, the fact that the workpeople have also taken consequentialaction does not alter the fact that the principal unconstitutional action was first taken by the employer. The circumstances that led to the dis-pute would thus need to be taken into account in seeking a solution.24 If on the other hand the management initiates discussion withinthe procedure (for example with a view to speeding up work, involving the renegotiation of rates) and adheres to the status quo while thematter is within the procedure, there should be no stoppage of work,and the workpeople are constitutionally in the wrong if they strike beforethe procedure is exhausted. If, however, there is a stoppage the union should take action to ensure that the workpeople return to work whilediscussions take place.
25 Where workpeople are seeking improved terms and conditions ofemployment, the status quo does of course automatically apply to them until the management agrees to the proposed change. Indeed the main problem here is that the status quo often lasts too long; procedures are too often unduly protracted, leading to unreasonable delays beforesettlement, and what is often required is a radical shortening of proce-dures.26 Another factor is often a complicated wages structure. To take anot uncommon example, one group of workers may have agreed a wageadjustment with the management in relation to a change in productionarrangements; this can well affect the wage relativities of other groups of workers, often those working side by side with the first group. Thereal difficulty in such cases lies in the pay structure, and the fact thatmakeshift solutions in such circumstances may meet criticism reinforcesthe need to establish pay structures on a comprehensive basis.27 This type of dispute therefore may strictly speaking arise from an employer-initiated action. The main conclusion of the Royal Corn-mission on the causes of disputes concerning wages in the motor industry (par. 389) was that:&quot;In our view, the failure to devise adequate wage structures, and toagree upon them in comprehensive negotiations with representa-tives of all workers concerned, is responsible to a large extent forthe industry&apos;s industrial relations difficulties.&quot;This can be contrasted with the beneficial results, in terms of industrial relations, of the National Coal Board&apos;s progress in establishing a com-prehensive pay structure.The revision of procedures28 The preceding paragraphs have concentrated on analysing thevarious types of problem and drawing conclusions, in general terms,about the appropriate remedies and what unions themselves should do to ensure that disputes do not develop into strikes and to deal withany strikes that may nevertheless occur. There is a broad measure ofagreement that the reform of procedures and wage structures in par-ticular industries, which was the central recommendation of the RoyalCommission, should receive the major emphasis in the improvement ofindustrial relations. This is indeed what the General Council have beensetting out rather more specifically in the preceding paragraphs inrelation to the analysis of different types of dispute. The job that hasto be done can only be done case by case, company by company, andindustry by industry, and the managements and unions concerned
have the main responsibility for bringing procedures up to date, and for having written into the procedures the particular points which havebeen mentioned.Other contributions tojreform29 In welcoming the recommendation to establish a Commission on industrial Relations, the General Council stated in Action on Donovanthat there was a very important job for the CIR to do, but that the negotiation of procedures was for the parties concerned. The general council must be fully consulted by the DEP when considering refer-ences to the CIR, and they look forward to close co-operation with theCIR as its work develops. Affiliated unions also have been invited tosuggest to the TUC possible references which might be made.30 The General Council have also worked closely with the DEP inbeginning the job of registering the procedure agreements of largecompanies, and they have informed all unions of the arrangements which have been made in this connection. They believe that there shouldbe the closest co-operation by trade unions in this process of registeringprocedure agreements.31 Reference must also be made to the scope for effective forms ofarbitration, where disputes are not settled because of the absence ofsatisfactory procedures. The General Council fully recognise in thisconnection the valuable work of conciliation carried out by officials of the DEP. They also believe that in many industries there would be great advantage in making provision once again for arbitration at therequest of one party through the reintroduction of Order 1376. TheGeneral Council have recently reiterated to the Government that they believe that the Industrial Disputes Order was very useful and thatarbitration of the kind proposed would be beneficial because it wouldprovide additional opportunities for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for the promotion of satisfactory voluntary procedures. TheGeneral Council have also suggested that within this context new machinery might provide for cases to be dealt with on a regional basisso that disputes could be dealt with more rapidly.32 The General Council believe that the reintroduction of Order 1376would make a useful contribution in dealing with many matters which do not appear to be within the scope of the White Paper&apos;s proposals;the Ministers proposed discretionary power to make an Order allowingaccess to the Industrial Court would appear to be limited to problemsassociated with trade union recognition, normally following the pro-posed CIR procedure (which provides that where an employer continuesto refuse recognition despite a CIR recommendation, a MinisterialOrder will enable the union unilaterally to take the employer to arbi-
tration by the Industrial Court). The CIR procedure and Order 1376should be seen as essentially complementary; whilst the CIR procedurewill be the proper one for many recognition cases, it will not cover many other cases covered by Order 1376, and it would in any event be unreal-istic to expect the CIR to deal with all the cases of this kind, oftenaffecting small groups of workpeople.The role of the TUC33 The further question is what assistance can be given by the TUCGeneral Council. The TUC has already instituted a programme of meetings with its affiliated organisations to discuss action following theRoyal Commission^ Report. Recognising that the changes which are needed must be based on the circumstances of particular cases, theGeneral Council have examined how they might give advice and assis-tance in particular and often local situations. There is a clear respon-sibility too on employers&apos; organisations to ensure that there are ade-quate procedures for negotiation and for the settlement of disputes, andthat strikes are not precipitated and indeed made inevitable by either the absence of such procedures or unconstitutional action on the partof management.34 Making settlements and remedying defects in procedures is theresponsibility of the two sides of industry, at industry and factory level.Any investigation of particular problems by the TUC is thereforeextraneous and supplementary to the normal procedures of industry.Indeed, a general procedure which departed even further from locallevel than do some industry-wide procedures at the present time wouldbe less helpful than ever.35 Unions already have an obligation, under TUC Rule 11, to keepthe General Council informed about disputes arising between them and employers, and the General Council are empowered on certain con-ditions to use their influence to effect a just settlement of a differencebetween a union and an employer. The General Council have alwaysused with discretion their power to intervene formally or informally,and will continue to do so, but they are bound to interest themselvesactively in disputes which significantly affect the wages or employmentof large groups of workers who are not parties to the dispute.36 Where the TUC becomes involved in trying to bring about asolution to a particular dispute, involving or affecting either directly or indirectly large numbers of workers, and thus becomes involved intalking to an employer, there is much to be said for the confederation of British Industry participating as well. The General Council have examined the possibility that, where the TUC becomes involved in
trying to solve a particular problem it should, if it considers that itwould be helpful, discuss the situation with the CBI at a very early stage, when the TUC and CBI would both be in touch with theirrespective affiliated organisations which were directly involved. As a corollary, the CBI would be able to request the TUC to examine aparticular problem jointly, with a view to considering how the twoorganisations might help in resolving a specific dispute. The general council have in fact initiated an exploratory discussion with the CB]about the possibility of jojnt action in this area, but the initial responseof the CBI to this suggestion has not been promising.37 Nevertheless, the General Council do not believe that develop-ment of the tuc&apos;s own role in dealing with particular disputes needdepend in the future, any more than it has in the past, on the active participation of the CBI. The General Council propose that the scopeof Rule 11 should be extended specifically to include unauthorised andunconstitutional stoppages which are likely to have serious repercussions-sions.38 Under the revised Rule .11 (see Appendix 2) where the disputeaffects a significant number of workers or where it seems likely to beprotracted and have serious repercussions, the General Council proposethat it should be an obligation on the union or unions concerned to notify the TUC of the circumstances. Even before notification the TUCitself might take the initiative to investigate the matter: such an initiative-tive might, for example, result from an approach from a union whose members were not in dispute or on strike but had been laid off or other-wise affected as a result of strike action by the members of another union.39 In either event the first requirement would be for the TUC general secretary to discuss with the union or unions concerned the possibilityof the TUC giving assistance towards the settlement of the dispute.In the light of the situation a decision might then be taken to refer thematter either to the Finance and General Purposes Committee or to aDisputes Committee. The General Council have it in mind that, parti-cularly in the case of a localised dispute, a Disputes Committee might include members drawn from a panel of experienced union officials.Where it was considered that an on-the-spot investigation would be useful, it might be appropriate to include as members of a DisputesCommittee trade union officials drawn from a region adjacent to the locality of the dispute; this would help in bringing to bear on theproblem the experience of persons who, while not immediately involved,would have knowledge of local circumstances and would also help inspeeding the investigation.40   The General Secretary or the Committee could, after consulting
the union concerned, discuss the dispute with local union representatives and also with the management concerned. After investigation of the causes and circumstances of the dispute, recommendations for securing a settlement would normally be made to the parties concerned.Recommendations might also be made for changes in the procedure toavoid similar situations occurring in future. If it was found in aparticular case that there was a strong element of inter-union difficultyin the situation, and if the employer indicated that he would beprepared to accept the tuc&apos;s findings, the Committee might make an award. In most cases, however, the Committee would make a recom-mendation and would seek to establish that all the parties concerned were prepared to act on it without delay. This would call for a positive response from management as well as from the trade union side.41 Unions have demonstrated over the years that they do their utmost to implement recommendations by the TUC for the settlement of disputes, and very rarely have the General Council had to exercise their ultimate power of suspending a union and reporting it to Congress.The General Council are confident that, in the case of unofficial andunconstitutional strikes, unions will impress on their members theadvantages to be gained from accepting TUC assistance in settling thedispute and will accept responsibility for doing everything within their power to ensure that their members accept recommendations by the tuc.42 The General Council would also require unions to satisfy themthat they had done all that they could reasonably be expected to do tosecure compliance with a recommendation (or an award, where thishas been made), including taking action within their own rules ifnecessary. They recognise that a few unions may need to review theirown rules to ensure that they are in a position to comply with recom-mendations or awards by the TUC. The General Council also considerthat it should be made clear in Rule 11 (as is already implicit in thatRule, and as is explicit in Rule 12) that in the unlikely event of a unionrefusing to abide by a decision of the TUC the General Council can take action under Rule 13 (See appendix 4).43 If the foregoing proposals are accepted by the Special congress the General Council will take action forthwith to give effect to them.They will also submit to the September Congress a formal proposal fora change in Rule 11: it will be along the lines set out in Appendix 2,and any observations that unions may wish to submit for the GeneralCounciTs consideration will be taken into account in finalising the precise proposal to be submitted to Congress.
RELATIONS BETWEEN UNIONS44 Among the challenges facing the trade union Movement are thoseof increasing membership and representation, getting recognitionfrom employers, and strengthening the procedures for negotiation and the settlement of disputes, so that trade unionists can achieve theiraims without having to engage unnecessarily in industrial strife. the tuc post-Donovan conferences demonstrated that the trade union movement is ready to meet these challenges, and that unions recognisethat the greater the measure of co-operation between unions, the sooner the prospect will become a reality.45 What those who criticise inter-union disputes apparently failcompletely to understand is that the more rapid pace of change in industry is bound to create tensions between groups of workers whichoften reflect themselves in inter-union differences. Moreover, the un-precedented rate of change in industrial structure and technology is often associated with initiatives by managements to make changes injob definition and job status (e.g. by breaking down jobs and creatingnew lines of promotion). These in many cases have a direct impact onthe spheres of influence of particular unions. These developments areaffecting a wide range of occupations in modern industry, where the emphasis is increasingly on the need for greater mobility, and call forpolicies which will ensure that greater mobility is consistent with theinterests of those who are directly affected.Closer working between unions46 No. 1 of the Bridlington Principles states that &quot;Each union shall consider the possibility of joint working agreements with unions with whom they are in frequent contact; such agreements should deal, where possible, with (a) spheres of influence, (b) recognition of cards, (c)machinery for composing difficulties, (d) conditions for transfer ofmembers&quot;. Such agreements may be bilateral between unions, orreached on a wider basis. The General Council wish to emphasise thatthe Bridlington Principles which deal with the avoidance of disputes and indeed the process of so modifying trade union structure thatissues of this sort never reach the stage of inter-union disputes areat least as important as the TUC procedure which operates whendisputes have arisen. They welcome the increasing readiness of unions to make inter-union arrangements of this sort, and also to approach the TUC for assistance, both formally and informally, when difficulties arise.47 Nevertheless, the General Council believe that every strike which takes place because unions cannot reconcile their disputes peacefully,
with what this means in terms of acrimony between trade unionists,must be a matter of concern to the trade union Movement as a whole,and that far greater emphasis must be place by unions on the priorexamination between themselves of issues that could lead to difficulty.In this connection they have endorsed the objective of more clearlydefining spheres of influence, and following the TUC post-Donovanconferences more detailed discussions to this end are being arranged with the unions concerned.48 The General Council have, over the years, brought many unionstogether and have been successful in promoting amalgamations andcloser working arrangements. But in the light of the TUC post-Donovanconferences they will take a fresh look at the question of trade unionrationalisation in relation to changes in collective bargaining arrange-ments and changes in the structure of industry, notably the growth oflarge combines.Inter-union disputes49 Many of the considerations outlined in the previous section of thisreport relating to disputes procedures and unconstitutional strikes arealso relevant to many disputes described as &quot;inter-union&quot;. Some types of dispute, e.g. about trade union recognition, cannot be solved in isolation from the attitude and actions of the employer. It is also important for employers to acknowledge that they have a responsibility to discuss at an early stage within a satisfactory procedure any proposalfor changing manning arrangements, including job definition, job status and, of course, redundancy.50 Rule 12 of Congress lays an obligation on the General Councilto use their influence to promote a settlement where disputes arise, orthreaten to arise, between affiliated organisations. The General Councilbelieve that affiliated unions accept that they must take account of theeffect that inter-union disputes have not only on the members of theunions involved but on the members of other unions. The general council consider that improvements are needed both in the procedures which should be followed by affiliated unions and in the tuc&apos;s ownfunctions, and that Congress should indicate clearly the part that the tuc has to play in the procedure for resolving disputes of this kind,whether official or unofficial. What is needed can best be identified byclassifying the types of dispute that occur between unions (bearing inmind that some disputes which are commonly thought of as &quot;inter-union&quot; cannot be solved in isolation from the joint employer-tradeunion procedure). The four types are:
(a) a difference about which unions should be recognised (recognition)(b) a difference about the union to which a particular group of workers should belong (membership)(c) a difference about which union members should cany out parti-cular work (demarcation)(d) a difference about the policy which should be pursued in respect ofterms and conditions of employment (wages and conditions).Official inter-union disputes51 There are some important distinctions which are relevant to theprocedure affecting (a) recognition and (b) membership on the one handas compared with the procedure affecting (c) demarcation and (d) wagesand conditions on the other. Some conclusions arising from this distinc-tion are drawn in the following paragraphs, but the essential featurethat all four cases have in common is that no inter-union dispute shouldbe allowed to become an official strike before the unions concerned have notified the TUC. The General Council therefore propose that,in order to avoid any such strike taking place, it should be an obligation on the unions which are involved in an inter-union dispute to notify the tuc of the circumstances and to give the TUC an opportunity toexamine the issue and to make an Award or Recommendation (which-ever is appropriate to the circumstances).52 In respect of cases (a) recognition and (b) membership it can beassumed that if an official dispute (short of a strike) emerges between two or more unions, there has been a failure to agree within an inter-union procedure, however informal that procedure. In all such casesunions will be required to notify the TUC and, in the absence of an agreed solution, to abide by an Award or to accept a Recommendationof a TUC Disputes Committee.53 In respect of cases (c) demarcation and (d) wages and conditions,account has to be taken of the relevance and adequacy of joint employer-union procedures as well as the adequacy of inter-union procedures.In respect of type (c) demarcation, for example, the problem typicallyarises out of some action by management which is not adequatelydealt with inside a comprehensive joint procedure. In these cir-cumstances the solution usually has to be found jointly with the employer, and as a consequence inter-union differences under heading(c) demarcation are more likely to be the subject of a recommendation by a TUC Disputes Committee, rather than an Award.54 The characteristics of situations of type (d) wages and conditionsare often very similar to those of type (c) demarcation, notably where an issue relating to wages and conditions leads to a divergence of interest
between two groups of workers whose wage relativities are being alteredas a consequence of technological or market changes. Here again, aTUC Disputes Committee would often make a Recommendation ratherthan an Award, not because a lesser degree of obligation is implied onthe trade unions concerned, but because the proposed solution hassubsequently to be agreed with an employer.Unofficial inter-union disputes55 The problem of unofficial inter-union disputes is more difficultthan that of official inter-union disputes in that, whereas in the case of official disputes the unions can ensure that normal working ismaintained while the tuc&apos;s disputes procedure is operating, in unoffi-cial disputes, strike action may have actually been taken.56 The first requirement therefore is that if, in any of the four situa-tions listed in par. 50 an unofficial inter-union dispute has led- to strike action, the unions should take all necessary steps to get their membersback to work.57 Secondly, where the dispute affects a significant number of workers and appears likely to be protracted, the General Council propose thatit should be an obligation on the unions concerned to notify the TUCforthwith of the circumstances. Such notifications will for the mostpart fall into one of three categories:(i) where there is a satisfactory procedure for settling disputes betweenthe unions concerned, where the unions have instructed their membersthat the problem must be dealt with through the machinery, and wherethe unions are satisfied that there will be an early return to work and asettlement; in this case the TUC would be notified primarily for infor-mation;(ii) where there is an inter-union procedure but where the members ofone or more of the unions are refusing to abide by this procedure;in this case the TUC will need to consider whether it should intervene;(iii) where there is no procedure between the unions, and where the probability of the need for TUC intervention is greater.58 Where, in cases (ii) and (iii), it is clear that the TUC needs to intervene, a Disputes Committee will be set up quickly with full authorityto investigate the causes and circumstances of the dispute. Whether theconclusions reached by the Disputes Committee should take the formof a Recommendation or the form of an Award would depend on the considerations that were outlined in pars. 51-54 relating to officialinter-union disputes that is, whether or not the solution also depends on securing agreement with the employer.
59 In relation to unofficial inter-union disputes, and even beforeformal notification by the unions concerned, the TUC might wish onits own initiative to investigate the matter, and to decide after con-sultation with unions directly involved, whether a Disputes Com-mittee should be set up. Such an initiative might, for example, result from an approach from a union whose members were not in disputeor on strike but had been laid off or otherwise affected as a result of strike action taken by the members of another union.Implications for TUC procedures and rules60 If the tuc&apos;s activities in relation to inter-union disputes are to be developed in this way, the General Council will examine the desirabilityof constituting a panel of experienced union officials, on which theycould draw in addition to members of the General Council to con-stitute Disputes Committees. Where the General Council and unionsconsidered that an on-the-spot investigation would be useful, theGeneral Council might wish to include as members of the DisputesCommittee, officials drawn from a region adjacent to the locality of thedispute; this would help both in bringing to bear on the problem theexperience of persons who, while not immediately involved, would haveknowledge of local circumstances, and would also help in speeding the investigation. Adjudication would of course continue to be undertaken,by Committees of members without a direct interest in the dispute.61 If the foregoing proposals are accepted by the Special congress the General Council will take action forthwith to give effect to them.They will also submit to the September Congress a formal proposalfor a change in Rule 12; it will be along the lines set out in Appendix 3,and any observations that unions may wish to submit for the GeneralCouncils consideration will be taken into account in finalising the precise proposal to be submitted to Congress.RELATIONS WITHIN UNIONS62 It is not the purpose of this Report to attempt to cover exhaustivelyall the aspects of trade union activity and of industrial relations on whichaction is needed. This section of the Report mainly concentrates on thequestion of trade union rules, in relation to which the General Councilindicated in Action on Donovan that they intended to carry out a com-prehensive survey in conjunction with affiliated unions; and internalprocedures and the role of workplace representatives in the context ofnew bargaining developments.
Trade union rules63 The Royal Commission recommended that there should be anextension of the legal requirements relating to the rules of a registeredtrade union to cover admission, discipline, disputes between a member and the union, elections, and the election and terms of office of shop stewards. The question of rules governing the calling of strikes was not included in this list, but was included (in the form of &quot;strike ballots&quot;) inthe White Paper which was published later. A further recommendation by the Royal Commission was that an Independent Review Body shouldbe set up to consider complaints about arbitrary refusal of admission to,or unjustifiable expulsion from, a union; to hear complaints (not dis-posed of by the Registrar) about election mal-practices; and to considerdisputes between the Registrar and the union as to whether its rulescomply with the requirements proposed by the Commission.64 The General CounciFs reasoned criticisms of these recom-mendations were set out in pars. 98 and 99 of Action on Donovan. they pointed out that these proposals did not stem from any convincing evidence that there was a serious problem which was at present notbeing dealt with, and indeed that the Royal Commission themselveshad concluded that there was little by way of adverse criticism ofinternal procedures and internal democracy. The General Councilrecognised that individual problems arose, but that this was the reason why provision was made in union rules and procedures for individual cases to be heard. The General Council also indicated in Action onDonovan that they intended to consider the case for the TUC establish-ing certain basic principles for union rules which would cover thepoints mentioned by the Commission, and also that they intended toexamine what machinery might be established under TUC auspices as a last resort for individuals who have a complaint about the operation ofexisting procedures.65 The General Council are at present examining these aspects of union rules on the basis of detailed information which has recentlybeen provided by affiliated unions. As a result of this examination, it isanticipated that the General Council will be drawing up a list of basic principles concerning admission to membership, discipline and expul-sion, and the procedure for elections. Affiliated unions will be expectedto incorporate these basic principles in their rules and the general council will be giving further consideration to the question of whethera new Congress rule will be needed to cover these points. Most unionswill already have some or all of these principles embodied in their rules.Where this is not the case the General Council fully recognise thatreasonable time will have to be allowed for any necessary amendments
to be made. As has already been stated, the General Council are also considering whether additional safeguards for individual members will be required by way of appeal to the TUC incases where an aggrievedmember has exhausted the union&apos;s own appeals procedure. The general council do not accept that this kind of issue should go to the IndustrialBoard, which the Government is proposing should have this job as one of its functions: nor can they accept that compulsory awards and penalties on unions for failing to carry them out are appropriatemethods of dealing with this kind of problem.66 On the question of rules governing the calling of strikes, theGeneral Council have already indicated that they do not take the viewthat strike ballots are always necessary or desirable. The need to haveclearly defined rules is nevertheless an essential feature of trade unions&apos;internal government, and while the General Council are not aware ofany instance in which a union does not have a clearly defined procedure for calling strikes, and do not therefore believe that there is any need for major changes in this field, they will be considering whether theyshould define criteria for incorporation in rules relating to strikes.67 Particularly where local negotiations play an important part incollective bargaining, unions should ensure that their rules and internalprocedures, including communication systems, recognise the need forspeedy consideration of requests for advice and assistance in connectionwith a local dispute; this would both preserve the union&apos;s overallcontrol of policy and of bargaining strategy, and would also enhancethe status and effectiveness of shop stewards. There is some evidencethat modifications to union rules in this respect have often not kept in line with the changes in the pattern of collective bargaining. As localbargaining develops, and satisfactory procedures are agreed at factorylevel, unions may need to review their rules, and the General council will be examining what advice they might give unions in this respect.The role of shop stewards68 In relation to shop stewards and their functions, among thequestions which the General Council believe unions should examine,if they have not already done so, are, first, whether an extension ofwork-based branches and of committees or conferences of the union on a geographical or industrial basis provide a more efficient channel of communications between members and stewards and between stew-ards and full-time officials. Second, whether the existing number of union officials and the allocation of their responsibilities is sufficient to pro-vide stewards with adequate advice and assistance. Third, whether thetraining being provided by unions (and other bodies) is of the rightquality and quantity.
69 There are still many companies in which unions are not recognised,and where attempts to establish shop steward organisation are absolute-ly opposed. Some companies allow only minimal facilities and seek to restrict both the activities of shop stewards and the functions of full-time officials. Managements therefore have an important part to play in developing speedy and efficient communications by providing facili-ties for shop stewards to consult full-time officials and by affordingaccess to these officials to meet shop stewards.70 In those companies or factories in which only a single unionoperates, there are greater possibilities of establishing efficient channels of communication and consultation on the trade union side. Theaccountability of stewards both to the members in the workplace and tothe appropriate committees of the union can be more easily regularised.This accountability is not a question of imposing discipline or exertingauthority but is one of achieving close co-operation between stewardsand officials, between the different bodies of the union, and of obtaining a wider understanding of the framework of collective bargainingobjectives and of union policy within which the steward and the unionnegotiators at the different levels operate. These problems are moreacute in the more common multi-union situations discussed below.Joint shop stewards&apos; committees71 In many establishments there are a number of unions representingdifferent grades or occupations. In these circumstances, stewards haveto co-operate with stewards of other unions. In some industries, workscommittees or similar bodies may be provided for in the formalmachinery but this co-operation between stewards is more commonlyachieved through joint shop stewards&apos; committees which have beenformed spontaneously to fill a gap in the official machinery. Thesejoint shop stewards&apos; committees perform many useful functions, inparticular in assisting the development of common policies to meetcommon problems.72 Difficulties arise when the policy of these committees divergesfrom unions&apos; official policy and when action is taken which conflictswith unions&apos; rules. However, it has to be recognised that in some casespart of the difficulty stems from the divergent policies of unions and the differences in their rules. What does have to be recognised is thatstewards&apos; committees do have authority and responsibility and cannot therefore be excluded from consultation in the formulation of policy on bargaining.73 The extension and development of collective bargaining at factorylevel will give added responsibilities to joint stewards&apos; committees and
to shop stewards&apos; conveners. In particular bargaining situations, theresponsibility and authority of such committees is complementary to the responsibility and authority of executive committees and has a particularly close relationship with the priorities as seen by members on the shop floor. The General Council believe that union procedures which do not take full account of this are in need of modification.74 Many joint shop stewards&apos; committees have been extended tocover a number of plants within one company and between companieswhose employees have many interests closely in common, whether inrelation to a product or a geographical area. In the same way in whichjoint stewards&apos; committees have been formed within particular fac-tories, so combine committees have been formed in response to thesituation in which decisions by management on a combine basis appa-rently necessitated such a development.75 The major question which unions have to consider is whether theyhave evolved a relationship between full-time officials and shop stewards, in the context of collective bargaining, which is up-to-date and effective, given all the difficulties. The situation of a multi-union,multi-factory company would appear to be a particular source of difficulty arising from the complexity of the constitutional and organi-sational circumstances. The General Council believe that one principle which should be considered is whether there should generally be theopportunity whether or not this means a formal piece of joint unionmachinery for joint negotiators to put major agreements to stewards&apos;committees so that questions can be raised and answered before anagreement is signed.Shop stewards&apos; committees and district machinery76 The other major aspect of this problem is the relationship at locallevel of joint stewards&apos; committees to individual union district com-mittees and the district machinery of federations of unions or of theunions comprising the trade union sides of national joint negotiatingbodies. The question for unions to consider is whether the existingchannels of communication at district level and between the districtmachinery and national machinery are adequate, and in particularwhether there are still cases requiring reference upwards to national level which could best be left to the discretion of those at district level.77 In the coming years, this issue will clearly be increasingly important in view of the possibility that joint national machinery will leave morediscretion to local level, but on the basis of guidelines, or principles, orareas to be covered. There will clearly need to be more discussion onissues such as this between local and national level.
Ill  Recommendations to Congress78   The General Council therefore ask Congress:(i) To affirm that the trade union Movement is unalterably opposedto the proposal that the Government should take powers to imposestatutory financial penalties on workpeople or on trade unions in con-nection either with industrial disputes or with the compulsory regis-tration by trade unions of their rules.(ii) To affirm that some of the other proposals made by the Governmentfor changes in the system of industrial relations and in the law relating totrade unions could in principle help to improve industrial relations andto promote trade union objectives.(iii) To empower the General Council to take the further action whichthey propose for the purpose of assisting in the improvement of pro-procedures and in the settlement of disputes; and to submit to the 1969Annual Congress for formal approval appropriate changes in the relevant Rules of Congress.
Industrial Relations and Trade Union LawComments on Ministerial Proposals bythe TUC General CouncilAdopteddi January 7, 1069The TUC General Council have examined with care the proposals madeby the Government for changes in the system of industrial relations andin the law relating to trade unions. A number of the suggested changes those which relate to the establishment of a Commission for industrial relations and to the registration of procedure agreements; to the assurance to workpeople of the right to join trade unions and to tradeunions of the right to recognition; to the maintenance and indeed theextension of the protection now afforded to trade union activities by theTrade Disputes Act 1906, to the protection of workpeople againstunfair dismissal; to the extension of the jurisdiction of the IndustrialTribunals; to the provision of belter information for collective bar-gaining purposes; and to the removal of some obstacles to workers&apos;participation in management could in principle help to improveindustrial relations and to promote trade union objectives. The general council will wish to clarify certain aspects of these proposals in their further discussions with the Government. The General Council howeverare opposed to, or at least have reservations about, the Government&apos;sother proposals, and they wish to leave the Government in no doubt about the nature of those reservations and the strength of their ob-objections.The General CounciTs aim is to reach agreement with the Governmenton ways of improving industrial relations and of strengthening volun-lary collective bargaining. This is the test by which the General council have examined both the Report of the Royal Commission and theGovernments proposals-which in some significant respects discardadvice given unanimously by the Royal Commission. As the general council emphasised both in their evidence to the Royal Commissionand in their comments on the Report, Action on Donovan, trade union-ists recognise the need to make such changes in the structure and theactivities of their organisations as are required to promote the social and economic advance of the nation. Affiliated unions, in association with the TUC, are embarking on a detailed examination of how such
changes can best be made on the basis of voluntary action which isat the same time the foundation of free trade unionism and the essentialprerequisite if the men and women who together make up the tradeunion movement are themselves to accept such changes willingly. this process however would be impeded if the Government allowed itselfto be misled, against the advice of the Royal Commission, by outsidecriticism which is at best uninformed and at worst ill-intentioned. Anyattempt by Government to impose unreasonable and therefore uh-vvorkable constraints on the freedom of working people (o pursue (heirlegitimate objectives could only harm the relationships between thetrade union movement and the Government and between workingpeople and employers.Inter-union disputesThis danger is clearly illustrated by the Governmenfs proposal that, inan inter-union dispute, the First Secretary should have power to imposefinancial penalties on an employer who or a union which refuses tocomply with a recommendation by the OR that (he union should be excluded from recognition. The General Council are themselves con-ccrned that such disputes should be avoided or at least amicably settledwithout causing industrial disruption. They accept that arrangementsfor handling such disputes are one of their central responsibilities, andwill be considering, in the light of the Report of the Royal Commission,ways of strengthening TUC procedures in (he context of improvingtrade union organisation and cx(ending membership.The General Council accept the view of the Royal Commission that, inaddition to the development of the tuc&apos;s own activities in these directions, the CIR itself may well have a useful part to play in bringingpersuasion to bear on the unions involved, and indeed in influencingemployers&apos; recognition policies. The General Council do not exclude the possibility (hat in some situations the Government might add itsweight lo a recommendation by the CIR. They arc, however, convincedthat to impose financial penalties on a union, on the grounds that in aMinisters opinion such a dispute may cause economic damage, wouldmilitate against finding a genuine solution for this problem.Trade union development fund the General Council are by no means enthusiastic about the offer toestablish a stale-financed trade union development fund. The GeneralCounciTs consultations with unions following the Donovan Report will cover a range of matters from the development, reform and extension of collective bargaining to the reform of trade union structure and a
reduction of multi-unionism. The General Council will themselves haveto consider, in consultation with the unions concerned, ways in which any deficiencies can be rectified, hut experience gives no ground for believing that financial problems me a significant obstacle to nmalgn-nmtion, or that trade unionists are unwilling to recognise the need toincrease contributions where Executives can show thai (his is needed 16improve such services as training, education and research.Legal ciiforccubiliiy of collective agreement the General Council welcome the Ciovcrnmeufs acceptance of theview, argued by the TUC and endorsed by the Royal Commission, thatcollective agreements neither should nor in practice could be madelegally enforceable contracts by statute. They have noted the Govern-inenfs proposal that trade unions and employers&quot; associations shouldbe enabled, by an amendment of the Trade Union Act 1871, to enterinto contracts which would be legally enforceable by an agreementbetween the parties to write this expressly into the collective agreement.They are bound to point out, however, that there is very little prospectof unions or employers&quot; associations making use of such a provision.In any particular case it would lead to the same difficulty as would arisegenerally if all contracts were made legally enforceable by statute. Theprospect that judicial decisions might be required about the rights of a dispute would compel unions and employers to frame the terms of theagreement in such a way that they would be legally sustainable. A union would need to adopt in practice a quite novel relationship with its members by acting as their agent and committing them in procedure agreements, since individuals are not implicitly parlies to procedure agreements. There is also the danger that the introduction of legalterminology into collective agreements would make these less com-prehensible to the members. This would run counter to the need forcomprehensible and flexible agreements, particularly as companybargaining develops.Ballots on otliciul strikesThe General Council regard as completely misguided and quite un-acceptable the Governmenfs proposal to take discretionary powers torequire a union to conduct a ballot which, in a Ministers opinion,threatens economic damage, and to back these powers with the threat offinancial penalties. Here again the Government has disregarded the considered view of the Royal Commission, which pointed out that thereis little evidence for the view that workpeople are less likely to volefor strike action than their leaders. The experience of responsible trade
union loaders is dial lo remove from (hem (he right to exercise any responsibility is likely (o militate very strongly against confidence inunion leadership, and that unofficial action would he encouraged, notreduced, as a result. The resentment of trade unionists at such an inter-vention would be increased by (he proposal thai a Minister should decide the terms of (he question lo he incorporated in the ballot paperami to determine the appropriate majority (of two-thirds in somecases).There are also very serious practical objections (0 compulsory ballots.The timing of the ballot would clearly he crucial and the result coulddepend on this. There could also be a whole range of possible argu-menls about such things as entitlement to vole, and irregularities inarrangements under which a statutory procedure could give rise lo a real danger of injunctions and disputes about the proper procedure.These are matters which are the responsibility of responsible bodies inunions; there is no argument about the general record in the exerciseof these responsibilities in the past.The General Council do not question the right of the Government lodiscuss with a union which is contemplating an official strike the desira-bilily of holding a strike ballot. Advice from the Government would notbe lightly disregarded, but to go beyond this and to force an Executiveagainst ils judgment to hold a ballot, under the threat of financialpenalties, would worsen, not improve, (he situation.I liu oiis(i(u(ioiinl strikesThe Royal Commission made an exhaustive examination of proposalsthai statulorily enforceable procedures for imposing &quot;cooling-olT&quot;periods on uno.fTic.itvl and unconstitutional (and indeed on oilier) strikesshould be introduced. The Commission^ unanimous conclusion wasthat procedures of this sort would not be beneficial, and (hat (heGovernments powers should not be increased. Despite (his, (he (iovern-mentally. has proposed that it should lake reserve power lo impose such a procedure, and lo line individual workers who did not comply with anorder.The General Council do not believe that this proposal is either pi acti-eahle or desirable. Such a provision could not be applied where thereare no procedure agreements, blven where there are such agreementsthey are not legal contracts, and it is therefore difficult lo see how a judicial pronouncement could lay down when the procedure had been broken by individuals or groups (assuming that as a mailer of clo-menlary justice unions would be able lo appeal lo a Court against aMinisters decision). Moreover, it is not unlikely that trade unions,
whether or not as a result of pressure from the membership, would seek to make their procedure agreements so general in their terms thatthey would not give the Government the opportunity to initiate action:this would be the reverse of the development which the Royal Commis-sion cogently advocated. Finally, in terms of achieving the objectives of securing a resumption of normal working, even if it was possible to compel strikers to return to work, it would not be possible to prevent them, if they so chose, from working without enthusiasm (with which no conceivable law could deal).The Government acknowledges that it would not be possible to defineprecisely in a statute what strikes would be unconstitutional, or to defineat all in what circumstances its consequences were &quot;likely to be serious&quot;,and that these issues would have to be defined by the Minister con-cerned. The General Council do not accept that it accords with demo-cratic procedures to give a Minister unfettered discretion to invokepowers to fine workpeople solely on the grounds that in his opinion the results of a strike are likely to be serious, using such criteria as hemay think appropriate.The General Council fully share the Royal Commission^ concern thatthe causes of unconstitutional strikes should be removed, and also their view that the most constructive way of achieving this lies in reformingthe institutions of whose defects they are a symptom. The government proposal would in fact hinder such a reform.Compulsory trade union registration and the Independent Review BodyThe General Council set out at length in Action on Donovan their rea-sons for dissenting from the Royal Commissions recommendation that trade unions should be subjected to compulsory registration and shouldbe obliged by statute to ensure that their rule books cover certaindefined subjects. The Government is in fact proposing to go even further than the Royal Commission by adding one significant subject, strikeballots: apparently its intention is that, while unions would be free to frame the specified rules to meet their own requirements, this would notapply to strike ballots.The proposal that the matters to be dealt with in union rules shouldeffectively be statutorily determined, and that an independent review body should be established to ensure among other things that thestatutory requirements are adhered to, are not based on evidence thatthere is a serious problem which is not dealt with. Furthermore, theGovernment has apparently disregarded the General Council&apos;s assur-ance that they are to examine jointly with unions whether their rules are
satisfactory, and the possibility of instituting a procedure under the auspices of the TUC for hearing individual cases of complaints that a union&apos;s rules have not been fairly applied. The General Council do not accept that there is any justification whatever for the Government to pursue these two proposals unless and until it can produce evidencethat the General Council&apos;s own plans are not going to produce asatisfactory result.The General Council hope therefore that the Government will, before its White Paper is published, reconsider these issues in the light of theGeneral CounciPs comments and proposals for action and of the advice that it received from the Royal Commission.
Industrial Disputes(see paragraph 43)The General Council propose that Rule 11 as amended should read asfollows. (Note: the substantive amendments are printed in italics).Rule 11: Industrial Disputes(a) It shall be an obligation upon the affiliated organisations to keepthe General Council informed with regard to matters arising as betweenthem and employers, and/or between one organisation and another,including unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages of work, in parti-cular where such matters may involve directly or indirectly large bodies of workers. The General Council shall, if they deem necessary, dissemi-nate the information as soon as possible to all organisations which areaffiliated to the Congress, and which may be either directly or indirectlyaffected.(b) The general policy of the General Council shall be that unless re-quested to do so by the affiliated organisation or organisations con-cerned, the Council shall not intervene so long as there is a prospect of whatever difference may exist on the matters in question being amicablysettled by means of the machinery of negotiation existing in the tradesaffected.(c) If, however, a situation has arisen, or is likely to arise, in which other bodies of workpeople affiliated to Congress might be involved in a stoppage of work or their wages, hours and conditions of employmentimperilled the General Council may take the initiative by calling repre-sentatives of the organisation into consultation, and use their influence to effect a just settlement of the difference. In this connection theCouncil, having ascertained all the facts relating to the difference, maytender their considered opinion and advice thereon to the organisation or organisations concerned. Should the organisation or organisationsrefuse the assistance or advice of the Council, the General Council shallduly report to Congress or deal with the organisation under Clauses (b),(c), (d) and Qi) of Rule 13.(d) Where the Council intervenes, as herein provided, and the organi-sation or organisations concerned accept the assistance and advice ofthe Council, and where despite the efforts of the Council, the policy ofthe employers enforces a stoppage of work by strike or lock-out, theCouncil shall forthwith take steps to organise on behalf of the organisa-tion or organisations concerned all such moral and material support as the circumstances of the dispute may appear to justify.
Disputes between Affiliated Organisations(see paragraph 61)The General Council propose that Rule 12 as amended should read asfollows. (Note: the substantive amendments are printed in italics.)Rule 12: Disputes between affiliated organisations(a) Where disputes arise, or threaten to arise, between affiliated organi-sations, the General Council shall use their influence to promote asettlement.(b) It shall be an obligation on the affiliated organisation or organisations concerned to notify the General Council when an official stoppage ofwork is contemplated in any dispute between affiliated organisationswhether relating to trade union recognition, trade union membership,demarcation of work, or any other difficulty.(c) No affiliated organisation shall authorise such a stoppage of workuntil the dispute has been considered by the General Council, as providedby Clause (/) of this rule.(d) Where a dispute between unions has led to an unauthorised stoppage of work, it shall be an obligation on the affiliated organisation or organi-sations concerned to take immediate and energetic steps to obtain a resump-tion of work.(e) The affiliated organisation or organisations concerned shall notify the General Council as soon as possible of any stoppage of work which involves directly or indirectly large bodies of workers, or which if pro-tracted may have serious consequences. In addition to such notification,the affiliated organisation or organisations concerned shall inform theGeneral Council of the causes and circumstances of the dispute and of the steps they have taken, or are taking, to secure a resumption of work.(f) Upon notification from an affiliated organisation, as required byclauses (b) and (e) of this Rule, or upon the application of an affiliatedorganisation, or when they deem necessary, the General Council shallhave the power to investigate cases of dispute or disagreement betweenaffiliated organisations and to refer such cases to the Disputes Committee.(g) If the parties to a dispute fail to submit the case to the DisputesCommittee of the General Council as provided by this Rule, it shallnot be permissible for such dispute to be raised at any Annual Congress.(h) The General Council shall have power to summon the contendingaffiliated organisations to appear before the Disputes Committee of the
General Council, and to require such organisations to submit all evi-dence and information that the Disputes Committee may deem essentialto enable it to adjudicate upon the case.(i) If the result of such an inquiry be that the complaining organisationfails to prove the charge, it shall bear the whole cost of the investigationincluding the expenses incurred by the defending organisation.(j) Should any affiliated organisation not carry into effect any decisionof the General Council in connection with cases under this Rule theGeneral Council may at once issue a report to all affiliated organisa-tions. If the decision of the General Council is still not carried out,the General Council may, at their discretion, adopt either of the fol-lowing methods of procedure:The General Council may report the matter to the next AnnualCongress to deal with as may be decided upon; orDeal with the organisation under Clauses (b), (c), (d) and (h) ofRule 13.Appendix 4Rule 13: Conduct of Affiliated Organisations(a) If at any time there appears to the General Council to be justification for an investigation into the conduct of any affiliated organisation on theground that the activities of such organisation are detrimental to theinterests of the Trade Union Movement or contrary to the declaredprinciples and policy of the Congress the General Council shall sum-mon such organisation to appear before them or their appropriateCommittee by duly appointed representatives of such organisation inorder that such activities may be investigated. In the event of theorganisation failing to attend, the investigation shall proceed in itsabsence.(b) If after such investigation the General Council decide that theactivities of the organisation concerned are detrimental to the interestsof the Trade Union Movement or contrary to the declared principlesof Congress, the General Council shall direct the organisation to discontinue such activities forthwith and undertake not to engagetherein in the future.
(c) Should the organisation disobey such direction, or fail to give suchundertaking, the General Council are hereby empowered in their discretion to order that the organisation be forthwith suspended from membership of the Congress until the next Annual Congress.(d) The General Council shall submit a report upon the matter to thenext Annual Congress.(e) No affiliated organisation shall circularise, either in writing or bygeneral oral communication, other affiliated organisations upon any matter concerning the business of the Congress, without first securingthe General CounciFs authorisation for such circularisation.(f) Should any such unauthorised circularisation take place concerning a motion for the Agenda of the Annual Congress or any Special Congressor Conferences, and the General Council after investigation decide thatthose responsible for such motion connived at, or were party to, orconcerned with such circularisation, the motion shall not be includedin the Agenda.(g) The General Council may investigate any violation of the pro-visions of Clauses (e) and (f), and if after such investigation they decide that any organisation has acted deliberately in such violation they maydeal with the organisation by investigation, suspension and report underthe terms of Clauses (b), (c) and (d) of this Rule.(h) Any affiliated organisation dealt with under this Rule shall havethe right to appeal to the next Annual Congress and may appointdelegates in accordance with Rules 17 and 18 to represent the organisa-tion upon the appeal and at the Annual Congress if the appeal is allowed. Congress shall upon such appeal have final authority to dealwith the matter by way of re-admission, further suspension or ex-clusion from membership of the Congress.
