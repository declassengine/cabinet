UPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITSIMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC SERVICE SUPERANNUATIONSCHEMESThis paper discusses some of the problems that will arise in the public services if contributions to and benefits fromthe National Insurance flat-rate and graduated schemes arechanged as the Secretary of State for the Social Services has proposed in 0(69)50.   An annex containing further explanatorybackground will be circulated separately.Background.2.     Shortly after they had outlined their proposals for aState graduated pension scheme (GPS), Ministers of the lastadministration decided that public sector pension schemes should adopt one of two courses:(a) They might contract out of the GPS.(b) They might participate in the GPS, but abateoccupational benefits by the amount of benefitsaccruing from it.3.     The Civil Service National Staff Side, for example, although they objected strongly to the principle of abatement of occupational pension benefits on account of National insurance benefits, acquiesced in this decision,&apos; and it was decided,after discussions between Staff and Official Sides, to contract established civil servants out of the G.P.S.Unestablished civil servants, however, could not be contracted1

out, because their eligibility for pension depends on their being established; and the principle of full abatement of occupational benefits on account of benefits from the GPS hasbeen applied to those unestablished civil servants whosubsequently become established and so eligible for a CivilService pension in respect of their period of unestablishedservice.    (A small category of civil servants are also requiredto participate in respect of established service, but they donot give rise to special problems in this context.)k.     The only exception to the principle of abatement is thatGPS benefits of less than 2s. a week, and benefits deriving from the ^% contribution for earnings-related short-term benefits (which also earns benefit under the GPS) are ignoredon de, minimis grounds.5.     Whether the Staff Side would have accepted the choiceoutlined in paragraph 2 above if they had known that whethercontracted in or contracted out they would be compelled to pay2%% of earnings between  18 and  30 a week, and that benefits from the GPS would be dynamised, is a matter of conjecture.But in all probability they would have pressed their objectionsto the principle of abatement much harder.    If the Secretaryof State&apos;s proposals are approved, we must therefore expect tobe accused of unilaterally and retrospectively altering theterms on the strength of which the staff agreed to the choicedescribed in paragraph 2.    I understand that the problems maybe even more serious in those public services (the majority)that have contributory pension schemes, since contributions and benefits were adjusted so as to put contracted out andparticipating staff on a reasonably equal footing.    If theposition of participating staff is improved retrospectively,contracted out staff may complain that they have been giveninferior value for their total contributions.6.    ,Many of the nationalised industries will face a rather different problem.   They have elected to preserve equivalentpension benefits for those (contracted out) members of their pension schemes who have retired without other entitlement to2

a deferred or immediate pension.   These equivalent pension&quot;benefits have been preserved at the minimum level. If &quot;benefits from the GPS are dynamised, I understand that the nationalised industries concerned expect to come under pressure to dynamisethe equivalent pension &quot;benefits that they have preserved.   Theydo not regard the cost of doing so as their responsibility,and they will demand that the State scheme should givedynamism on equivalent pension benefits in respect ofcontracted out employment, or at any rate that they should beput in funds by the Government to give dynamism themselves.7.     In short, if the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals are accepted, we may face a major row with public service employees and a number of major public sector employers.Possible measures to reduce criticisms8.     Other objections apart, this is a particularly bad time toantagonise staff interests in the public services.    our proposed earnings-related State pension scheme will requirelarge-scale changes in existing public service pension arrange-raents.   To persuade staff to accept those arrangements willtake every ounce of goodwill that we can muster.    It thereforeseems wise to see what measures can be devised to reduce discon-tent if the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals are accepted.9.     It is true that contracted out employees will earnentitlement to GPS benefits through paying the highercontributions proposed.    Someone earning  30 a week or more,for example, would be entitled to a pension of about 3s. a week for service bet?/een November 1969 and April 1972.   However, theprinciple of abatement would require that a corresponding reduction should be made in occupational pension benefits.(By the same token, it would require deduction at anappropriately higher rate if the 3s. a week had been dynamisedbefore it came into payment.)10.   We cannot afford to abandon the principle of abatementaltogether.    In the Civil Service, for example, it wouldmean that the man who had been unestablished for part of hiscareer (and therefore a participator in the GPS) would be better

off than the man who had been established throughout; we shouldbe asked to reopen abated superannuation awards; and mostimportantly, it would call into question the policy of successive Governments of attempting to limit total benefits from State and occupational pension schemes to a reasonabletotal.   This would not only lead to demands for abandonment ofthe (partial) abatement of occupational benefits on account ofthe flat rate National Insurance pension (which would be expensive); it would also risk prejudicing the Government&apos;position in the review of public service occupational schemes to take account of the new earnings-related State scheme (see para. &quot;6 above).11.   However, to insist on. full abatement will add considerably to the resentment that we must anyway expect.    In my view thebest course will be to&apos; persuade staff interests to accept, sofar as possible, a continuation of the present position, withoutprejudice to the principles that each side considers right.That is, we for our part should agree in general not to abateoccupational benefits on account of GPS benefits earned by thenew 2^% contribution on earnings between  18 and  30 a week,nor to attempt to increase abatement on account of the dynamis-ing of GPS benefits.    In addition, we would not seek toincrease abatement in respect of the flat-rate national insurance pension, even though this abatement (which has stood at its present level since 19U8) is certainly inadequate.    these agreements would be without prejudice to our views on theprinciples that ought to govern the relationship between Stateand occupational pension benefits.    They could be justified asa short-term expedient for the limited period before the intro-duction of revised occupational schemes in 1972.12.   In return, the staff interests would have to agree to join with us in defending the anomalies that would result from this approach, and not to use our willingness to refrain from apply-ing the principles of abatement in present circumstances asan argument for its general abandonment.    (There could, ofcourse, be no question of buying the staff back into the GPSand agreeing not to abate occupational benefits on account ofthe resulting GPS benefits).k

13.   The general approach suggested in paras. 11 and 12 above will need to be discussed as soon as possible with staffleaders.    It may need modification in some details but not,I should hope, in principle in the light of their views.H4.    I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to consult the Civil Service staff leaders as soon as possible on these general lines.    No doubt those of my colleagues with rcsponsi-bilities for other public services will wish to act similarly.S.Civil Service Department, S..W.1.19th May. 1969

ANNEX TO S.S.(69)2kOPERATION OF ABATEMENT OF CIVIL SERVICE PENSIONS1.     Except in the case of employees who were in superannuableemployment on the 5th July 19U8, persons subject to occupational pension schemes in the public sector have their benefits abated(i.e. reduced) to take account of the flat rate national insurance retirement pension.   For a variety of reasons the rateof abatement has not been updated and is still related to the pension of 26s. per week payable to a single man in 19^-8.2.     Under the Graduated Pension Scheme (G.P.S.)&quot; a contributionrate of h-k% of pay between  9 and  18 a week is payable by employees and employers (i.e. in all).   In return for this contribution, a pension entitlement is established at the rateof sixpence a week for each  7 10s. paid by men ( 9 by women)ji.e. just over 1s. pension a week for each year of contributoryservice by a man  earning  18 a week.3.     The G.P.S. made provision for contracting out employees whowere members of an occupational scheme which provided benefitsat least as good as those offered by the G.P.S.    It was decided in consultation with the staff interests that the Civil service should be contracted out to the maximum extent possible.   this meant that those concerned received no G.P.S. benefit and paidno G.P.S. contribution.   But since the G.P.S.  contribution income was being used in part to finance a deficiency in thefund for the flat rate scheme, which has no provision for contracting out, those contracted out of the G.P.S. were required to pay somewhat higher contributions to the flat ratescheme.   At present a male Class I employee over the age of 18pays 168.8a. if he participates in the G.P.S.  (i.e., iscontracted in) but 19/1 d.. if he is contracted out of it.h.     It was not possible to contract all civil servants outof the G.P..S.    Those who could not be guaranteed a pension bythe National Insurance retiring ages (65 for a man, 60 for a woman) - i.e. because they were unestablished and therefore notpensionable or because they were very late entrants and could not qualify for a civil service pension by these ages - were obliged1

to participate.    Some of them, however, could subsequentlyqualify for a civil service pension.   The unestablished onbecoming established could reckon their unestablished serviceand the late entrants might serve on beyond the retiring age to complete the 10 year qualifying period.    In these circum-stances they would qualify both for a Civil Service pension andfor a G.P.S. pension.   This was considered likely to lead toover-provision of pension and powers were therefore taken toreduce the Civil Service pension by the amount of the G.P.S.pension.5.     In 1966, G.P.S.  contribution rates were raised by ^% aside (employees and employers) on all earnings between  9 and 30 a week.   This increase was to finance short-term earnings-related sickness and unemployment benefits and it was payable byall, contracted out and participating employees alike and, for both, it reckons for G.P.S. pension.    It would have been inaccordance with established policy to increase the abatement ofCivil Service pensions to affect the additional G.P.S. pensionearned by this increased contribution.   It was decided, however,that no such action should be taken both because the amountof pension in question was so small (a ^% contribution at the top rate of  30 a week generates a pension of only aboutfourpence a week for each: year of contributory service) and because it was already apparent by then that a radical reviewof the relationship between State and occupational pension benefits could not be long delayed.6.     Other public service pension schemes abate the occupational pension to offset flat rate and graduated National insurance pensions following the same basic principles as those applied in the Civil Service, but the precise manner in which the abatement is determined varies from scheme to scheme.   Forthe contributory schemes appropriate adjustments are made in both employers&apos; and employees&apos; contribution rates.
