9(69^68 COPY NO. ^iLL6ttl.JlSiB5i_l.i69CABINETDISJPUJTJ^AT^^Memorandum by the F i^sJ^Secretary^J^jStajt^and secretary of State for Employment and ProductivityGeneralMy colleagues may wish to know the background to the presentLeyland strike.2.     The company (now part of British Leyiand Motor Corporation),which has had a somewhat paternalistic tradition and a long history of peaceful labour relations, consists of five plants in the Preston areaemploying some 8,500 manual workers, about half of whom are piece-workers.3.     Following a one-day stoppage of 200 piece-workers, a claim wasmade on 30th April for a substantial pay increase for a group of employees in one plant and was extended on 8th May to cover all piece-workers in the five plants.    Behind the claim lies some dissatisfaction with anomalies in the present piece-work system, and there is also a desire, to which the Leyland-BMC merger has given added point, toreduce the gap between Midland and Leyland rates.    No formalapplication was, however, made to the management before 30th April.In the following week there were several joint discussions within thecompany, ending on 16th May in a works conference, the final domesticstage under the engineering procedure.4.     Since the strike began the company and the EngineeringEmployers1 Federation have had discussions on 3rd June with theAmalgamated Engineering and Foundry Workers Union (AEF) (which represents the majority of the strikers and has insisted on monopolisingthe negotiations on the union side&quot; although members of nine other unions are involved).    The Joint Parliamentary Secretary of my Departmentlias had separate exploratory discussions with both sides on 3rd and4th June, and officials of my Department had very lengthy talks with thetwo sides on 11th and 12th June.    In all three cases the aim was to seek a basis for a return to work but this has not proved possible.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

The Procedural position.     The engineering procedure provides that there should be nostoppage of work until a claim had been taken by the unions through the external stages of procedure, i. e. local conference and if necessarycentral conference.    In the past the Leyland management have persuadedthe unions to make settlements at domestic level with only extremelyrare references to the external stages of procedure and Mr, Scanlon ofthe AEF, which made the strike official   on 10th June, argues that hisunion is merely following past tradition and that it is not open to themanagement to involve the external stages of procedure, which would inany case be inappropriate for handling the complexities of the revisionof the piece-work system.    This is hardly a tenable position in that inthe past reference to the external stages has largely been avoided becauseagreement has been reached at domestic level, and the point currentlyat issue is not the detailed revision of the piece-work prices, but thebasis on which the revision should be conducted.The unions claim and the Company^ offer6.     The need for a general review of the large number of piece-workprices and for a general increase is accepted by the management, butthis will inevitably be a lengthy business, and the immediate point a tissue is the basis of revision and the interim arrangements which would flow from it.    The claim is j(a) There should be a guarantee for the average male piece-workerof 200 per cent bonus, i. e,     piece-work earnings (earningsover and above the piece-worker&apos;s basic rate of  5. 5s andpiece-worker5s supplement of  7, 18s. 8d,) should be200 per cent of the basic rate.    The present average bonusis 165 per cent,(b) Women piece-workers should receive the same percentage bonne(c) Inexperience workers should receive a minimum wage of 18. 10s. for 12 weeks.During the discussions on 11th and 12th June, the company offered aminimum of 190 per cent bonus for new piece-work i-this was acceptedby the union on 11th June - and of 170 per cent on existing jobs, withpro rata increases (i. e. somewhat lower percentages) on the womenrsbonus rate.    The company*s offer would raise the present average earnings for male piece-workers from  21, 15s to  23- 24, as against 26. 10s. if the union&apos;s claim were granted.    On item (c), agreement was reached on a rate for inexperienced labour of  18.-2-

The Breakdown7.     The talks on 11th and 12th June under Department of employment and Productivity (DEP) chairmanship were abruptly broken off by theunion.    Mr. Scanlon indicated on the morning of 12th June that although he had been prepared to accept the company&apos;s offer of a190 per cent bonus for new work, this was not really acceptable to themen.   He said he was nevertheless prepared to stick by his bargain,but only if the management were prepared immediately to settle allother outstanding items on the unionrs terms.    The management, whosegeneral approach to the negotiations had been somewhat indecisive,had not reached a decision how they should react to the new positiontaken up by Mr. Scanlon, when Mr, Scanlon and his colleagues walkedout of the talks.    At a meeting of the strikers at Ley land later the same day, there was a unanimous vote in favour of continuing the strike.The Outlook: &apos; - i\ : h;,.:;:;&apos;;. ; ;8.     The union&apos;s walkout was 330 doubt dictated by tacticalconsiderations.   The main aim was probably to strengthen their handvis-a-vis the management but there is also a possibility that since thereis strong local pressure (reinforced no doubt first by the hope and nowby the fact of union support), a compromise solution at that stage mightwell have been rejected by the men.    On the company &apos;s side, there havebeen signs over the past ten days of an anxiety tc bring the strike to anend at an early date, even at the expense of concessions.    Apart fromthe 8,5 00 employees on strike at the company*s plants in Lancashire,2,5 00 have been laid off at Albion Motors, Glasgow, and 2,500 at Jaguar,Coventry.     5 million worth of output has been lost from theLancashire factories and  2^ million from other plants, much of it forexport.    There is a possibility of some overseas markets beingpermanently affected.    Against this background, the company arelikely to seek through the Engineering Employers Federation an early opportunity of resuming taJks.B. A. C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.
