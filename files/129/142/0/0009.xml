GOC(69) 59 COPY NO.___20th May. 1969CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS bill memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and ProductivityI was authorised (CC(69) 17th Conclusiona) to prepare an InterimIndustrial Relations Bill, for introduction in this Session of Parliament,to give effect to the proposals in the White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;regarding(i)  the right of employees to belong to a trade union;(ii)  the recognition of trade unions by employers (includingrecognition disputes between unions);(iii) the conciliation pause;(iv) the establishment of an Industrial Board; and(v) disqualification from unemployment benefit where there is a trade dispute.2.       As my colleagues will be well awate the Prime Minister and I arestill engaged in discussions with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) aboutthe proposals for dealing with unconstitutional strikes and with inter-union recognition disputes;  and these discussions may well lead me to propose some modification to the provisions which we shall want toinclude in the Bill.    It is therefore too early to seek to reach any final decisions on these particular matters.    In view of the fact that it hasbeen decided to delay the final formulation of these provisions until after the special congress of the TUC on 5th June, the time availablefor the consideration of the Bill after that date will be limited.    In order,therefore, to save time, I invite my colleagues tc consider and approve the other provisions of the Bill which are relatively uncontroversial forthe TUC.    I am therefore attaching, as an Annex to thic memorandum,a summary of these clauses.-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJE5TYrS GOVERNMENT)

3,       The Industrial Relations Committee has already considered insome detail the provisions of the Bill, and the Annex takes account of thevarious points agreed in discussion by that Committee.Right, of employees to belong to a trade union4.      There was some difference of view, in the Industrial relations committee,as to whether the sanctions provided for in the Bill against an employer who prevented his employees belonging to a trade union should take the form of a fixed amount of damages payable to the employee or of a penalty exacted by the State.    It was suggested that itwould be undesirable, as a matter of legal principle, to provide for a fixed amount of damages of  100 since this would have the effect ofconfusing the ideas of damages for breach of contract and of penalties for contravening a statutory duty.    On the other hand, there are good reasons for treating an infringement of the right of an employee to belong to a trade union as a matter which should give rise to compensationfor the employee; and we need to ensure that the damages payable inthis situation take account of injuries on which it is very difficult to puta precise financial value.    I was invited to discuss this issue further with the Law Officers;  and I will let my colleagues know whatconclusion we reach.    I am, however, persuaded that it would not bedesirable - as I originally proposed - for me to have power to increasethe figure of  100 by Order.Application to the Crown5k      The Industrial Relations Committee agreed that it was desirable,as a general principle, chat the provisions of the Bill should apply to crown servants (though not to the armed forces or the police).    TheCommittee recognised, however, that there was a constitutional problemof empowering one Minister to make Orders, and possibly even to takeproceedings against, other Ministers.    I was invited to discuss this problem with the Law Officers.    In the light of their advice, I can see no good reason for not allowing civil servants, like employees elsewhere,the right to trade union membership.    Much greater difficulty arises,however, on the recognition provisions since, under the Bill as drafted,I might have to make an Order requiring a Government Department torecognise (or exclude from recognition) a union which it had been unwilling to recognise or negotiate with.    I could also be put in a situationwhere, in the unlikely event of the Department contravening an Order, Ishould have to take proceedings against one of my colleagues.    Thiswould clearly be unacceptable.    I therefore propose that we should attempt to achieve by a slightly different procedure the same effect inthe Civil Service as is achieved in the private sector by the making ofa recognition Order.    The procedure I envisage would be the following^-2-

(i)  I should be empowered to refer recognition problems involvingGovernment Departments to the Commission on industrial relations (CIR).(ii)  The recommendations of the CIR should be binding on theCrown without the need for me to make a formal Order.I do not think it would be desirable or necessary to provide for recourseby the union or unions concerned to unilateral arbitration if a GovernmentDepartment failed to implement the recommendations of the CIRs wherea Government Department assumes an obligation of this kind we may reasonably plead that this obligation will be fully honoured.    Where the recognition issue involves an inter-union dispute, broadly the same procedure might be applied: and I would similarly propose that thereshould be no sanction against a Government Department, both for thereasons given above and because this would require me to takeproceedings before the Industrial Board against a colleague.    It is forconsideration, however, whether In the inter-union dispute there ought,nonetheless, to be power to take proceedings against a trade union whichattempted, by strike action, to compel or induce a GovernmentDepartment to disregard a recommendation of the CIR.    In my view there is no reason why we should treat such a union any differently froma union which attempts to compel an employer in the private sector tocontravene an inter-union recognition dispute order,6.      I believe that similar considerations to those above apply also to health service employees, since trade unions representing theseemployees negotiate nationally through a Whitley Council on themanagement side of which the Department of Health and Social Securityis represented.    I would therefore propose that we might adopt a similar procedure for recognition disputes in the health service.Inter-Union Recognition Disputes; Penalties7.      I am not asking my colleagues to reach a final decision at thisstage as to whether the Government should or should not implement theWhite Paper proposals regarding inter-union recognition disputes.    Iwould, however, welcome their views on one question which was discussed by the Industrial Relations Committee, but on which no clear decision was reached.    This is the question of financial penalties for contraveningan inter-union recognition order,    I had proposed that the maximumpenalties which might be imposed on an employer (for failure to recognisea union or for continuing to negotiate with an excluded union) and on a union (for inducing an employer to contravene an inter-union recognitionorder) should be the same, namely,  10, 000.    It was argued that thiswould prove a relatively larger penalty to the majority of unions than itwould be to a firm of any size; and it was therefore suggested that the-3-

appropriate maximum penalty for a union should be  5, 000,    I was invited to consider this point further.    On reflection, I have come tothe conclusion that, whatever the figure we may decide upon, it wouldbe difficult to justify a different and lower maximum penalty for tradeunions because, in the typical Inter-union dispute, it will generally bethe trade unions action which will tend to undermine the Secretary ofScatets order.B0A0 C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.

ANNEXINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILLSUMMARY OF DRAFT CLAUSESA.    RIG-HT TO MEMBERSHIP OF-A TRADE UNION1.     It is to be a term of all contracts of employment that the employershall not do anything to prevent or deter the employee from being orbecoming a member of a trade union;    and any provision in a contract whichprecludes or penalises the exercise of the right to belong to a union will be void.   The right is to belong to some union, not a particularunion;   but an employer is not to be able to require an employee to belong to a &quot;house union&quot; rather than any other union.2.     Where an action by an employee against an employer for breach ofthe term is successful, the employer is to pay him  100.   This sum willbe regarded in the same way as liquidated damages for the breach;   itwill not affect entitlement to damages, or other remedy, for breach ofany other term of the contract, or for wrongful dismissal, provided the dismissal is wrongful for another reason (e.g. because notice was not given).3.     The Contracts of Employment Act 1963 is to be amended so as torequire an employer to include in the written particulars of an employee5sterms of employment, a statement that he may belong to a trade union and whether he is to belong to a specified union.4-.     Any rule of a friendly society (registered under the friendly societies Act 1896) which excludes from membership or benefits, orpenalises in any way, a member of any trade union, or of a particularunion, will be void.B.   RECOGNITION OF AND NEGOTIATION WITH TRADE UNIONS(Viflaere there is no dispute between unions)5.     Where it appears to the Secretary of State that there is nointer-union dispute, but an employer has not somplied with a requestof one or more unions to recognise and negotiate with it or them, shemay refer the matter to the C.I.R.    If the C.I.R. recommends that the/ employer

employer should comply with the union request, the Secretary of state shall make an order giving effect to the C.I.R.&apos;s recommendations to theextent that the employer has not at the time of the order alreadyvoluntarily complied with these recommendations.   The order will requirethe employer to recognise one union (or more than one) and to negotiate with it (them) either generally or to the extent specified.   The order may cover some or all employees, and may be restricted in its applicationto national, regional or local levels.    The ordor may be neither variednor revoked without further reference to the C.I.R.6.     If, at any time more than 2 months after an order has been madeunder paragraph 6, a union complains that the employer has not complied with the order in any respect, the union may submit its complaint tothe Secretary of State together with a claim that the employer shouldobserve terms and conditions of employment (which may be any terms or conditions relating to matters on which the employer has an obligationto bargain under the order).   If the Secretary of State is satisfiedthat the union has supplied sufficient information to enable theoomplaint and claim to be- heard,  she will refer them to the industrial court.   If the Court decides that the complaint is well-founded and thatthe claim ought to be conceded (or that other terms and conditions oughtto be observed by the employer) the Court may make a binding award.The award will have effect as an implied term of contract and may be retrospective but not beyond to the date the union submitted its claimto the Secretary of State.   There is to be no bar against a unionsubmitting a complaint and claim on more than one occasion if the employer continues to defy an order.C.    INDUSTRIAL BOARD7.     The Board will have a legally qualified President (appointed jointlyby the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State), who will be either the President or one of the Independent members of the Industrial Court.The Board&apos;s other members will be drawn from the legally qualifiedindependent members, the employer members, and the employee members ofthe Industrial Court.   The Board&apos;s composition for the purpose of anyparticular proceedings will be a chairman, an employer and an employeemember chosen by the President.   The chairman may either be the Presidentor an independent member appointed by him.   One of the independent members may be appointed to be a vice-president.   If there is no/vice-president,

vice-president, and the President is unable to perform his functions,the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State may appoint an independentmember to act in his place.D, UNEMPLOYMENT AMD SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT8.     Section 22(i) of the National Insurance Act 1965 and Section 10 ofthe Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 are to be amended to deletethe references to &quot;financing&quot; and to membership of a &quot;grade or class&quot;,and so to narrow the grounds on which an employee laid off because ofa strike may be denied unemployment benefit or supplementary benefit.These changes are to come into effect from an &quot;appointed day&quot; determinedby the Secretary of State in an order made by statutory instrument,E, APPLICATION TO THE GROWN3*     For the purposes pf those sections dealing with the right to tradeunion membership, the conditions under which any person serves in theoivil service will be deemed to be a contract of employment.Wt   In recognition cases., the recommendations of the C.I.R. shall be binding on the Crown (except in respect of members of the armed forces or the police))   but no provision should be made for resort to unilateralarbitration on the use of sanctions against Government Departments.(SECRET
