NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMES&apos;REPORT ON SERVICE pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence the Reference to the board as explained in Annex A, Service pay is by Government decision a standing Reference to the Prices and Incomes Board.    On the 30th May,1568, following the publication of the Board&apos;s Report on Service pay(Cmnd 3651), I said in Parliament that:-a. the Government welcomed the Board&apos;s intention to undertake a thorough-going review designed to examine the feasibility of evaluating Service jobs and comparing them with those incivil life by methods which would reduce to the minimum thenecessity for subjective judgement; and, as a relatedquestion, to examine the basic structure of Service pay and allowances;b. the Board has been asked to complete its review within ayear in order that, consistently with current incomes policy,any new system of pay that might be desirable in the lightof this review, could be introduced as soon as practicable;c. the Government were determined that&apos; any new system whichwas adopted to improve the Grigg formula should be fair tothe Services and play its part in ensuring that we have thenecessary number of recruits.I   The Board&apos;s Report is now ready, and we have announced that it will)e published about the middle of June.    Both in the form and in thescope of their recommendations the Board have exactly fulfilled ourm advertised remit to thern.I-   For the last twelve months we have been criticised for failing tojonour the obligations to the Forces implicit in the Grigg system, andfor withholding from them a part of what they would have got under&apos;rigg.   Our defence has been founded on the Standing Reference to thetod, and both Parliament and the Forces have accordingly been led tospect much of the Board&apos;s review.   We cannot now reject recommendations*Meh fulfil our explicit mandate;    which are strongly argued on their11ni merits;    which are consistent with Incomes Policy;    and on whichJttr own Defence policy depends.   To shuffle in the face of the Board&apos;s^commendations would further damage recruiting and morale;    and wefcoulfl be compelled,  in the end, to apply costly remedies for which we;0uld gain no credit.    In fact, I believe that the Board&apos;s recommenda-&apos;lons, quite apart from considerations of equity and necessity,Resent   a valuable major reform in Defence administration.A dominating consideration must be the grave and continuing shortageCONFIDENTIAL/of ...

0f recruits.   As the Report points out, we are one of the very fewnations maintaining all-regular Forces, who must he professional,highly trained, effective and versatile.    In all Arms the task of theindividual Serviceman has grown more complex and technical;    and the qualifications required of him are rising steadily.   As the Boardobserve, we are dealing with a group that is broadly representative ofthe population as a whole in its origins and education.   And we arefacing increasing competition from civilian employers, at a time whenthe number of young men available for recruiting is declining,  through a past fall in the birth rate and because more young men continue infull-time education.5i   In the Defence White Paper 196S I said that I needed to recruit38,000 male other ranks last year.    If we had recruited the same proportion of those available as we did in 1965/66, we should have recruited37,000.   In fact we recruited under 29,000,  a shortfall of nearly a quarter.   Even when the rundown of the Forces is complete we shall continue to need at least 35,000 recruits a year if we are to maintainthe force levels required by our published Defence policies.    In spiteof a slight improvement in recent months,  there is no sign whateverthat a solution is in sight. , Moreover the field of recruitment willcontinue to shrink until the mid-1970s.   On recent trends we could expect to recruit only about two-thirds of the annual long-terra requirelent.6.   Over and above the deficiencies in total numbers there are serious;signs of imbalance and shortages;    and poor recruiting will lead toundermanning, dissatisfaction,  and still poorer recruiting.7,   Table 8 of Appendix I to the Report is significant.    It shows thatanong other ranks where the shortfall in recruiting is greatest, lowpay is most generally regarded as the greatest disincentive to a service career.    Even though re-engagement of personnel already servingis fairly satisfactory at present, it would be unlikely to survive a failure to carry out improvements recommended &quot;by the Board.8.   The consequences of failure to solve the recruiting problem, andto encourage re-engagement among those already serving, are clear.Compulsory military service will he the only means of maintaining ourpromised contributions to NATO.   Preliminary studies have shown thatthis would raise military and economic problems quite as formidable asthe obvious political difficulties.Ihe Board1 s short-term recommendations.    In Chapter 3 of their Report the Board are in no doubt that the manpower shortage faces the Services with a problem which is rapidlybecoming critical and will combine .to get worse in the 1970&apos;s.   Forthese reasons they believe that an increase in Service pay is justifiednow, as a necessary step towards solving the manning problem.10.  The Board&apos;s short-term recommendations are as follows:a. an increase of 3i% on basic pay, additional pay and marriage allowance, back dated to the 1st April, 1969, a global sumof  1hM.   The Board refer to this as a step tov/ards replacing the existing structure of Service pay in the long-term bya comprehensive &quot;military salary&quot;;b. new scales of pay for Service Doctors and Dentists, withinthe global sum, to bring Service Doctors near to paritywith GPs in the National Health Service, for the reasonsset out in detail at Annex B;

removal of all -financial and other discrimination againstmarried officers and other ranks on grounds of age.    TheBoard refer to independent evidence that the man penalizedtoy existing restrictions, toeing necessarily junior in rank and low paid, is suffering considerable hardship, to the detriment of morale, efficiency, recruitment and re-engage-ment.   To pay the same rate of marriage allowance to olderand younger married men would cost atoout  0.6M in a full year;    this would need to toe met out of bhe glotoal sum.    but all other allowances which under-age married Servicemen areat present denied are compensatory allowances,  i.e. theyare designed either to reimburse expenses necessarily incurredtoy Servicemen in the course of their duty or,  in the caseof separation allowance,  to compensate for hardship.   Theydo not therefore form part of the Serviceman&apos;s pay,  and theBoard recommend that the cost, estimated at atoout FA .0M ina full year, should toe met outside the global sum;d. issue of ration allowance to married men on a continuing&quot;basis when serving &apos;away from home.    The Board describe thisrecommendation as designed to remove a current anomaly whichis a source of considerable resentment amongst all married men, and frequently results in financial hardship.    TheBoard recommend that this change, costing approximately U.5M up to the end of the current Financial Year, shouldtoe financed outside the glotoal sum;e. certain changes in the rules governing the issue of educationallowance, again designed to remove disabilities which theBoard regard as one of the major disincentives to re-engage-ment, at a cost estimated to toe of the order of FA .UM per year, outside the glotoal sum;f. other changes in the regulations governing certain forms ofadditional pay, which are of great importance to the services concerned, tout are of marginal financial significance;    thesecosts, some  50,000 a year all told,  to toe met within theglotoal sum.The Board&apos;s Long-Term Recommendations11&apos;  A &quot;Military Salary&quot;.   The Board recommends that for the long-term a new pay code should be worked out and introduced with effect fromthe 1st April,  1970, under which the discrimination in pay between the married and the single Serviceman would toe abandoned and all Servicemenregardless of their marital status would receive a common &quot;basic salarysubject to tax;   tooth married and single men would pay quartering oraccommodation charges to toe deducted at source from taxed pay.    Singlemen provided with food at public expense would pay a standard rationcharge, though this would toe remitted in circumstances specified inthe Report.12.  This recommendation is &quot;based on the following&apos; considerations:a.     in no other walk of life is there differentiation betweenthe&apos; remuneration of married and single men.    The administra-tion of the existing system has been unsatisfactory, in thatthere has been no agreed system for the review of marriage allowance.    The present differentiation is regarded as outof date within the Services.    Potential recruits cannot beexpected to understand it,  and it is therefore likely to toea disincentive to enlistment;

X),     civilian pay does not distinguish married men from single1 men;    this function is left to income tax.    Since theServiceman pays income tax in the same way as a civilian,the single man suffers discrimination;I      c.     the present system offers the lowest emoluments to singlemen,  that is to those whom the Services are particularly anxious to recruit;d.     the present combination of pay, allowances and benefits in kind is so complicated that it is difficult to convey topotential recruits what their earnings in the Services willbe, or even for Servicemen themselves to calculate what their true earnings are.1.13,  la tne view of the Board the most satisfactory way of overcomingthese difficulties would be to pay all Servicemen a comprehensive salarywhich would, be subject to tax in the normal &quot;way.    Out of it they would be required to jjay for food, lodging and clothing (excluding uniform)Ilike any civilian.    This principle has already been adopted by the[Canadian Armed Forces in 1966, and is currently under consideration in the United States.    The Board recommend that charges for married quarters[should be related to the cost of comparable civilian housing, thatI charges for single accommodation should he related partly to the costI to the Government of the accommodation provided and partly to the^charges for married quarters (with a reduced charge for sub-standard^accommodation);    and that ration charges should be assessed by the(same formulae as are now used for assessing ration allowances.fill.  Job Evaluation.    The Board has concluded that job evaluation[techniques should be used to obtain data on Service and civilianfrelativities on which together with other factors,  to base new pay levels within the framework of the &quot;military salary&quot; concept.    It hascommissioned two firms of management consultants to work with thei Services and the Board to carry out this task.    It will however be forthe Services themselves to determine how the relativities which willi emerge from this study can he fitted into their rank and trade; structures.X-Factor&quot;. I The Board observe that there will remain some15.  the elements in Service life which may withstand any attempt at measurementin relation to standards obtaining outside - the liability to danger,turbulence, and what they describe as the adverse balance of Serviceconditions of employment as compared with those generally prevailing ^in civilian employment.   The BOard propose to continue their study ofthese especially onerous conditions of Service life, which they term the &quot;X-factor&quot;, observing that it is probably desirable that compensa-tion for the &quot;X-factor&quot; should be expressed as a percentage additionto pay.   They propose to examine this question in the light of the new rates of pay to be assessed by job evaluation.Cost!by the :-,ofinancialnot all o1st AprilQf Dust uabove thehort Term.

17.  bong Term.   In the long-term, the restructuring of Service pay inaccordance with the &quot;military salary&quot; principle, with the relativelyheater increases which it implies for single men, will in itselfinvolve an increase estimated at  52.5*- gross per annum (excluding thecost of the ration allowance concession covered, in the short-term proposals) on the Defence &quot;Budget, but no more than  -j6M net exchequer cost after tax.    (Appendix V of the Report:    the exact figures dependon levels of charges still to be determined).    But the long-term levels0f pay and the total cost of implementing the Board&apos;s recommendationscan only be worked out finally toy the evaluation of Service jotos andthe Quantification of the &quot;X-Factor&quot;.rMmparison with the Grigg Formula.18.   In order to put these cost figures into perspective it is useful&apos;to&apos;consider what the implications of persisting with the G-rigg formulawould have been.   A return to the G-rigg formula would,  in fact, toe theonly oractical alternative open to us, and the only one which couldconceivatoly toe acceptable to the Forces.19.  By comparison with an increase of 7fo for all Servicemen last year the civilian analogues of Service officers under the Grigg formula lastyear also received an increase of 7%;    while if the movement of the pay of other ranks had continued to toe governed last year toy the Griggformula relating it to movements in the Index of Average IndustrialEarnings, they would have received an additional increase of atoout 3%,making 10  in all.    The gain in cash to the Services compared with whatthey actually received last year would, have &quot;been some  8M.    From 1stJanuary, 19^9, however the Civil Service analogues of Service officers have received a further increase averaging h% which was the second stage of the increase awarded to them in 1968,  and it is now proposedthat they should toe offered a further 5a with effect from 1st July,1969 - atoout another 9&apos;;;-&apos; in all.    as regards the civilian analogues ofother ranks,  the movement in the Index of Average Industrial Earningshas recorded compound increases totalling atoout 19-7/  up to 31st October,1968, by comparison with the 7/- increase for other ranks last year.Even after adding the increase of just under 4g in basic pay now proposedto the 7/;- which they received last year    the Services will, on the Griggformula, still be lagging toy atoout 5&apos;,- for officers and over 8&apos;;-, forother ranks - say  25M per annum;    to offset which the Board have proposed measures other than pay amounting to no more than  6.5M.20,  As for the longer term the only relevant cost comparison which canjbe applied at the moment is the hypothetical cost of applying the Griggsystem up to 1 .4.70, the date when the Board have it in mind that their long term recommendations should take effect.   This cost cannot toeprecisely estimated, since it involves extrapolating to 1 .4.70 pay increases awarded to the civilian analogues of officers and movementsjin the Index governing the pay of other ranks, on which the Griggformula was &quot;based.    It has been provisionally estimated, however, thatthe total cost of continuing with the Grigg formula might have &quot;beenft high as  77M (gross) -  52M net - per annum.    The detailed calcula-pona are in Annex C.    By comparison, the gross cost of the measures recommended toy the Board and actually put into effect last year wask7M per annum;    to this must toe added the cost of the short term measures now recommended toy them ( 20.5M), and the estimated gross cost;of the long term restructuring of Service pay ( 52.5M per annum) - sayf total of  1001:1 gross ( 70!:; net) per annum.f*  However in considering the cost implications of the Board&apos;s longperm proposals, there is a valid distinction between questions ofPrinciple on the one hand, - the adotption Jof the &quot;military salary&quot;/concept ...! CONFIDENTIAL

concept and the use of job evaluation techniques, - and on the otherhand the determination of the precise levels of pay which might emerge from job evaluation and the quantification of the &quot;X-factor&quot;.    Theonly cost to which we should be committing ourselves by acceptance ofthe &quot;military salary&quot; is that in paragraph 17 above ( 52.5M gross peraanum).   It will be for Ministers to decide separately, in the lightof the Board1 s eventual proposals on levels of pay, what further sumsshould be allowed.rwAusions22,  The main conclusions which I draw from the Board&apos;s report andrecommendations are as follows:a. the short-term recommendations rex^resent an increase notexceeding 3i/^ on pay,  additional pay and marriage allowance,and an increase of just under k% on basic pay.    The Servicesthemselves (and our vjolitical critics) will not regard them as more than partially restoring the award of which theywere deprived last year with the abandonment of the Griggformula, x^Fticularly in view of the recent award to CivilServants and of the further general increase in industrialearnings.   The increase now proposed is, in the opinion ofthe Board, the minimum required both in order to fulfil the Government&apos;s moral obligations and to prevent a further serious decline in recruitment and re-engagement;b. at the same time,  this increase will not, of itself, raiserecruitment to the required level;    for this the prospect ofa radically better future is needed.   The concept of some formof &quot;military salary&quot; is the only prospect available to us;c. this concept in any case accords with the pattern of lifefor the Services in future.   As a result of our defence policy decisions Servicemen will in future spend much more time inthe United Kingdom, and, because of this, military and non-military interests are becoming increasingly closely linked,with the effect of emphasising civilian values and styles of organisation in the Services.   There has been a continuingtrend away from combat type jobs to technical and supx^ortfunctions similar to those found in many areas of civilianlife.   However, in many fields, the weight of the &quot;,X-factor&quot;has, at the same time, been increased rather than diminished:Servicemen will remain liable to danger and turbulence, andto the general uncertainties, strains and restrictionsdescribed in paragraphs 2\\-2h of the Board&apos;s Report, but willhave fewer compensating opportunities for travel andadventure than in the past;d. the cost of accepting the principle of the &quot;military salary&quot;in itself would not be greatly in excess of the cost ofmaintaining the Grigg formula;e. the job evaluation methods recommended by the Board meet our public acceptance of the need to &quot;reduce to the minimum the necessity for subjective judgement&quot; in establishingleVels of pay.    These methods have been developed with theassistance of all the Departments concerned as well as ofindustrial consultants;    and no less subjective methods areavailable.

23,   In general it seems to me inescapable that, having abandoned theGri&amp;S formula on the strength of our publicly professed acceptance ofthc^rrard1 a view that it was crude and incompatible with our ownIncomes Policy, and having appointed the Board as independent refereesin the matter of Forces&apos; pay,  there is no conceivable defence we could offer for rejecting the Board&apos; 3 recommendation that we should introduce into forces&apos; pay a form of structure which is taken for granted in thecase of every other occupation and profession.    Nor could we dismissmethods of evaluation which entirely correspond to our publishedmandate.   The only alternative now would be to return to the Griggsystem which we ourselves have discredited and which - as the recruitingfigures show - has clearly broken down under modern conditions.    Apartfrom the deplorable public impression which this would create,  thefurther damage to the morale of the Forces - who, unlike other public servants are not in a position to back their demands by the threat ofmilitant action - would be incalculable.    The deferment of a decisions would effectively prevent the introduction of a radically new pay codeby April, 1970;    it would be tantamount in practice to a rejection ofthe Board&apos;s recommendations for the foreseeable future, and it wouldhave similar consequences.2k.  If the Board&apos;s recommendations regarding the introduction of the&quot;military salary&quot; were accepted they would constitute a major revalua-tion of Service pay, not all the cost could be accepted as a normalpay and price change for the purposes of the Defence Budget.    I am prepared to accept that, to the extent that the introduction of theI &quot;military salary&quot;involves&apos;gross expenditure in excess of what would have resulted from the application of the Grigg formula by 1st April,I97O, this would have to be found within the Defence Budget ceiling,j The Board&apos;s recommendations are in my view so important to the defenceIpolicy which we have decided upon that I am prepared to make reductionselsewhere in the defence programme to accommodate them on this basis.125.  I also accept that we cannot and need not commit ourselves atI this stage to particular levels of pay which might result from jobi evaluation, or to the size of the element in pay attributed to the&quot;X-Pactor&quot;.    I accept that we should openly recognise that much workrenains to be done, over a period of about a year,  to establish suitablelevels of reward.;Recoinmendations26.  a.     I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree that the short-term recommendations of the Board should be accepted intheir entirety;h,     I invite my colleagues to endorse in principle the Board&apos;slong-term recommendations on the structure of Forces&apos; pay,while preserving a reasonable flexibility, about thepractical interpretation of the recommendation, in the lightof further studies during the corning year;c.     I therefore seek agreement to my making an announcement inthe House on the lines of Annex D concurrently with thepublication of the Board&apos;s Report.D.W.H.Hinist:5thry of Defence, S.W.1Jurte, 1969

TCONFIDENTIAL .ANNEX a background TO THE STANDING REFERENCE OF FORCES&apos;  PAY TOTHE NATIONAL BOARD ^OR PRICES AND INCOMFSThe system which governed the settlement of Service pay fromI96O to 1966 stemmed from the recommendations of the Advisory Committeeon Recruiting (The Grigg Committee)  in 1958 (Cmnd 5k5), which were accepted by the Government (Cmnd 570) in November of that year.      Itentailed biennial reviews of pay based on comparisons with pay move-jaents outside the Services.     Officers&apos; pay increases followed percent-Age movements in the pay of the executive and administrative grades of the Home Civil Service.      Other ranks&apos; pay increases followedpercentage movements in average earnings in manufacturing and certain other industries as notified by the Ministry of Labour.      It will be noticed that the system provided only for movement in Service pay.On the question of whether the level of Service pay was correct,  theGrigg Committee said no more than that the rates current in 1958 bore,at that time, a reasonable relationship to those outside and did notdeter recruitment.2,   In January 1966, the prospective increases in pay which had emerged from the application of the Grigg formula, were referred tothe Prices and Incomes Board to determine whether they were consistentnith Part I of the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd 2639).The Board concluded that.the 1966 review should be carried out andimplemented in the same way as previous reviews.     They observed thatthe assurance of a biennial pay review by which movements in Serviceemoluments were brought broadly into line with movements outside theServices could not be abruptly withdrawn without adversely affectingpcruitment and re-engagement.     They stated &quot;Unless and until theGovernment duly notifies the members of the Armed Forces that a new system of review of their emoluments is to be adopted, we considerthat there is a commitment.&quot;     They pointed out, however,  that the-Grigg formula was based entirely on a somewhat crude application of theprinciple of comparability and recommended that greater account should betaken of other factors for the determination of pay.3.   The principle of the Standing Reference of Forces&apos;  pay to theBoard was accepted in June 1966,   in the course of discussion in cabinet (1) of prices and incomes policy.Jote:   (1)    CC( 66)31 st Meeting.

When I announced the Board&apos;e remit in May 1968,   I promised that Would take into account questions raised on the pay of doctors and dentists in the Armed Forces.      In 1962 Service doctors were givenanew deal which promised them over an average career a 16$ lead overthe average earnings of general practitioners in the National health service.     After the Seventh Report of the   Klndersley Review Body inMarch 1966 a new system of payment for general medical practitionerswas introduced which was intended to increase their income by about one-third.     This would have implied an increase in basic pay of up to505?, for Service doctors if we were to honour the principles andconditions agreed in 1962.2,    In the event,  the Government awarded Service doctors and dentistsa 10$ increase in pay comparable to that awarded by the KindereleyCommittee for National Health Service hospital doctors, by comparisonwith an increase of Mi% which combatant officers had earlier received.The BMA ceased to co-operate with the Ministry of Defence overrecruiting,  refused to accept the Ministry of Defence&apos;s advertisingfor their journal and wrote to the Deans of Medical Schools advisingthat the Services no longer offered a satisfactory career.      since these actions began recruiting has fallen off seriously and prematureretirements of serving doctors has risen.3,    The Prices and Incomes Board recognised in their Report No.  70of May 1968 (Cmnd. 3651) that there were fundamental questions to besettled on the right relativity between the pay of combatant officersand that of Service doctors,  and between the pay of Service doctors and that of their civilian counterparts.     These questions required further study and doctors and dentists in 1968 received the sameinterim increase of 7% as other officers.     This award was followed,however, by the further Kindersley award of 7% to GPs in January ^363.The Board now recommends that Service doctors and dentists shouldreceive,  exceptionally,  an increase in pay which will restore them tonear parity with National Health Service GPs.      The money for thisaward can be provided within the on total emoluments of theServices as a whole.      I therefore see no reason to disagree with theBoard&apos;s recommendation.

HYPOTHETICAL COST OF PROJECTING GRIGG TO 1.U.7QThe last award to the Forces under the Grigg formula was on1,1^.66.     The purpose of this note is to consider what might havebeen the cost of applying the formula between that date and 1.L.70,taking into account the recommendations &quot;by the NBPI which were putinto effect last year,  in order to provide a basis of comparison withthe cost of the recommendations in their latest report.2,    For officers we have to considera. increases actually awarded to their Civil Serviceanalogues (see Annex A) under the Grigg formula with effect from 1.1.68 and 1.1.69,  totalling 1W;b. a Central Pay Increase of 5%   recently approved for those analogues,  to take effect from 1st July,  1969.3,    Up to 31.3.69 officers have received only 7% of the 16.6%(compounded)  increase produced by paragraph 2 above,  leaving a further8,97$ to be applied (compounded), at a cost of about  8M gross( 5?M net).For other ranksa. we have to consider actual increases in the Index of average Industrial Earnings up to the latest date forwhich figures are available (19.7196 from 1.8.65 to31.10.68);b. in the absence.of figures later than 31.10.68 in theIndex of Average Industrial Earnings it has been assumed that they v/ould turn out to be somewhat similar to thosein the Index of Average Earnings of All Employees.Actual figures in this Index are available from 1.11.68to 31.3.69 at 3.25$;    further projection to 31.7.69 atthe same rate would give another 2.6%, making 5.85% in all;c. the total percentage yielded by a. and b.  above would be25.56%.5.    Up to 31.3.69 other ranks had received an increase of 7% only,leaving a further 17% (compounded) still &quot;due&quot;, at a cost of  L2M gross( 29M net).6.    The above suggests that the total cost of projecting Grigg up to1.U.70 might be taken as  77M gross ( 52M net),  of which  27M wasawarded to the Forces in 1968, and  20.5M would be absorbed by the short term measures proposed by the NBPI,  leaving a balance &quot;due&quot; of 29,5M gross ( 20M net) against the estimated additional cost of introducing the military salary ( 52.5M gross -  16.OM net).

FORCES&apos;  PAY REVIEW - DRAFT GOVERNMENT statement on the 30th May,  1968,  the Government announced that they had asked   the National Board for Prices and Incomes to undertake a thorough going review of the pay of the Armed Forces.     This review was to examine the feasibility of evaluating Service jobs andcomparing them with those in civil life by methods which would reduce to the minimum the necessity for subjective judgement and also toexamine the basic structure of Service pay and allowances.     TheGovernment have now considered the Board&apos;s Report.     They are grateful for the thoroughness with which the Board have carried out their task.2,    For the short term the Government accept the recommended increaseIn pay to take effect from 1st April,  1969,  together with otherimmediate changes in emoluments recommended by the Board.3,    The Government accepts in broad principle the Board&apos;a long term proposals as a basis for a new structure of Forces&apos; pay,  along lines which would make it possible to establish a clear relationship between the emoluments of Servicemen and their civilian counterparts.As the Board recognises, however, much work still needs to be donein order to establish,  following the report,  suitable levels ofreward for individual Service ranks, branches and trades;    to deter-mine appropriate charges for accommodation and rations;    to construct a new pay code which will ensure a square deal for the Servicemanwhile assisting the Services to overcome current recruiting problems;and to enable the cost and other implications of implementing the new structure to be precisely assessed.Iw    In addition there are a number of detailed recommendations inthe Board&apos;s Report the implications of which require careful studywhich must take some time in certain cases.      It will be the aim,however, to complete this process,  so far as the practical difficul-ties and the sheer size of the task permit,  and to introduce new arrangements, within about a year.     Work has already begun.5.    The Government accept the Board1s proposal for the regularreview of Forces&apos; Pay thereafter.6.    They also note the views of the Board on Service pensions.      Thissubject is being studied separately,  and it will necessarily be sometime before the results can be published.      A major factor lies inthe need to clarify the relationship between Service pensions(together with other occupational pensions) and the Government&apos;earnings related pensions scheme announced in Cmnd.   3883.
