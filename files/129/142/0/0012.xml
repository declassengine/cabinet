Statement is sued by the Department of Employ meritand Productivity on 5th June^l969The Government have noted the decision of the SpecialCongress which has approved the General Councils proposals in&quot;Programme for Action&quot;.As the Government has made clear in its exchanges over thepast weeks with the TUC, they recognise that the General CounciUsproposals are a major advance, and in particular, that those fordealing with inter-union disputes now seem broadly satisfactory.But the Government has considerable reservations about the effectiveness of the General Council&apos;s proposals for dealing withunconstitutional strikes and, in particular, about the proposed arrangements for ensuring that awards and recommendations made after a TUC     enquiry into such disputes are implemented byaffiliated unions and by their members.The General Council have been invited to meet the PrimeMinister and the First Seci?*&amp;ary on Monday, 9th June, when therewill be further discussions on the TUC plans and the Government^proposals tor legislation.

I am writing to follow up the meeting with the General Council on21st May when we discussed the General Council&apos;s report &quot;programme for Action&quot;, since the Prime Minister and I think we should put on recordbefore the Special Congress on 5th June the. Governments views weexpressed at that meeting.    These viev/s have been confirmed by further study of the General Council&apos;s report,,.2,      At the meeting we made it clear that the government considered the proposals in &quot;Programme for Action&quot; a majoradvance and in particular that those for dealing with inter-uniondisputes now seemed broadly satisfactory.    On the other hand,as has been made clear in our discussions we have considerablereservations about the proposals for dealing with unconstitutional strikes.    It has been consistently emphasised that &quot;the government regarded as essential and urgent that effective measures should betaken to deal with unconstitutional stoppages, which though perhaps not large in themselves, nevertheless caused by their repercussionsserious damage to the economy and hardship to perhaps thousands ofother workers.    As the White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; recognises,a major contribution to the solution of this problem may be expected from long-term measures, in particular the improvement of negotiatingand disputes procedures.    The Government has already taken action inthis field by the appointment of the CIR and the registration on a voluntary basis of procedure agreements.    In the Governments view, however,short-term action both by the Government and by the two sides of industryis also vitally needed, and all practicable steps must be taken in an effort to contain the effects of the most seriously damaging unconstitu-tional strikes.    The Governments proposals for a conciliation pause hasbeen framed for this purpose,3.       Turning now to the General Council proposals, the Governmentwelcomes the recognition in paragraph 40 of the need for carrying outurgent &quot;on-the-spot&quot; investigations and for making recommendations and awards with a view to securing a speedy resumption of work andof negotiations on outstanding matters.    The proposed arrangementsfor ensuring that recommendations and awards are implemented are,however, in the Governments view inadequate in a number of respectswhich are set out below,4,       Paragraph 42 says that the General Council would &quot;require unions to satisfy them that they had done all that they could reasonably beexpected to do to secure compliance with a recommendation (or an award, \where this has been made) including taking action within their own rules if necessary&quot;.    In the Governments view this doesnot constitute as firm an undertaking as the TUC has given in the caseof inter-union disputes where it is proposing to amend rule 12 toprovide:

&quot;Where a dispute between unions has led to an unauthorisedstoppage of work, it shall be an obligation on the affiliatedorganisation or organisations concerned to take immediate and energetic steps to obtain a resumption of work&quot;.The Government recognises that unconstitutional strikes are by nomeans always the fault of the strikers.    That is why it proposes inits legislation to require management to return to the status quo wherethe strike is due to arbitrary unilateral action by management.    But the tuc itself recognises (paragraph 24) that there are cases where goodprocedures exist and have not been used and where the strikers areconstitutionally in the wrong and the union ought to take action to secure a return to work.    However the discussion on 2lst May showed that theGeneral Council do not regard paragraph 42 as a comrnitment to ensurethat where the TUC have recommended a return to work and persuasionby the union fails to secure this, the union will take action within itsrules, including the exercise of disciplinary powers against members who remain on strike.    Nor does the report provide that where a unionfails to take such action, the General Council will instruct it to do so,and failing a satisfactory response, will take action against the unionconcerned under Congress rule 13.5.       Paragraph 42 also recognises that some unions may need to review their rules to ensure that they are in a position to comply with recommendations or awards by the TUC.    Provision should in theGovernments view be made to ensure that this is remedied promptly,e, g. by placing an obligation on affiliated unions, who do not already possess adequate powers, to revise their rules with a view to seeking the necessary powers within a defined period,6.       There are two further points on which the Government would welcome a more explicit statement of the General Council&apos;s plans.The first relates to the considerable additional responsibilities whichthe General Council&apos;s proposals for intervention, both in inter-uniondisputes and in unconstitutional stoppages, will place on general council members, on the officers of affiliated organisations, andon the staff of the TUC,    In the Governments view specific provision should be made to meet these heavy additional responsibilities and toestablish appropriate procedures and machinery, e, g, for the conductof enquiries.7,       The second point relates to the matters which may be covered byrecommendations or awards.    The General Councifs report suggeststhat these might deal with (i) a resumption of work, and where thedispute has been caused by unilateral managerial action, a returnto the&quot;status quo;  (ii) the improvement of procedures, and (iii) the substantive matters at issue in the dispute.    It is accepted thatrecommendations on (i) will be desirable in order to enable negotiations to be pursued under the agreed procedure, and that recommendations on

(ii) may be useful both for the settlement of the immediate dispute andfor the longer-term improvement of relations.    Is there not a risk thatto the extent that TUC recommendations aro concerned with the substan-tive matters at issue in the dispute, they may undermine the propernegotiating procedures, when in the Governments view the ma j ox-emphasis of the tuc&apos;s action in unconstitutional strikes should beto secure a return to work while negotiations take place under the agreed procedures ?8.      At the meeting on 21st May, it v/as agreed that there shouldbe a further moeting with the General Council after the Special congress and I understand that arrangements have now been made for this meeting to be held on 9th June.    It would, I suggest, be useful then to discuss further the points, set out above in the light of the Special Congress on 5th June.
