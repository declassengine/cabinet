DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 7018th June, 1969COPY NO.4CABINETINDUSTRIAL relations memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and ProductivityAs my colleagues know, the Prime Minister and I will again bemeeting the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)tomorrow.    The purpose of this paper is to obtain the agreementof my colleagues to the proposals which should then be put to them,2.      As the Prime Minister and I explained to the General council at our meetings last week, the Government is prepared not to proceedwith the interim Bill in exchange for an undertaking by the general council to recommend to the September Congress the modificationof Rule 11 on the lines of C(69) 67 circulated on 13th June.3,      If the General Council continue to refuse to adopt this course,we should proceed with one of the following two courses: namely, toput the penal provisions in the draft Bill into &quot;cold storage&quot; by providing that they can be activated by Order &quot;in Council only not earlier than sixmonths after the Bill receives Royal Assent;  or to modify the draft Billon the lines explained in the succeeding paragraphs by making unionsresponsible for the conduct of their members.A scheme to emphasise trade union responsibilities4.       Under this proposal the Secretary of State would make aconciliation pause Order &apos;.(a t&amp;c consultation with the Confederationcf British Industry (CBI) and TUC) in the same circumstances as envisaged in the White Paper - &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;.    That is tosay, an Order would be made where a strike was in breach of agreedprocedures, or where no adequate procedure existed; but the power would be limited to those strikes which would have serious consequences.The employer would be required to observe specified terms andconditions and the employees to discontinue their strike and returnto work,-1-

5,       The Bill would lay responsibilities upon the union or unions concerned to use their best endeavours to ensure that their membersdid in fact return to work in order to allow for procedureu or, ifnecessary an enquiry, to be used or be held.    If a strike continued and the Secretary of State considered the union or unions were not seriously trying to get strikers back to work, she would be empoweredto take proceedings before the Industrial Board on the grounds that theyhad not used their &quot;best endeavours&quot; to secure a return to work.    Ifthe Industrial Board found against the union(s), they would be subjectto a substantial maximum financial penalty,6,      It would be provided that a trade union would not be able to pleadin its defence that the absence of relevant provisions in their rules hadprecluded action to secure a return to work of their memoers.    As sometrade unions do not have appropriate disciplinary rules to deal withunconstitutional strike action by their members, it would be necessaryto make provision to allow trade unions to take action to amend theirrules before the appointed day.7.      I recommend that, if we proceed with the Bill on the lines suggested above, we should exclude from this Bill sanctions relatingto inter-union disputes in view of the proposals made by the TUC for effective action in these cases.B. A. C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W.1.18th June, 1969
