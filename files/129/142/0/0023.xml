Qit^LH COPY NO. ,..66I^l2^t-J-.3J&amp;3.CABINETTHE REPORT OF THE DUNCAN REVIEW committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth affairs a Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Val Duncan wasappointed by me in August, 1968, following consultations with mycolleagues most closely concerned, to &quot;review urgently the functions and scale of the British representational effort overseas (includingDefence and other Attaches and Advisers and British Defence Staffs)in the light of the decisions on foreign and defence policy announced by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on 16th January, 1968, the balance ofpayments, and the changing international role which these imply forthe United Kingdom: to make recommendations particularly on the furtherance of British commercial and economic interests overseas and, in arriving at these recommendations, to consider the value toHer Majestyls Government of work done and information submittedby overseas posts in the political field; to have regard to the functions and scale of representation by other major Western European countries;to bear in mind, in the light of the current need for the strictesteconomy, the importance of obtaining the maximum value for all british Government expenditure and the consequent desirability ofproviding British overseas representation at lesser cost; and to aim to report within side months in order that the benefit of any savingsmay accrue as rapidly as possible&quot;.     The Committee presented theirReport to me on 9th June.Nature of the report.       The Report covers the whole range of British overseas representation; the Diplomatic Service is the major element, but theBoard of Trade, the Ministry of Defence, the British Council, theCentral Office of Information, the external services of the BBC, andthe&quot; Home Departments providing civilian attaches for posts abroad are all involved.    &quot;While there is general approval for much of what isbeing done at present, the Report proposes that in the future thereshould be a calculated shift in the deployment of our effort to take account of the &quot;towering importance&quot; attached to the improvement of-1,HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

our economic, position.    The Committee drew attention to a number offields in which economies might be made.    They suggest a substantial reduction in the information effort and in the deployment of service attaches and Defence Staffs.    They envisage that, in the medium term,the reorganisation of political work at what they regard as our less important Diplomatic posts, and in the longer term, the rationalisation of estate management should together produce substantial savings.Other economies, the Report suggests, would flow from reductions in overseas Security Guards; from administrative simplifications;from modifications in traditional Consular Services; from therestricting of Civilian Attaches1 work; and from the construction of a modern Foreign and Commonwealth Office building in London.Against these savinge, the Report reckons that there would have to beset extra expenditure on certain short-term items, notably improvedretirement compensation, and on certain continuing commitments,such as an increased export promotion effort, the full implementation of the recommended manpower margin and increased training in the diplomatic Service, a greater use of international travel, more adequate provision of modern equipment, and the growth of immigrationwork.    The Committee conclude, without making any precise forecastson the timing or net financial effect of any such changes, that their recommendations could be implemented by the mid-1970s; and thatthe saving of total expenditure involved (on British overseas representation as a whole) could by then be not less than 5 per cent(at constant (1968) prices), and perhaps of the order of 10 per cent.3,      I am in agreement with the Duncan Committee that the essentialconsideration in examining our overseas representation must be, to quote the Report, &quot;the effectiveness of our overseas services as an instrument of British interests abroad&quot; in our changed internationalposition.    The emphasis which the Report places on the British role in Europe and the Atlantic area is consistent with the government&apos;s policy and I accept that this implies consequences for the deployment of staffs overseas,,    Nearly half the Diplomatic Service abroad are serving in this area already; but we have substantial interests inother parts of the world and in our relations with the Commonwealth.Care must be taken to see that these continue to be effectivelyserved.    The Committee&apos;s studies on our export promotion services are timely and will stimulate further planning in the Foreign and commonwealth Office and the Board of Trade.    I think it right that the diplomatic Service should retain its separate identity from the home civil Service, as the Report recommends, although the two shouldcontinue to be closely associated.    We must also recognise the forceof the Committee&apos;s point that any significant reduction of staff must be- matched by a reduction in the functions which that staff is required&apos;to perform, notably in the political reporting and consular fields.-2-

4.     However, the Duncan recommendations are not, like those of thePlowdeh Report, a precisely worked out series of administrativeproposals.    They range from broad generalisations on matters offoreign policy and direction of effort to precise observations on particular functions of the representational effort.    Some of the mare matters primarily for the Diplomatic Service alone % others have broad implications for the Government as a whole.    At anumber of points the consideration of the Report will have to takeplace in the context of the work at present being undertaken on theFulton Report.    Many of the Duncan recommendations arecontroversial and will require detailed study in Departments and inthe other bodies concerned over a period of time before we candecide whether the individual recommendations should be rejectedor accepted, and if so, to what extent.Machinery for consideration of the Report5,     I have arranged for inter-Departmental machinery to be set upas a matter of urgency to consider the Report in detail and make recommendations.    This will be under the direction of a steering committee of senior officials.6.     In view of the public interest, the Report should be published in the fullest possible version.    In the confidential text of the Reportthere are a few sensitive passages not affecting the recommendations,which, at the request of the Departments concerned, the Committeeare content to have omitted in the published version.    Theseomissions are indicated in square brackets in the text, with theaddition of a few amendments and omissions listed in Annex A.7.     While I am sure my colleagues will welcome the Committee&apos;general approach, it would seem premature for the Government to commit itself at this stage, before sufficient study of the recommenda-tions, by welcoming or dissociating itself from specific parts of theReport.    I propose to lay the Report before Parliament and simultaneously to make a statement commenting on it in the broadestpossible terms.    The desirability of averting pressure on theGovernment to enter into specific commitments indicates that publication should take place as soon as possible.    I should add that the arrangements proposed in this Memorandum have alreadybeen communicated to those Ministers whose Departments are most directly concerned and have been generally accepted by them.I therefore invite my colleagues to take note with approval of thedraft statement attached which I hope to make in the House as soonas conveniently possible.    I would arrange for a similar statement to be made by a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister in the&quot;Lords,M. S.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S. W, 1,4th July, 1969-3-

DRAFT STATEMENT BY FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHSECRETARYWith your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that ofthe House, I should like to make a statement on theReport of the Review Committee on Overseas Representa-tion, which has to-day &quot;been laid before the House.The House will recall that last August I invitedSir Val Duncan, Sir Frank Roberts and Mr. Shonfieldto report urgently on the means of obtaining the bestvalue for money from our overseas representation,having regard to our foreign and defence policies andthe economic situation and all that these imply for britain&apos;s role in the world.   This was a formidabletask and we are deeply grateful to Sir Val Duncanand the members of his Committee for dischargingit so speedily and so thoroughly.Their Report is far-ranging and draws many important conclusions.   These concern a wide variety of matters, from broad issues of policies and priori-ties to quite detailed points *f management.    Some ofthem concern questions which lie outside my direct responsibility.   Some are very much in line withthoughts and practices which we ourselves had beendeveloping;       others - and I very much welcome/this(1)

this - are novel and suggest new departures in ourways of handling the problems concerned.While the Government warmly welcome the Commit-tee&apos;s general approach, my colleagues and I feel that before we can give a specific endorsement to their conclusions, we need to go further into their probableconsequences, their implications for the standard and range of our services overseas, and their effect on our foreign policy as a whole.   The publication of theReport will give many persons inside and outside this house an opportunity to consider these important and complex issues.   I do not think it would be right forthe Government to commit itself too deeply before theyhave had the benefit of this opportunity.    I am there-fore as a matter of urgency initiating studies andconsultations on the Report.   These will includediscussions with the appropriate Staff Associations.At the same time, I should like to say that Ivery much welcome the tribute which the Committeehas paid to the high standard of our overseas ser-vices, and particularly to the competence and adapt-ability of Her Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Service.I am sure that the House will join me in thankingSir Val Duncan and his colleagues for devoting somuch of their time to this important task.   They/have(2)

have produced a penetrating and objective survey,which has already had a valuable effect in stimulat-ing our own consideration of these problems and whichwill be an essential guide through the challengingyears ahead.(3)
