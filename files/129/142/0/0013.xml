OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)REVIEW CF PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCIESMemorandum, by the Secretary of State for the Home department and group of Ministers has been considering the action to be taken on the reports of the Boundary Commission for England, Scotland andWales circulated to members of the Cabinet on 4th June (C(69) 60),2.       The recommendations of the Boundary Commission for Englandare based on existing local government boundaries.    Their proposals would involve major changes for 271 constituencies and minor changesfor 75, out of a present total of 511 (the proposed total is 516),     TheRoyal Commission on Local Government in England has recommendedradical alterations of local government boundaries,    I understand thatit is proposed to publish a White Paper on the Royal Commission^recommendations by the end of the year and to proceed to legislationthereafter.    Implementation of the recommendations on constituency boundaries now would need to be followed in a few years&apos; time with further drastic changes to bring constituency boundaries into line with new local government boundaries.     Out of the 516 constituenciesrecommended by the Boundary Commission for England, 94 would requireimmediate readjustment to conform with the boundaries for the mainlocal authorities recommended by the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment,    Constituencies bordering on those constituencies wouldrequire consequential adjustment,3,      In Wales the recommendations of the Boundary commission would involve major changes in seven constituencies and minor changesin four constituencies out of a present total of 36 constituencies.Preparatory work on legislation for a radical alteration of localgovernment boundaries is well advanced.    If the Cabinet were toagree that a Bill should be introduced in 1969-70 the new local authorities could be brought fully into operation on 1st April, 1972,    If constituency boundaries were altered now, on present plans 19 out of the 36 proposedconstituencies would then need to be reviewed again in order that theymight conform with the new local government boundaries.C(69) 63COPY NO.10th June, 1969CABINET

4.     In Northern Ireland, the recommendations of the boundary commission will include proposals for extending constituencies in belfast to include areas outside the City.    If these recommendations were to be implemented they could well prejudice a review of localgovernment boundaries, and a further review of constituency boundaries would be needed when new local government boundarieshad been established.5.     The group of Ministers has accepted my view that I should not proceed to implement the recommendations on constituency boundariesfor England and Wales; and for the reasons explained in paragraph 4I think that this conclusion should extend to Northern Ireland,Legislation would be needed to relieve me of the obligation in section 2(5)of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, to laydraft Orders in Council giving effect to the recommendations,    I would however go ahead and publish the reports of the Commissions, forinformation.Re-activating the Boundary Commissions6.     The effect of section 2(1) of the House of Commons (redistribution of Seats) Act, 195 8, is that, unless provision is made to the contrary, the boundary Commissions would not be permitted to carry out anothergeneral review of constituencies until 1979-84.     But new localgovernment boundaries will have been settled before then, and we oughtto enable a Boundary Commission to commence another general reviewof constituencies in a part of the United Kingdom as soon as the localgovernment boundaries within that part have been settled.    I suggestthat power should be taken to enable the Secretary of State to present toParliament the draft of an Order in Council requiring a boundary commission to commence forthwith another general review of constituencies before the next general review is due if the Secretary ofState is satisfied that the Commission can carry out the general review on the basis of local government boundaries which can be regarded asbeing reasonably stable.    The Bill could provide for the draft Order inCouncil to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.Greater London7.     Greater London was outside the scope of the Royal Commission.There is a good case for dealing with the recommendations onconstituencies in Greater London now so that for the Greater london council (GLC) elections in April, 1970, each constituency can become a single-member electoral area in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 7(l)(b) of Schedule 2 to the London Government Act, 1963,A difficulty is that seven constituencies at present straddle the greater london boundary.    This could be overcome in the Bill by making theminimum alterations set out at Annex A.    The combination ofPotters Bar urban district and Elstree rural district would create a newconstituency with a small electorate (34, 875 electors) but this would be preferable to tinkering with the neighbouring constituencies inHertfordshire.-2-

8.     The alterations of Constituencies within Greater London and ofthe seven constituencies straddling the Greater London boundary would all need to be implemented at the same time.    Accordingly, all the alterations would be included in the Bill,Constituencies outside London9.     A list of constituencies with over 80,000 electors is at Annex B.With the aim of removing the unfairness of under-representation at thenext general election I propose that legislation should give the boundary commission the task of making recommendations - to be implementedby Order in Council subject to the affirmative resolution procedure -for dividing into two those constituencies in England with a presentelectorate of over 90,000 except that where there are two adjacentconstituencies, each with 90,000 electors or more, the whole area should be divided into three.10.     Of the 16 constituencies with over 90,000 electors, Epping andHornchurch would be dealt with by the proposals for Greater London.Of the other 14 constituencies, the following are contiguous areas:-Billericay CC and South East Essex CCPortsmouth, Langstone BC and Gosport and Fareham BCHitchin CC and South Bedfordshire CCH or sham CC and Arundel and Shoreham CC11.     There are two constituencies in Northern Ireland with highelectorates (South Antrim (1968 electorate 122,391) and North Down(106,851)).    I would not propose that the area of these adjacentconstituencies should be divided into three.    I would use the arguments that -(a) the number of constituencies in Northern Ireland is fixed at 12;(b) the average electorate of constituencies in NorthernIreland is, deliberately, much higher than that inEngland (76,405 as compared with 59, 825 in 1968)because of the existence of the Northern ireland parliament; and(c) Northern Ireland MPs at Westminster have a smallerrange of matters to deal with on behalf of theirconstituents.Effect of Proposals12,     The effect of the proposals in paragraphs 7 and 9 would be toincrease the number of constituencies in the United Kingdom from630 to 631.-3-

Announcement of conclusions13,     There is a Question down for oral answer on 19th June askingwhen I expect to make the Orders to give effect to the recommendationsof the Boundary Commissions.     If my colleagues agree, I would propose to announce in reply that the reports of the Commissions for england and Wales and Northern Ireland will be laid before Parliamentwithin a few days; that legislation would be introduced, with a view topassing both Houses by the summer recess, to implement therecommendations for constituencies in Greater London and for makingthe minimum consequential alterations where constituency boundariesat present straddle the Greater London boundary.    Elsewhere thelegislation would provide for the Boundary Commission to make recommendations for dividing the abnormally large constituencies.14.     The Secretary of State for Scotland is ciiculafcing a separate memorandum about Scotland.L, Jo C,Home Office, S.W. 1.10th June, 1969

glSTING CONSTITUENCIES STRiUDDLING THE GREATER LONDON BOUNDARYThere are at present 98 constituencies entirely within greater london and another seven constituencies which overlap the greater london boundary.     These seven constituencies are :-i EppingChigwellOrpingtonEpst SurreyCarshaltonBametEnfield West72,701 in Essex52,72k in Essex933 in Kent2k,k53 in Surrey29,058 in Surrey&quot;17,73k in Hertfordshire17,1h1 in Hertfordshire1969 electorates32,976 in Waltham Forestk,39k in Redbridge59,135 in Bromley1+9,213 in Croydon38,016 in SuttonU9,525 in Barnet32,1h7 in Enfield2.   The parts of the Epping and Chigwell constituencie s which lieoutside Greater London could become separate constituencies.3.   The part of the Orpington constituency which lies outsideGreater London could be added to the existing Sevenoaks constituency.h,   The obvious consequential in Surrey would be to adopt therecommendations of the Commission,     Caterham and Warlingham U,D,(at present part of East Surrey CO.) would be combined withGodstone RttD, (at present in Reigate CO.) to form a new East SurreyCC,    Reigate M.B, would then be combined with Banstead CD, (atpresent part of Carshalton CC.) to form a new Reigate constituency.5.   The simplest consequential in Hertfordshire would be to combinethose parts of Barnet and Enfield West constituencies which lieoutside Greater London (i.e. Elstree R.D. and Potters Bar U.D.) inone new constituency named South East Hertfordshire.     The totalelectorate (3k,875) would be small.     To increase the size it wouldhe possible to include in the new constituency a part of either theexisting South West Hertfordshire constituency (1968 electorate77,268) or of the Hertford constituency (1969 electorate 81 ,787).(The Boundary Commission have recommended that Elstree R.D. andPotters Bar CD. should be included in a new South Hertfordshireconstituency together with three parishes of St. Albans R.D. whichare at present in the St. Albans constituency and with one parishof the Watford R.D, which is at present in the South WestHertfordshire constituency.6*    If legislation were introduced to implement the recommendationsof the Commission for Greater London and to deal also with the seven areas in the way suggested above, the Epping and Hornchuroh

The effect would also he that the totalnumber of English constituencies would be reduced from 511 to502.7, A rough diagram showing constituencies overlapping the greater london boundary is attached.
