DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 6916th June, 1969CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL - REINTRODUCTION of unilateral ARBITRATIONMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and productivity the Cabinet invited me (CC(69) 26th Conclusions, Minute 2) to circulate a paper on the possible reintroduction of unilateral arbitrationbased on Statutory Instrument 1376 of 1951.2,       The Industrial Disputes Order (SI 1376) was made under emergency powers, replacing an Order that had operated during the war.    it provided for references to an Industrial Disputes Tribunal at the instance of one party without the agreement of the other, and thatawards by the Tribunal should be legally binding.    Access to theTribunal was confined, on the union side, to unions which habituallytook part in the settlement of terms and conditions of employment inthe industry or section of industry concerned;  or which, in the absenceof negotiating machinery, represented a substantial proportion of theworkers concerned.    Also, no reference could be made of a case unlessany existing voluntary negotiating machinery had first been exhausted.3,      In 1950, when the Government was dismantling emergency powers,the Trades Union Congress (TUC) asked for legislation to retain unilateralarbitration.    The employers&apos; organisation was opposed to this, and theStatutory Instrument was not replaced by permanent legislation (exceptthat Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 nowprovides for unilateral arbitration as a means of enforcing recognisedterms and conditions on employers).\4.       The TUC has on several occasions pressed for the reintroduction of unilateral arbitration;  the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has consistently opposed it.    Essentially, the TUC arguments have been thatunilateral arbitration would present an opportunity for trade unions to seek redress in sections of employment where they are sometimes notrecognised and where the strike weapon is not used either because oftradition or because of union weakness; they see it as of benefit to workers in weak bar gaining positions.    The CBI think that it would undermine voluntary negotiating procedures, and they also point out-1-COPY NO.

that although the awards are legally binding, in practice it is open tounions to get round awards which they do not regard as satisfactox&apos;y by using industrial pressures to pursue further claims.5.       The Donovan Commission considered the question of unilateralarbitration (paragraphs 267 to 275 of the report) and the TUC evidence on the subject.     They said that it would do little to further the fundamentalaim of development of collective bargaining but they did however recommend the selective use of unilateral arbitration in support of recommendations ofthe Commission on Industrial Relations that employers should grantrecognition and bargaining rights to trade unions.    The proposed legislation on industrial relations would include provisions whichwould broadly give effect to this recomrnendation.6n       I agree with the Donovan Commission that unilateral arbitrationwould not, in general, further the development of collective bargainingwhich is the prime aim of our policy.    Indeed general access to itwould undermine existing procedures and might well diminish the will to establish such procedures where they do not now exist.    Moreover,if access to unilateral arbitration were only possible after agreedvoluntary procedures had been exhausted (as was the case underOrder 1376), there might well be a reluctance on the part of employers in negotiations to make offers for a settlement in the fear that any offermight thereby become a platform on which a more costly arbitration award could be based.    Equally trade unions might look beyond anyoffer in negotiations to a better settlement from arbitration.7.      It has been argued that recourse to unilateral arbitration would strengthen the position of workpeople in areas where the trade unions are weak but the provisions in the interim Industrial Relations Bill forthe establishment of a statutory right to trade union membership and forthe recognition of trade unions by employers are directed to this sameend.    I therefore think it would be inappropriate to legislate now forgeneral access to unilateral arbitration although I would propose toexamine, in the light of experience gained from the limited use of sucharbitration for which the Bill provides, whether any extension of it would prove helpful in persuading more employers to recognise and bargainwith trade unions under agreed procedures.    This would be a matter aappropriate to the major Industrial Relations Bill next Session.B.A.C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W. 1.16th June, 1969
