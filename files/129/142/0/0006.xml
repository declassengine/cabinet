this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 5620th May, 1969COPY NO,0 0CABINETIRANIAN OILMemorandum by the Secretary of State, fcr Foreign and commonwealth affairs at the meeting of the Cabinet on 15th May (CC(69) 23rd Conclusions,Minute 2) I reported that negotiations between the Iranians and theWestern Oil Consortium had been brought to a successful conclusion and undertook to circulate a short memorandum on this subject to mycolleagues.2.      An agreement was signed in Tehran on 13th May.    This settlesthe revenue which the Iranian Government will receive from the consortium during the current Iranian year (1348).    Negotiations on oilrevenues have been the subject of recurrent friction and tension betweenthe two sides in recent years.3.TheJonsortium comprises the eight major international oil companies.    It was formed in 1954 as a British-registered company to succeed Anglo-Iranian Oil (subsequently British Petroleum) following theAbadan crisis.     It is responsible for oil development in Southern iran and produces 95 per cent of IranTs crude oil output.    BP has 40 per cent of the shareholding and Shell 14 per cent.    The five major american companies have 7 per cent each; a smaller American grouping5 per cent;  and a French company (CFP) 6 per cent.4.       The Consortium has ljo far been successful in keeping the growth of Iranian oil production well ahead of the annual average growth in theMiddle East as a whole.    It has provided the Iranian Government with substantial sums of revenue, mainly in the form of taxes and royaltieson crude oil production ($3,680 million in 1960-67 alone).    But the Shahhas consistently pressed the Consortium to do better.    He argues thatIran should be given preferential treatment in Middle East oil productionsince, with a population of 28 million, his country needs more money for development and puts it to better use than the tiny or backward Arab oilstates;  that Iran is a reliable source of oil compared with the Arabs; andthat Iran is moreover a good friend of the West.-1-

5.       With these considerations in mind and as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the Consortium, the Iranian Government includedin their current Five Year Development Plan provision for oil revenuesto increase by 15 per cent annually.    They did this without consulting the consortium and irrespective of market considerations.    Moreover, theycommitted themselves firmly to these figures by giving legislative effectto the Development Plan.    As a result, by the beginning of this year,the Shah was pressing the Consortium to find $1, 000 million.    He wasthreatening to expropriate 50 per cent of the shareholding or of theConsortiumTs reserves, or forcibly to load crude oil at cost, i  the consortium failed to meet his requirement.6.      This situation placed the participating companies in some difficulty, since there is a world surplus of oil.    The companies couldnot agree to produce more oil than they could &quot;sell;  but neither couldthey cut back on growth in production, elsewhere because of theircommitments to the Governments of other oil producing countries and because of general economic considerations affecting the internationaloil industry.7.      However, following discussions with Her Majestyts Governmentand the United States Administration, the Consortium finally offered$930 million in oil revenue and one month1s advance on next year&apos;revenue, giving a total of just over  1,000 million.    They are preparedunder certain conditions to carry through the advance until 1972 and to go some way to meet the Shah in increasing production capacity dtrring thenext few years.    Agreement was reached on this basis,8.       This compromise is very satisfactory.    It suggests that theIranians are becoming more realistic about oil revenue targets and thatthey might even be willing to adjust the Development Plan to bring ifc more into line with expected receipts.    Although there may still be difficulties about oil revenues in future years, both sides are anxious to avoid annualconfrontations and have therefore agreed to meet in the autumn to review the future position on production and revenue.    This should help toremove a potential source of friction in Anglo-Irs.nian relations at a timewhen we are negotiating with the Iranians over Bahrain and when welook to Iran as an element of stability in the Middle East after our military withdrawal from the Persian Gulf.M.S.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S.
