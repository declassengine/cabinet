C(69) 748th July, 1969REFORM OF LAND TENURE IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the purpose of this memorandum is to.seek the agreement of mycolleagues to the publication as soon as practicable of a White Paper onthe reform of land tenure in Scotland in terras of the draft attached.2.       The terms of the draft White Paper were generally approved bythe Home Affairs Committee at their meeting on 16th May.    A numberof points emerged in the discussion, and I refer to these in thismemor andum.3.      Part I of the draft White Paper describes the feudal systemof land tenure in Scotland (paragraphs 1-3) and previous examinationsof the problems arising from that system -(paragraphs 4-7).Paragraphs 8-11 deal with my review of the subject and the consultations I have undertaken.    In this connection the HomeAffairs Committee asked about the need to consult the EnglishLaw Commission in addition to the Scottish Lav/ Commission,The English Law Commission have, I understand, had the opportunityof seeing the papers which were sent to the Scottish Law Commission,and they have offered no comments at this stage on v/hat is proposed.4.       The remainder of Part I is taken up with an analysis of theadvantages and disadvantages of the feudal system,5.       The proposals for reform embodied in Part II of the draft white paper, involving the abolition of the feudal system, constitute a radicaltransformation of a system of land tenure which has subsisted forcenturies in Scotland, and they would be regarded publicly as representing a major policy decision by the Government,    The proposals would be a source of controversy;  superiorities are currently held as a form offinancial investment (including trustee investment) by bodies such asthe Church of Scotland and certain of the universities as well as by insurance companies and private individuals;  and consequently therewould probably be vigorous opposition to any move which threateneda source of perpetual income.    On the other hand the general-1-COPY NO.cabinet this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)

practicability of the proposals has been tested in the discussions mentionedin paragraph 10 of the draft White Paper;  they would be welcomed in many quarters;  and I consider that they could be presented as part of theGovernments for ward -looking attempts to modernise Scotland&apos;s institutions.Main features of proposals, The main features of the proposed reforms are identified inPart II of the draft White Paper, and my colleagues may find somecommentary on these helpful.Ending of feudal system (paragraphs 37-40)7,       On a day appointed under legislation feudal tenure as such would-be declared to be at an end, and vassals v/ould become absolute owners of their property.    It may be helpful if I describe at this point how Ienvisage the situation from that time onwards in relation to (a) formerfeudal conditions and (b) former feuduties,8.      In accordance with the view about the value of certain kinds ofprivate land conditions expressed in paragraph 32 of the draft white paper, I propose that former feudal conditions of continuing usefulness(as defined in the legislation) should remain in being.    Such conditions would however be enforceable not by former superiors but by neighbouringproprietors.9.      Former vassals would not be obliged to redeem the annual paymentformerly exigible as feuduty at the moment when the feudal system was declared to be at an end.    My proposals envisage that any vassal shouldbe able to redeem the payment at any time after the appointed day, andthat redemption would be compulsory on the first sale of land after theappointed day.10.      The terms on which vassals would be able to redeem theirliability would be of key importance to the whole operation at the timein question and would be of concern to former vassals and formersuperiors equally,    I recommend that the White Paper should notspecify terms of redemption.    A figure of any given number of years&apos;purchase which we fixed now could be either over-generous or over-harsh in the light of market and general economic conditions prevailing at the time;  and any figure we put in now would form a centre of prematurecontroversy and distract attention from the merits of the main proposals.Apart from these considerations, I should like to consider the possibilityof introducing some kind of flexibility into the redemption system.Accordingly paragraph 38 of the draft White Paper refers simply toredemption by ex-vassals &quot;on fair and reasonable terms&quot;.rOWPIDPMTIAL

Ban of further feuing (paragraph 27)11,       It is of course an essential element hi my proposals that furtherfeuing of land should be prohibited, and likewise that kindred forms of contract, such as contracts of ground annual, should no longer beallowedoFuture forms of tenure (paragraphs 29, 30 and 41-54)12.      Where land was sold in the future it would be absolutely conveyed,and the purchaser would own it absolutely.    Side by side with theproposed new form of ownership, however, there would be a continuingneed to allow occupation of property for a limited period of time.    Thedraft White Paper therefore envisages the continuation of leaseholdtenure;  but I am proposing certain limitations on this form of occupancy,particularly in relation to leasehold for residential purposes (seeparagraph 15 below).Land conditions (paragraphs 31-35)13,      Under the proposed new system of ownership there would bea place for private conditions attaching to the land.    I propose however that such conditions should be more restrictively defined by statute thanfeudal conditions have been in the past, in order to ensure that theyoperate to the benefit of the land itself.Lands Tribunal for Scotland (paragraph 36)14.      I propose to prepare interim legislation which would, inter alia,give to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland powers to vary or dischargefeudal conditions.    Under the proposals in the draft White Paper theTribunal would continue to have these functions in relation to formerfeudal conditions of continuing usefulness and to private land conditionscreated after the new system came into operation.Limitation of leasehold tenure (paragraphs 41-45)15.      Experience in Scotland and elsewhere has shown that hardship canarise when long leases of residential property run out; and I think thatthe opportunity of this major land tenure reform should be taken to curbthe further development of such leaseholds in Scotland.    I propose thatthis objective should be achieved by placing a statutory 20-year limit onresidential leaseholds:  such a period is designed to be unacceptable tothe-prospective land developer and only acceptable to a prospectiveoccupant where the temporary nature of the occupation is clearlyrecognised,

16.       Similarly I think that the opportunity might also be taken to limit the duration of industrial and commercial leases.    At present many suchleases have a duration of 100 years or more;  but it would seem desirable for the future that the new form of absolute ownership should replaceleases amounting virtually to occupancy in perpetuity.    Accordingly,as paragraphs 44 and 45 of the draft explain, it is proposed tentativelythat a limit of 60 years should be put on such leases.    This is very muchin the nature of a suggestion and, if there were widespread reasonedopposition to it, I would be prepared to drop it0Associated proposals (paragraphs 46-48)17.       Paragraphs 46 and 48 of the draft White Paper indicate that theGovernment propose to examine other forms of (non-feudal) land tenurein Scotland, together with certain land burdens of-ancient origin.    Thesephenomena have a long history of extreme complexity;  and some of themarouse from time to time a certain amount of local complaint.    But theyare not a national problem on the scale of feudal tenure (which embracesmore than 80 per cent of all property in Scotland),    So, while I think weshould show that we are aware of their existence, they require.a greatdeal of research and investigation, and I would not judge it prudent to commit ourselves to specific action then until this has been done.18.       On the other hand paragraph 47 of the draft White Paper lets itbe known that it is proposed to treat certain other contracts which produceeffects comparable to those of feuing - contracts of ground annual and existing long leases - in the same way as feus.Action following on White Paper (paragraphs 50-54)19,       Part IV of the White Paper describes the next steps which theGovernment would have in mind to take.    These are, firstly, thepreparation of the interim legislation referred to in paragraph 14of this memorandum and, secondly, consultation on the publishedWhite Paper,,    Legislation to give effect to the main proposals willnot be possible in the present Parliament.Conclusion20.      I invite my colleagues to agree to the publication of a white paper in terms of the draft attached.W.R.Scottish Office, S.W.1,8th July, 1969

LAND TENURE IN SCOTLAND - A PLAIT POR REFORMForewordThis paper pats forward proposals by the Government for basic reform ofland tenure in Scotland.     It also contains shorter-term proposals for chang-ing in the meantime certain features of the feudal system of tenure and fornr-king reforms in Scottish conveyancing law.Part I of the paper deals with the present feudal system of land tenure,sets out the objections to it, and describes in general terms the new systemproposed by the Government.     Part II summarizes the main changes which theGovernment propose to make under the new system.     Part III outlines some ofthe problems relating to the proposed new system and suggests means of dealingv/ith them.     Part IV explains the first phase of the action which theGovernment propose to take, including the adoption of certain measures forthe reform of conveyancing lav/.Throughotit this paper the term &quot;land&quot; includes any building or part of a.building in separate ownership.PART IThe Peudal SystemFeudal tenure1.   Most land in Scotland is held today on a system of tenure which lias itsorigin in medieval times.     This system is feudal tenure, which in its practical operation in the latter half of the present century is far removed from its beginnings in a feudal society.     A feature of that society was theP&amp;ctico whereby a landowning nobleman would grant to a loyal follower thenght to a piece of land in return for service;   this service would commonlytake the form of an obligation to arm and to fight in wars in which the ovor-^-osd became engaged.     In the process of time it became permissible for theoriginal recipients of such grants to bequeath the land to their heirs or to dispose of it.

2a     Today feudal tenure, divorced..from the social conditions in which it had its origin, has become in practice a legal system for the exercise of privaterights in land through the medium of feuing.     This is the grant of land in perpetuity in exchange for a recurring annual payment (the feuduty) and oftensubject to conditions which impose obligations and restrictions upon thegrantee in relation to his use of the land.     With the passage of time therights of granters (or superiors) have in certain respects become restrictedand those of the grantees (or vassals) extended.     A superior can no longer,for example, clo-im services as a condition of the grant;   and the vassal for his part can sub-feu land or can transfer his rights to another person.     Thesystem nevertheless contains a fundamental inflexibility which is out of keeping with the general pattern of conditions in society at the present day.Neither the superior nor the vassal can require an alteration of the provisionsof a feu charter - which may have been signed many decades ago - no matter howunsuited to changed conditions these provisions may have become.     Such an alteration is possible only by agreement with the other party:    otherwise theprovisions (including the feuduty) remain fixed in the terms which wore thoughtappropriate when the charter was originally signed.3*    Feudal tenure is also prone to considerable complications.     Y/here, forexample, sub-feuing takes place, there is a superior at each of two or morelevels, each superior having a right to claim feuduty from his vassals and toenforce conditions over the land.     There may thus be a multiplicity of interests in any given piece of land in the form of highly complex feudalrelationships which, in their operation, are often a source of stfbstantiallegal expense.jfe-g-Y-ious examination of the problems4.    Proposals for modification and reform of the Scottish system of land tenure have a long history.     In 1910 the deliberations of the LunedinCommission, which was set up to enquire into &quot;the expediency of institutingin Scotland a system of registration of title&quot;, concluded with disagreementamong its members and the publication of four reports (Cd. 5316) with varying/recommenda/bi ons

recommendations.     Several of these involved substantial changes in thefeudal system, but no action was ever taken on them.     More recently, beforethe present Government took office in 19^4* their predecessors had recognizedthe need for an examination of certain aspects of land tenure in Scotland.In the first place, a Committee was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Beidin 1959 iQ examine the case for introducing registration of title to land inScotland.     By a majority, that Committee, in their report (Cmnd. 2032),published in July, 1963, recommended the introduction of registration of title.They also recommended that an expert committee should be appointed to work outthe details of a scheme for registration of title, and that there should be a review of conveyancing law and practice, i.e, the legal processes involved indealing with property rights, principally in relation to the buying and sellingof land and buildings.5,     In June, 1964 the previous Government set up a Committee on Conveyancinglegislation and Practice under the chairmanship of professor J. II. Halliday ofthe University of Glasgow:   their report (Cmnd. 3118) was published in-December, 1966..     In August, 196)5 the present Government announced their acceptance of the principle of registration of title to land;   and in Novemberof that year a Committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Professor G. L.F, Henry of the University of Edinburgh to work out the details of s. suitablescheme;    this Committee has still to report.     /JNote;   what is said about theHenry Committee will need to be changed if their report is forward by the timethe White Paper reaches final forms    some reference to registration of titleas an adjunct to, but not an essential part of feudal reform may be calledforj6,    The Halliday Committee&apos;s terms of reference were:    &quot;To examine and report on existing conveyancing legislation and practice in relation to heritable andnoveabls property and to make recommendations with a view to amending or new legislation,,&quot;     It will be noted that the terms of this remit did not extend to a review of the present land tenure system itself.     But the Committee^report showed that even an examination directed to conveyancing law and practice/within

within the existing- system called fcxih. questions about that system;    and thereport did in fact contain a number of suggestions for more fundamental change.7,     The Halliday Report received a widespread welcome in the legal professionand among those concerned with land transactions and the use and developmentof land.     This acceptance of a report which not only recommended changes inconveyancing but made more radical suggestions concerning the present system,of land tenure was one of the factors which confirmed the Government in their conclusion that they should carry out an examination of the whole system offeudal tenure in order to find, out its advantages and disadvantages and toestablish whether a better system could be devised to take its pla.ee.Government consultation8.    On 26th July, 19^7? in reply to a Parliamentary Question about theHalliday Report, the Secretary of State made the following statement in theHouse of Commons 5-&quot;I have been considering this Report with the Lord Advocate in. &quot;Wie light of the comments I have received on it from interestedorganisations.     As a, result I have decided that there should be -an intensive examination of the possibility of major reform of the Scottishsystem of land tenure itself.     (The system of land tenure was not ofcourse within the remit of the Halliday Committee.)     I have authorisedofficials to enter into consultation with the main bodies concerned with land transactions and conveyancing in Scotland with a- view to developingproposals for this purpose, and I shall be consulting the Scottish LawCommi!ftsiona!i9o    Following this announcement a memorandum of proposals was sent forconsideration and comment to the Scottish Law Commission and to a number ofthe main bodies concerned with land transactions and land use.     Thismemorandum outlined the new system of land tenure for Scotland referred to inparagraph 23 of this paper and suggested ways of approaching some of theproblems both of conversion to the new system and of that system Itself.CONFIDENTIAL/10.

10,   Meetings were subsequently held at which the memorandum was the subjectof discussion between officials of the Scottish Office and representatives ofthe following bodiess-The Law Society of scotland the Faculty of AdvocatesThe Society of Writers to H.H. SignetThe Scottish Landowners1 federation the National Federation of Property Owners and FactorsThe Building Societies association the Chartered Land Societies Committee (Scotland)The Scottish Association of Registered House Builders11,   The Government are grateful to the bodies who were consulted for the trouble they took to make available their advice and experience.     Thediscussions which took place were full, free and most useful.     In some areasthey confirmed the workability of the proposals;   in others suggestions were put forward for improving them;    and in others again there was usefuldiscussion about means of minimising difficulties.     While the Governmenthave not been able to accept all the suggestions which were put forward, the consultations made a valuable contribution to the fuller proposals set outlater in this paper,12,   It has been argued that, while it is inflexible and complex, the great meritof the feudal system of tenure in Scotland is that, within its limitations andhowever cumbrously, it works.     Indeed it can be argued that there is no formof land use or development which, although sometimes at considerable troubleand expense, cannot be catered for within the feudal system.     It is also alwayspossible to point to difficulties arising under other systems which have not generally arisen in Scotland.     Where, for example, developers of land for house-building in Scotland were prevented by legal difficulties from feuingland to house-purchasers, or where, because of the complexity of feudal land lawythey were uncertain whether feuing was competent, they granted leases instead.But this was not a widespread practice, and Scotland has in large measure been/spared

spared the difficulties that, in England and Wales, made necessary the passingof the Leasehold Reform Act 1967*     &quot;SaAt this having heen said, a fundamentalobjection to the feudal system remains..     This is the possession by the superior of autocratic powers which may or may not be used in the publicinterest and which are frequently exercised for the purely negative purpose offrustrating proposals for land use and development.13,   An argument can also be put forward in favour of the feudal system inrelation to what the Halliday Committee call &quot;land conditions&quot;.     This is a term which is used in this paper for conditions which impose restrictions or duties in regard to the use of land and which are enforceable against theowner or a developer of the land affected by them.     This is an area of thelaw which under many systems of land tenure gives rise to questions about howfar restrictions or duties are enforceable with the passing of time;   whetherthey are enforceable against the successors of the person who entered into theoriginal agreement;   whether they are enforceable only by the person for whosebenefit the conditions were originally imposed or also by his successors;   andso on.     It can be argued that the feudal system, by recognizing a clearcontinuing relationship between successive superiors and vassals, avoids these doubts in the main area (that of feudal conditions) in which such land conditions at present exist in Scotland.     But it is in just this area that the essentiallyautocratic nature of the feudal system is most apparent,     The right to enforceland conditions often rests with one party alone (the superior), to the exclusion of the interests of others who may be directly affected by a change in the use ofthe land,Hf   It is not surprising that the enforcement and non-enforcement of feudalconditions do in practice constitute a major source of difficulty andcontroversy in the present system of land tenure.     The conditions may have been laid down long ago, but they may have been and indeed may still be ofbeneficial value to the land and to neighbouring proprietors.     On the otherhand, they may now be obsolete because of changed circumstances, or they maynever have been of any real benefit.     But in financial terms they are, so^ar- as they are enforceable, of potential profit to the superior.     HeCONFIDENTIAL / caimot

cannot initiate- a change in the use of land, but he can prevent useful change0r extract from a vassal who wishes to make such a change a high price for aviaiver of feudal conditions,;     The price need bear no relationship to any alteration in the value cf the superior&apos;s interest or to any increase in thevalue of the vassal1 s interest as a result of the change:    the price can bewhatever sum the superior cares to demand and the vassal is able and willing topay.    There can be no justification for the power of superiors either toprevent an often useful change of use or to exercise such an unconstructivefinancial interest in the change of use of land.15,   The enforcement or waiving of conditions gives rise to controversy in othe:ways also.     Vassals may have purchased property in a feudal estate in the expectation that the uniform set of conditions applied to them and to their neighbours would be operated by the superior to ensure tha maintenance of the amenities of the estate;   and it is true that a system by which a single public-spirited superior enforces a set of conditions throughout an estate can work toaaintain amenity without the complications which might follow an attempt to achieve the same purpose by a system cf  leases.     But there is no guarantee that the system will work in this way.     A neighbouring vassal, unless his feucharter gives him a right of enforcement (ius quaesitum jtertio)has no say in tha matter,     A particular condition may be beneficial mainly to the neighbour,and in that case it will be he who is affected by the loss of amenity if it iswaived;   but it is the superior who has the right to enforce it or (whether forprofit or not) to waive it.     Whatever may be the case for or against a systemof land conditions as such, it is wrong that one party (the superior) should hexa financial interest in the waiving of the condition at little or no disadvantajto his own enjoyment of his rights in land, but possibly to the disadvantage0? other parties,i6,  Such controversies have been sharpened by a change in the nature of feudalsuperiors.     A tendency has developed for individual superiors to be replaced by companies and other bodies holding superiorities merely as a form of^vestment.     In the past the paternalistic superior, with a personal interest

^ the area he has feued, has often played a constructive role, though one out0f keeping with modern democracy;   but the superior interested only in drawingmaximum profit from his financial holding regardless of the cost to hisyassals displays the mosx serious disadvantages of the system.17, The feudal system has other disadvantages.     Some of these are relativelyElinor, but they can be vexatious enough to the individual people concerned and they are all aspects of a general objection to a system of land tenurewhich involves a vassal and a superior, with a perpetual liability for anrnnual payment by one to the other.     It is not surprising that there shouldby objection to the annual payment of feuduty when there is often no apparentservice afforded by an impersonal or even anonymous superior to the vassalfor the payment,18, A particularly objectionable right of superiors under the system is thatthereby, in a case of &quot;unallocated feu duties&quot;, i.e. where proportions of asingle feuduty have been appiortioned over a number of properties without formalallocation by the superior, he can require any one of the vassals to pay thewhole feuduty, that person being consequently burdened with the collectionof their shares from the other vassals.   Again, the very words &quot;superior&quot;and &quot;vassal&quot; themselves, with their flavour of an age long past and a socialstructure long vanished, cannot be acceptable in modem times.19i It is sometimes argued that the existence of feuduty is in the interestsof vassals because it enables them to spread over a period of time the costof buying land.    The G-overnment cannot wholly accept this argument.   Peudutiesare charged in perpetuity, and it can be argued that vassals often pay fortiieir land many times over:    they may also find themselves having to pay alunp sum in respect of site value as well as accepting the perpetual liability for rouduty.   There is also some evidence to suggest that house purchaserstend to ignore &quot;the &quot;hidden cost&quot; of their house embodied in the feuduty:   theother common method of spreading the cost of house purchase - borrowing - atleast has the advantage that the purchaser is more likely to understand hisOomiriitment from the outset.   Final^, there is some ground for a suspicion thatCONFIDENTIAL &apos;the

the creation of feuduties and the- increase in their--general level in recentyears represents not a spreading of the cost of land but profiteering by;! Y iunscrupulous developers.20.   The feudal system is then fundamentally rigid and autocratic;   it can bethe source of complex interests in a single piece of land and consequently of heavy legal expense;   and in its operation it frequently assumes a purelynegative character.   The experience of those active in the field of landtransactions and land use suggests that it at least delays land use anddevelopment.   In addition there are, in the nature of the system, likely to be many cases in which the difficulty or cost of obtaining-a waiver of feudalconditions prevents development altogether,A new system21,   The Government do not think that the answer to these difficulties lies in minor patchwork reforms.   Their conclusion is that the balance of argumentis against perpetuation of the feudal system of land tenure, and they are convinced that it should be replaced by a new system altogether.22.   On this question the findings of the Halliday Committee, although bytheir terms of reference they could not consider a new system of land tenure,are of importance.   The Committee recommended that on a date sixty yearsafter the enactment of the necessary legislation all existing superioritiesshould be extinguished and that existing vassals should hold their land direct from the Crown, but free from feudal conditions as such and from liability forfeuduty.   They thus recommended that from that point in time vassals should become absolute owners of the land,23.  Prom that starting point the next question is whether there is any advantage to be gained by the maintenance of the feudal system over such aperiod as the Halliday Committee suggested.   The Government have reachedthe conclusion that the disadvantages of the feudal system could be avoidedand provision made for all the needs of desirable land use and development undera system of land tenure, capable of being established as soon as the necessary legislation had been passed, the only forms of which would be:-CONFIDENTIAL/(a)

(a) absolute ownership   and.(b) the enjoyment of occupation for a limited term (a lease).It was such a system that was outlined in the memorandum of proposalsreferred to in paragraph 9 arid tested out in the discussions described inparagraph 1 0,24.   The Government do not underrate the magnitude of the change which wouldbe involved in adopting a new system.   Nor do they imagine that the conversion to such a system and the working of the system itself would be free of difficulties.   But, after careful consideration, they believe thatit would be in the interests of Scotland and the Scottish people to abolishfeudal tenure as a system of land-holding and to substitute a new system.

PART IIThe Seven-Point Plan of Reform25.   Major reform of the Scottish land tenure system such as the Governmentare proposing would demand substantial legislation covering many detailedaspects of the subject.     The purpose of this Part of the paper is to describein outline the most important legislative proposals which make up the Government&apos;sseven-point plan of reform.     The proposals are explained more fully in Part III,which also contains suggestions for dealing with some of the problems whichwould be likely to arise in going over to and in establishing the new system of tenure,,     The Government&apos;s intentions are thats-(1)   On an appointed day feudal tenure will be abolished, and existingvassals who are owners of the dominium utile, i.e, the present proprietorsof the land, will be declared to own their land in terms of the new formof absolute ownership,(2)   Prom the appointed day the feuing or sub-feuing of land will no longer be allowed, nor will any other disposal of land or rights in land subjectto any form of annual payment in perpetuity or quasi-perpetuity,(3)   The system of land tenure will in future be based on two forms ofholdings -(a) a form of absolute ownerships   and(b) enjoyment of occupation for a term (a lease),(4)   It will be possible under the new system to create certain types ofprivate condition running with the land.(5)   The Lands Tribunal for Scotland, for which provision was made in the lands Tribunal Act 1949? will be given power to annul&apos; or modify unreasonableland conditions,(6)   Leases of land for house building and leases of house property will belimited to twenty years,(7)   Leases of land for non-residential purposes will be limited to sixtyyears. - -

- PART IIIProposals and Problems26.     The aim of the Government in propbsaing to embark on a major- reform ofland tenure in Scotland is to bring about the establishment of a new system of tenure which, while being as simple as possible, would enable land to be usedefficiently and productively and would be compatible with existing sjrstems of social control over land use a27.    It seems to the Government that a system of tenure is possible whichsatisfactorily meets these criteria but in -which the feuing of land need have noplaces    Prom a given date following the passing of the necessary legislation,, itkill therefore no longer be legally competent to feu land or otherwise to dispose of land or rights in land subject to any form of annual payment in perpetuity or quasi^-perpetuity.28,    The new system of land tenure which the Government envisage for scotland will have the two main features referred to earlier, i.e. a form of absoluteownership (abbreviated from now on to &quot;ownership&quot;);    and a right to occupationfor a fixed pei-iod of time (leasehold) *Omierjhip^29.    On a given day fixed by law feudal tenure as such will be abolished and thosewho own land at present as vassals will automatically be declared to be the absolute owners of that land.     In feudal terms, they might be said at that moment in time to come into possession of the estate or right in land which is knownas the dominium pienum.     Paragraphs 37 to 1+0 of this paper will explain how itis proposed that feudal holdings of land should be converted into ownership andvdll deal with the questions of existing feudal conditions and feuduties*30.    Ownership under the new system would constitute a permanent exclusiveright in land;   and the holder of this right would be able to exercise overit acts&apos; of ownership of all kinds, including disposal.     The exercise of theright would be subject to such factors as social controls over land use - for/example

example those relating to town and country planning, building and public heaHth -and land conditions (see paragraphs 31 &quot;35 below).Land conditions310    when land 5a   sold in the future it will be absolutely conveyed, andthe purchaser will own it absolutely.     In this context a major point to beconsidered is the place of private conditions which &quot;run with the land&quot;, i.e.v/hich remain attached to the land regardless of who at any given time owns it.32.    The essentially autocratic nature of the feudal system and the practice by superiors of granting waivers for profit have perhaps obscured the fact that private land conditions can operate beneficially and reasonably.     Althoughit is true that the role of such conditions has to some extent been taken overby modern plamiing and similar legislation, the Government believe that theyare nevertheless useful, as a complement to statutory controls, in enablingcitizens to safeguard the value, amenity or usefulness of their property and in helping to achieve harmony among neighbouring proprietors on detailed questionsof common responsibility for the upkeep of property.     Conditions running withthe land constitute a desirable element of stability in any system of tenure, andthey have the advantage that they do not need to be re-ncgotiatcd (with consequentlegal expense) on every occasion on which land and property change hands.     Inorder, however, to remove the objectionalle features of the operation of landconditions as seen under the feudal system the Government propose to limit for thefuture the types of conditions that may be attached to land;    to redefine how andby whom such conditions may be enforced;    and to establish a judicial authorityto which appeals may be made against conditions which are thought to be unreasonable.33&quot;    In the Government&apos;s view a fresh statement is needed of the requirementsttuch land conditions should satisfy.     It may be that the definition ofthese requirements could be based on the present law relating to landconditions, with suitable adjustments.     But it should be a pre-requisite of/all

all such conditions that:-(l)   They should relate solely to the land on which they are imposedand to its use:(2)   they should be of such a kind as to benefit other land in thatthey serve to increase the value or amenities of that land orconduce to the more convenient or beneficial use of it;    and-(3)   they should be clearly defined, and the deed creating them should specifically provide that they are to run with the land.These pre-requisites would not prevent parties to any transactionentering into conditions of other kinds:    such conditions would not howeverrun with the land in question, but would bind only the contracting parties per-sonally.34.    Under the present system of land tenure, generally speaking, superiorsalone have the right to enforce feudal conditions relating to amenity andother matters.     This situation is bound to change with the disappearance offeudal tenure and the establishment of the new land tenure system.     TheGovernment have reached the conclusion that the most reasonable andstraight-forward arrangement in relation to new land conditions is togive enforcement rights only to owners of laud to which the benefit created by the conditions is specifically attached by the terms of the creating deed or any subsequent variation of it.     In this way it will be clear who has a right toenforce conditions - a feature of the present land tenure system which is oftencommended and which it would be undesirable to lose if this can be avoided.The proposed judicial authority referred to in paragraph 3^ will however be      - -.- -empowered to entertain representations from parties who, though they have no writtenright of enforcement, can show to the satisfaction of the authority that theyhave an interest in securing that particular conditions continued to be enforced.35*    Methods of enforcement of condions need to be examined more closely,but the Government&apos;s provisional view is that they could be based on existing/law

law relating to interdict and damages.Judicial authority36.     It is of the very nature of land conditions that with the passage of timecertain conditions, reasonable though they may have been originally, become less relevant than they were when first created.     Under the new system it wouldbe important to ensure that requests to be relieved of out-of-date conditions were not unreasonably obstructed by those with a right to enforce them.     For thisreason the Government accept that there are good grounds for the establishment of judicial authority with power to modify or annul conditions running with the land.In the Government&apos;s view the appropriate authority for this purpose would be the lands Tribunal for Scotland, for which statutory provision is made under the lands Tribunal Act 19^9.     Indeed, as the Halliday Committee made clear in theirreport, the need for the Tribunal exists already under the present system of land tenure;    and Part IV of this paper will say more about the Government&apos;s proposal in this direction.Conversion to the new system37*    From the appointed day feuduty as such will cease to be payable, but untilthe time when redemption takes place, as explained in paragraph 38, the annualamount formerly due as feuduty will continue to be paid by the owner to theex-superior.     In respect of recovery of this amount feudal remedies suchas irritancy will be abolished, but the ex-superior will continue to have thesame personal remedy by civil action as at present.38.    At any time after the appointed day any owner will be able to elect to redeem the annual money payment due by him to the ex-superior;    and redemptionwill be compulsory on the occasion of the first sale of the land after theappointed day.     The terms of redemption will be prescribed by statute andwill have the effect of enabling ex-vassals to redeem the obligation on fair and reasonable terms.

39.    An important question in relation to conversion to the new system is thatof feudal conditions.     The potential usefulness of certain kinds of privateland conditions ivas mentioned in paragraph 32 of this paper;   and the government consider that it would he reasonable to permit feudal conditions of continuingusefulness e.g. conditions relating to amenity, to remain enforceable under thenew system of tenure.     But, in accordance with the spirit of the reforms whichthe Government propose to make, the right of enforcement will after the appointed day be in the hands of the proprietors likely to be affected, by breach of acondition.     This category of affected proprietors will require to be defined in the statute, perhaps   by reference to the geographical proximity of their land to the land affected by the condition.     Some ex-superiors might, as it happened,come   into the category of those with enforcement rights - but only in their capacity as owners of neighbouring land.Mi    The proposed Lands Tribunal for Scotland mentioned in paragraph 36rill have a role to play in relation to feudal conditions of continuingusefulness ?which continue to subsist under the new system of tenure.     There mightbe failure amorg affected proprietors to agree on whether breach of a condition[of continuing usefulness should be permitted in a particular case;   or the identity of the affected proprietors might not be clear;   or there might beispute as to whether a particular condition was in fact of continuing usefulnessr not.     In such situations a person aggrieved by a condition and impeded17 it from developing his property should have a right of recourse to therlbunal.     The Tribunalwill also be empowered to entertain representationsjrom parties who, though not affected proprietors within the strict termsif the statute, can show to their satisfaction an interest in securing thatArticular conditions continue to be enforced.fcbnld1i*   The Government recognise that under any new system of tenure it willatinue to he necessary to provide for the use&apos; and occupation of land and/property

property for limited periods of time.    Many people will still, for example,have to make temporary moves because of the^nature of their work;   and,depending on their individual circumstances, they will not always want to buya house in the place to which they are going or to give up their existinghouse irrevocably.     They may quite reasonably want to lease the latter forthe duration of their absence and take a lease of property in their newsurroundings.     In most respects the present leasehold system in scotland would seem adequate as part of the new system which the Government envisage,but they consider that an import ant modifibat ion is necessary in relation to long leases for residential purposes.lj.2.    Experience in some parts of Scotland and elsewhere suggests that longleasehold of land for residential purposes can give rise to many kinds of difficulty.     During the tern of the lease a multiplicity of interests in theland can be created, with consequent conveyancing difficulties.     The system inthis respect has in fact disadvantages coraparablo to those of feuing.Towards the end of the lease there may be a good deal of hardship for people as they come to realise that the home which they have made over a long period,which they have had improved from their own resources, and which they haveperhaps come to regard as their own will come into the possession of the landlord.     Again, as the end of the lease comes in sight, property may oftenfall into a state of dilapidation.     It was considerations such as thesethat led to the passing of the Long Leases (Scotland) Act 195^ (the provisionsof which have now expired) and that led the Halliday Committee to theconclusion that &quot;the use of long leasehold tenure of dwelling-house proertyshould be strongly discouraged.&quot;^3*    The Government therefore propose that under the new system of land tenure in Scotland the maximum period for a lease of land on which houses are to be built or for a lease of residential property should be 20 years.Such a restriction will not prevent the building cn leased land of houses/deliberat ely

deliberately designed for occupation over limited periods, such as certainkinds of holiday bungalow;    but it will prevent the disruption caused whenpeople find their homes coming into the possession of landlords.l&amp;.t    Different considerations apply to leases of land and buildings for commercial and other non-residential purposes.     Long leases are widely usedin the conveyancing of commercial and industrial properties, and they may help good planning and land management by making it easier to group landuses and developments into a modern pattern where buildings over a substantialarea become obsolete about the same time.     It is difficult to see howeverwhat contribution leasehold can make if leases are granted for periods much longer than the normal expectation of life of a building.     Very long leasesmay indeed open the way to the perpetuation of the feudal system in practice, ifnot in theory.K5*    In the light of the consulations referred to in this paper the government consider that the valuable features of a leasehold system in the commercialfield would be preserved if a limit of 60 years were put on such leases.     Wheredevelopers envisage the use of a site for appreciably longer periods, andvncre owners- envisage surrendering the use of the land for such longer periods,there appears to be a clear case for outright purchase.Other forms of tenureMS.    Side by side with feudal tenure there exist in Scotland today other formsof tenure which, originating in historical events or circumstancescenturies ago, have survived unchanged in many ways.     There &apos;is, for example,udal tenure, of Scandinavian origin, in Orkney and Shetland;   and there arethe &quot;kindly tenancies&quot; in Dumfriesshire which have existed since the timeof Robert the Bruce.     The main concern of the Government has been to examine and deal with the feudal system of tenure under which the great bulk of landrn Scotland is held;   but before major legislation on land tenureis presented to Parliament they intend to bring under review, with/appropriate

appropriate consulation, other existing forms of land tenure in orderthat conclusions may be reached about their future.47.   Apart from the forms of tenure mentioned in the preceding paragraph,there are other contracts -which produce effects comparable to those of feus.Contracts of ground annual show undesirable features similar to those offeus;   and long leases, when they amount to grants of land in perpetuity,are equally undesirable.   The Government&apos;s intention for longer-termlegislative purposes is that these forms should be treated in all respects in the same way as feus.Other money burdens on land48.   Further relics of past centuries are to be found in Scotland in theform of obligations on individuals to make payments which, in their earlierforms, were related to services or facilities provided in return.   Indifferent parts of Scotland, for example, there are still exigible paymentsknown as multures arising out of obligations to have grain ground atparticular mills.   This practice and the relationship which it reflectedhave long disappeared, but even at the present day the owners or tenants ofcertain lands require to make these payments.   In Orkney and Shetland leviesknow as &quot;skats&quot; are still to be found - a survival of the land tax which was originally imposed during the Norse occupation of these Islands.   In their further examination of non-feudal systems of land tenure the government propose, in keeping with their general aims of land temire reform, to bringsuch obligations as these under critical scrutiny in order to decide what should be done with them.49.   The main features of the reform of land tenure which the government propose for Scotland have been outlined in this Part of the paper.   Part IVdescribes, the action which the Government have in mind to take in the nearfuture.

PART rvThe Next Steps50.   The proposals for the reform of land tenure in Scotland which theGovernment have made in this paper are put forward as a basis for legislation.     It is of course open to any individual or professionalor other group to make their views known, and the Government will welcome comment on any aspect of the proposals,51,   Given the length of time the feudal system has subsisted in Scotlandand the complexities inherent in it, the legislation necessary to bringabout fundamental reform would inevitably be substantial.     This being so,it will be 1971 at the earliest before the major land tenure reformlegislation is introduced.     But the Government are concerned to deal before then with certain of the most objectionable features of the feudal system to which the Halliday Committee&apos;s report called attention and,concurrently, to give legislative effect to some of the useful recommendia-tions made by the Committee for reforming conveyancing law.     For these purposes the Government propose to introduce early legislation.     Thefollowing paragraphs describe the matters which it is proposed to dealwith in this measure.Variation and discharge of land conditionsI52,   Reference was made in paragraph 36 of this paper to the recommendationof the Halliday Committee that judicial machinery should be provided forthe variation and discharge of land conditions.     This recommendation was widely welcomed in the legal profession and elsewhere as a means oftempering the autocracy of the feudal system;    and the Government attach importance to establishing such arrangements as part of their interim/ action

action in this field.     The Government propose therefore that those whoseland is burdened by land conditions should be enabled, in default ofagreement with superiors, to seek to have such conditions modified orannulled by a judicial authority broadly on the lines envisaged by theHalliday Committee.     The Government consider that the appropriate authority would be the Lands Tribunal for Scotland, which will in anycase be needed for other purposes.Unallocated feu duties and ground annuals53,   The problem of unallocated feu duties and the vassals&apos; liability toact as an unpaid debt collector was referred to in paragraph 18 of this paper and was also dealt with in the Halliday Report,&quot;    The government propose to make provision in their interim Bill for dealing with thedifficulties to which unallocated feu duties give rise at the present time.It is proposed that the Bill should enable every vassal to apply to hissuperior to have his share of the feuduty fixed as the limit of hisfinancial obligation and thus given the effect of a formal allocation.It would be open to a vassal or superior to question the amounts to befixed, and unresolved disputes would go before the Lands Tribunal, forScotland,     It is the Government&apos;s viev/ however that there should be noaugmentation of vassals&apos;  share to cover any increased collection costs incurred by superiors.     It is proposed that the provisions described inthis paragraph should also apply to ground annuals.Hal.li.day Committee conveyancing recommendations54.   The Government wish to take the opportunity presented by their interimlegislation to give effect to certain of the recommendations made by theHalliday Committee for the modernisation of conveyancing law.     Any detailedexposition of these highly technical matters would be out of place in this paper, but the aim in general is to deal in the Bill with those recommendations which the legal profession in Scotland regard as the most urgent and important.     It is proposed, for example, to deal with thequestion of positive prescription, which relates to the establishment of rights in land, and which is currently under further examination by thewi   t j    n CONFIDENTIALooottxsh Law Commas sxon.
