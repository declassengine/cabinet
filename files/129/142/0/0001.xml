(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY[S GOVERNMENT)$ S &apos;Copy No._CABINETDIVORCE REFORM bill memorandum by the Lord chancellor,      My colleagues will  remember that, at  its meeting held on12th November,  the Cabinet  took note of  the parliamentary committee&apos;s opinion that,   in view of the history of  the bill introduced by Mr. William Wilson last Session,  it would be appropriate for the Government  to find time for the House tohave an bpportunity of reaching a conclusion on Mr. Alec Jones1sDivorce Reform Bill  (which is in substance the same asMr4 Wilson*s Bill)  during  the current Session (CC(68)  46thCancluslonsi Minute 2).2.      Accordingly,  time was made available for  the Second Readingwhich was carried by 188 votes  to 103 at a morning sitting on17th December.      On 26th March the Bill completed its committee stage after 13 sittings and emerged substantially unamended.It has now been considered on Report on 3 successive Fridaysand is down for further consideration next Friday, but determined opposition on the part of a small group of Members has made it;obvious that there is no prospect of the Bill getting throughthe House in Private Members1  time.      Unless,   therefore,Government  time is made available,  this Bill/  like its predecessor,will be lost for lack of time.3,      In my view the Government ought to make time available andthus afford an opportunity for  the House of Commons  to reach afinal conclusion on the proposals contained in the Bill, ifnecessary at the cost of an all-night  sitting.      Although itenjoys all-party backing,   the great majority of those who favourit are Government supporters and,  after what happened last session,  I  think there would be widespread dismay and resentmentamong them if once again this reform were frustrated through lack of time,4,      If the Bill is to have a reasonable prospect of completingits Parliamentary passage,  it must  leave the House of Commonsnot  later than 23rd May,      There is,  I believe,  a feelingstrongly held in many quarters  that a decision on these matters should be reached.      If we cannot make time available for theC(69) 5113th May. 1969CONFIDENTIAL

Report and Third Reading stage in the Commons  to be completed by the Recess, we must  face the consequence that,  for the second year running,  there will have been a failure to reach such adecision.      For the reasons I have given,  I  think this  is a consequence we ought  to avoid.G,House of Lords,SW112th May 1969CONFJDENTSAL
