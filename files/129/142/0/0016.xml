C(69) 66 COPY NO.10th June, 1969CABINETREVIEW OF PARJLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland at the meeting of Ministers held on 3rd June, I was invited to circulate a paper to the Cabinet about the implementation of the Reportof the Boundary Commission for Scotland, with a view to separate consideration of the Scottish position.The commission s recommendations,      Annexed to this paper is a factual analysis of the Commissionsrecommendations.    The Commission have recommended no change in thetotal number of Scottish constituencies (71); but their proposals involvesubstantial alterations in 37 constituencies, including the reduction ofGlasgow*s representation from 15 to 13 seats and the creation of two new constituencies in Dunbartonshire and Lanarkshire,     The Reportnotes that in the period between 1954 (when the last review was carriedout) and 1965 the Scottish electorate declined by 17, 345 and that the electoral quota for the purposes of the Commission^ review was 47, 745,compared with an English electoral quota of 58, 759.    There are only twoScottish constituencies with an electorate of more than 70,000: EastDunbartonshire (84, 967 in 1968) and Lanark (74, 510).The Report of the Pioyal Commission on Local Government in Scotland3,      It is now unlikely that the Report of the Wheatley commission will be published before September.    I have as yet received no indication of what the Commission will recommend but it is clear that their proposals will involve radical changes in the structure of local govern-ment in Scotland.    Yet the Scottish Boundary Commission operatesunder much more flexible rules than the English Commission, theonly stipulation being that no burgh (other than a county of a city)shall be partly in one constituency and partly in another.    Thusimplementation of the Scottish Boundary Commission^ Report is most unlikely to produce a situation that would result in any formalinfringement of the rules following reorganisation of local governmentin Scotland,DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)

Implementation of the Boundary Commissions report,      I am under the same statutory obligation, in respect of theScottish Report, as the Home Secretary is in relation to the Reportsfor England, Wales and Northern Ireland, namely, to lay it beforeParliament &quot;as soon as may be&quot; after it has been submitted togetherwith drafts of Orders in Council for giving effect to it, with or withoutmodifications.    My preference is to implement the Scottish report-t infull, without further delay.    It is true that in Scotland there are noglaring examples of under-representation comparable with certainconstituencies in England; but 15 years have elapsed since the lastreview and it seems undesirable to perpetuate the more serious anomalieswhich have resulted, for example, from the redevelopment of centralGlasgow and the growth of population in new towns such as East Kilbrideand Cumbernauid.    If no action is taken on the Commission^ Report,these disparities will be accentuated until such time as legislation is introduced to enable a fresh comprehensive review of constituenc3^boundaries to be undertaken in the wake of &quot;Wheatley and Maud,    i see considerable advantage therefore in fulfilling my statutory duty to implement the Scottish Commission^ Report forthwith.Possible alternatives5,      I appreciate that this course of action would be embarrassingin relation to the introduction of legislation to relieve the Home Secretaryof his statutory obligation in relation to the Reports of the other boundary commissions.    I have therefore examined possible alternatives,(a) I could simply decline to act on the Commission^ recoramenda-tions and leave the existing Scottish constituencies untouched: this wouldmean my joining with the Home Secretary in seeking to be relieved of mystatutory obligation.    I could justify this course on the grounds that theWheatley Report is in the offing and that there are no glaring anomaliesto be dealt with by the kind of &apos;holding operation&apos; proposed by the HomeSecretary for splitting English constituencies with an electorate of morethan 90,000,    On the other hand, it could be argued that the Scottishelectoral quota is much lower than the English quota and that, if thelargest English constituencies are to be split, the dividing line shouldbe significantly lower in Scotland,(b) This consideration led me to consider the possibility of dealingwith the more serious anomalies as a holding operation.     These are in east Dunbartonshire (84,961) and Lanark (74, 510).    If the formerconstituency were to be divided up, the most sensible course v/ould be.to follow the Boundary Commission&apos;s recommendations and createthree constituencies (average electorate 45, 752)outof East and vTestDunbartonshire (84, 961 and 52, 295 respectively).    There would alsobe some advantage in splitting the Lanark constituency since this wasthe other area in which the Commission recommended the creation ofa new constituency, primarily to accommodate the growth in the-2-

population of East Kilbride.    It would be impracticable, however, toadopt the Commission^ proposals for this area since this would entailaltering the boundaries of six other Lanarkshire constituencies; andthe Commission would have to be asked to recommend the basis onwhich Lanark should be divided without affecting the adjoiningconstituencies,6.       The effect of (b) would be to increase the number of Scottishseats from 71 to 73;  and I recognise that it would be extremelydifficult to justify this having regard to the fact that the Scottishelectorate is declining whilst the English electorate has increasedvery substantially since the last review was carried out in 1954,I have therefore concluded that the only practical alternative toimplementation of the Commission^ Report is a standstill on existingconstituency boundaries in Scotland,7,      I remain of the opinion, however, that the most straightforwardand acceptable course would be to implement, without modification, theReport of the Boundary Commission for Scotland;  and I invite mycolleagues to agree to this,    I could not defend any other courseby reference to future discordance with th.2 statutory rules in theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Acts, as the HomeSecretary can;  and the difference between the English and Scottishversions of these rules would, I think, be a tenable explanation ofthe Governments reasons for taking different courses in the twocountries.W.R.Scottish Office, S, W, L.10th June, 1969

Analysis of the Recppmondations of the boundary Commission...for ScotlgjTd(Kotos   A figure immediately following the name of a constituency&apos;in this!paper denotes the 1965. electoratej   the subsequent figure in brackets denotesthe 1968 electorate)flumbar of, constituonciea1.    Rule 1 of the Rules for Redistribution in Schedule 2 to the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 provides that Scotland is to &quot;00divided into not less than 71 constituencies^   . Since the last general review in 1954 the Scottish electorate ha3 declined by.17?345. while .in the sameporiod the ISnglish electorate has increased by 1,102,730*     The 19&amp;&apos;5 electoral quota for Scotland is 47?745 compared with a quota of 58,759  Q&apos;  England.In those ^circumstances the Scottish Commission have taken the view that thereis no case for an increase in Scotland&apos;s representation at Westminster.Relationship of constituencies to local government areas&apos;-2.    Only Rule 4(0 (b) of the Rules in&apos; Schedule 2 to the 1949 Act has a hearingon the relationship of Parliamentary constituencies in Scotland to localgovernment areas, this rule providing that.no burgh, ,other than a county of acity, shall be included partly in one constituency and partly in another.The Commission have indicated in their report, however, that in carrying out their review they have had regard to the desirability of Constituency boundarioconforming with local authority boundaries generally and-not only with burghboundaries.     Otherwise the rules provide that the electorates of constituencies should be as nearly equal a3 practicable,&quot;   but that theCommission may depart from this requirement and the requirement about burghboundaries if special geographical considerations make this desirable,.     TheHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958 also relievos the Commissiorof the obligation to give full effect to the rules in all oirournatancos.if?for instance, changes would break local ties0Outline of Commission&apos; s -recommendations.3. : The Commission have recommended that 25 of the existing 1&apos;\ constituencies -should remain unchanged and thata fturther 9 constituencies should be altered ;only to conform with minor changes in local authority boundaries.     Some of the.constituencies concerned have very small electorates,&apos;e.g. Western Isles./&apos;23,292 (22,542),&quot; - Orkney and Zetland 25,244 (24,633)5   and Ross and Cromarty2^685 (24,426). - Like their predecessors, the;Commission have taken, the, (view that special geographical considerations&quot; /justify the continuation ofthose area&apos;as separate constituencies.

j,,,    The Commission have recommended substantial changes in the remaining 57constituenciesi    In only three areas however, is tho nuiaber of seatsEffected(i)   GlasgowThe electorate in the city declined by 65,965 between 1954 and ,r;965j ;and there has been a further decline of 33,031 between 1965 and 1968,. ;The city how contains some constituencies with very small electorates,,e,g. Kelvingrove 26,301 (20,550), Central 28,916 (22,172)-&apos;and Oovan 134,350 (27,350). The Commission have recommended that the representationof the city should be reduced from the existing 15 constituencies to 13constituencies. This would give an -average electorate, per Glasgowconstituency of 50,088 as at 1965 and 47,547 for 1968c &apos;&quot;(ii)&apos; Dunbartonshire,The existing two constituencies in this count;&apos;-&apos; had a total electorateof 126,426 in--1965 and of 137,256 in -1968a; East Dunbartonshire with anelectorate of;75,705 in 1965 and 84,961 in,.1968 had the largest electorateof any constituency in-Scotland. The Commission have recommended that-the- county should be divided into the following throe constituencies::East Dunbartonshire 37,463 (46,642), Central Dunbartonshire 44,723&apos;(45,327) and West Dunbartonshire 44,296 (45,357).-(iii) LanarkshireThe existing seven constituencies in the county,had a total electorate-of 369,566 in 1965 and of 380,675 in ,1968.&apos; . The Commission have recommended an additional constituency.     This would give an average&quot;electorate per constituency of 46,196 for 1965 and of 47,584 for 1968,5.    In the following areas tho Commission have recommended- substantial changes which do not affect the number of constituencies.(i) Ayrshire and ButeAn adjustment between the Central Ayrshire&apos;. and Kilmamockconstituencies&apos;to include &quot;the whole, of tho Kilmarnock District of Ayrcounty in the Kilmarhock constituency^    Tho-electorates of the revised:constituencies would be as follows:   Central Ayrshire 47,211&apos; (48,724.)and Xilmarnock 52,260- (52,039).(ii) FifeAdjustments affecting mainly Dunfermline Burghs, Kirkcaldy Burghsand West Fife constituencies.     The county is at present divided into two county constituencies (East Fife and West Fife) and two districts ofburgha constituencies (Dunfermline Burghs and Kirkcaldy Burghs)^(Notes   Districts of burghs constituencies are a Scottish peculiarityana consist of &apos;a number of burghs, not all of which are contiguous,associated together for purposes of representation in Parliaments-there are only three such constituencies remaining in Scotland of/which

which two are in Fife.)     The changes would involve the association&apos; of the burghs in the districts of burghs constituencies with the .-surrounding county areas and would result in the county being dividedinto four county constituencies.     One effect of the changes would bothe redistribution of tho comparatively largo and increasing electorate- in West Fife&apos;56,156 (59,l8o).    Tho electorates of the revisedconstituencies would bo:   Central Fife-47,762 (i-9,835) , Dunfermline50,597 (51,377), East Fife 49,578 (49,506$,, and Kirkcaldy 57,201(56,914).     &apos;i (iii) EdinburghAdjustments to five of tho existing seven constituencies to reducedisparities in the electorates.     Tho electorates of tho revised&apos;, constituencies would be as fellows:   Edinburgh Leith&apos;44,908 .(43? 170)3 -&apos;( .&apos;.Edinburgh North 51,607 (47,649), Edinburgh West 44,60S&apos;(47*748)tEdinburgh Central 49,024 (-45,591) and Edinburgh Pontalands 40,063 .(42,185).(iv) RenfrewshireAdjustments to East Renfrewshire&apos; 65,781 (68,274), West Renfrewshire52,569 (55,718) end GreenoCk 46,375 (44,612) to reduce the disparitiesin the electorates.
