TELEVISION OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE HOUSEOF COMMONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord President of the council. Before the Recess I announced in the House of Commons that therewould be a debate on 19 October on the question of an experiment in the broadcasting of the proceedings of the House,    Before then my colleagues will wish to consider the form of the debate and the general nature of anysuch experiment.FORM OF DEBATE2. As the issue is one for the House rather than for the Government Iconsider that the debate should be on a Private Member&apos;s Motion in the names of prominent advocates of the broadcasting of proceedings(eg. Mr Batsford, Mr Crouch and Mr Driberg), and that there should be a free vote.    I would propose to discuss the wording of the Motion with theprincipal signatories, but I envisage something on the following lines -&quot;That this House considers that there should be an experiment in the public broadcasting of its proceedings;  and that the services committee should consult with the broadcasting authoritiesregarding the arrangements for, and evaluation of, such an experiment&quot;,I would expect the Services Committee to appoint a sub-committee for thispurpose.3. I would propose to speak in the debate.    So far as the governments view is concerned, I would say simply that we would abide by the decisionof the House on this matter:  but I would confirm my personal belief thatthe broadcasting of proceedings would be in the interests of Parliament.I would also propose to put to the House the following conclusions reached in consultation with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and theIndependent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), on the form which an experimentmight best take, if the House so wished.1CP(72) 100 COPY NO      653 October 1972CABINET
THE NATURE OF THE EXPERIMENT4.        It is envisaged that the experiment should last three weeks.    Itshould comprise the television and sound broadcasting of proceedings ofthe House of Commons and also the sound broadcasting only of proceedingsof the House of Lords.    There are two particular matters to be considered:a. Should the experiment be a public or closed circuit one?b. The need for balanced coverage.5,        Although this would be contrary to what was proposed by the SelectCommittee in 1966, and might perhaps slightly lessen the chance of a vote in favour, it is in my view essential that the experiment should be public.Members should have the opportunity to assess the way in whichproceedings are broadcast, the public&apos;s reaction and the effect of publicbroadcasting on the conduct of proceedings.    The broadcasting authoritieshold this view strongly, and have little or no interest in a closed circuitexperiment.    I have therefore deliberately suggested that the word &quot;public&quot;should be included in the terms of the Motion.6. The broadcasting authorities1 ideas on their possible experimentalprogrammes are set out at Annex A.    I think these are acceptable as abasis for discussion.    But the House will need assurances that coveragewill be fair and balanced, not only in Party political terms but in relationto the standing and reputation of the House.    It would not be practicableor desirable that the House should exercise censorship over the content ofbroadcasts, nor would the broadcasting authorities proceed on any basisother than their ultimate editorial independence.    Both the BBC and IBAhave existing obligations to maintain due balance and impartiality (under theBBCs licence and agreement and under the Television Act 1964 respectively).They have indicated that they would be willing to consider giving under-takings relating these general obligations to the specific circumstances ofan experiment.8, The experiment is intended to cover &quot;proceedings in the House&quot;.I would not recommend that formal restrictions should be placed on the broadcasting authorities, except that their broadcasts should be confined to proceedings in the Chamber.9.        I would propose to explain the above position to the House.    Ifnecessary the editorial assurances might subsequently be embodied in a formal exchange of correspondence.    Some detailed points on copyrightand privilege are set out at Annex B.TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT, LIGHTING, ETC.10.        Certain installations and enhanced lighting would be required inthe House for the experiment.    The House would wish to judge the effects of these, which would be varied as far as possible so as to demonstratealternative options.    Details would be worked out by the ServicesSub-Committee in consultation with the House and broadcasting authoritiesand the Department of the Environment.    The broadcasting authorities are confident that conditions will be better than in the 1968 House of Lordsexperiment.2
R home Office3 October 1972/\ .. .311.        If the experiment is public the maximum cost to public funds wouldbe  2, 000 to be borne on the Department of the Environment Vote.    the bbc have requested that the costs they would incur (hitherto estimated at about  150, 000) should be accepted as lying outside their forecasts ofexpenditure at the time of the last licence increase.    If the House were todecide in favour of a closed-circuit experiment, and the broadcasting authorities were persuaded to participate in it, they would requirereimbursement of their expenses.TIMING12. It is hoped that the experiment might take place in the early summer of 1973, if the House so decided.RECOMMENDATIONS13.       I recommend that:a. The debate on the experimental broadcasting of theproceedings of the House should take place on a backbench motion on the lines set out in paragraph 2, and there should be a free vote.b. I should speak in the debate as proposed at paragraph 3.
ANNEX APOSSIBLE BBC AND THE IBA PROGRAMMES DURING THE EXPERIMENTBBC Television(a) Nightly half-hour summaries of the day&apos;s proceedings&quot;broadcast after 11 p.m. and repeated the followingluncht ime.(b) Extracts in news broadcasts.(c) One or two Question Times (broadcast live)  in separateprogrammes.(d) Perhaps live coverage of a major debate.BBC RadioRecorded speech both from the House of Commons and theHouse of Lords in extended &quot;Today in Parliament&apos; and1Ye st erday in Par1iame nt&apos; programme s.IBA Television(a) Appropriate recorded visual extracts in nightly news bulletins and regional news magazines.(b) A week in Parliament&apos;  item in a weekly magazineprogramme. ,(c) One or two experimental late-night longer summaries ofa day&apos;s proceedings.(d) Perhaps live coverage of another full debate.All television broadcasts would be in colour. Coverage dufing.main viewing times in new bulletins would be as generous aspossible.     The format and treatment would be varied as much aspossible during the experiment.
ANNEX BCOPYRIGHT, PRIVILEGE AND DEFAMATION(i) CopyrightFurther consideration may need to be given to whether the house would wish to assume copyright of recordings of its proceedings, orenter into more specific agreements with the broadcasting authorities with regard either to imposing restrictions on the ultimate disposalby the broadcasting authorities of such material or the specificationof any rights of educational bodies, overseas Parliaments etc to have access to such material.     The broadcasting authorities have statedthat they would wish to have the copyright of their recordings of proceedings in accordance with the views expressed by the then lawOfficers in their evidence published in the second report,   of theSelect Committee on the Broadcasting of the proceedings in the Houseof lords in 1968.     For the purpose of the debate, hox^ever, it issuggested that, if necessary, it might merely be indicated that the broadcasting authorities have stated that they would be willing toconsider imposing in any contracts of sale conditions requiring thatthe material may not be used in any way that was derogatory to theHouse or its Members.     The details might then, if necessary, be pursued by the Services sub-Committee.(ii) Privilege and DefamationAccording to the first and second reports of the Joint Committeeon the Publication of Proceedings in Parliament (1969-70), an amend-ment to the Parliamentary Papers Act, 1840 would be required inorder to extend absolute privilege to the broadcasting ofParliamentary proceedings.     Publication of proceedings, or extracts,by the broadcasting authorities during an experiment would, therefore,as such, appear only to enjoy qualified privilege (i.e. a charge ofdefamation might be made by a Member against the broadcasting authorities if, for example, he considered the choice of extracts from his speech was actuated by malice - the position being the sameas for press reporting).     The broadcasting authorities have indicated that they would be satisfied with the availability of a defence of qualified privilege, and if this issue is raised in the debate it is, therefore, proposed to say that in these circumstancesno amendment of the Parliamentary Papers Act,  1840, would appearto be required.
