1At previous meetings the Government, the TUC and the CBIhave agreed on objectives for economic management in the presentsituation: faster growth in national output and incomes andmoderation in the rate of cost and price inflation.    The government believes that the specific proposals set out below offer the best meansof moving towards these objectives in the next 12 months, as well aslooking after the interests of pensioners.    During this period theGovernment, the TUC and the CBI will need to meet regularly to discussobjectives for the ensuing phase and how best to achieve thorn, .The proposals are:-ECONOMIC GROWTH1.     The Government would extend its commitment to achieve a5 per cent rate of growth to cover the next 2 years.    This isnecessary not only to increase the national prosperity and toprovide additional resources for the social services but alsoto reduce unemployment below its present unacceptable level.PRICES2.     The aim should be to keep the growth of retail prices resultingfrom increases in costs within a limit of 5 per cent over thenext 12 months.3.     This aim requires that price increases of manufactured products,which will benefit from a larger than average increase in productivity, should be kept within a limit of 4 per cent, andthat this should be fully reflected in retail prices.    nationalised industries would be expected as nearly as possible to match the performance of the private sector.    The proposal on pay set outin paragraph 5 below would be crucial in keeping these priceswithin this limit.   (See Annex)4.     The Government would be prepared, as part of a tripartitieapproach to take further action as appropriate to limit price increases where it has the ability to influence them.pay.     Over the next 12 months pay increases, which should come intoeffect not less than 12 months after the previous increase,should consist of a uniform cash sum of  2 a week.    In industries where pay is largely or wholly governed by existing incentivearrangements, any changes negotiated, whether at national,company or plant level, should be so designed that earnings donot rise by more than  2 a week for the same output.    This
approach would both help the low paid and ensure that the package as a whole reduced the rate of inflation.    Due account would have to be taken of any reduction in hours.6.     A new body should be set up to help the traditionally low paidindustries to achieve greater efficiency as a basis for payinghigher wages; and should be available to help employers and unions to improve the position of the lower paid in otherindustries.7.     Certain once-for-all factors could in 1973 have the effect ofcausing retail prices to rise by somewhat more than the5 per cent envisaged in paragraph 2.    It is therefore proposedthat threshold agreements should be adopted in settlementswhich conform with the proposals in paragraph 5 above.    Thecompensation would be a flat rate amount, say 2Op for eachincrease of 1 per cent above a threshold of 6 per cent.    Thiswould ensure that the low paid maintained a substantial realincrease throughout the year.PENSIONS8.     Pensioners would benefit from the reduced rate of inflationwhich would result if these proposals were observed withoutany exceptions.    In addition, the Government would beprepared as part of the tripartite approach to take appropriate action to ensure that in the coming year pensioners also hadthe benefit of a share in the nation!^, increasing prosperity.The Government recognises that the TUC and CBI- will need timeto consider these far-reaching proposals, but hopes to resumesubstantive discussion in mid-October.    In the meantime, to avoid therisk of prejudicing the prospects of these proposals being applied over thenext 12 months, the Government calls on all those concerned with pay and price determination not to take any action inconsistent withparagraphs 1-7 above.2
ECONOMIC background. If the rate of economic growth over the next 12 months is takento be 5 per cent and if the rise in home costs per unit of output is takento be no more than 5 per cent the current value of g. n. p. a year from now will be  60, 250 million.2. On the assumption that the share of g. n. p. which will go towages and salaries will be 61 per cent - the average for the past tenyears - the total of wages and salaries will rise over the next 12 months to  36, 750 million at an annual rate, some  3, 000 million more than atpresent.    The number of wage and salary earners is taken to rise to22^ million.    This is equivalent to a rate of average earnings (wagesand salaries per head) some  2. 60 per week higher than now.    the relationship between actual average earnings and basic settlements is notfixed and some allowance has to be made for &quot;drift1.    An across-the-board rise of  2. per week would be compatible with earnings on averagerising  2. 60 per week.3. A change in standard working hours or in the length of paidholidays as part of a pay settlement, or in place of a cash increase, hasimplications for labour costs.    To the extent that such arrangements implymore people are needed to produce a given output or more hours are paid at overtime rates the scope for increasing cash pay for a normal hour,consistent with a given rate of increase of costs and prices, is lessened.A cut of one hour in the standard week, with no change in pay, is equivalent, other things being equal, to a pay rise of about 2j per centor about 75p a week.3 2 PER WEEK FOR ALL EMPLOYED PERSONS
