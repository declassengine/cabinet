CABINETHOUSING FINANCE ACT 1972Memorandum by the Secretary of State for wales. On 1 August the Cabinet invited me (CM(72) 39th Conclusions,Minute 5) to report on:i. the arrangements being made by Welsh local authorities for the implementation of the Housing Finance Act 1972, and;ii. the steps which might be considered for dealing withany authorities who remained recalcitrant.2. Only five out of 168 Welsh local authorities still remainrecalcitrant.    A note on these is attached.DUTIES OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON 1 OCTOBER3. Welsh local authorites are required on 1 October to:i. bring into operation a rebate scheme conforming to theAct and make copies of the scheme available for public inspection (sections 18 and 24);ii. increase the rents of their dwellings as required bysection 63 or by amounts specified by me in directions undersection 62(4).PROPOSED ACTION ON 2 OCTOBER4. On 1 October the five authorities concerned will be seen to be indefault.    It is already publicly known that they intend to be so, and I amclear that action must then be taken.    I therefore propose on 2 october to give notice to all five that I am considering making a default order.    Iam required in doing so to give them one month to make any representations to me.1CP(72) 95 COPY NO      ? ^26 September 1972
SUBSEQUENT ACTION5. Within that month I propose to ascertain from the local authorities the extent of their default.    In each case I am fairly sure that none of therequirements in paragraph 3 above will have been satisfied, and I do not envisage any further inquiry then being necessary.    I would then propose,when the month is up, to make default orders.6. If a local authority refuses to comply with a Default Order the nextcourse would be to seek a mandamus or to appoint a Housing Commissioner.It is also open to me when I have made a Default Order to reduce, suspendor discontinue housing subsidies.    Further, there could be the possibilityof an Extraordinary Audit, with consequences of surcharge and disqualifica-tion.    My mind is not closed to such a possibility but in the light of myexperience with Merthyr over the school milk issue I am not sure that thiswould be a useful course in Wales.7. It is too soon yet to take a firm decision on what I should do after theDefault Order stage, but as I see it at the moment the likelihood is that i will wish to proceed by early appointment of Housing Commissioners.8. Our aim is, I take it, to secure compliance with the law, as quickly as possible and in a way which leaves the least scars in our relations with local authorities.    So far as Wales is concerned I doubt if a writ ofmandamus is the best way of securing these ends.    There are certainlysome who would welcome the opportunity of appearing in court and seekingmartyrdom through imprisonment for contempt.    We saw this in the school milk row with Merthyr Tydfil last year.    Both there and elsewhere therewill be people of the same mind this time.9. By contrast, the appointment of Housing Commissioners is likelyto be a less dramatic course.    It will, moreover, ensure that the benefits of the Act in the concrete form of rent rebates are enjoyed by the tenantsconcerned.    We can show that the Government by such action haveprotected the needy from the suffering caused by the unlawful acts of theirauthorities.    I have no reason to believe that officials of the councils wouldnot co-operate and I would expect there to be a fair chance that thedefiances will gradually fizzle out.10. No final decision need yet be taken on that particular point. Forthe moment I seek the agreement of colleagues to the action I propose totake after 1 October.    I will report the outcome of this in due course.P TWelsh Office26 September 19722
ANNEX TO CP(72)95HOUSING FINANCE ACT 1972DEFAULTING AUTHORITIES IN WALESBEDWAS AND MACHEN UDCThe Council resolved at an early stage not to implement theAct&apos; and confirmed their decision after the possible consequenceswere pointed out to them in a letter from the Welsh Office.    Thedecision was taken against the advice of officials who, actingindependently, formally notified my Department of their ownresolve to co-operate with a Housing Commissioner.CWMBRAN UDCThis authority resolved at an early stage, but only by eightvotes to five, not to implement the Act. Their officialsproduced a we11-documented case advising implementation, andhave made it clear they will co-operate with the Department.The Council1s resolution was confirmed, by ten votes to seven,when the possible consequences were pointed out to them in aletter from my Department.MERTHYR CBCThe Council took no formal decision till a fortnight ago, but when it was taken it was unanimous.   Drawing on their experience in their school milk &quot;revolt&apos;, they have formally instructedtheir officers to co-operate with a Housing Commissioner, andhave asked me to appoint one.VAYNOR AND PENDERYN RDCThis Council has not formally notified me of a resolution taken a fortnight ago not to implement the Act. They border on Merthyr,and the pressure is from that part of the Council1s area virtuallyin Merthyr, and which will join Merthyr on reorganisation.    Theirofficials are frightened at the Council&apos;s temerity in deciding notto implement the Act.-YSTRADGYNLAIS RDCThis Council sought a direction to apply a/rent increase of 65p,but the case they submitted did not justify this, and I gave-direction for 90p.When they received the direction the Council last week votednot to implement the Act, by a majority of four votes to two,with one abstention and four absentees.   This could well be reversed if my notice that I am considering a default orderinduces a better attendance.CONFIDENTIAL
