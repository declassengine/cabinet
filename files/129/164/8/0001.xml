CP(72) 83 COPY NO24 July 1972CABINETDEFAULT ON THE HOUSING FINANCE bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for wales. On 29 June the Cabinet agreed to review in a month&apos;s time thesituation which might arise if some local authorities failed to implement the Housing Finance Bill (CM(72) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5).2.        In accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decisions colleagues have emphasised -a. the Governments determination to proceed with the Bill;b. the help which the Bill gives to lower paid workers; andc. the fact that only about one council tenant in five will pay la week more in October 1972.In consultation with the other Ministers concerned we have made plans for a national press and television campaign starting in September topublicise the rebates and allowances which will become available to tenants for the first time.3. The situation is still uncertain but there are signs that ourpresentation of our policies is beginning to have the desired effect.When representatives of Labour Groups in local authorities met atTransport House on 8 July to discuss this issue, they did not resolve torefuse to implement the Bill but resolved instead to depute to the PrimeMinister to tell him that they believed that implementation would cause a break-down of local government.    The Prime Minister has refusedto receive such a deputation.    A number of Labour controlledauthorities have sought, or are showing signs of seeking, a directionunder clause 62(4) of the Bill which would allow them to increase rentsin October 1972 by an average of less than  la week, and a number ofthem have been told that such a direction will be given when the Bill isin force.    It seems clear that most of those authorities who are stilltoying with the idea of non-implementation will not finally make up their
mind until the Bill has received Royal Assent (probably 27 July) or evenuntil its main Parts come into force (10 August).    A few smallerauthorities may have committed themselves so far that a substantial measure of non-implementation on their part may be inevitable.4. On 29 June the Cabinet invited us to consult them before takingthe preliminary step leading to a default order which is laid down in theBill viz to send the authority a notice informing them that we are considering making a default order against them.    (The authority wouldhave one month to make representations before the default order itselfcould be made.)   We expect to be able to identify by the end of august the real would-be defaulters through our Departments&apos; informalcontacts with local authorities.    If there are any real would-bedefaulters, we would propose to bring our proposals for dealing withthem to colleagues early in September.5.        In our paper CP(72) 68 we said that, if a default order is made and the defaulting authority do not remedy the default we would inpractice have the following options:-I.      To appoint a Housing Commissioner to remedy thedefault.2.      To reduce, withhold or discontinue housing subsidies.3.      To direct that an extraordinary audit should be held with the object of enabling the district auditor to surchargemore quickly any councillor responsible for the default.We have now obtained a verbal opinion from Treasury Counsel on other possible remedies.    He considers that, once we had made a defaultorder and the authority did not remedy the default, we would have agood chance of obtaining an order of mandamus from the DivisionalCourt requiring the authority to remedy the default.    This would be an attractive fourth option, and might be worth going for before resorting to the appointment of a Housing Commissioner.     (He considers much less good our chances of obtaining an order of mandamus before we had made a default order and this had failed in its effect. )6.        We invite our colleagues to agree that -1.      We should continue to present our policies on the lines agreed by the Cabinet on 29 July.2.      We should report to the Cabinet early in September our conclusions on whether the preliminary steps leading to a default order should be taken to enable further consideration tobe given to the matter.P WP t department of the Environment24 July 1972 2
