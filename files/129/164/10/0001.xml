fRUNWAY SITES FOR THE THIRD LONDON airport memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment (RE) considered on 26 July the choice of sites for the runwaysat Maplin Airport, and the implications for the withdrawal of the Ministryof Defence Proof and Experimental Establishment from Shoeburyness.2. Details of four possible sites were published in April as a basis for consultation, beginning with the Roskill site (Site A) to the south and runningnorth-east to Site D, preferred by the Thames Estuary DevelopmentCompany (TEDCO).    Noise assessments showed that the airport shouldcause even less noise disturbance than forecast by the Roskill Commission,because of the introduction of quieter aircraft.    The noise impact(especially on North Kent) decreased, but the costs rose, the further tothe north-east that the runways were sited.3. Aviation interests and the Port of London Authority favour Site A,largely because it appeared to offer the earliest opening date.    The popularreaction, supported by most of the local authorities concerned and by agricultural interests, is understandably in favour of Site D.    But Site C,which is considerably cheaper than Site D, would be acceptable to Essexand Kent County Councils.    Site B has no takers.4,        RE agree that the choice is effectively between Site A and Site C.The Ministry of Defence prefer Site A because it is compatible with their withdrawal programme.    On cost grounds the arguments remain somewhatin favour of Site A:  reclamation costs for Site C would be some  5 million more than for Site A; but the best estimate at present available to us onthe capital costs of access suggests that there is little to choose between thetwo sites;  while the other resource and time costs which fall on those whouse the airport are less favourable to Site A than previously estimated.    on environmental grounds, the choice OjfJJite C against Site A would take 900houses outside the 35 Noise and Nuisance Index (N.N.I.) contour;  and nightnoise disturbance, for which no reliable measure exists, would also be lessat Site C,1CP(72) 85 COPY NO     u u1 August 1972CABINET
5. Two other important considerations have emerged.    The Secretaryof State for the Environment believes that the choice of Site A will forfeit theco-operation of Essex County Council, without which we shall be in serious difficulties, particularly over urbanisation and communications;  and their opposition, together with that of amenity interests, could lead throughobjections and resistance at public inquiries, and petitions against ourhybrid Bill, to protracted delay in completing the airport.    The constructionof Site C however imposes on the Ministry of Defence Proof and experimental Establishment an earlier withdrawal from Shoeburyness;difficulties have arisen in obtaining other sites for the Establishmentswork;  and the Secretary of State for Defence considers that if Site C ischosen it would be impossible, on present withdrawal plans, for the airportto be opened in 1980 without unacceptable disruption to the defence programme.6..        I am in no doubt that the Committee definitely favoured Site C on environmental grounds;  agreed that the cost might be higher, but not significantly so;  and that though in theory it might take longer than Site A,in practice it might be just as quick because it would have the goodwill ofthe local authorities and environmental interests.    The objection was on defence grounds.    On the other hand, once alternative sites for the work ofthe Proof and Experimental Establishment have been secured, itsreconstruction could (at a cost) be accelerated.    We cannot now be sure of completing the airport by 1Q80 at either site; but the choice of Site C is less likely to lead to unmanageable delay, and will not involve us in thedifficulty of justifying, after we decided to go to Maplin on environmentalgrounds, the choice of the least environmentally attractive site,7. We need a decision on the site now to enable detailed planning for thereclamation to proceed and to prepare the legislation, to be introducedearly next Session, setting up the Maplin Development Authority.    on balance, we consider that we should choose Site C; but in doing so we must recognise that the target date for opening the airport must depend on thetime within which the defence facilities can be withdrawn from Shoeburynesswithout unacceptable disruption.    RE has already put urgent work in hand for this purpose.recommendation, I invite my colleagues to agree the choice of Site C, as proposed inparagraph 7 above.R home Office31 July 19722
