DEFAULT ON THE HOUSING FINANCE ACT IN ENGLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. On 1 August the Cabinet invited me to report in September on whatEnglish local authorities were doing to implement the Housing finance act 1972 and on how to deal with any recalcitrant authorities(CM(72) 39th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. Nearly all English authorities are implementing the Act.    but many Labour-controlled authorities decided to do so only after some considerable hesitation and delay and will thus fail to meet the admittedlyvery tight timetable set by the Act.    I do not propose default action against them.3. There remain 2 groups (details are in the Annex): -i.       14 medium-sized or small Labour-controlled authoritiesare still firm in their refusal to implement the Act.ii.       About 5 authorities which are still standing out are likelysoon to decide to implement.Of the second group, Birmingham are likely to decide to implement on October and Camden will probably follow suit later in the month.    I donot propose to take default action against them unless unexpectedly theyprove obdurate.4.        We cannot however ignore the first group s defiance of the Actmuch beyond the beginning of October.    To do so would risk a serious loss of credibility among our supporters and opponents.    Some authorities might even reverse their decision to implement the Act.    4 options are open to the Secretary of State:-i.       To direct the district auditor to hold an extraordinaryaudit of the authority&apos;s housing accounts wherever such an auditseems likely to lead to a surcharge by the auditor of thecouncillors responsible for the loss caused by their authority&apos;sdefault (including the loss of income due to a failure to increase1CP(72) 94 COPY NO     6526 September 1972CABINET
rents).    A surcharge of over  500 automatically disqualifiesthe surcharged councillor from election or from being a memberof a local authority for 5 years (unless the disqualification is removed as a result of an appeal to the High Court).After the Secretary of State has directed that an extraordinaryaudit be held, the procedure and the outcome passes out of his control into the hands of the district auditor.    This has thepresentational merit that an independent official with statutoryduties, and not the Government, is seen to be acting against thedefaulting authority.ii.       If the authority have not responded to a default order, toobtain an order of mandamus from the Divisional Courtrequiring them to remedy the default.    Treasury Counsel hasadvised that the chances of obtaining such an order are good andthat, if the order were defied, we need not seek to enforce it byan order for contempt (which would lead ultimately to imprisonmentof the councillors responsible) but could instead resort to theappointment of a Housing Commissioner (see iv. below).iii. If the authority have not responded to a default order,to reduce,  withhold or discontinue housing subsidies and obligethe authority to meet the resultant shortfall from the rates.This would tend to saddle all the ratepayers with a burden causedby the intransigence of some of their councillors.iv. If the authority have not responded to a default order, toappoint a Housing Commissioner to remedy the default.    Thisis politically unattractive where the Council wish to saddle theGovernment with the full odium of increasing rents.    Moreoverunless the Commissioner is extremely good, and lucky, practicalunpleasantnesses are likely to arise which will reduce hiseffectiveness and prolong his appointment.5. The relative effectiveness of these 4 options will vary betweenauthorities.    We shall want to choose the option most likely to influence the individual councillors whose minds we need to change, in the light ofthe tactical advice which my Department will normally be able to obtain from the authority&apos;s officers.    The first option (extraordinary audit witha view to surcharge) may prove to be our most effective weapon.    Iconsider that we should mainly rely on it and only adopt one of the other three where there are special reasons for doing so.6.        I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that:-i.       For the time being I should take no default action againstthe authorities referred to in paragraph 3 ii. above.2
ii.       I should take no action against the group of authoritiesreferred to in paragraph 3 i. above until after Birminghamhave made their decision on 3 October.iii. From 5 October onwards I should send a notice to each authority in the group informing them that I am consideringmaking a default order against them under the Act.    Theauthority then have one month to make representations.    Duringthis period my Department would maintain informal contact withthe authority with a view to securing implementation and theauthority could respoad by tt resolution to implement the Act or at least by taking the preliminary steps towards such a resolution.If at the end of the period the authority still persisted in theirdefault, I would make the default order requiring them to takespecified steps within a specified period to remedy the default.During this period my Department would also maintain informalcontact with the authority.iv. Once I had sent to an authority a notice that I was consideringmaking a default order, and provided that their attitude and actionsseemed likely to bring about surcharge by the district auditor,I should direct that an extraordinary audit be held.v.       If an authority against whom I had made a default orderfailed to remedy the default, and if for any reason the procedureleading to surcharge was not proving effective, we should have toconsider whether to adopt the second, third or fourth optionsin paragraph 4 above.    At that point I would consult my colleagues.This issue would not come up for decision until about 25 Novemberat the earliest.P w department of the Environment26 September 1972
AUTHORITIES WHO ARE STILL FIRM IN THEIR REFUSAL TO implement the ACTBarrow CB:     The Council have previously resolved not to implement the Bill and will almost certainly resolve on 3 October not to implement the Act.Canterbury CB:     The Housing Committee on 19 September decidedonly to introduce rebates, folloxfing the Council&apos;s previous decision not to implement the Act in full.   At the next council meeting on I4. October the Council are unlikely to decide to increaserents.Carlisle CB;     The Council are likely on 26 September to acceptthe Housing Committee&apos;s recommendation not to implement the Act.(However the Labour majority is only 22-18).Doncaster CB:    The Council will not reopen the question ofimplementation at the next meeting.     At the previous meeting theyresolved not to implement the Act.Salford CB:    The Council have^resolved not to implement the Actand to invite the Secretary of State to declare them in defaultand appoint a Housing Commissioner.     The Labour majority aretaking a very hard line.South Shields CB:    The Management Board meeting on 27 Septemberis unlikely to recommend a reversal of the Council&apos;s decision notto implement the Act.Walsall CB:    The Council on 18 September confirmed their earlierresolution not to implement the Act.Eccles B:    The Council on 18 September confirmed their resolutionnot to implement the Act.     A different decision might, hoxtfever,emerge from the next meeting.Bedworth UP?    recently resolved not to implement the Act.However a special Council meeting may be called and this may leadto a reversal of this decision.Clay Cross UP have resolved unanimously not to implement the Actand have instructed their officers not to act uon behalf of theConservative Government as a Housing Commissioner&quot;.10
Conisborough UP will probably not alter their decision not to implement the Act, although there may be second thoughts.Garforth UP:    The Council are unlikely at the meeting on27 September to alter their decision not to implement the Act.Halstead UP:   The Council are unlikely at the next meeting to alter the 7-6 decision not to implement the Act.Skelmersdale and Holland UP;    The Council are unlikely to reopenat the next meeting on 26 September the decision not to implement the Act.AUTHORITIES WHERE THE ISSUE IS IN EFFECT STILL OPEN AND WHERE ANEARLY DECISION TO IMPLEMENT SEEMS LIKELYBirmingham CB:    The Council will resume their consideration ofthe question of implementation on 3 October.     Informal indications are that a majority of councillors will vote in favour ofimplementation.Camden LB:   Two minor and justifiable concessions in relation tothe rent rebate scheme and the amount of the October 1972 rent increase are likely to create a majority in favour of reversingthe previous decision not to implement the Act.Mansfield B:   A decision to implement the Act has been deferredseveral times but there are informal indications that it will soon be taken.Slough B:   The Council is expected to accept a recommendation ofthe appropriate Committee to reverse the previous decision notto implement the Act.Note:   There may.be a few small authorities where a formaldecision to implement the Act has not yet been taken, but it isthought that such decisions are unlikely to be long delayed.i1
