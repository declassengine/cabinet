DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72)79 COPY NO    6512 July 1972CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE REORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for social services.        In May 1971 I issued a Consultative Document on National health service (NHS) Reorganisation in England.    This followed discussion inthe Social Services Cornrnittee and the Cabinet (CM(71) 19th and 24thConclusions).2.        In the light of comments on and discussions about the consultative Document, I am now ready for -a. publication of a White Paper announcing the Government&apos;decisions on NHS Reorganisation; and b. the preparation of the necessary legislation.WHITE papers.        A draft is attached for approval.    In general, it reaffirms theadministrative pattern described in the Consultative Document.    A fewpoints on the draft White Paper which the Cabinet will wish to have drawn to its attention are set out in the Annex to this memorandum.LEGISLATION4. The reorganisation of the NHS must take effect at the same time asthat of local government, i. e 1 April 1974.    To give time for preparatory work that cannot be started until the Act is on the statute book, it must be our aim to secure Royal Assent by Easter 1973.    This in turn means thatthe Bill should be introduced at the start of the 1972-73 Session.    Theintention is to introduce it in the Lords.    The main Instructions are with parliamentary Counsel.1
FINANCIAL AND MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS5. One of the chief aims of the administrative reorganisation is tosecure better value for money.    In the long term, therefore, it will not,of itself, give rise to additional cost.    In the short term, extraadministrative costs (attributable to retraining programmes and othertemporary factors) totalling about  13 million will be incurred over thefour years 1972-73 to 1975-76.    This expenditure has already beenprovided for in the White Paper &quot;Public Expenditure to 1975-76&quot;(Cmnd 4829).6. The reorganisation will similarly help to secure a better use of manpower,   and is not expected, of itself, to increase staff numbers,except to the very small extent needed to cope with the extraadministrative work that has to be done during the transitional period.HOME AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE7. The draft White Paper has been considered by the Home and social Affairs Committee, who agreed that it should be published.    the text now circulated is that approved by the Committee, except that somedrafting amendments have been made to Section XIII (&quot;Medical and DentalTeaching&quot;) to meet suggestions made by the Lord Chancellor.    these amendments are designed to improve the presentation of the proposals relating to teaching hospitals but do not affect their substance.DA TE OF PUB LICA TI ON8. The Committee asked me to consult the Lord President of theCouncil and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales about the timing of publication.    In the light of these consultations I propose thatwe should aim for publication on Tuesday 1 August, subject to finalconfirmation with the Lord President of the Council nearer the time.conclusion.        I now seek the Cabinet1 s agreement to publication of the white paper.K department of Health and Social Security12 July 19722
AnnexManagement Structure (Section XIV and Appendix III)1.     The management structure at regional, area,  and districtlevels and in the individual institutions, cannot be settleduntil a detailed study, which is being undertaken with the help of management consultants, has been completed and therehave been consultations with interested organisations on itsoutcome.   The study should be completed at the end of thismonth and the consultations will take place in the autumn.An outline of some ideas developed in the study is includedin Appendix III.Local Authority Representation on Area Health Authorities(paragraph 98)2.     An Area Health Authority will normally have a membership of about 15.   The Consultative Document proposed that &quot;some&quot;of its members should be appointed by the corresponding localauthority (ie the non-metropolitan county council, or,  inthe conurbations,  the metropolitan district or London borough council).   The primary purpose of such membership is not that the area health authorities may be aware of the viewsof the public - this will be achieved through therepresentatives of the district councils and voluntary organisations who will sit on the community health councils -but that the area health authority should include some members active in and knowledgeable about the management ofclosely related local government services.3.     The draft White Paper proposes that the number of localauthority members on each AHA should be four.   This willprovide room for members with knowledge of the personal social services, education and other relevant services and of thelocal authority^ general policies.   Local government interestsmay say that four is not enough.   But an increase in this number would overweight the local authority&apos;s influence on the3
area health authority&apos;3 financial and other decisions;    itwould destroy a proper balance in the area health authority&apos;scomposition (unless the total number of members were increasedto an undesirable extent);    and it would also be strongly resisted by many working in, and associated with, the NHS whoare hostile to local authority party politics exercising too great an influence over its operation and development.Payment of Chairmen   (paragraph 91)h.     It is proposed to take power to remunerate the chairmen ofthe regional and area health authorities - and only the chairmen,not the other members.   Payment - on a part-time basis - isthought to be justified for the chairmen (and for them alone),because their responsibilities will be heavy and they may haveto forego other work;   they will all be chosen and appointed bythe Secretary of State, whereas this will not be so in the caseof members of the area health authorities other than the chairmen.Teaching Hospitals   (Section XIII)5.     Special arrangements are proposed for the incorporation ofthe teaching hospitals in the integrated regional and areamanagement structure.   These vary in detail from those set outin the Consultative Document and are the result of longnegotiations, which are continuing, with the Teaching HospitalsAssociation.School health   (paragraphs 3t 20-21)6. The Consultative Document left open the future arrangementsfor the school health service. These have been considered by asub-committee of the Working Party on Collaboration between theNational Health Service and Local Government. The Secretary ofState for Education and Science and I are agreed, in the lightof this committee&apos;s work, that the future development of health services for schoolchildren and their co-ordination with other
branches of the NHS can best be achieved by responsibility forthe school medical and dental service being with the NHS but with the education service retaining its responsibilities forthe special education of handicapped children.attached draft of White Paper

CONFIDENTIALforeword by the Secretary of State for Social services for two years I have been responsible for the National Health Service -and for the personal social services.Throughout this time my respect for the achievements of the national health Service has steadily grown. Whatever its defects we would beutterly wron?r to take for granted the massive performance of thisremarkable network of services and the ease of mind that it has broughtto all the people of this country.   I am sure that they feel a deep sense of gratitude to all those involved: to the members of the governingauthorities; to the men and women who make their career in the Servicewhether in direct contact with patients or in supporting services; and tothe voluntary workers.But at the same time I have come to recognise, as many others have, thatwhile this good work will continue, nothing like its full potential canbe realised without changes in the administrative organisation of theService.Hence this White Paper.   It is about administration, not about treatment and care.   I make no apology for that.   Administration is not of coursean   end in itself.   But both the patients and those who provide treatment and care will gain if the administration embodies a clear duty to improve the Service and the facilities for doing so.ILet me illustrate this.   Everyone is aware of gaps in our health services.Even for acute illness, where we provide at lea^t as good a service for our whole population as any country in the world, there are some respects inwhich we achieve less than we could.   On the non-acute side the services for the elderly, for the disabled, and for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped have failed to attract the attention and indeed the resources which thoy need - and all the more credit to the staff who have toiled sotirelessly for their patients despite the difficulties.
It is well unaerstood now, moreover, that the domiciliary and community services are under-developed - that there is a need for far more homehelps, home nurses, hostels and day centres and other services that supportpeople outside hospital.   Often what there is could achieve more if it was better co-ordinated with other services in and out of hospital.   It iswell understood too that there must be more emphasis on prevention - or at the least on early detection and treatment.For the imbalances and the gaps Governments must take their share of theresponsibility.   Resources were and still are stretched .   The acuteservices had a legitimate priority.   But the shortcomings were not rational.They did not result from a calculation as to the best way to deployscarce resources.   They just happened.Why did they just happen?   Because it has never been the responsibility- nor has it been within the power - of any single named authority toprovide for the population of a given area of a comprehensible size the bestthehealth service that/money and skills available can provide.   There has been no identified authority whose task it has been, in co-operation with those responsible for complementary services, to balance needs and prioritiesrationally and to plan and provide the right combination of services.It is to enable just such an authority to operate in each area, with thebest professional advice, that the Government proposes to reorganise theadministration of the National Health Service as explained in this white paper.The National health Service is one of the largest civilian organisationsin the world.   Its staff is growing rapidly.   It contains an ever-growingmultitude of stills that depend on and interact with each other.   Itserves an ever-growing range of health needs with ever more complex treatmentsand techniques.   And though the Government has made substantial additions2
to un expenditure programme which was already planned to grow at an above-average rate, there is never enough money - and never likely to be - foreverything that ideally requires to be done.   Nor. despite the greatincreases since 1948, are there ever enough skilled men and women.Real needs must therefore be identified, and decisions must be taken andperiodically reviewed, as. to the order of priorities among them.   Plansmust be worked out to meet these needs and management and drive must becontinually applied to put the plans into action, assess their effectivenessand modify them as needs change or as ways are found to make the plans more effective.Effective for what?   These are not plans for individual care but for thesupport of the professions that provide the whole range of services to thepublic.   They must therefore be effective in providing what patients need:primarily, treatment and care in hospital; support at home; diagnosis and treatment in surgery, health centre or out-patient clinic; or day care.The health services depend crucially on the humane planning and provisionof the personal social services, and therefore on effective and under-standing collaboration with local government.   No doubt arguments willcontinue about the theoretical advantages of making both health ana social services the responsibility of a single agency.   But the formidable practicaldifficulties, which have been fully argued elsewhere, rule this out as a realistic solution, and require us to concentrate instead on ensuring thatthe two parallel authorities - one local, one health - with their separatestatutory responsibilities shall work together in partnership for the health and social care of the population.   This White Paper demonstrates theGovernment&apos;s concern to see that arrangements are evolved under which amore coherent and smoothly interlocking range of services will developfor all the needs of the population.3
4The doctor and other professional workers will gain too.   The organisationalchun :et; will not affect the professional relationship between individualpatients and individual professional workers on which the complex of health services is so largely built.   The professional workers will retain their clinical freedom - governed as it is by the bounds of professionalknowledge and ethics and by the resources that are available - to do asthey think best for their patients.   This freedom is cherished by the professions and accepted by the Government.   It is a safeguard for patientstoday and an insurance for future improvements.But the organisational changes will also bring positive gains to the professional worker.   He - or she - will have the   opportunity of organising his or her own work better and of playing a much greater partthan hitherto in the management decisions that are taken in each area.At the same time the more systematic and comprehensive analysis of needs and priorities that will lie behind the planning and operations of each area will help professional workers to ensure that their skills bring thegreatest possible benefit to their patients.Vheue arc Lhe reasons for issuing a White Paper, and for promotinglegislation, about the administration of the National Health Service.Administrative reorganisation within a unified health service that isclosely linked with parallel local government services will provide a surefoundation for improving the service to the public.
The reorganised Service:the main features
I   UMFI&amp;WPENTIAL1.    The National Health Service should be a. single service.Its separate parts are intended to complement one another, and not to function as self-sufficient entities.   In practice, however, the fragmentedadministration we now have throws barriers in the way of efforts toorganise a proper balance of services - hospital and community - throughoutthe country.   The administrative unification of these services will makea firmer reality of the concept of a single service.2.   Unification of NHS administration forms part of the Government*swider programme of administrative reform.    In the autumn of 1970, theCentral Government machine was reorganised.   The emphasis was on groupingof functions in departments with a wide span, so as to facilitateunified policies over inter-related areas.3.     The Government also announced in the autumn of 1970 its decisionto unify the NHS - already proposed by the previous Government. Thisunfication will draw together the administration of the family practitionerservices, the community health services, and the hospitals.   Unificationwill also bring the administration of the school health service within the NHS.4.     Far-reaching changes are also proposed in local government, underthe Local Government Bill now before Parliament.   These will create newareas ishich, without losing their local character, will be large enough toenable authorities to plan and provide good quality services with thenecessary numbers of trained and specialised staffs.5.    The personal social services have already been brought together under the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 - passedunder the previous Government with full support from the then Opposition.Under this Act, the personal social services which were previously divided betweenthe children&apos;s, welfare and health committees of the local authoritieshave been gathered together under a single committee.   This arrangement will continue when the Local Government Bill comes into operation.6
This local unification of the personal social services has beenmatched centrally by concentrating responsibility, previously sharedwith the Home Office, in the DHSS, which is also responsible for administering cash benefits, including those paid to the sick and disabled.7, All this has not been done just to get administrative tidiness.Unification offers solid advantages to the individual and the family,because their needs for health and social services are not divided into (separate compartments.   A single family, or an individual, may in a shortspace of time, or even at one and the same time, need many types of health and social care, and these needs should be met in a co-ordinated way.Otherwise they will get an unsatisfactory service or even no service at all.8. There are very strong arguments for bringing health and social services under a single administration.   This could be accomplished by putting the NHSwithin local government.   But, for reasons accepted and fully explained by both the previous and the present Government, that is not attainable,at least in the foreseeable future.   What therefore needs to be done isto make sure that the two parallel structures - the health service andthe local authorities - work together as a joint enterprise in both the planning and the operation of services of common concern.   More is said about this later.9. Narrowing our view now to the NHS, the Government &apos;s plans for unification-tion of its administration offer the prospect of real benefits, not only tothe individual and the family, but to the public in general.  They providefor a single administering body locally, which will draw its funds fromone source, and will take a wide, unbiased and constructive view of the priorities across the whole range of needs served by the general practitioner and other community health services and
by the hospitals.   This is the hub of the GSovernment^s proposals forNHS unification.   &quot;Unbiased&quot; is important.   There will be no questionof the community health services swallowing up the hospitals, or, amore common suspicion, vice versa   &quot;Constructive&quot; is also importantbecause the aim will be to keep the needs of the local people constantlyunder review, and to improve and adjust services in order to providethe best practicable health facilities for all.10. The NHS administering authorities will be entirely new bodiescovering the whole field of health care, domiciliary and institutional.Their membership and administrative structure will be such that they arehot dominated by people whose main interests lie in one or other service.They will have capable members, and will appoint skilled and appropriatelytrained staff.   They will be armed with the most expert advice.   They willhave effective channels for the expression of local public opinion.These points are developed in later Sections of this White Paper.11* These features will enable the authorities, within the generalframework of national policy, to provide a sensitive, constantly improvingservice in their areas, giving proper attention to care as well as cure,and a much needed impetus to be given to the prevention of illness andthe promotion of health.8
II   THE CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENT12.       The previous Government had given much thought tounification, and had issued two Green Papers for public discussion.The present Government was not however satisfied that the proposals in the,Green Papers would create the administrative structureneeded for a fully effective NHS in England.   A consultative document was therefore issued in May 1971.13.        This provided for a clear definition and allocation of responsibilities, with maximum delegation downwards, matched byaccountability upwards.   There would be regional authorities betweenthe Central Department and the area authorities.   The aim would be toset objectives and standards and to measure performance against them.A sound management structure would be created at all levels.   authorities would be kept small and ability, drive and judgment would be the maincriteria for the selection of members.   The views of the public wouldbe voiced, not by way of membership of the health authorities but more directly, through representative community health councils in eachlocality, to advise the area authority and keep it in ^lose touch with local opinion.14.        The consultative document also promised the early setting upof two special studies.   The first was an expert study of the detailedmanagement arrangements, at both member and officer level, in the regions,at the area headquarters, in the districts within the areas and in theindividual hospitals and other institutions.   The second study was of thearrangements needed to secure close collaboration between the area health authorities and the local authorities; a working party, representative ofthe interests concerned, was to undertake this study.  Both studieswere started in the summer of 1971.CONFIDENTIALQ
r15.        There were also to be consultations with the organisations concerned about the shaping of the general arrangements to meet thespecial conditions in Greater London.   These consultations, too, began in the summer of 1971*16.        Comments on the consultative document were received fromnearly 600 organisations and individuals, and discussions were held with a number of the principal bodies concerned.   In the lightof these, the Government has reached firm decisions on the future administration of the NHS.   These decisions are set out in laterSections of this Paper.   Legislation is being prepared and will beintroduced in time for the reorganised NHS to come into operation onthe same date as the reorganisation of local government ie 1 April 1974.
III   SERVICES WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE NHSNational Health Service17*       The services that will be brought together under unified NHSadministration are these:the hospital and specialist services now administered bythe Regional Hospital Boards, Hospital Management Committeesand Boards of Governors;the family practitioner services now administered by theExecutive Councils;the personal health services now administered by the localauthorities through their health committees; (see the next paragraph)and the school health service.18.        The personal health services are those which now standreferred to the local authority&apos;s health committee under the NHS Acts andthe Local Authority Social Services Act, 1970.   They includeambulance services;epidemiological work, including general surveillance ofthe health of the community;family planning;health centres;health visiting;home nursing and midwifery;maternity and child health care;medical, nursing and supplementary arrangements for the preventionof illness, care and after care;   andvaccination and immunisation.
19.        The registration of nursing hoses will also become the responsibilityof the NHS.School Health20.        Those providing health services for schoolchildren will need to work closely with the hospital service and personal health services for families and children and with the education service.Local education authorities&apos; present responsibilities for school medical and dental services will be transferred to the NHS.   Local education authorities will remain responsible for the ascertainment and education of children whothrough handicap or disability need special education.   The NHS will make available to local education authorities the advice and the medical, dental,nursing and allied resources which they need to discharge these functions,and will give them similar help in such fields as health education and school hygiene.   There will be arrangements for joint planning andco-ordination of the two services.21 *        With the fusion of the organisation and management of all thepresent dental services within the new health authorities, hospital dentists,general dental practitioners and dentists providing services for schoolchildren,children below school age, and expectant and nursing mothers will be able towork together more closely.Child guidance22. The child guidance service is made up of three distinct elements.They are child psychiatry (which may in future increasingly be based ingeneral hospitals); social work (which will have/its main&apos;base in localauthority social servicesdepartments); and educational psychology, whichfalls to local education authorities.   The present pattern of organisation,with work centred in many areas in a clinic in local education authoritypremises, is likely   on present trends to give way gradually to looser and more flexible arrangements.   What is essential is that the three services shouldcontinue to work in close partnership to meet the needs of children with
emotional, learning or behavioural problems.   Partnership is needed in ensuringco-ordination of the observation, assessment and treatment activities of the health authorities, the education service and the local authority social services for ohildren in care.Health education23*        As part of their responsibility for the prevention of illness, the health authorities will have comprehensive health education powers. but because they are responsible for environmental health services such asfood safety and hygiene, local authorities will have complementary powers;local education authorities will retain their responsibility for healtheducation within the school curriculum.   The Health EduoationCounoil will continue to work with the various bodies concerned with healtheducation, and to provide a national focus and centre of activity.Personal social services24. The personal social services will continue to be provided by thelocal authorities - the counties (other than the metropolitan counties),the metropolitan districts and the London Boroughs - through their social services committees.   The future of hospital social work is underreview.Environmental health25*        Environmental health   will also continue to be a function of local government.   This term includes measures for preventing the spread of communicable disease (other than routine immunisation, some epidemiologicalinvestigation and treatment);   powers relating to food safety and hygiene,port health, and the diseases of animals in so far as they affect humanhealth; the public health aspects of environmental services; and the enforcement of requirements about environmental conditions at work places.   Theseenvironmental hygiene responsibilities will be vested in &quot;the district localauthorities.   The local authorities will be encouraged to seek the advice, and indeed the services, of medical staff employed by the health authorities,though statutory responsibility will rest on the local authorities, not the health authorities.
Occupational health26. The health authorities will be concerned with preventivehealth measures of many kinds and will provide treatment and care for people who suffer injury or ill health however caused.   However,responsibility for the health of persons in relation to their employmentlies with the Department of Employment.   In matters affecting the health and safety of employed persons there must always be close workingbetween those responsible for health and the environment both inside and outside the workplace.   It is intended that there should be very close co-operation between the NHS and the Employment Medical advisory service in relation to both policy formulation and day to day operations.In addition arrangements are being made for EMAS to use NHS laboratoriesand other investigatory facilities.
IV   NHS AUTHORITIES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS27.        A national service calls for a national strategy, with nationalobjectives, standards and priorities.    It is, however, equally important to encourage variety and flexibility in working out the strategy overthe country,    tfithin the national framework, therefore, administration will be delegated to local bodies, who will set out their own objectives and be responsible for achieving them.Regional and area levels of management28.        The Government has decided that effective organisation of the health services in England requires two levels - regional and area - in addition to thecentral department.   At each of these levels there will be a unified administra-tion covering the whole span of the NHS.   The old administrative divisions betweencommunity and hospital services will completely disappear.   Since each area health authority will serve the same population within the sameboundaries as its matching local authority, the purpose will be thatformal divisions between the health, the education and the personal social services will be bridged by the arrangements for collaboration.There will in effect be parellel organisations with links between them.29*       There is a difference between the local authority and itsmatching health authority.   Where statutory responsibility for theadministration of a local service is placed on independent localauthorities, the Ministers responsibilities being correspondinglylimited, it is right that the local authorities should deal directly with the central Department.   The personal social services,where the Department of Health and Social
Security has central responsibility, are an example of this.30. But the MS is in a different position.   Parliament has placedfull statutory responsibility for the service on the Secretary of Stateand holds him accountable for the money spent on it - nearly all ofwhich comes from central sources.   Moreover, a great deal of planning and allocation of resources must take place on a wider-than-area basis:for example, the services linked with University medical schools andthose based on regional centres.31. This means that the Secretary of State must satisfy himself that the service in England is being efficiently run.   In Scotland and in Wales,with their relatively small populations, it will be practicable to do this by means of area health authorities in direct relationship withthe oentral Departments in Edinburgh and Cardiff.   Health services inthose two countries could therefore be operated without interposing a regional organisation between the central Health Departments and the areas.Bvt in England, a central Department operating from London could not hope to exercise effective and prompt general supervision over area authoritieswhose numbers will be six times those of their counterparts in Scotlandand eleven times those in Wales.Regional administrative tier32. In theory, the regional organisation necessary in England could take theform of regional offices of the central Department.   In practice, theywould be much less effective than separate regional authorities.33. To place the whole job on the central Department and its regional offices would result in over-centralisation and delay; it would draw theDepartment into many matters that should be resolved locally or regionally;
and it would distract the Department&apos;s attention from the policy tasks which must be done centrally and which, are its proper concern.34.        There is also a positive case for separate regional authoritiesrather than regional offices of the central Department.   Each regionalauthority will be a body of local people knowledgeable about their region&apos;sneeds.   They will have close relationships with the university, which lias a keypart to play in the region&apos;s work through its teaching and research activities,and will be able to develop a continuing and constructive dialogue withtheir Areas .35* These are the main reasons why the Government has decided infavour of a regional administrative tier for the NHS.The job to be done: nationally, regionally, locally36* Under these arrangements, there will be central strategicplanning and monitoring by DHSSj regional planning and general supervision of operations (as well as some direct executive functions) by regional authorities; and area planning and operational control by area authoritiesco-ordinated with local authorities sharing common boundaries.37* This means that the planning function in the NHS will be exercisedat three levels, area, region and central department.   Each has its owndistinctive role.   The central department will settle national healthpolicies, objectives and priorities.   The RHA will have a regional planningresponsibility which will include settling priorities when there are competing claims between areas.   But the fundamental unit in the planning processwill be the area.   Area health authority plans for the communitieswithin the area - the &quot;districts&quot; - will strongly influence the way inwhich local, regional and national priorities are carried into effect inthe area, and how they are harmonised with local authority plans.
Management study38. As mentioned in paragraph 14, the consultative document saidthat the Secretary of State would have a study made of the detailed arrangements for management at regional, area and district level and inthe individual hospitals and other institutions.   The study is beingsupervised by a Steering Committee which includes members from thethree branches of the present NHS and from the Department, whosePermanent Secretary is its chairman.   Detailed work and discussions with existing health service authorities are being undertaken by a study group acting on the Steering Committee&apos;s behalf.   These are the steering committee&apos;s terms of referencet&quot;On the basis of the Governments consultative dooument on NHSreorganisation, and taking account of other relevant studies commissionedby the Secretary of State, to make recommendations on management systemsfor the services for which regional and area health authorities will beresponsible and on the internal organisation of those authorities.M391 The method followed in the study has been to produce a range of hypothetical models of organisation at the various levels and to test them in discussion with a cross-section of health authorities throughout England.40.        After the Secretary of State has received recommendations fromthe management study, he will consult the interests concerned.   decisions will not be taken on the recommendations until the views of those interests have been considered.   Some of the ideas being developed in the managementstudy are however described in the document at Appendix III to this white paper.   These ideas are provisional and subject to change in the lightof further work in the management study.
V    AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIES - FUNCTIONS41* The last Section sketched the basic functions of the threelevels of authority in the reorganised NHS: the areas, the regionsand the central Department.   In this and in the next four  Sections,the work of the authorities and the relationships between them willbe looked at in more detail.Area planning42. The area health authority will be responsible for achievingnational health care objectives through the provision of comprehensivehealth services designed to meet the needs of the communities within its districts.   It will be responsible for planning and developingservices in consultation with its matching local authority and withthe regional health authority.   It will regularly and systematicallyappraise the quality of existing services in the districts and assessunmet needs, comparing the situation with national standards of care and identifying opportunities for improvement.   This approach will encourage comparisons between alternative methods of care, in thehome and in the hospital.,   It will also make it possiblefor the area authority, with guidance from the region, to gear its plans insuch a way that, in time, its services match national standards of care.43* The planning process will mean that the area must work very closely with the local authorities so that improvement programmesrequiring action by both sets of authorities can be approved andimplemented effectively.   More is said about this in the next Section.The process will also of course involve continuing discussion with the regional health authority which will use approved area plans as its
basis for assessing the area authority&apos;s performance,,Area operation of services44*      The area health authority will be an operator of services as well asa planner.   As such, it will be the employer of the staff who work at areaheadquarters and in the districts.   For a period, however, medical and dentalconsultants and senior registrars, except those working in &quot;teaching areas&quot;/,will continue to be appointed and employed at regional level, in order to consolidate recent improvements in the machinery for manpower planning anddistribution.   These arrangements will be reviewed after five years.   Theauthority will also be responsible for the quality of the &quot;hotel&quot; services- catering, domestic work and so on - and other supporting services whichback up the health professions and in so doing, influence patient care.The &quot;distriots&quot;45. The day to day running of services will be based on localities(&quot;districts&quot;) within which it is possible to satisfy the greater part ofthe public&apos;s health care needs.   As such, the district will form thenatural community for the planning and delivery of comprehensive healthcare.   It will be small enough for professional representative machinery tobe effective within it, it will contain a district general hospital - orseveral hospitals together carrying out the functions of such a hospital -and will usually have a population of between 200,000 and 500,000.   Becausethe boundaries of the health district will be related to health care needs,they will not necessarily correspond with the boundaries of a local govern-ment district, for which different criteria are appropriate.   Many AHAswill be responsible for only one or two districtsj a few will have up to five.*46. The districts will not in any sense form a separate formal tierof authority below the areas.   Within them, however, it will be possiblefor the services of doctors, nurses and others to be organised soas to answer community needs most effectively, and to fulfil the area authority&apos;s obligation to ensure unification of health services.   Theorganisation in a district will be designed to achieve integration of/ See paragraph 114* See footnote to paragraph 53        2QCONFIDENTIAL
all health servioes available within it, ao that the representativesof Llw modioal profoooion and the profeseional heads of services in thedistrict can jointly make the important district decisions and in that way be responsible, not merely for running district services but forhelping to shape them.47*      The document at Appendix III outlines the management study1 sprovisional views on arrangements for district management.Boundaries and patients48.      &quot;Regions&quot;, &quot;areas&quot; and &quot;districts&quot; should not and will not bebarriers to the use of health services.   The user will be able, as now,to cross boundaries without hindrance or formality, to get the servicesbest suited to his needs, his convenience and, as far as practicable,his choice.49*      Where the natural community for health care substantially overlapsthe new area boundaries, special administrative arrangements will berequired.   These are being worked out as part of the management study.General guidance will be issued and in areas of particular difficultythere will be local discussions.Collaboration between areas50.      There will be many instances in which one AHA will provide services for another and ABAs generally will collaborate with each other in mattersof common interest.   There will for example be a need for collaboration between adjacent ambulance services in such matters as emergency cover(including cover for serious accidents), the best&apos;use of ambulance stationssituated near area boundaries, and training.    There may well also bescope for joint action between neighbouring authorities in the ordering,storage and distribution of supplies.   In addition, some area health authorities may need to arrange for certain
services to be provided from neighbouring areas.   In some instances,the area authorities concerned will be situated in different regions,which will mean collaboration across regional boundaries.Joint health authorities51.      Some functions may best be performed by a joint health authority (JHA)covering more than a single area.   Such a body would, in its own sphere,have the powers (eg to employ staff and enter into contracts) held by AHAsin their wider spheres.   The new authority that will price prescriptionsfor the whole of England will be a JHA responsible directly to the Secretaryof State.Medical and dental teaching52.      The administrative arrangements in areas in which facilities insupport of medical and dental teaching are provided, are discussed inSection XIII.
CONFIDENTIALVI     AREA 1IRALTH AUTHORITIES -COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTCommon boundaries for NHS and local government53.      The AHA will be the operational NHS authority, responsible forassessing needs in its area and for planning, organising and administeringarea health services to meet them.   But it cannot hope to do these thingssuccessfully on its own.   It is crucially important for the citizen requiringhelp of both the health and social services that collaboration between thetwo should be firmly established.   This points to the need for identitybetween the health area and the area of the local authority responsible forthe personal social services.   In almost all cases this identity will be complete. The only exceptions will be in London where the 53 Boroughs(including the City) will be grouped to form a smaller number of health areas.This means that, subject to the outcome of the Local Government Bill, therewill be 72 AHAs autside London (38 corresponding with non-metropolitancounties, and 34 with metropolitan districts).   A list and map are givenin Appendix I, /Need for other links54*      Identity of area for health and personal social services will be valuable, but close links are also needed between the health authority and the local authorities responsible for education,/   It will be for the area health authorities to examine in detail thenumber of districts needed in each area.   Preliminary study suggestshowever that, outside London, 27 areas might contain one districtonly; and that there might, be 21 areas of 2 districts, 11 areas of 3districts, 8 areas of 4 districts and 4 areas of 5 districts, making an approximate total of 154 districts.23dT% Kl El      KITIA I
environmental health, housing and other services where interests overlap. Theposition here is complicated by the fact that theBe local government services will not all be administered by the same authorities: personal social services by the non-metropolitan counties, the metropolitan districts and the London boroughs; education by these authorities except in central London where the ILEA is responsible; environmental health and housing by the non-metropolitan districts, the metropolitandistricts and the London boroughs.55. In any case,  collaboration cannot be left to depend merelyon common    boundaries.   Services of mutual concern have to be identified,and arrangements made between the authorities to plan, develop and operatethem so that they satisfy mutual needs.    In the circumstances of a radical reorganisation in both the NHS and local government, this mustmean a full study in advance of the scope for collaboration and of the ways in which links between them can be devised.Working Party on Collaboration between NHS and local government56. The links are already being studied by the working partyproposed in the consultative document, to which reference has beenmade in paragraph 14.    This working party has been set up jointly bythe main local authority associations and the appropriate central departments, and is broadly representative of local government, the nhs and central government.57 A wide range of matters, both general and detailed, are being studied by the working party, which will continue in being during andafter the passage of the NHS Bill to advise on the guidance aboutcollaboration to be given to the health and local authorities in readiness for the reorganisation of the NHS and local government on the 1st April 1974.But a number of important recommendations have already been made by theworking party and,   subject to the outcome of consultations24
with interested organisations, it is likely that the arrangements will cover the matters set out in the following paragraphs.Working Party&apos;s recommendations58.       Collaboration must include planning and investment on theone hand and day to day operations on the other.59*       On planning and investment, the requirements of an area need to be jointly identified and, in the light of the resources available,the best ways of fulfilling them agreed between the health and localauthorities concerned.60.      On day to day operations, the arrangements for collaboration mustcover the general sharing of goods and facilities, such as the use of premises; the bulk purchase of supplies; building and associated maintenanceservices; &quot;hotel&quot; services like catering, domestic work and laundries;and management services such as computers, 0 and M and work study, and information services.   The arrangements must also extend to the provisionby one authority to the other, of the advice and services of professionalstaff.   For example, social services staff will need to be made available by the local authority to the health authority.     Equally, localauthorities must continue to have professional advice - from doctors,dentists and nurses - in order to carry out their statutory functions in the personal social services, education, environmental health and housing.   They should look to the health authorities for such help.
61.        There must be means of making sure that the arrangements for working together are firmly established and comprehensive and thatthey involve members and senior staff of the authorities concerned.There will therefore be local joint consultative committees ofmembers of the authorities to examine jointly the plans of theauthorities and to advise on the planning and operation of services in spheres of common concern.   One such joint consultative committee might be established in a metropolitan district to cover all theservices of common concern; but in a non-metropolitan county two committees would be needed - one covering personal social servicesand school health, and representing on the local authority side thecounty council; and another for environmental health and housing,which would include representatives of all the local authoritydistrict councils.   Special arrangements would be needed in some areas, eg London.   Each joint consultative committee would be supported by a group of senior officers from the authorities concerned.62. The joint consultative committee would make its views knownto the constituent health and local authorities arid these viewsmight be published. It is expected that discussions on thejoint committees would generally lead to agreement being reached between the authorities but there will be arrangements under which an authority can seek the help of the central Gfovernment on any matter where it has not been possible to reach agreement.63. In addition to the joint consultative committees, each AHAwill include in its membership members of the corresponding localauthority (see Section X) j and local authorities will be26
strongly recommended to co-opt to their relevant committees members or officers of the AHA.   These arrangements for membership of theauthorities or committees will be supplemented by close workingrelationships between the chief officers of the authorities and bythe arrangements for sharing the services of professional staff.Statutory provisions for collaboration in the last resort, the quality of collaboration will depend on the readiness of those concerned at all levels to communicateand collaborate with each other.   But it is desirable to provide an administrative setting for this, as described above.   And it isdesirable also to provide a sound statutory basis.   It is therefore proposed that the NHS Reorganisation Bill should contain a generalobligation on the authorities concerned to collaborate 5 should give them the fullest possible powers to provide each other with goods and services; and should make it obligatory to set up joint consultativecommittees.Finance65. Appropriate financial arrangements between health and localauthorities to cover these different forms of collaboration will be recommended in the light of advice from the Working Party onCollaboration.j27
VII   AREA HEALTH AUTHORITIES - FAMILY PRACTITIONER SERVICES66. Unification of the health services will not change the status ofthe general medical and dental practitioners, ophthalmic medical practitioners, opticians and pharmacists.   They now provide services as independent contractors, and they will continue to do so.67. Unification will however open up new opportunities for familypractitioners to develop their services as integral parts of comprehensive,integrated health care.Family practitioner committee68. To administer the contracts, the AHA will be required by statuteto set up a Family Practitioner Committee.   Its work will consist of entering into contracts with the individual practitioners, and administeringtheir terms of service, including remuneration schemes,(which will be settlednationally), and the statutory disciplinary arrangements (which will^beunchanged).   On all of these matters, the Committee will deal direct withthe Central Department.69* The Committee will be made up in the same way as areExecutive Councils at present outside the London area.   There will be 30members, half of them appointed by...the-professions themselves.   The 15professional members - 8 doctors, 3 dentists, 2 pharmacists, one ophthalmicoptician and dispensing optician - will be appointed by the local, professionalcommittees for the area, which.will perform broadly the same functions as they now. do in relation to the family practitioner services.   Of the remaining 15members, 11 will be appointed by the AHA (at least one being an area authority28
CONFIDENTIALmember) and 4 by the local authority (or authorities) entitled to appointmembers to the AHA.    (See Section X for details of AHA membership).   Thechairman will be appointed by the Committee from among its own members.AHA responsibilities70.    If there is to be proper integration of health care in the reorganisedservice, the AHA must itself take responsibility for those issues where theprovision of family practitioner services involves other parts of the unifiedMS or the personal social services.   These include the planning anddevelopment of health centres; the approval where necessary of practitioners&apos;own proposals for providing premises; plans for contractor services in new towns and redevelopment areas; and general arrangements for nursing and otherskilled staff employed by the AHA or by the local authority to work withfamily doctors in their own practices, whether in health centres or elsewhere.The AHA will of course want to be sure that plans for developments which affect contractor services are generally acceptable to its familypractitioners.   It will therefore consult the FPC and the local professionalcommittees, and will take full account of their views before it makes decisions on these matters.Staff for the family practitioner committee71*    The^ staff serving the ppc will, like other staff workingwithin the area, be employed by the AHA, but the Committee will be consulted before senior appointments are made.   Some staff may choose tomake their career in the service of the Committee, but those who want a wider career will be given opportunities to transfer between the work ofthe Committee and other parts of the area administration,72,      These arrangements willgive the Committee a better prospect of getting the services of the best quality staff than would be the case if
staff were to be appointed by them because in that event, careerprospects would inevitably be limited.Medical Practices Committee, Dental Estimates Board, Joint Pricing Committee73. The work of the Medical Practices Committee and the Dental Estimates board will remain unchanged in the new structure.   The Joint Pricing Committeewill be replaced by a joint health authority with the same functions.
CONFIDENTIALVTII   REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES74*       The re^ional task will be in part strategic planning,in part co-ordination and supervision, in part executive.Planning75*        The regional health authority will develop strategic plans and priorities based on a review of the needs identified by AHAs and on its judgment of the right balance between the individual areas&apos; claims on resources.It will plan the ways and the pace at which area needs may be met, guidedwhere appropriate by agreed national and regional policies and standards.76.        The RHA will be responsible for identifying, in consultation withAHAs, services that need a regional rather than an area approach, and arranging for their provision, either direct or through specified AHAs.with professional advice,The authority will need to develop,/an overall regional plan for specialist services and to pay particular attention to the provision and location ofrarer specialties such as neurology, neurosurgery, radiotherapy and someforms of laboratory investigation.   The deployment within the region of senior hospital medical, dental and scientific staff will be determinedby this plan.77*        The RHA will have a special responsibility for ensuring - withthe Universities and AHAs concerned - that satisfactory service facilities are provided to support medical and dental teaching, undergraduate andpostgraduate, and research.   It will therefore have a close relationship with a University providing medical and dental undergraduate education,and there will be many links between the health services and the specialisedworic and research that are associated with the medical and dental schools.Co-ordination and supervision78*       The RHA will review the plans of each of its areas to satisfyitself that they contain programmes to achieve necessary improvements in services, that they are attainable within available regional resources, thatthey are consistent with national and regional polcies, and that they have been
co-ordinated with the planning and operational activities of localauthorities.   They will also need to see that area plans collectively fittogether to meet the needs of communities: sometimes this may call for theprovision of services to people of one area from hospitals outside their area. (The same situation may also arise as between regions).19.       Having agreed area plans with the area health authorities, it willallocate resources between them, and will monitor theirperformance against a set of agreed objectives and programmes for whichthe resources have been allotted.Executive functions80.       The most important of these will be the design and construction ofnew building and works.   The RHA will itself undertake the more importantprojects, subject to any necessary approval by the central Department and toguidance on such matters as design and cost standards and building techniques and methods.   The design and execution of other new building work will be delegated to AHAs, subject to any necessary approval and guidance by theRHA.   The latter will however be the main executive building agency and willemploy architects, engineers and quantity surveyors not only for its own workbut also to help AHAs on building projects delegated to them.   Responsibilityfor operation and maintenance of engineering plant and services and for themaintenance of existing premises will be delegated to the areas, subject to regional supervision.81.     A great deal of work has been done on the functional planning of hospitals: this work is being carried forward in the standardisation of departmental designs.   The use of these designs will encourage a high quality of architecture and a high priority will be given in the reorganisedservice to the architectural and environmental standards of new hospital buildinAmbulance service82.      The RHA will need to see that there is effective co-ordination and collaboration between adjacent AHA services in such matters as emergency
CONFIDENTIALcover, the siting and use of ambulance stations, and training.   And in thegroup of health areas corresponding to a metropolitan county, there will be advantage in providing a single ambulance service; this could be operated bythe RHA as a service to its AHAs.Other services83.       These will include the provision of a blood transfusion service;and the sponsorship of some research projects, including regionalepidemiological studies.   Some parts of the overall plan for supplies in the region - for example, the purchase of certain items of equipment - may be discharged most economically or effectively on a regional basis (just asothers will best be handled at area or national level).   Again, somemanagement services may be provided most effectively by the RHA: for example,the provision of computer facilities, the compilation and processing of statistics, and certain aspects of the personnel function including theprovision of selected training facilities for use by the staff of AHAs aswell as by those of the RHAs.RIL^s:   numbers and boundaries84.       The location and size of health regions are determined by severalfactors.   The location should be such that each Region has a Universitymedical school within its boundaries.   The size must be sufficient forsatisfactory planning but not too large for the co-ordination and supervision of the AHAs; and it must be suitable for the exercise of regional executive functions.   It is also obviously desirable to avoiddisturbing the forward planning of the hospital service, unless other factors make this unavoidable.   In the light of these considerations, theGovernment has decided that the new health regions will be based on the14 planning regions now in use for the hospital service.85.       Each region will consist of a number of complete health areas - noarea being split between regions - and this means that a number ofadjustments are needed in the present hospital regional boundaries tosecure conformity with the new area boundaries.   Details outside London are set out in the list and map of areas and regions in Appendix I.
IX   CENTRAL DEPARTMENT06. The RHAs will be accountable to the Secretary of State for theirown activities and for those of the AHAs.   The Secretary of State willcontinue to have responsibility to Parliament for the National health service as a whole and will determine national policy.   The Departmentmust assist him in these ways:(1) Settling, within the framework laid down by the Act, thekind, scale and balance of services to be provided in the regions and areas.   For this purpose it must develop, inconsultation with the field authorities and the professions,appropriate long term objectives, priorities and standards of care as guidelines for effective area and regional planning.(2) Guiding, supporting and (to the extent that this is desirable)controlling the RHAs.   It must help the field authorities tounderstand the guidelines and the reasoning behind them.And it must allocate to RHAs the resources for putting them into effect.(3) Obtaining or developing resources which strongly influence the adequacy, efficiency and economy of the services.   This requiresspecialist work on particular resources - personnel; financejproperty and building; supply.   The central Department willhave a special responsibility in relation /to staffing.   the recruitment and training of the skilled manpower required inthe NHS call for various measures at national level eg to forecast staff requirements, to plan numbers of trainingplaces, where appropriate to monitor the quality of training,and to arrange publicity to attract entrants. . The requiredqualifications, remuneration and conditions of service will
continue to be settled at the centre.   Also, all land and property will vest in the Secretary of State.   And the central department will continue to be responsible for overall budgetingand accounting of health expenditure.(4) Carrying out other functions that are best organised centrally.Just as some things need to be done by the RBA rather than theAHA, so there are things best done centrally.   Examples are sometypes of research and the standardisation and preparation ofnational statistics.   Purchase of equipment or supplies centrallymay be justifiable in economic terras or by reason of control of quality or distribution.   The NHS superannuation scheme will alsocontinue to be centrally administered.   A microbiological servicerelated to communicable disease will continue to be administeredcentrally by the Public Health Laboratory Service Board on behalfof the Secretary of State.(5) Supporting the Secretary of State in his Parliamentary and publicduties.87.      In addition, the central Department has responsibilities towards other services besides the NHS, particularly the personal social services and social security.   And it discharges some central Government tasks such asthe licensing of medicines (in association with the Medicines Commission),the control of food safety and hygiene, and acts as the production authorityfor the medical supply industry.  These responsibilities have to be co-co-ordinated with the Department&apos;s responsibilities towards the NHS.88.      As already announced, the organisation and operation of the department has been reviewed, with the help of management consultants.   Proposals have been formulated which are designed to enable the Department to carry out effectively thefunctions it will have after NHS reorganisation.   The proposals are based
closely upon the Department&apos;s role as defined above.   In particular,(a) emphasis is placed on the development of a process of planning, in association with the field authorities, tohelp the Secretary of State to decide national objectives and priorities.   One of the main sections ofthe Department will be organised to assist in this process, with particular attention to assessing people1sneeds for health and social care and proposing how thoseneeds can best be met from the full range of servicesthat can be made available in the reorganised NHS, the personal social services, and other relevant services.(b) great importance is attached to a close and continuingrelationship with RHAs.   For this purpose, another mainDepartmental group    will be organised as the focal point for action in partnership with the RHAs.     Its Divisionswill be responsible for assisting RHAs to produce andimplement plans which will give effect to national policies and priorities while taking full accomt of local circumstances,priorities and policies.   They will also ensure that the BHAsreceive any help from the Department that they need.   Andthey will be responsible for surveillance over the quality and effectiveness of health service management.   Whenappropriate, RHAs will communicate direct with other, morespecialist parts of the Department, but these Divisions willbe created specifically to support and guide them across thefull range of their business.(c) the Department&apos;s staff concerned with personnel policies inthe NHS will also be increased, and will be organised in a third main group.
89.      Thus the central Department will be organised on an inter-professional basis to carry out three main groups of tasks inconnection with the NHS: planning the kind, scale and balance of services in association with the field authorities and the professions;working in partnership with the RHAs and providing them with support and guidance; and carrying out central NHS personnel functions.   TheDepartment is also planning to increase the number of NHS staff secondedto it, and of its own staff who spend training spells in the reorganisedservice.
CONFIDENTIALX  MEMBERSHIP OF AUTHORITIES90.     The strength of the new administrative structure will in theGovernment&apos;s view largely depend on three factors; small and capable member-ship of authorities to approve and monitor policies; effective machineryfor getting expert advice to the members from the medical and other health professions, and for gathering, appraising and handling intelligence; andchannels by which, in every health district, the users of services canrepresent their views vigorously to management.   This Section examines thefirst of these factors; the following two Sections discuss professionaladvisory machinery and the community health councils.Volunteer members; remuneration for chairmen91*     The Government believes that, as in the past, the NHS should be administered by trained staff, under the general direction of authoritiesoomposed of part-time members who give their services voluntarily.   Membersof the area and regional health authorities will serve in an unpaid capacitythough they will be entitled to travelling and other allowances.   Thechairman will however have a specially heavy and time-consuming job andit is desirable that there should be no financial barrier to his giving as muchof his time to the health service as the job demands.   The legislation will include a provision to make it possible for the chairmen of health authoritiesto be remunerated on a part-time basis.Scope of the authorities1 work92.      The new authorities will have important work to do.   The area authorities responsible for for example will employ thousands of staff, professional and others, they will be/the health care of up to a million people or even more, they will administerannual budgets running into millions (in some cases many millions) of poundsand will be responsible for buildings and plant worth many millions.93.      In general terms, members will have two interacting sets of responsi-bilities: the supervision of the creation and development by their chief officers of policies in response to changing needs; and the overseeing of standards of performance, both in quantity ?nd quality.   They will needability to give guidance and direction on policies to their chief officerscharged with the management of the service.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBasis for membership of authorities94* To do this work effectively, the authorities must be small.   Thearea authority will normally have about fifteen members.   The regionalauthority will be about the same size depending on the number of areas inthe region and other variable factors such as the number of Universitiesproviding medical and dental education.   The authority will be free toco-opt to committees where they think the committees would benefit fromthe help and advice of people who are not members of the authority.95* An important part of the area health authorities members1 work willbe to visit the hospitals and other units for the management of which theywill be responsible.   A planned programme of visiting will be one means bywhich members will be able to enlarge their understanding of problemsrequiring their attention and to check progress made in dealing with them.But authorities will not need to rely only on their own members for visiting.They will be able to co-opt suitable people to help them.96. The work to be done by the members calls for general ability andpersonality. They will need to be interested in the NHS; to have an unbiased,questioning yet constructive approach and good judgment; to set high standards and provide vigorous leadership. A diversity and a proper balance of relevantability and experience are also called for. These needs can best be met if,in the main, members are chosen for their personal qualities after appropriateconsultations, not elected as representatives reflecting the views ofparticular interests.Membership of RHAs97. The RHAs will form part of the chain of responsibility running fromthe Secretary of State to the areas.   Their authority will derive from the selection and appointment of their chairmen and members by the Secretary ofState, who will be required before making his choice to consult with theappropriate interested organisations including the Universities, the mainlocal authorities and the main health professions.
Membership of AHAs98*      The Chairman will be appointed by the Secretary of State, afterconsultation with the Chairman of the RBA.   Because of the need for closedecision-making links with the local authority services, local authoritymembers who are active in the management of the personal social services,education and other relevant services, should have places on the ABA and four    members of it will therefore be appointed by the correspondinglocal authority.   Because of the need for a close link with the Universityproviding medical and dental teaching facilities, one place on the AHAwill be filled on its nomination: there will be a second place if thearea includes substantial teaching facilities.99*      The remaining members of the AHA will be chosen and appointed bythe ERA.   The RHA will be required, before making its choice, to consult with appropriate organisations.   These organisations will include thoserepresentative of the main health professions, as it is intended thatAHAs should include in their membership people of authority and experiencewho themselves are members of the healing professions.   This is in additionto the AHAs professional advisory machinery and to its chief professionalofficers.   The proportion of professional members will not be prescribed,and will differ from area to area and change from time to time accordingto circumstances, but an AHA will always include doctors and at least onenurse or midwife - but not drawn from staff who are accountable to theauthority&apos;s chief professional officers.
XI     PROFESSIONAL ADVISORY MACHINERY^OO.       Strong professional advisory machinery will be built into the new structure.   The Act will include provision for this.   It will function at each level of management, and will ensure that the RHA and AHAand their staffs make decisions in the full knowledge of expert opinion.It will ensure, too, that at all levels the health professions exercise an effective voice in the planning and operation of the NHS.Professional advice for the health authorities101.       The details will be worked out in consultation with the variousprofessions in readiness for 1974.   Though the detailed arrangements will vary according to the circumstances of the individual professions, it isclear thata. at least the following professions must be covered:doctors, dentists, opticians, pharmacists, and nursesand midwives.b. the arrangements must include provision for successorsto the local medical, dental, optical and pharmaceuticalcommittees, since they will, as now, have important statutory andother functions to perform eg the appointment of members to the Family Practitioner Committees.c. the arrangements should also carry into the reorganisedService the best of the experience already gained in theexisting service (eg the developing Cogwheel structure,other satisfactory arrangements at HMC and individualhospital level, and the advisory systems on professionalmatters built up by the RHBs)j and should take account of the interestsProfessional advice for the Department   of medical, dental and nursing education.WZt       At the national level, the Department of Health and social security must have available to it expert opinion on a wide range of matters, many of which are highly technical, relating   to the provisionof the National Health Service.   Advisory bodies will continue to be themain source of this advice.   They are either set up as standing bodies orx See paragraph 130
appointed as occasion   requires.&quot;03. The main standing advisory body is the CentralHealth Services Council, created in 1948 to advise the Secretary of state on general matters bearing on the service.   Standing Advisory committees have been appointed to advise the Central Health Services Council and theSecretary of State on specific aspects.     The constitutions and terms ofreference of the Council and of the Advisory Committees will be adjusted as necessary to meet the needs of the reorganised and unified service.   In 1946the elements in the composition of the Central Health Services Council werespecified in the Act, but it is now proposed to use subordinate legislation for this purpose - as has always been the case with the Standing Committees -so that the composition can be adjusted more flexiblyto meet changing circumstances. As well as members appointed by virtue oftheir official positions at the heads of certain professional bodies, the list of which is under review, and members with other health serviceexperience, it is intended to include on the new Council some peoplespecifically appointed to advise from the patient*s viewpoint.There will also be cross-representation with the Personal Social ServicesCouncil, so as to secure representation of social work interests on theCentral Health Services Council and of health service interests on the personal Social Services Council,   The new - like the present - advisorybodies will be free to offer advice on their own initiative as well as onrequest.Advice on staff training104.  Arrangements axe also being made for giving expert advice to theSecretary of State on the training of NHS staff: details are given inSection XV.
XII      COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILSExpressing local opinion105.        In planning and running their services, the health authorities must be in a position to know the views taken of them by the communities for whom the services are provided.   They must also take full account ofthose views in the decisions they make.   A lively and continuinginteraction between management and the users of services is of directbenefit to both parties.   It helps to make sure that the public has afull say in what is done in its name, and it helps the managingauthorities by making them better informed on priorities, needs anddeficiencies in service.106,       The expression of local public opinion can be catered for inone of two ways.   It can be done indirectly by including in the member-ship of the health authorities local people serving in a representativecapacity.   Or it can be done more directly, through bodies speciallyset up for this purpose, with direct links to the authorities.   TheGovernment prefer the second course.   It allows each of the interests- management and the community - to concentrate on its own specialfunction, avoids a confusion between the direction of services andrepresentation of those receiving them, encourages a constructiveinterplay of ideas and makes possible the expression of a widercross-section of local opinion than is feasible where the authorityitself contains members serving as representatives. /Community health councils: membership107.       Bodies to represent the views of the consumer - the community health councils - will therefore be established.   There will be one foreach of the area&apos;s health districts.43
It is nt Lho district, rather than at the (often large)area, where there is real local interest.   special arrangements will be made where the people living within a health districtlook for a large part of their services to a neighbouring district (whichmight be administered by a different area health authority).t08.       Each council will be made up of people with particular interestin the health services.   Half its members will beappointed by the local government district council(s), and therest by the AHA, mainly on the nomination of voluntary bodies concerned locally with the NHS and some after consultation withother organisations.   No upper or lower limit of membership will be set,but a total of between 20 and 30 members would normally be about right for ensuring a proper spread of local interests within an effective andcoherent working unit. Councils will appoint their chairmen from among theirown members.Functions1109.        The councils basic job will be to represent to the AHA theinterests of the public in the health service in its district.   It willbe for each council to decide how best to go about this, but they willbe expected to influence area policy by contributingtheir own ideas on how services should be operated and developed.   Tohelp them do this effectively, councils will have powers to secureinformation, will have the right to visit hospitals and other institutions,and will have access to the area authority end in particular to its senior officers administering district services.   Some council members may want totake a special interest in particular institutions or services or partsof their district, especially where the districts are large.tJD&amp;*   Councils will be well placed to bring to the notice of the AHA and itsdistrict staff potential causes of local complaint, especially those of ageneral nature, but their function will be distinct from that of the
AHA1s complaints machinery and of the Health Service Commissioner(see Section XX.), There will be well understood procedures forthe investigation of individual complaints in the reorganised servicebut a CHC might well wish, on request, to provide information about these procedures, to advise complainants how to lodge a complaint andto provide a &quot;patient&apos;s friend&quot; where one is needed.   The volume andtype of individual complaints about a service or institution will beof legitimate concern to councils as a measurement of publicsatisfaction.111.        For their part, the AHA will be expected to consult the CHCson its plans for health service developments, and particularly on proposals for important variations in services affecting the public.New services, closures of hospitals or departments of hospitals or their change of use, are examples.   The full AHA willmeet representatives of all its community health councils at leastonce a year; that meeting would of course be additional to the regular,less formal meetings which will take place between the authority1smembers and officers and CHC representatives.   The councils will publishannual reports and may publish other reports; the AHA will be requiredto publish replies recording action taken on issues raised in them.Councils1 expenses1*1-2.        The AHA will meet the councils&apos; reasonable expenditure, includingexpenses incurred by their members, and will provide accommodation for meetings and secretarial staff.45
XXII      MRDICAL ANT) dental TEACHING113.        Tim NHS has always given high priority to providing facilities in support oL&apos; medical and dental teaching carried out by the Universities,and in support of associated research.   This will continue to be one of themost important priorities at all levels of the reorganised service: nationalregional, area and district,&quot;Teaching areas&quot;114-        Some of the areas will have substantial facilities of this kind.They will be described as &quot;teaching areas&quot; and the AHAs which administerthem will be called AHA(t)s.Integration witliin the regions115.       Administrative unification is essential is there is to be a properly balanced development of community and hospital facilities tomeet the needs of teaching, of research and of services to the public.Teaching hospitals have in recent years gone a long way in providingdistrict hospital services.   Unification will help them to take this further and in so doing, will bring great benefit to the districts concerned.   Atthe same time, facilities for teaching and research are increasingly needed,not only in hospitals but also in the community health services: here toothe closer union of teaching hospital and community services will be ofbenefit.   Moreover, administrative unification will enable the staff ofthe teaching hospitals to play the full part which they and the health service as a whole would wish them to take in the development of the newadministrative organisation that will be set up in 1974*116.       For these reasons, the teaching areas will be administered aspart of the regions in which they are situated^
117.        But integration of teaching hospitals within the unified NHS must take account of the special character of undergraduate teaohing and of university sponsored research, and of the fact that the hospitals wherethey take place also provide specialised services for many people livingoutside their area.   The hospitals1 individual identity and historictraditions are valuable assets which must and will be preserved when thenew organisation is set up.   The rest of this Section describes thearrangements to achieve these important objects.118,       The teaching hospital will obviously have a central role in the health services for the district in which it is situated.   The administrative arrangements at hospital and district level have still to be worked out indetail in the light of the recommendations of the Management Study.   Butit is clear that there will be intimate links between the AHA(T) and those responsible for the administration of the teaching hospital.   It is clearalso that the management at the district level, acting for the AHA(T), willhave the main responsibility for all operational matters and will play a leading part in planning the development and improvement of services.   Itis expected that AHA(T)s will wish to nominate one or more of their members to take a special interest in the services of a district where there is ateaching hospital.   They will be free to co-opt people to give them support in this, and to assist in planned programmes of visiting.119,        It is important to maintain the present close working relation-ships between teaching hospitals and their associated medical and dentalschools, and to extend those relationships to all the health services inthe districts.   The responsibility for securing this, day in and day out,must rest at the local level.   A joint committee between the AHA(T) and themedical or dental school may also be found useful.   Where, in London,47
statutory arrangements exist for BG representation on school Councils,similar arrangements will be made for AHA(T) representation.120.        The AHA(T) itself will have teaching and research interestsprominently in mind in its operational responsibility for the area andin the work it does on planning the improvement and development of the nhs.   The AHA(T)&apos;s membership will demonstrate this.   The AHA withoutsubstantial teaching and research facilities will have one membernominated by the University, but the AHA.(T) will have two.   The AHA(T)will also have at least two additional members with teaching hospitalexperience - more if the area includes more than one teaching hospital(or group of hospitals of a kind that has hitherto been designed as asingle teaching hospital).121.       The AHA(T)s will exert a strong influence at the regional level,where the RHAS responsibilities will be much wider than those of theexisting RHB, and will include provision of support for teaching and research.   The RHA will include a member appointed by the Secretary ofState after consultation with the University (more than one member ifthere is more than one University concerned).122.        The Departments review of regional plans and estimates to ensureconsistency with national policies and priorities, will pay particular attention to the balance between teaching and non-teaching areas.   The RHAwill receive in its financial allocation a specific identified allowance for teaohing and research.   It will also be required to set up a committeeto advise it on its responsibilities in relation to medical and dentalundergraduate education and research; this committee will contain membersco-opted from the University (or Universities) and the AHA(t)s.123.        Regional health authorities will have important responsibilities for helping to ensure that there are satisfactory arrangements within the48
CONFIDENTIALnew nervine for postgraduate medical and denfcal education and training.It is envisaged that they will be advised on the discharge of these responsibilities by regional postgraduate education committees, as areregional hospital boards at present, and that these bodies should bedistinct from the committees advising on the provision required forundergraduate teaching.124.       These arrangements should make for a fully integrated service in which the teaching hospitals will play as vital a part as they do inthe hospital service as at present organised.Special interim provisions125.        Teaching hospitals have traditionally been centres of excellencein acute medicine.   Increasingly they have widened their interests toinclude aspects of non-acute conditions.   In future, the integratedservices of the district and the teaching area will be able to benefit from their capacity for general excellence and for high standards.The teaching hospitals&apos; contribution to the reorganised service will undoubtedly be a growing one, but during the early years there is boundto be anxiety about the possible effects of new administrative relation-ships.   There is therefore a need for additional safeguards during thoseyears, as reassurance that full weight will be given to the importance ofthe teaching and research functions as well as to the essential servicerole of these distinguished hospitalsa126.       The scope of the safeguards needed is still being discussed, buttwo have already teen decided upon.   On the first appointment of AHa(T)s,the members appointed for their teaching hospital experience will beappointed by the Secretary of State from among the members of existingBGs and University HMCs.   Similarly, on its first appointment, the RHA.&apos;s49
501.1&apos;Ho.hj.ng &apos;ui(l research committee will include members drawn from thetpresent BGs and University HMCs.
XIV A SOUND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE127.        The Government considers that these arrangements - for area,regional and central administration, for strong advisory machinery,and for the expression of local opinion - provide a sound structurewithin which the health professions can provide the public with an efficient and humane service.Administration; statutory provisions128.       At present, statutory responsibility for administering the nhs is divided between the Secretary of State (acting throughregional and local bodies) for the hospital services, the executive councils for the family practitioner services and local authorities for the other community personal health services.   In future, therewill be a clear line of responsibility for the whole NHS from theSecretary of State to the RHAs and through them to the AHAs, with corresponding accountability from area to region to centre.   The overallresponsibility which will rest on the Secretary of State makes it necessarythat, in addition to making statutory regulations and issuing guidance, heshould be able to give formal directions to RHAs and AHAs; RHAs will have thesame power of formal- direction in relation, to the AHAs.   These directions may be general, covering all authorities, or they may bind only one authority,in relation to either a general or a particular matter.   The power of formaldirection should however be needed only in the most exceptional circumstances.$29.       This framework will be flexible so that practicesmay be changed in the light of experience and altered circumstances.Administration; delegation, clinical freedom130,       National and regional planning is essential.   But it is farfrom the Government&apos;s intention that the NHS should continually be administered or supervised on the basis of regulations and directionsfrom centre or region.   Objectives and priorities will be approved and51
r*&quot; rformanoo monitored, but the authority doing the job itself willbe left l.o get on with it, with a minimum of interference.   Thiswill apply as between the central Department and the RHA and asbetween the RHA and the AHA.Financial administration131.        As to the funds needed for RHA and AHA services, the department will be responsible to Parliament for expenditure.  But subject tosuch directionsj, regulations and guidance as may be necessary, it willdelegate financial responsibility to RHAs, and RHAs will similarlydelegate it to AHAs.   More detail is given in Section XvT.Supervision of delegated authority132.        The first requirement for effective supervision is goodplanning, so that comprehensive plans, which take account of available resources, are prepared within the AHAs and are reviewed and approved by RHAsand in more summary form by the Department.   If omissions can be spottedand put right at the planning stage, then there can be the maximumdelegation of authority in the actual conduct of the job, and theneed for much more detailed intervention later on can be avoided.Secondly, supervision entails the monitoring of performance to ensurethat planned standards of service and efficiency are being achieved.Performance can be monitored in various wayss by the collection andanalysis of regular statistical information, by specially commissionedreports and enquiries, by visiting and contacts between the staff ofthe Department and field authorities,       by systematic visiting,inspection and advice such as are carried out by the Departmentsauditors or by the Hospital Advisory Service, and by the self-criticalobservation and analysis of practice by which the professions52
monitor their own work. Finally, supervision requires follow-up of plans to ensure that agreed actions are being taken and to consider their effect.133.       In the reorganised service, there will be a more systematicand comprehensive planning process than now exists.   The department will annually prepare guidance on national policy objectives forAHAs and EHAs who will then draw up their plans for thedevelopment of their services to meet these objectives together withtheir own local priorities.   It is intended to   seek methods ofobtaining improvedinformation and more effective measurement of needs and of performance.   Such measurement is exceptionally difficult in healthcare and better statistical indicators have to be devised.   Allauthorities will need to seek ways of using this information more effectively to assess the real progress of the service in achievingits objectives and to identify opportunities and problems.   there organisation of the Department will, as has been explained, provide for it to have closer and more regular contaot than in the past with the health authorities, which should lead to a better mutual understanding of problems and objectives. And the Hospital Advisory Service will continueto provide valuable information and advice to the Secretary of Stateand to the service itself.   The Departments function of general supervision will be mainly directed towards the activities of the regional health authorities, -who will be expected to supervise theactivities of the area health authorities in the same way.53
134*       RllA and AHA members are there to see that the right questions are asked and answered in the preparation, operation and review of plans; and toensure a full awareness of health needs as a basis for the design of policy,the settlement of priorities and the provision of a good standard of service.They are not there to do the work that their officers are trained to do.Hot only would this be a waste of time and effort; officers can be expectedto give of their best only if they are entrusted with a wide measure ofresponsibility, and can enjoy a feeling of pride and personal achievementwhen a good job is done,135*       The success of the service will depend not only on the work ofclinicians and other professional staff but also on the quality of thewhole range of administrative staff.Organisation of work136.        It is important that organisation structures, functions and procedures should be clearly laid down to a greater extent than in thepast, and this will be done.137*       Organisation structures will be specified with sufficientflexibility to take account of the varying circumstances of the newhealth authorities.138.        Job descriptions should indicate clearly the criteria by whichperformance will be assessed.   This applies alike to the chairman and membersof the authority and to their officers, so that responsibility for givingdrive and leadership as well as for executive work is not left in doubt.139*        In recent years, as a product largely of some important studiesand reports, there have been changes in the organisation of the workof NHS staff - medical, nursing and of other professions, particularlyin the hospital service.   For example, hospital clinicians have beenorganising themselves in many hospital groups in Divisions based onclinical specialties and in association with general practitionersalong lines recommended in the &quot;Cogwheel Report&quot;* - with the aim of* First Report of the Joint Working Party on the Organisation of medical Work in Hospitals, HMSO 1967.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALorganising their own work better, making known their requirements and prioritiesas collectively decided to the hospital authority and reviewing hospital activitymore effectively.   The nursling services also arc being reorganised,under Chief Nursing Officers for hospital groups, on the linesof the recommendations of the &quot;Salmon Report&quot;*.   Similar principlesare being applied to nursing staff of local authorities.   Hospitalpharmaceutical services are being reorganised in accordance withbhe Noel Hall Report**.140*        The intention is to develop these principles of organisationand adapt them to the unified NHS.   The management study will be making proposals for this.Specialists in community medicine141.        Unification will bring together into one service medicaladministrators now working in the public health services and those inthe hospital service.   Their functions will continue to be carriedout after reorganisation and doctors from both these spheres willhave a central part in the planning and management ofthe unified service, in the Department, in the regions and in the areas and districts.142.        As specialists in what is now recognised within the professionas community medicine, their concern will be with assessing need for health services, evaluating the effectiveness of existing servicesand planning the best use of health resources.   Equally, they willconcern themselves with developing preventive health services, withthe links between the health and the local authority personal social,public health and education services, and with providing the medical advice and help which local authorities will need for the administration55_.-_*Report of the Committee on Senior Nursing Staff Structure, HMSO 1966**Report of the Working Party on the Hospital Pharmaceutical Service, HMSO 1970
of those services,143,        The Working Party on Medical Administrators^ underDr R B Hunter1s chairmanship, lias described the work of the specialist in community medicine at all levels of a unified health service.   Their report points to the especially important responsibility which these specialists will have within the district management forimrotinc the functional integration of health care.144* Their skills will complement those of other health serviceadministrators and of the clinicians.   These groups will togetherform a partnership in management of the new service.56*Report of the forking Party on Medical Administrators, HMSO 1972
CONFIDENTIALXV     THE STAFF OF THE SERVICE145.   There are many references elsewhere in this White Paper to thepresent and future contribution   of the staff of the service.   Any largeundertaking naturally depends for its success on the loyal and efficientsupport of its staff and the manner in which they identify themselves withits objectives. This is as true of the NHS as of any other organisation. It isthe staff who provide the service, and the buildings, equipment and supplies are simply     the medium through which their skills can be exercised.The staff of the NHS authorities - hospital and local health authoritiesand Executive Councils - deserve high praise for the way in which theyhave performed their work and, despite the administrative barriers^largely co-operated with, each other.They must take credit for rendering so intelligently and humanely theservices for which they have been responsible since 1948.   The integratedNHS will enable them to gain wider experience of the Service and make fuller use, for the benefit of the patient, of its various partsthan has so far been possible^ and that will improve patient care.Personnel management146.      The National Health Service is highly labour-intensive, nearlyIQfo of the revenue costs being incurred on salaries and wages.   Moreover,the staff employed in the service combine a range of skills wider than inmost other organisations.   The service therefore needs particularlydiscerning and skilled personnelnamagement at all levels from the centreoutwards.   This implies not only the employment of properly trained staffin personnel departments but the recognition that every manager or supervisorhas a personnel function.   Good staff management demands goodmanpower information and work is being done on this both in the Department
confidential and elsewhere. The managers of the reorganised NHS at all levels will be encouraged to give closer attention to this subject and will have betterresources to handle it than their predecessors have had.Staffing studies147*       The development of the service will be assisted by the resultsof studies, - to some of which reference was made in Section XIV, - alreadycompleted or currently in progress, of the role and functions of staff engaged in the scientific and technical services, building maintenance,pharmaceutical services in hospitals, and in the nursing and midwiferyservices in hospitals and the community.148.       These studies will help in adapting professional and occupationaltraining to the needs of a modern integrated health service.   In particular,the content and the organisation of the training and education of nursesand midwives will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the BriggsCommittee on Nursing.Management training&apos;49*      Professional and occupational training will be complemented bymanagement training: that is, training to equip all the decision-makers withan understanding of the needs of the service as a whole and of its staff, andwith the skills enabling them to make the best use of the available resources.Most management training will need to be multi-professional.   It will needalso to take account of the close relationship between the objectives ofthe National Health Service and those of the local authority social services.This will accordingly form a part of management training at all levels.In addition, it is intended to arrange a regular series of seminars for senior people over the whole range of services for which the Secretaryof State is responsible.Advisory machinery150.     Various Committees have already provided valuable advice about stafftraining.   In particular the National Staff &quot;Committee, for hospital administrative58
confidential and clerical staff and the National Nursing Staff Committee for hospital nursesand midwives, have done valuable work not only on training but also in careerdevelopment, in encouraging movement between various branches of the hospitaladministrative service, in advising on selection and promotion procedures, andin developing staff appraisal systems and systematic career counselling.Unification means that comprehensive arrangements for all aspects of the personnelfunction, including training must now be developed.   The Department1s own resources are being strengthened for this purpose.   The work done by the NSCand the NNSC will be built upon, developed to meet the needs of an integratedhealth service and extended to other groups of staff.   It is therefore proposed,in consultation with the interested bodies, to reconstitute the existingCommittees and to constitute others so as to create a linked series of staffadvisory committees to provide co-ordinated advice to the Secretary of State.It is also proposed to establish an NHS Training Council, as a new advisory body working with the staff advisory committees on the training aspects of thework.Movement and Interchange of staff151*      The efficiency of the NHS and career development will both benefit frommovement of staff between the different levels of administration:   betweenregion, area, family practitioner committee, district and unit, and betweenthe different branches (administration, finance, supply and so on) at thevarious levels.152.      The same applies between the Central Department and the NHS.   Staffin the Department and the NHS need to know more of each other&apos;s work.   TheDepartment are studying the arrangements previously made for interchange ofstaff and will be consulting with the interests concerned on ways in which such arrangements might be improved and expanded.Pay and conditions of service153*      Rates of pay and conditions of service in the new structure willcontinue to be settled through national machinery.   A new review bodyhas been set up to advise the Government on the remuneration of doctors and dentists.   Management and staff will need to negotiate changes in the confidential
constitution of the present whitley Councils in order to meet the changesin the service and in particular to provide for the representation of thenew management bodies and of staff whose pay was previously settled outsidethe NHS whitley system.NHS employment policies154* measures outlined above are all intended to contribute to thedevelopment of clear and comprehensive employment policies for the reconstructedNHS covering recruitment, training, career development and retirement policies in the interest of good management and the full realisation of staffpotential.155,     As in the past, there will be consultation with staff&quot;organisationson matters on which their experience and their concern to secure the best interests of their members will come into play.
xvi      FINANCIAL administration^)0&quot; The change in administrative structure will not mean a changein the methods of financing the NHS except in the case of services transferred from local authorities.   The cost of those services, and of the health authorities&apos; other expenditure, will be financed mainly by taxation and met from.moneys voted by Parliament.   The general arrangements for chargingfor certain NHS services will not be affected.-157*        The Department will make capital and revenue allocations toRHAs.   Prom these, the RHAs will meet the cost of their own servicesand will allocate money to AHAs to meet the cost of area services including the cost of the community health councils.   Payments madeto practitioners under the terms of their contracts will be separatelyfunded by the Department.158. Regional and area health authorities will be required toprepare and maintain a medium terra &quot;roll-forward0 plan covering a4-year period together with indications of likely targets for the main capitaldevelopments&quot;over a longer peripd. Authorities-will be notified of provisionalfinancial ceilings for each of the succeeding four years so that plansmay be expressed in the form of financial estimates, covering bothrevenue and capital expenditure.The allocation of funds bythe regional authorities will be closely integrated with the planningprocesses so that the plans are based realistically on the levels of funds likely to be made available.   To encourage the most efficient use of resources and flexibility in the execution of planned developments,authorities will have freedom, within limits, to use funds allocated for capital expenditure to meet revenue
expenditure and vice versa.   Arrangements will also be worked out toenable unspent revenue allocations to be carried over from one yearto the next.   In addition, authorities will be given a more directfinancial interest in land holdings and land transactions.159. Improved accounting and financial systems arebeing devised. Tne estimates produced aspart of the planning process will be the framework for a budgetingsystem designed both to give overall control and to provide functionalbudgets which will help individual managers to exercise detailed controlover resources and to assess the cost-effectiveness of departments and services against any recommended standards.   Financial monitoring willform an important part of the monitoring of performanceso that RHAs and AHAs will be able to compareactual results against estimates and budgets. It will alsoenable the Department to be satisfied that efficient financial controland management is maintained throughout all authorities, and that funds are used to the best advantage and in conformity with national policies.The Department will continue existing arrangements for carrying out a statutory audit of the authorities&apos; accounts.160.        The allocations of available funds to health authorities willbe designed progressively to reduce the disparities between the resources available to different regions, and to achieve standards end improvements in services with due regard to national, regional and area priorities.The new information systems and other methods of assessment and reviewof services should help to ensure that the bases used for allocatingfunds meet these objectives with increasing effectiveness.
161.        The transfer of services will relieve local authorities of expenditure and this will have to be taken into account whenassessing the level of grant to be paid by the central Governmentto local authorities after April, 1974*
The reorganised Service:other issues
XVII     VOLUNTARY SERVICES162.   Voluntary service has always played an important part in thedevelopment of health and welfare services in this country.   Manyvoluntary organisations are already active in both the health and social services.   Unification of health services and the alignmentof area health authority boundaries with those of the localauthorities responsible for personal social services, will enablevoluntary bodies to see more clearly how their present services in each area, fit in with the range of needs of people both in and out of hospital, and in this way, will help them to work still more effectively.   They will be encouraged, in close co-operation withthe area health and local authorities, to increase and extend their activities.   And they will, through their membership of community health councils, influence the way in which district and area health services are developed.163*  The resources of voluntary organisations and individualvolunteers must, as far as is possible, be matched to the needs of thecommunity for their services.   With this object in view, the recentgrowth in the number of organisers co-ordinating voluntary help in hospitals will continue.   Research is going on into similar methodsof co-ordination in the wider field of voluntary work in the community.There may he scope for AHAs and local authorities to make jointappointment of organisers to co-ordinate voluntary help, eg for the elderly or mentally ill or handicapped, in both hospital and community.This emphasis on co-ordination arises from the great variety of needs and resources and its purpose is not in any way to limit the independence of voluntary bodies but to provide an outlet for their continuingexpansion.
I64. Good working relationships must also be preserved and strengthened in each community.   Individual hospitals will still providea focus for a wide range of voluntary service.   Of particular value is service directed to needs of long-stay patients - visiting andbefriending, helping relatives to visit, occupying the patients1 day and keeping them in contact with the everyday life of the community.Outside the hospitals, there are many other needs for voluntary help.Examples are visiting the elderly and the disabled in their own homes and hostels; and to a growing extent, providing car services for thosewho need help to travel to doctors surgeries, health centres or hospitalout-patient departments, to visit friends and relatives in hospital orto attend social clubs.165. The RHAs and AHAs will be able to make grants in support of voluntary bodies which provide and promote services within the generalscope of the authorities&apos; responsibilities.   Financial help for nationalactivities will continue to come from the central Department.
$ XVIII   the PRIVATE SECTORHole of private sectort 6, The Oovernment recognises the contribution made by the private sector of medicine to the sum of health care, through a wide variety of private hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions and throughindividual practitioners.   It thinks it right for people to have anopportunity to exercise a personal choice to seek treatment privately.The existence of facilities for private treatment, both within and outside the NHS, provides this opportunity.   The private sectorcan also act as a stimulus to enterprise, development and high standards of service, and has a part to play in maintaining this country&apos;s position as a medical centre of worldimportance, from which the NHS benefits.   For its part the Governmentwill continue to make available facilities in NHS hospitals for private patients, without prejudice to the needs of those - the vast majority - who wish to be treated as NHS patients and who are the hospitals&apos; primary concern.MO a        The Government also acknowledges the tradition of service tothe community rendered by the long established voluntary institutions,including those run by religious orders.   These institutions could continue to make a particularly important contribution towards the care and welfare of geriatric patients and patients needing care and support in the final stages of fatal illness.Contractual arrangements /168,        Wherever it is compatible with the proper planning of services for an area, the Government wishes to encourage the use by the NHS of voluntary facilities provided under contractual arrangements.These facilities would be regarded as forming part of the total healthresources of an area, not just as sources of temporary help.67
Denominational HospitalsT69*.       There will be no change in the arrangements which preservedthe character of certain hospitals and their association withparticular religious denominations when they were transferred tothe NHS in 1948.
CONFIDENTIALXIX    ENDOWMENTS170. The hospital authorities are trustees of substantial sumsgiven to them by the public.   Much of this money was given for local and special purposes.   In transferring these trusts to the new authorities, it is right and necessary to preserve both the local administration and the purposes of these gifts as far as it ispossible to do so.171. The funds now held and administered by BMCs will be transferredto the appropriate AHA.   To preserve the advantages of local administration,the AHA will be able to establish committees, of those in the locality whoare concerned, to advise it on the spending of the funds.   The future administration of funds held by BGs - some of which are very substantial -is still under discussion.   The BGs of the London postgraduate teaching hospitals will retain their endowments as long as the Boards remain inexistence (see Section XIIL).172, In spending endowment moneys, the authorities will be requiredto respect the special and local purposes for which the funds were originally given.   Thus endowments held for special purposes will continueto be used only for purposes within the scope of the trust; and thoseheld for the general purposes of a particular hospital only for thepurposes of that hospital.   Endowments at present held for the general purposes of a hospital authority (as distinct from those of a particularhospital) will be used only for the hospitals at present controlled and managed by the hospital authority concerned and for, health servicesassociated with them (for example, research and local health centres).173.        The Hospital Endowments Fund will be available to health authorities for use for hospital and associated purposes.69
174*       The new authorities will have powers to accept fresh giftsto help them in any part of their work.   Financial help from voluntarysources has an important part to play in the Health Service, and every encouragement will be given to locally organised fund-raising by voluntary organisations.   When it is directed to specific localobjects approved by the health authorities, it is a useful means ofspeeding up progress.   It also encourages local innovation andpioneering.   Independent funds are badly needed, not only by the acute, children&apos;s and other hospitals which at present tend to attractmost of the public&apos;s gifts, but also for the geriatric and psychiatricservices.   They are needed, not for patients.&apos; basic requirements, butfor raising standards and to encourage the inventiveness andimagination that are important in the services they provide.
CONFIDENTIALXX   HANDLING COMPLAINTS175,     For the investigation of complaints, each health authority should havearrangements which work well and which command the confidence of the public.Arrangements already exist in most local authorities.   In Executive Councils,there are long-established statutory procedures for investigating complaintsagainst contractor practitioners.   As to the hospitals, the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Secretary of State for Wales set up anindependent committee, in February 1971, with Mr Michael Davies QC, as itsChairman, to undertake a thorough review of their arrangements for handlingcomplaints, to provide the hospital service with practical guidance, andto make recommendations.   The Committee is expected to report later thisyear.176.      But however good the arrangements, some complainants will remaindissatisfied, and it is important that they should feel that they can seek the help of an independent third party.   As already announced, the Governmenthas  therefore decided that a Health Service Commissioner should beestablished to investigate complaints against National Health service authorities.   The full text of the statement which the Secretary of Statefor Social Services made in the House of Commons on 22 February 1972 is reproduced in Appendix II.177*      The appointment of a Health Service Commissioner is an importantextension of the ombudsman principle in the public service.   TheParliamentary Commissioner for Administration was appointed in 1967 witha remit covering Government Departments (including what is now the Departmentof Health and Sooial Security, and the Special Hospitals, but not the national health Service), and the Government has  also announced its intention of introducing a complaints machinery for local government.178.     The legislation necessary to establish the Health Service commissioner will form part of the NHS Reorganisation Bill, but the Commissioner willbe able to start work before the unified service   comes into operation
on 1 April 1974, though until that date his jurisdiction will not extend to health services provided at present by local authorities.   Afterunification, his terms of reference will cover the whole of the NHS, buthe will not investigate complaints that in his opinion relate to theexercise of clinical judgment by doctors and other staff, and he willnot deal with complaints for which statutory procedures already exist(eg those about general medical and dental practitioners, pharmacists andopticians, which will continue to be dealt with under the service committeeprocedure), or which he thinks the complainant could reasonably pursue throughthe courts or before some tribunal.179.      The complainant will have direct access to the Health service commissioner.   The Commissioner will not however investigate a complaint until heis satisfied that the health authority concerned has had a reasonable opportunity to investigate it and reply to the oomplainant who, despite this is still dissatisfied.It is plainly important that the health authority should itself have theopportunity to investigate a complaint about a service for which it is responsible, and in the great majority of cases the internal procedurescan be expected to satisfy the complainant.   It is only when the complainantremains dissatisfied that there may be scope for an investigation by the health Service Commissioner.180.     Complaints to the Health Service Commissioner will not have tobe made by the patient himself, although no doubt most of them will be.There will be cases where the patient is unable to act for himself, andwhen that happens, the complaint may be    made     for him.   This is animportant safeguard for those who, because of the nature of their infirmity,are unable to speak for themselves; it will enable a wrong suffered, forexample, by a mentally handicapped person to be brought to light.   In such case3,the complaint can be made by a relative or friend of the patient or by amember of the hospital staff.
XXI     SPECIAL HOSPITALS*81.        The Secretary of State is directly responsible for the controland management of the special hospitals which are provided under the mental Health Act 1959 for patients detained under that Act who, inhis opinion, require treatment under conditions of special securitybecause of their dangerous, violent or criminal propensitiessThese hospitals receive patients from all parts of England and Wales.In addition to their therapeutic functions, the maintenance of security for the protection of the public is an essential feature of their work.   It is intended that the Secretary of State shallretain direct responsibility for their control and management, but with power to delegate such responsibility to a regional or area health authority or a specially constituted joint health authorityif future developments should make this desirable at any time.The Secretary of State has no present intention of changing thearrangements for direct control by the Department.
XXII    ARRANGEMENTS FOR LONDON182.        The Londoner needs integrated health services, closely associatedwith the personal social and other local authority services, no less thanpeople living elsewhere.   The arrangements in Greater London will thereforehe based on the general regional and area structure adopted for the restof the country.Special features of London area183.        There are however exceptional features in the health and related services in London which call for adjustments to the structure.   Among thesefeatures are the already established pattern of local government boundariesand services, the way in which hospitals - including the very large number ofundergraduate and postgraduate teaching hospitals - are distributed, and the factthat executive councils administer family practitioner services over much widerareas than those of the individual London boroughs.   In recognition of thesefeatures, and taking account of the consultations referred to in paragraph 15 -which are continuing - certain special arrangements will be made in the london area.184.        These special arrangements take account of three important aspectsof the situation in London:(a) London borough boundaries must be used in forming AHAs so thatthere can be collaboration between the NHS and borough services;(b) these boundaries are in the main unrelated to many of theexisting health services, and the natural health districtsoverlap them;(c) some important health services - notably the family praotitionerand ambulance services - need units of administration larger than either the borough or the health district.Special arrangements185.        The special arrangements are these:(a)   There will be four RHAs.   Each is likely to contain territoryinside and outside Greater London, and territory in inner and inouter London. 74CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALan advisory co-ordinating working group will be set up on linessimilar to the Joint Working Group which now exists to advise on hospital services in London.   The group will secure co-ordinatedplanning of facilities for medical and dental teaching and research and the location of regional and sub-regional specialities;Health areas will be formed out of single London Boroughs or groups of boroughs.   The boundaries have not yet been settled.The local authority places on the AHA (which may be more than thefour mentioned in paragraph 98) will be shared between the boroughson an equitable basis;the health districts, each of which will have a community healthcouncil, will have boundaries which will not always follow the borough boundaries within the health area;the Greater London Ambulance Service will not be split up betweenthe RHAs or AHAs but will continue to be administered as asingle unit.It is an accepted aim that each postgraduate teaching hospitalshould become closely associated with other hospitals and health services in its vicinity.   But until this association is closeenough to make ifc desirable for the postgraduate hospital to be administered by the AHA(T), the Secretary of State will, afterconsultation with London University, continue its Board of governors in being for an appropriate transitional period.During this transitional period the Board will continue to beappointed as at present, except that the members now nominated by the RHB will be nominated by the RHA..   The Board will have adirect relationship with and will get its money from the central department,75
CONFIDENTIALFamily practitioner committees186.        Area health authorities and family practitioner committees mustcorrespond on a one-to-one basis in order to get maximum benefit fromintegration of the health services.   This applies as much in Greater london as in the rest of the country.   The replacement of the five executive councils which cover Greater London and parts of the surrounding areas by a different number of family practitioner committees will give rise tocertain practical problems, and the central Department will give all the help it can in overcoming them, in consultation with the interests concerned.Boundaries and patients187.       No part of these special arrangements will prevent Londonerscrossing boundaries to their family doctor or to a hospital outside the health area in which they live.   In London, as in the rest of the country,administrative boundaries will be designed to help, not to hinder the patient 075A
CONFIDENTIALXXIII     RUNNING THE SERVICE UNTIL 1974188. It is important that the NHS should continue to develop withoutany loss of momentum, and that the administrative changes on 1 April 1974should not cause interruption or delay.   This means that all the existinghealth authorities should see their work as going on beyond that date, eventhough they will not themselves continue to exist in their present form.Local health authority services189. The local health authority services have been impressively devolped in recent years.   The new health authorities will be able to take over aflourishing range of community-based services if the pace of development doesnot falter in the period before unification.   The Government has made provisionfor increasing public expenditure on the community health and personal social services.   In the case of family planning, financial support was given for atrebling of expenditure in the years 1971/2 and 1972/3.   Financial terms morefavourable for authorities than in the past for renting health centre premisesto general practitioners have been announced.190. The work of existing staffs of local health authorities - whetheroperational or administrative and whether or not professionally qualified -will increase in importance and scope.   Medical Officers of Health can look forward to greater opportunities in medical administration in the widest sense,and training is being provided (see Section XXTV) to equip them and othermedical administrators to take advantage of these opportunities.   Nursing staffin the community will also have a wider span of work, both in preventive healthwork and in clinical care of patients. ,191. Members and senior officers of most local health authoritiesattended the regional conferences held in late 1971 and early 1972which the Secretary of State for Social Services and his Ministerial76
colleagues held, on the need to ensure that standards of local health servioes and morale and Interests of staff are maintained and strengthened in the interim period.   In February 1972(Circular 13/72), the Secretary of State made a number of recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the local health services withparticular emphasis on deployment of nursing staffs.   Local health authorities were urged, for example, to continue to encourage schemes for theassociation of nursing staff with group general practices and to put intoeffect the recent recommendations about management structure and management training of nursing staff in parallel with what has beenin progress for some time on the hospital side following the Salmonreport.   They were also asked to make wider use of ancillary help andof the skill of SENs so as to enable health visitors and home nurses tobe deployed more effectively.   It is hoped, too, that local health authorities will maintain the impetus already given to the improvementin the standard of equipment and training of the ambulance service.77CO N FIDE N-TIA t
CONFIDENTIALXXIV   PREPARING FOR 1974Joint Liaison Committees192*      There is a great deal of preparatory work to be done if NHSreorganisation is to be carried through smoothly, and without interruptingcontinuity in the provision and development of services for patients.1&apos;93*       The new area and regional authorities will be appointed assoon as possible after the necessary legislation is passed.   They will therefore be in existence, in &quot;shadow&quot; form, for some months before they take over responsibility for administering the NHS from theexisting authorities on 1 April 1974.   They will have much to doin this short time.194*       The task of the shadow authorities will be made easier ifas much preparatory work as possible is done before their appointment.This work will fall largely to the existing NHS authorities.   Itdivides into two main parts.   First there is work that can and shouldbe done by the existing authorities themselves; examples are thepreparation for each new area of statements about existing resources,developments in hand and current forward plans; and about rights,liabilities and endowments to be transferred to the new authoritiesin 1974.   Secondly, there are matters which can be settled only by thenew shadow authorities when they are established in 1973, but on whichpreliminary assessments can be carried out in advance.   Examples arethe pattern of health districts within each new area, and the management structure and the staffing and accommodation requirements.195*      The existing authorities cannot do this work on their own.   they need guidance and help; they must consult together; and their effortsmust be co-ordinated. For these purposes joint liaison committees arein the process of being established.    There    will normally be    0nesuch committee for each new health area, composed of representatives - all or mostof them  senior officers - from each existing authority; and one for each78CONFIDENTIAL
net? health region, composed of representatives of each area joint liason committee and of the HHB.196, These joint liaison committees will work in consultation with similar committees that are being set up for local government reorganisation.They will have a special responsibility for ensuring that NHS staff are fully consulted, and are kept fully informed about NHS reorganisationby their existing employing authorities.Training for reorganisation197* Arrangements have been made and announced for the holding ofintegrated training courses lasting about four weeks, at universities and other centres, to prepare senior staff for their new responsibilities and opportunities.   These courses, and other special courses designedto complement the inter-professional courses, have already started.   Inaddition, it is proposed shortly to arrange a series of short conferencesor seminars for the most senior staff in each region, following publicationof this White Paper; and local arrangements for training will be made bythe joint liaison committees.NHS Staff Commission198* NHS reorganisation will bring together under a single management,staff previously employed by a variety of bodies.   For many, their work willchange little or not at all, except that they will have a new employingauthority.   But there will all the same be problems of redeployment; and theremust be arrangements for filling particular posts under the new authorities.   Itis of the first importance that these matters should be handled - and felt by allconcerned to be handled - with the greatest possible fairness for the staffconcerned.   The Government has already made clear its intention to set up aNHS Staff Commission responsible for advising on the procedures to befollowed for filling posts and on the arrangements for the transfer of staff,and for safeguarding their interests during the period of reorganisation.79

XXV   CONCLUSION202. In the final analysis, health oare depends on the effeotivedelivery at the right time and place of the skills and devotion of thoseproviding the services required.   We are indeed fortunate in this countryin the quality of the staff of our health teams, and we have good reasonto be proud of the achievement of the National Health Service.203.      Nevertheless, no one would claim that it is perfect.   The proposedreorganisation offers the chance to establish a framework within which abetter integrated and improved service can be offered to the public.204,      How in fact will the public benefit from reorganisation?  A moreinformed judgment of priorities will concentrate more of the available resources where they are most needed.   There will be better co-ordinatedprovision for their health and social needs.   Professional skills will be grouped into teams to meet the needs of particular categories of patients- the old, the handicapped, the aoutely ill, mothers and children, the mentally sick .   The community health councils will be a means of ensuring that the service is run with full regard to the public&apos;s views.   Improvedarrangements will be made for enquiring into complaints.205.      Reorganisation will be of equal benefit in helping those who provideor manage health services to improve the quality of care given to the public.The health professions will have the support of a well organised NHS for theexercise of their professional skills and will be freed from some of thefrustrations which the lack of this in the past has caused.Furthermore, they will make an important contribution to the management of the service 1 the governing authorities will include members of the mainhealth professions and will reach their decisions on the basis of advice from strong professional advisory oommittees and from their chief professional
officers.   Those of the professions who are independent contractorswill be strongly represented on special committees for administering theircontractual relationship with the service.206.      The staff of the NHS, including the professional staff, will ina unified service have wider scope and opportunities than is now thecase.   They will be fully consulted about the changes, and care will betaken, by the establishment of a Staff Commission and in other ways, tosafeguard their interests when the changes are being made.207.      The members of the new health authorities, and their administrative staff, will be able to develop comprehensive services without runninginto the artificial administrative barriers which now divide the sectors of what should be a single service.   The administrator will have fullscope for personal initiative within clearly allocated responsibilities.This will give him the satisfaction of being able to do a worthwhile jobwell, of securing value for money and providing a framework and thenecessary support for an efficient and sensitive health servioe.208.      This White Paper proposes a framework which will co-ordinate the many and varied skills of all those who work in the National health service and will focus them on the needs of the individual citizen of thisoountry.

APPENDIX IISTATEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 22 FEBRUARY 1972.BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICESHEALTH SERVICE COMMISSIONERThe Government have decided that there should he a Health service commissioner as part of the arrangements for dealing with complaintsin the National Health Service.   Although the great majority of complaints are satisfactorily dealt with by health authorities, thereare some that the citizen should be able to refer to an entirelyindependent person if he remains dissatisfied with the action takenby the Health Service authority.   A commissioner would serve thisindependent function and would reinforce the rights of those who use the Health Service, without detracting from the responsibilities ofthe Health Service authorities or reflecting on the value of the work done by the staff of the service.There will be a Health Service Commissioner for England, one for wales and one for Scotland, but, initially at least, the three postswill be held by the same person.   This is an important expansion ofthe machinery for the independent investigation of complaints forwhich the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration represents a proven precedent.   It would be premature for the commissioner tobe designated now.   The Government think, however, that the work ofthe Health Service Commissioner and of the Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration should be closely associated, and they recognisethat there are strong arguments for considering whether these postsshould all be held by the same person.   Before reaching a decision onthis, the views of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration will be sought.   Appointment of the commissioner will be by Her Majesty by Letters Patent.   In this and in his tenure of office, he will follow the precedent set by the parliamentary commissioner for Administration, and will enjoy the same degree of independence in carrying out his functions.   The Health service authorities will continue to be responsible for investigating complaintsmade to them, as part of their general management responsibilities.The commissioner will consider only those complaints made by or onbehalf of patients which have already been made to the responsibleauthorities and not been resolved to the complainant&apos;s satisfaction.Complainants, or those acting for them, will in  11 cases deal directly with the commissioner.The commissioner will be responsible for investigating actionstaken by or on behalf of the Health Service authorities where it is claimed that an individual person has suffered injustice or hardshipthrough maladministration, or through a failure to provide necessary rtreatment and care.   He will not, however, deal with complaints fromstaff about their pay and conditions of service, or with complaintsconcerning contracts or other commercial transactions.   Nor will heinvestigate the actions of general medical and dental practitioners,85
pharmacists, ophthalmic medical practitioners and opticians, all ofwhom are not employees of the Health Service but are in contract with it.   A statutory procedure already exists for examining complaintsagainst them, and this will continue, without the involvement of thecommissioner.   In Scotland the commissioner will not deal with complaintsfalling within the jurisdiction of the Mental Welfare Commission.Together with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State forScotland and for Wales, I have had thorough and constructive discussions with representatives of the medical profession about complaints bearing on the relationship between clinicians and patients.   We have decidedthat the commissioner should be precluded from investigating any action taken in the course of diagnosis, treatment or clinical care of an individual patient which, in the commissioner1s opinion, was taken solelyin the exercise of clinical judgment.In cases coming within his jurisdiction, the Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration does not look into complaints when the complainant hasor had a right of appeal to a tribunal or a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law, unless he is satisfied that in the particular circum-stances of the case it is unreasonable to expect the complainant to resortor have resorted to it.   The Health Service Commissioner will follow thesame practice; I would expect that he would need to use his discretion to investigate this type of case only on rare occasions.The procedure under which the Commissioner will conduct investigationswill be similar to that observed by the Parliamentary Commissioner for administration.   He will be required to send a report of the results of investigations to the complainant, to any person complained against andto the responsible health authorities.   He will make an annual report,and may make special reports, to the Secretary of State, who will berequired to lay them before both Houses of Parliament.Legislation will be required to enable the Health service commissioner to be appointed.
MANAGEMENT STUDYINTRODUCTIONThis Appendix outlines, for general information, some ideas being developed inthe study, set up by the Secretary of State   on the detailed managementarrangements in the regions, areas and districts of the reorganised NHS.These management arrangements relate to all that has to be done in the health service - the medical as well as the other functions.   The study is beingcarried out with active participation by staff from various branches of the nhs.   The eventual recommendations   to the Secretary of State   will be thesubject of formal consultation with the interests concerned before decisions are taken.PRINCIPLES2.   The ideas on management arrangements are being developed in accordancewith principles stated in the Consultative Document.   The principles are:2.1   that there is to be a fully integrated health service inwhich every aspect of health care is provided,so far as is possible,locally and according to the needs of the people.2.2   &quot;that throughout the new administrative structure there should bea clear definition and allocation of responsibilities;   that thereshould be maximum delegation downwards, matched by accountabilityupwards;   and that a sound management structure should be createdat all levels.&quot;   (Consultative Document, paragraph 6).3.   The management arrangements are being designed to fit within the organisational framework described in outline in the Consultative document and in more detail in the main body of the White Paper.   The salient features are:3.1   Delegation downwards (with corresponding accountability upwards)from the Secretary of State to Regional Health Authorities (RHA),and from the Regional Health Authorities to Area Health Authorities (AHA).AHASwill be accountable to the RHA and the RHA will be accountable to theSecretary of State for the effectiveness and efficiency of the services provided.3.2   Area Health Authorities coterminous geographically with the newlocal authorities which are being set up outside London.87Appendix III
4.   Two further principles have guided the study in the development of management arrangements:4.1   The clinical autonomy of doctors and dentists responsible forthe diagnosis and treatment of patients must be fully preserved.4.2   To allow for the exercise of professional discretion in their work,professional people are most suitably managed by members of theirown professions.5.   The study has also taken into account the changes recommended in organisation and processes for the Central Department, the proposals madeby the Hunter Working Party on medical administrators and the deliberationsof the Working Party one collaboration with local government.ACCOUNTABILITY BETWEEN AUTHORITIES6.   It is proposed to achieve delegation downwards with accountability upwardsbetween levels of statutory authority with the help of a planning and monitoringprocess.   This processf mentioned in various places in the White Paper,would be more systematic than now exists and cover much more thanjust capital planning.7.   The purpose of planning is to ensure that major decisions, includingresource allocations, are made by statutory authorities in advance in thelight of available facts and after examining alternative courses.    implementation of the decisions can then be delegated, and monitored against the plans.- -8.   The process would consist of an annual planning cycle updating a rollingten-year plan - a four-year plan based on notified financial targets and aless detailed projection for a further six years.   During the cycle decisions would be made by the statutory authorities at Area and Region and by theCentral Department after a process of critical appraisal and agreement at each level. /9.   Plans would be formulated for the Area and its operational districts withinpolicy guidance put forward by the Central Department and the statutory NHSauthorities.   This guidance would consist of-9*1   A summary of the policy statements made during the year, settingpriorities between them.9.2   An indication of the likely availability of resources for each Region.9.3   Suggested target standards of care and service provision.
10.      The plans for district health services should be based on a consideration^in the light of the resources available, of the needs of people for health care of various kinds. Programmes for meeting needs should be drawn up for &quot;patientgroups&quot; - such us the mentally ill,   the handicapped, the elderly, mothers andchildren - as well as for preventive work and for those acutely ill and in need of primary care (through the family practitionerservices) or secondary care (through the hospital and specialist services).   these programmes should be translated into operational plans for health services thatwould include targets for performance and budgets for money, manpower and other resources.   In this way it should be possible to provide more continuity of carefor individual patients - in prevention, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation -and to effect changes in the balance of care (from hospital to community)more readily than is possible under the present system in which the shape of services tends to be determined rather by the institutional framework withinwhich they are provided than by objective .appraisal of means of meeting needs.11.      The AHA would pull together plans for its districts with plans for Area-wideservices and ensure that they are co-ordinated with the plans of the matchinglocal authorities for complementary services.   The RHA would be responsible for developing strategic plans and priorities, for planning services and medicalspecialties that need a wider than Area approach and for ensuring that Area plans are balanced in terms of resources usage and standards of provision.12.      Performance would be monitored by higher levels against the plans in termsof spending against budgets, achievement of operating targets, and completionof planned activities.   As one means of monitoring performance, and to giveimproved financial and budgetary control, a new accounting system is being developed which will relate expenditure to the functions and services provided, and require budgets for each to be controlled bymanagement.   The system will also serve the planning process by providing someanalysis of costs by patient groups.AREA ORGANISATION: DISTRICTS13.      The size of Areas has been determined by the need to establish effectiveplanning and operational links with the matching local authorities which are toprovide related services.   Areas vary between some with a population of around200 thousand and several with a population of well over 1 million.   Indevising an organisational structure, the district has been taken as the unitwithin which each AHA should seek to integrate services operationally.   Thedistrict is seen as a geographic unit within which it is possible to satisfy the greater part of the populations health care needs.   The district wouldbe small enough for professional representative machinery to be effective within it, it should contain at least one district general hospital or its equvalentand it would usually have a population of between 200,000 and 500,000.   The
present distribution of district general hospitals and of groups of hospitalsfulfilling that function indicates that about one in three of the Areas outside london will consist of a single district,  another one in 3 will have 2 districts,and of the rest only 4 areas will have as many as 5 districts.   The variationswill be reflected in the organisational arrangements.14.   Operational activities will be largely decentralised to districts, andit is within the district organisation that those practitioners with clinicalautonomy must come together with other professions to organise and providefor the delivery of health services.   The district organisation is thereforebeing designed to1^.1   Achieve integration of all health services available within it14.2   Bring the representatives of the medical profession and the heads of services together to fflake the important districtdecisions jointly.--14.3   Enable district officers to participate not only in the running of services but in helping to shape them.15*   Methods of achieving accountability for activities within a district willdiffer according to whether the activity is organised in15.1   a &quot;hierarchical&quot; system (eg. nursing, administration, medicaladministration, hospital pharmacy) in which the staff are organised by rank and act on the authority of those of higher rank who are appointed as their superiors.15.2   a non-hierarchical system (hospital consultants *nd contractorsfor family practitioner services).16.   Non-hierarchically organised professions will co-ordinate their activities through different forms of representative machinery.   The arrange-ments will differ according to whether the professional people who carry it out have16.1   a contract of employment (eg. consultants working in hospitals) or16.2   contract for services with the Family Practitioner Committee(contractors for general medicaldental and ophthalmic servicesand for pharmaceutical services) .In either case the arrangements for co-ordination with other services shouldtake the form of representative committees.   In the case of contractors, theobject would be to enable them to contribute their ideas to plans for services in the district and, by giving them an insight into the agreed plans, to
adapt their own work accordingly.   In the case of consultants, there would be thefurther object of co-ordinating their demands on resources in accordance withthe plans for services within the Area.These objects^could be achieved by organisation in dividions according toclinical specialties along lines already successfully adopted in the hospital service (&quot;Cogwheel&quot;).17.   The heads of the hierarchically organised services and representatives of the non-hierarchically organised professions would cometogether as a district management team (DMT).   The DMT would ensure that plans and activities within the district are co-ordinated.   This team mightconsist of17.1   Two elected medical representatives - one from the specialists,one from the general practitioners, acting as the link with non-hierarchically organised members of the medical and dentalprofession.17.2   A medical officer (community physician) accountable for the assessment of community health needs, for the surveillance of thedistrict wide provision of health care, for the working of teamsfor patient groups and for some services to local authorities.17*3   A nursing officer responsible for the management of the nursing services both inside and outside hospitals17*4   A finance officer responsible for providing the districtmanagement team and others with the necessary financialinformation, guidance and advice.17.5   An administrator responsible for administrative co-ordination and support both for the team itself and throughout the districtincluding all institutional services.Other heads of services would attend meetings when matters affecting their services were to be discussed and in a district with undergraduate medicalteaching responsibilities a representative of the medical school would be amember of the team.18.   The team would be a consensus group, that is, all decisions it makeswould have to be unanimous. It would therefore need to be co-ordinated,preferably by appointment or election of one of its members as chairman.In cases where agreement cannot be reached, matters would have to be referredto higher authority.   The team would thus have operational control of districtservices.   It would be responsible for.achieving objectives-according-to agreedplans and would have budgetary .responsibilites.&apos;19.      Within the district, teams drawn from the professions concerned would work together to ensure that plans are prepared that ensure integration of all services.CONFIDENTIAL
Teams to prepare programmes for &quot;patient groups&quot; could be formed ofrepresentatives from specialist care, general practitioners, medical officers,nurses both in hospital and outside, paramedical, and social workers,administrators, etc. Other teams could look at the development of preventivecare services, primary care services, and acute specialties.   In this wayplans could be based on a determination of needs and could include contributions from all the professions and services concerned.The community physician would have an important role to play in this work -in identifying opportunities for improvement in the provision of services;in helping to ensure continuity of care as patients move between different sections of the service; in assisting in the co-ordination of patient groupteams; and in helping to co-ordinate the work of the health authority andthe social services authority.AREA ORGANISATION:   AREA STAFF20.      In an Area with two or more districts, Area staff would be required toput together Area plans, to manage services to be provided to the districts,eg supplies, to provide the secrerariat of the Authority and the FPC and toprovide services to the matching Local Authority.   Some of the Area staff wouldgive professional and technical direction to staff in districts where operational control is exercised through the district management teams.   Area staff who wereprofessional heads would undertake some of the personnel management of professionalstaff in the districts.   In the larger Areas the RRA could delegate to the ABA,for management by Area staff, some functions which the RHA would usually provideas a service to smaller Areas.21.      The chief officers of the Area staff, would co-ordinate their activitiesby coming together as a team.   The Area team would consxst of:21.1   A medical officer, responsible for organising the provision of professional advice to the AHA and its officers, for general relations with the medical staff under contract of employment and for services to the matching local authority.21.2   A nursing officer responsible for providing advice on nursingmatters to the AHA and its officers, for communicating policyio nurses in districts and for organising education and training facilities for nurses in the Area and for ensuring the provisionof nursing services to the matching Local Authority.21.3   A finance officer, responsible for providing advice on allfinancial matters to the AHA and its officers, co-ordinatingpreparation of the financial estimates, preparing the statutoryaccounts, providing
accountancy and cashier services, control systems and financialinformation to management, measuring expenditure against agreedbudgets, and providing financial supervision and internal auditfor financial propriety.21.^   An administrator, responsible for administrative co-ordination and support for the team itself and throughout the Area, for providing support to other officers in their personnel management and planning functions, for some services delivered on an Area widebasis such as supplies, ambulance, etc, and for secretariatservices to the AHA, the Family Practitioner Committee andother committees in the Area.22.   Heads of services not included in the team would attend meetings when matters affecting their services were to be discussed.    Those who were headsof professions would also have access-to-the AHA and its Chairman.23.   In an Area which was not divided Into districts, the Area Team would alsoperform the functions of the BMT, joined by the elected medical representative,members and - if with teaching responsibilities - by a representative of themedical school.italy.   The district teams would be accountable for operational services withindistricts, either through the Area Team of officers or directly to the AHA.The arrangement to be adopted might depend on such factors- as the size ofthe Area and the number of districts in it.   The lines of accountabilitywould need to be clearly set out in job descriptions.REGIONAL ORGANISATION25.   As at Area, so at Region, there would be a team of officers accountable tothe RHA for the co-ordination of work delegated to officers.    This team wouldbe responsible for Regional planning, for allocation of resources, for monitoringAHAs&apos;performance, and for delivering certain services, such as blood transfusionservices, on a regional basis.   A proportion of the RHA&apos;a staff will be engagedin architectural and engineering design and quantity surveying for the capitalworks programme for the Region and providing professional support to Areas for building and engineering maintenance and operation.   To co-ordinate these activities, both for new works and for maintenance, it is proposed that thereshould be a works officer   appointed to each Region who would be a member ofthe Regional Team.
26.   The team might accordingly consist of:26.1   A medical officer, responsible for organising theprovision of professional advice to the RHA and its officersand for communicating policy to medical officers in Areas.26.2   A nursing officer responsible for providingadvice on nursing matters to the RHA and its officers and for communicating policy to nursing officers in Areas.26.3   A works officer, responsible for the direction and co-ordination ofbuilding, engineering and quantity surveying. -   -26.4   A finance officer responsible for providing financial advice tothe RHA and its officers, and for co-ordinating financialpractice and systems throughout the Areas.26.5   An administrator responsible for administrative co-ordination and for adminsitrative support to the RHA and its officers and for some services provided on a regional b?sis.Heads of services not included in the teams would attend meetings of theteam when   matters affecting their services were to be discussed, and thosewho were heads of professions would have access to the RHA and its chairman.27.   The capital building programme for the Region would be one of the products of the comprehensive planning process outlined in paragraphs 7-11 above.Thus the need for new buildings will be identified and examined alongsideall other possible potential measures for improvement of services.   For eachproject included in the programme a team (Project Team), including doctors and nurses, would be set up to brief the designers.   The Project Teams would draw upon advice from staff belonging to the AHAs concerned.28.   RHA officers would not have direct authority over the AHA or its officers.    They would however   have monitoring responsibilities and beauthoritative spokesmen for the RHA in their own fields.   As such theywould be able to interpret RHA policy to AHA officers, subject toresolution between the RHA and AHA of any conflicts.Department of Health and Social security london  SB123 June 1972
