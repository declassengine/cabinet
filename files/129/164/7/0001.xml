CP(72) 82 COPY NO        8524 July 1972CABINETFURTHER PROVISION FOR HEATING IN THE supplementary benefits scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. At their meeting on 13 July (CM(72) 36th Conclusions, Minute 5)the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum on my proposal toinclude in the supplementary benefits scheme a special additional paymenttowards winter heating costs.2,        There is mounting public and Parliamentary criticism thatsignificant numbers of supplementary pensioners are cold in winter and suffer much misery because they cannot afford to heat themselvesadequately.    This criticism is not confined to our opponents, though theyvoiced it strongly during the debate on the Second Reading of the national insurance Uprating Bill.    The Opposition will however focus on inadequateprovision for heating as a token of a mean and indifferent Government.The present provision and the October improvements are described inthe appendix to this note, but I do not think that these improvements willbe substantial enough to rest on next winter in view of the heavy pressure which now seems likely to develop on heating.    The next all-round increasein benefits is not due until November 1973 and price increases afterOctober this year will be used to discredit our promise to protect themost vulnerable next year.3.        In preparation for next winter I am arranging for local authoritiesand voluntary bodies to help identify old people with heating needs, so thatthe Supplementary Benefits Commission can consider helping in cash under their discretionary powers and local authorities can consider improvingliving conditions.    Since however the new local authority social service departments are still findihg their feet it is clear that, next winter at least,there will still be many people at risk who may be entitled to special help with heating costs under the supplementary benefits scheme but will not receive it because they cannot be identified.    &quot;We shall therefore still bevulnerable on this score.    For this reason and those given in paragraph 1,we need to consider the possibility of increasing the general supplementary benefit provision for heating.
FORM OF PAYMENT4.        I propose that the extra provision should consist of a lump sum payment intended as a general contribution towards winter heating costs.The alternative would be an additional weekly payment for a defined numberof weeks.    But this would be interpreted as a tacit admission that the scalerates themselves were inadequate! would be very difficult to explain toclaimants when added to the already complicated provisions described inthe appendix;  and would involve substantial extra work for my Departmentsalready hard-pressed local offices.    A lump sum on the other hand would beless apt to prompt criticism of the scale rates; would help meet fuel billsas they fell due; and would be generally simpler to understand and administer,AMOUNT AND SCOPE OF PAYMENT5.        I propose that the payment should be  10.    To meet the need it could not be much less, but it could not be much more without upsettingthe relativities within the supplementary benefits scheme described above.It should broadly speaking be made to all recipients of supplementary benefit who receive the long-term addition, that is, to supplementarypensioners and to those under pension age such as the chronically sick and single-parent families who have been on benefit for at least two years.We could not justify withholding the payment from long-term beneficiariesunder pension age whose heating needs were as great as those over pension age.    But we can exclude supplementary pensioners in residential accommodation, since they do not have to meet heating costs.    Thepayment would be made to all who were within the defined categoriesat any time during the &quot;winter&quot; period November to March.NUMBERS AND COST6. On this basis the lump sum payment would be made to about1.9 million supplementary pensioners and about 300,000 beneficiariesunder pension age.    The cost would be  22 million.    No extra staff wouldbe needed; the work would be done by overtime and casual recruitment,7.        I can offer no savings from the social security programme to offset the extra cost.    Indeed, I believe the programme already makesinsufficient provision for improvement in the level of benefits andin other respects,    I shall need to pursue this in the later stages of the public expenditure review,LEGISLATION AND TIMING8,        A short Bill (probably of two or three clauses) would need to be enacted very speedily at the beginning of the new parliamentary session.    Payments could then begin towards the end of November (ifthey are to serve their purpose acceptably they ought not to start muchlater than this) and would be completed by the middle of February,    Inorder however to allow time for the administrative preparations to be set in hand I must seek a decision at this stage of the public expenditure review,
FUTURE prospects . After next winter the position may be different in some respects.We should be able to improve progressively the identification of people at risk and see that they have the help they need.    But once we had the powerto make lump sum payments of this kind it would be very difficult to avoid a repeat exercise at least in any year in which there was not a generousgeneral benefit uprating in relation to price movements.    Indeed thepossibility of making a lump sum supplementary benefit payment for heatingwould be one of the factors to be taken into account in our uprating policy.CONCLUSION10.       The Home and Social Affairs Committee have considered my proposals and were attracted by the general arguments in favour of them,though they considered that it would be preferable to present them as an extra winter allowance rather than as a provision specifically for heatirg.From the political point of view I believe that my proposals command ahigh degree of priority, and I therefore seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval ofthem.K department of Health and Social Security24 July 1972
APPENDIXPROVISION FOR HEATING- IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFITS SCHEMEProvision is made for all normal heating requirements in the supplementary benefit scale rates, which from October will he  6*55 a week for asingle house-holder and  10.65 a week for a married oouple (representinginoreases of 75p and  1.20 a week).   Rent is paid in addition.   Thelong-term addition (LTA) of (from October) 60p a week and 85p for the over 80s (an increase of 10p a week) is payable on top of the scalerate8 to pensioners and other long-term recipients of supplementary benefit.  From October the scale rates plus the LTA will amount to 7.15 a week for a single householder ( 7*40 for the over 80s) and 11.25 a week for a married couple ( 11*50 where one of the oouple is over 8^).   The LTA is intended to help with regular extra expenses,and some or all of it may he available towards the cost of extra heating.Where there is a special need for extra heating because of poor health,bad accommodation (or a combination of both) or because the claimanthas to use an expensive form of heating, a discretionary exceptional circumstances addition (ECA) can he made.   The SBC have recentlywidened the criteria of entitlement to EC As for heating and from october the rates of EGA will he 30p, 60p and 90p a week (an inoreaseof 20 per cent on each rate) depending on the severity of the case.Where the LTA is in payment the first 50p of EGAs (75p for the over80s) is subsumed in the LTA, so that only reokonable expense above this amount attraot an ECA.
