UNITED KINGDOM PASSPORT HOLDERS IN UGANDANote by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord President of the council. After discussion with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer I have had the attached memorandum prepared in order to focus for my colleagues the principal aspects of thesituation which confronts us and the main decisions which we have to take.It falls into the following broad sections:-a. The scale of the immediate problem and the current positionas regards our efforts to deal with it.b. The steps which we have taken, and are taking, to make it more manageable, both by concerted international action (including an effort to arrange for the resettlement of many of the Asians inother countries) and by direct pressure on President Aminhimself.c. The problems, mainly domestic, which will confrontus if our efforts under b. have only limited success and we are compelled to accept a large number of Ugandan Asians in thiscountry.d. The implications of such a decision in the longer term,which may require us to rethink the whole of our immigration policy.2.        The decisions required under each of these heads are indicated at the appropriate points,    I would ask my colleagues, in consideringthem, to bear in mind that we are dealing with a man, in the person of president Amin, who is fundamentally irrational and unreliable.    Wecannot tell how he will react if he thinks that we are provoking him too far; and here it is relevant to remember that we have substantial interestsin Uganda and that some 7,000 British subjects (&quot;belongers&quot;) are atpresent in that country.    But considerations of this kind, which mightCOPY NO65CP(72). 916 September 1972CABINET
suggest that we should do all that reasonably can to help President Amin to extricate himself without too much loss of face from the position which hehas created, have to be weighed not only against the criticism which we arealready attracting from our own supporters for what they regard as our&quot;softness&quot; in dealing with the Ugandan Government but also against therisk that, if we are in fact too &quot;soft&quot; and encourage other countries to suppose that they can deal with a similar problem in the same way, wemay create a situation in this country which, in both political and socialterms, we simply could not control.R home Office6 September 1972
UNITED KINGDOM PASSPORT HOLDERS IN UGANDAI.    introduction. On 18 August the Home Secretary issued the following statement:-&quot;The Government have considered the position of the UnitedKingdom passport holders (UKPH) in Uganda in the light of the discussions the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had recently with the President ofUganda.    As the Government have already made clear, the United kingdom has a responsibility for the holders of United Kingdom passports issued in east Africa.    This includes an obligation to admit them to the UnitedKingdom if they are expelled from their country of residence.In the extreme situation created by the Government of Uganda,our first responsibility is to see that our passport holders receive fairtreatment; to ensure, if possible, that they are able to remain in theircountry of residence;  and that if the Government of that country will not allow them to do this, they are given adequate time and facilities to move to the country of their choice and do not have to come to the United kingdom under duress.Mr Rippon explained to President Amin the British governments attitude in these terms.    The Governments aim, in co-operation withother countries whose interests are also involved, will now be to ensurethat the Government of Uganda will see that the UKPH in their countryreceive the fair treatment which is their due.    This means that if theyare expelled they must have time to settle their affairs in an equitableway and to take out their possessions;   President Amin has given specificassurances on these points.The staff of the High Commission in Uganda is being reinforcedimmediately for two purposes.    The first is to establish the identity and number of UKPH and in this context the Government wish to make it clearthat they accept responsibility only for UKPH and the dependants as definedunder normal immigration rules.    The second purpose is to seek toarrange with the Uganda Government that those who are entitled to come here should be enabled to do so in an orderly way and with proper regardto their interests.Discussions are taking place with a number of Commonwealth andother countries with the aim of ensuring that those UKPH who wish to goto countries other than Britain ahould be allowed to do so.The Government are proposing to establish a Board with responsibility for the resettlement of those who come to Britain.It will be necessary to ensure that the transfer of passport holdersdoes not impose an excessive strain on community relations in thiscountry or housing, schools and other facilities in particular areas.
The active co-operation of local authorities and of voluntary bodies,including the representatives of immigrant communities already in theUnited Kingdom, will be sought.This is a problem we are determined to handle in a humane and orderly way&quot;,2, Earlier estimates put the total of Asian UKPH in Uganda at 50, 000people.    This may have been too high.    It appears that a number of UKPHhave left Uganda in the last year or two, probably to go to India, withoutnotifying us.    In the first five days only 1,110 families came forward ofI, 567 called, and the average size of family (three) was lower than expected.    The result was that only 3,372 people were cleared for admission to the United Kingdom against an earlier estimate of 7, 500,But this first sample may have been exceptional,3,        Apart from the UKPH, there are thought to be some 6, 000 Asianswith Indian and Pakistani citizenship, and a further 23, 000 who claimUgandan citizenship.    The Ugandans are trying to reduce the numberof their citizens to a minimum - perhaps as low as 5, 000,    The remainderwill then presumably be stateless.II. DIPLOMATIC ACTIONa.   With the Ugandan government, When President Amin saw our High Commissioner on 9 August andconveyed his ultimatum (that the 80, 000 (sic) UKPH in Uganda must beremoved within three months) Mr Slater, speaking on instructions, saidthat this decision would lead to pressure on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to review the whole field of Anglo/Ugandan relations, including economic relations.    He also delivered a personal message from the Prime Ministerwhich included the following passage:&quot;I feel bound to make it clear to you that a decision to expel UKPHfrom your country as abruptly as this would cause a very strong reaction in Britain,    There is already very heavy pressure on the Government totake some countervailing action and relations between our two countries can hardly fail to be seriously damaged&quot;.5.        During his visit to Kampala in mid-August Mr Rippon wrote to president Amin reminding him that the British Government had the right and duty to protect UKPH wherever they lived.    When he saw the President,he reminded him that, though he had not come to threaten or cajole, therehad been questions in the House of Commons about aid to Uganda and thatthe British Government had stated that they would keep the situation underreview.
6. The High Commissioner has on several occasions reminded theUgandan Government of their responsibility for the safety of all Britishsubjects in the country.    The most recent reminder was given orally on  September.7.        In addition we have approached the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations, the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees and a large number of other Governments, requesting them to use their influence to the same end.    President Nyerere has spoken up in public and the Sudanese have intervened in private.    But otherwise internationalopinion has hardly reacted.8. Moreover, although the processing operation in the high commission has gone smoothly and the staff have been substantiallyreinforced, the Ugandan administration has been unsatisfactory.    AsianUKPH have run into three main difficulties:a. There has been no official announcement about what theAsians can take out with them, or how much they can remitthereafter.    Despite assurances given to Mr Rippon (by theMinisters concerned) that there would be no confiscation andthat the disposal of properties would be orderly, families arein practice only allowed to take out Shs. 1, 000.    The HighCommissioner is pressing for a clear statement on transfer ability.b. Asians are being forced to sell centrally under Governmentarrangements.   We do not know how these arrangements work or what prices they are getting.c. There are reports of molestation and forced levies; but theHigh Commissioner considers these to have been exaggerated.b.    With other Governments9. We have also been in touch with more than 50 foreign and commonwealth Governments to seek their help in accepting Asiansfor settlement or in other ways.10.       Early contact was made with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.In terms of numbers much the most important of the three is India.We have asked the Indian Government to consider extending to Ugandathe system (at present applicable only to Kenya) under which they acceptinto India UKPH whose passports are endorsed to show that they will beadmitted to the United Kingdom.    Mrs Gandhi has replied non-committallybut has agreed to talk.   It is proposed to brief our High Commissioner,who is now on leave in this country and will be returning to New Delhi atthe end of this week, to pursue the matter further.   In the light of had discussions it may be necessary to consider whether a Minister should visit New Delhi,
11.        Early approaches were made to the Canadian, Australian and NewZealand Governments,    The Canadians made a generous response.     Weare pressing the Australian and New Zealand Governments to follow suit.We have been in touch with 15 other Commonwealth and 27 foreign government.    The only substantial offer of help, other than the Canadian,has come from Malawi, where President Banda has offered to take 1,000 or1, 500 Asians.    There have been other offers, or half promises, to taketoken numbers.    We have been in touch with the Aga Khan, who has told us that he is confident that, given time, he wiU he able to settle all theIsmailis from Uganda (about 10,000) outside Britain,    These approachesare being followed up.12.       In the United Nations, the C^cretary-General has undertaken to send a personal emissary (Dr Robert Gardiner) to talk to President Amin.    Weshould know the outcome shortly.    We are also instructing our permanent representative to raise the Ugandan question at the session of the Economicand Social Council starting on 12 September,    This is the quickest way toget the item on the agenda of the Assembly, where the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary will be speaking on 27 September and maytable a draft Resolution,13.        The possibility of taking the dispute to the International Courtis also under consideration.14.        The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has undertaken to do what he can to help.    But his interest is in those Asians who areeventually found to be stateless and he can therefore only help us indirectly.
5SECRET15.       Some Asians will travel directly to host countries other than theUnited Kingdom.    But others willing to settle elsewhere may have tocome to the United Kingdom first and will need the means to go on.    Tomake this possible it has been proposed that the United Kingdom should beprepared to pay travel expenses from the United Kingdom to the hostcountry.16.       Next, it has been proposed that we should help financially with the resettlement of Asians in developing host countries which may not havethe resources to receive large numbers of migrants who will be virtuallypenniless.    Such prospective host countries fall into two main groups.By far the most important in the first group will be India, from wheremost Asian UKPH in Uganda or their forebears originally came.    pakistan and Bangladesh, also in the sub-continent, would probably be willing totake small numbers.    The second group consists of the countries of latin america, who have shown an initial sympathetic interest in taking someAsian UKPH.    It seems clear from first contacts that a favourable response from the countries of the second group will largely depend on whether resettlement aid of some kind will be forthcoming either from theUnited Kingdom or from the international community.17.       In the countries of both groups - and here Malawi should probably also be included, although Dr Banda has not made any bid for assistance -the host Governments will almost certainly be put to some expense overthe selection and reception of the UKPH who eventually come to them,quite apart from their establishment where necessary in some kind oflivelihood.18.       It is also likely that a financial inducement will encourage to settleelsewhere a substantial number of UKPH who otherwise would come to britain.    Three possible ways of meeting these costs are discussed below.19.       The first suggestion, made with particular reference to India, isthat the High Commission at Kampala might be authorised to offer toUKPH willing to go to India a resettlement grant of, say,  2, 000 a familypayable on arrival in Bombay, provided that the beneficiaries were willing to apply to the Government of India for permission to settle therepermanently and to acquire Indian nationality, renouncing citizenship ofthe United Kingdom and Colonies at the same time.20.       The advantages of this scheme would be:-a. That each beneficiary&apos;s and his family1 s rights to cometo the United Kingdom would be extinguished.b. That the lump sum payment to each family could well becheaper than the initial cost of settling them in the UnitedKingdom.
21.       The disadvantages of this proposal appear to be:-a. That, in the judgment of the High Commission at New Delhi,while the Government of India might be persuaded to accept UKPHtechnically &quot;in transit&quot; to the United Kingdom although they knew that some 80 per cent in fact intended to settle permanently inIndia and would acquire Indian nationality in due course, theywould be most unlikely to agree to a public commitment at thisstage to accept large numbers of UKPH expelled from Ugandafor permanent settlement now.    The main reason for this is thatthe Government of India maintain in public the position that india has a population problem of great magnitude and cannot for thisreason afford to become a country of immigration.b. That the arrangement could be open to criticism becausethe sum would not vary according to the profession, trade orcircumstances of the head of family concerned - ie a doctor oran accountant would receive the same lump sum payment as asmall trader or other semi-skilled man, with the result that itwould not be attractive to a cross section of the UKPH but onlyto the poorer sort.c. That the lump sum would probably have to be uniformirrespective of the family&apos;s final destination.     2, 000 would bemuch more attractive in Malawi than even in India and yet mightbe barely adequate for a professional man in the Argentine.We should inevitably be pressed to standardise on the highestfigure.d. That the scheme could prompt other Governments withnumbers of UKPH in their territories to eject them.e. That it would be difficult to justify making lump sumpayments to those going from Uganda to India in exchange forrenunciation of their British citizenship while continuing to withstand Mr Enoch Powell&apos;s argument that immigrants already in the United Kingdom should be paid to leave.    This was a pointof great difficulty in last year&apos;s debates on immigration legislation.22.       The second suggestion is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should offer financial assistance to host Governments receiving numbers ofUKPH either in the form of some addition to their existing allocations of aid or, where we do not give aid, by help in financing an ad hocresettlement programme.    This aid or assistance would need to be in theform of grants and not of loans.    It would have to cover the mainexpenditure of host countries on the UKPHj and it could include the costof grants or advances made by them to individual families to help to setthem up in a profession or trade.6
a. That it would be possible to classify   these payments asaid, although it is unlikely that all the sums which would berequired could be found within this years aid programme.b. That grants to individuals would become theresponsibility of the host Government who would be better ableto judge what amounts would be appropriate in local circumstances.c. That Her Majesty&apos;s Government would not be open to the accusation of being willing to pay their nationals to renouncetheir citizenship.24.       The disadvantages are:-a. That, because the scheme would be financed by blockpayments between Governments rather than by individualpayments to heads of families as in paragraph 19 above, we might pay more per unit family for this type of settlement.b. That it would not carry with it any guarantee that thebeneficiaries would settle permanently in host countries andrenounce their British nationality.25.       The third suggestion, which is an alternative to the first twosuggestions (and could be a supplement to the second) but applies only toemigration of UKPH to countries in Latin America, is that we should accept the tentative offer of the Intergovernmental Committee for european Migration (ICEM) to draw up a programme for the selection and settlement of UKPH in a number of countries in Latin America,possibly including Brazil, Uruguay and the Argentine.    ICEM have long experience in this field.    The United States Government have told us that they would be willing to make a considerable contribution to anyprogramme for settling Asians expelled from Uganda in Latin Americawhich the Committee might be asked to draw up.    Other countriesmembers of ICEM might also be willing to help financially;  and theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution would therefore be proportionatelysmaller.26.       Decisions are needed on the following points:-a. Whether the United Kingdom should be prepared to paythe travel expenses from the United Kingdom to the hostcountry of UKPH arriving here but willing to settle in third countries.b. Whether individual grants should be paid to UKPH fromUganda in consideration of their settling in third countries and being willing to renounce their United Kingdom nationality assoon as possible thereafter.7_fiFf.RFT__
c. Whether, as an alternative to b. agreements   -should bemade by the United Kingdom with host Governments as appropriate to contribute towards programmes of resettlement for UKPH fromUganda, including the allocation of resettlement grants to families in need of them.d. Whether we should explore further the possibility of using the services if ICEM to devise and operate a programme forresettlement of UKPH in certain countries of Latin America.IV.    DIRECT PRESSURE ON UGANDA27.       The major British interests at risk in Uganda are:-a. about 7, 000 United Kingdom &quot;belongers&quot;, consisting of2, 000 heads of families and 5, 000 dependants.    About 1, 100are aid personnel;  and of these the large majority are teachers,who are on contract to the Ugandan Government from whom they receive their basic salary, with supplementation from the UnitedKingdom Government.    Though the main concentration is inKampala, many are scattered in remote parts of the country.b. British investments in Uganda are currently estimated at 30 million.    The most important sectors are banking andplantations.    Uganda provides a market from some  16 millionworth of British exports per annum; but we import about 20 million from Uganda.c. We have at risk some  50 million in possible claims onECGD and other Ugandan liabilities.d. If Uganda were to default on its remaining obligations inrespect of pensions, thi3 could cost us up to  200, 000 a year.28.       The only measures of retaliation which we have taken so far havebeen to suspend action on the  10 million loan and to stop making newappointments of technical assistance staff.    If we want to take furthersanctions, the following steps are open to us:-Capital Aida. To stop payment of money ( 1.4 million) committed fromearlier loans but not yet spent, leaving the projects uncompleted.This would hit British suppliers, since part of the payment wouldbe for British goods and services.b. To freeze the uncommitted balance ( 300, 000) of past aidloans.    This, and about  500, 000 from the frozen  10 millionloan, would represent the only savings available from aidcutbacks in 1972-73.
c. Not to recruit any new technical assistance personnel for service in Uganda.d. To withdraw supplementation from existing personnel.This costs about  1.7 million a year; but the cost ofcompensating and resettling the individuals would far outweighthis.e. To offer no further places for civilian (or military)trainees from Uganda in the United Kingdom.Other Sanctionsf. To freeze Uganda&apos;s sterling balances  5- 6 million).g. To withdraw the British Army Training Team.h. To stop deliveries of armoured vehicles.    28 more are due to be delivered between now and March, though there willin any case be delays, eg because of payments difficulties.j.       To advise tourist agencies that British tourists should avoid Uganda.    The Americans have already taken actionon these lines.29.       Of the above measures d. ,  f. and g. would have the most directimpact on President Amin and are therefore the most likely to provokeserious repercussions in Uganda.    There would be other disadvantages in taking these steps.    We should have fired our only effective shotsbefore seeing whether the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-Generaland others would have any effect.      We might lose much of theinternational goodwill and sympathy we have earned so far.    But themain disadvantage would be that we might well have to get the Asians outin more difficult conditions, and probably more quickly; we might also have to evacuate our own &quot;belongers&quot;.    In other words we should belikely to produce the opposite result to that which we had been aiming at.We might well wish, however, to take all these steps once all our&quot;belongers&quot; were safely evacuated. &apos;30.       The other steps (a. , b. , c., e. , h. and j) would be unlikely toproduce such dramatic consequences or to provoke a vehement reaction from President Amin.    Action under a., however, would mean that money already spent would be wholly wasted.    The others, although some would have practical drawbacks and might be thought mean andpetty, would have considerable presentational value in this country.    Ifthis is agreed, the High Commissioner could be instructed to explain thereasons for them to President Amin and warn him that, if the situationworsened, we might be compelled to take the more extreme measures.
(It is recognised that, if the security situation did worsen, we should probably have to take more aggressive measures and risk theconsequences. )31.       Decisions are needed on whether, if the objections to implementing the action in paragraph 28a. are accepted, we should implement those at paragraph 28b., c, e. , h. , and j. and warn President Amin that we might find ourselves compelled to take those at paragraph 28d. , f., and g. also.V.    THE DOMESTIC PROBLEM32.       This section of the memorandum deals with the problems oftransport, accommodation, resettlement, etc, which will arise inrelation to those Asians whom we have to admit when we have exhaustedall the possible means of limiting the numbers.Transport33.       The discussion of transport arrangements has so far been confined to the 3, 000 families (originally assumed to number 15, 000persons) whose applications for admission to the United Kingdom hadbeen processed by the High Commission before the present crisis.Air Transport34.       There are at present about 15 scheduled flights a week betweenUganda and London.    These are normally fairly well booked but after15 September they may at the maximum have up to 50 per cent of capacity available for Asians from Uganda.    Not more than a fraction ofthose being expelled (say 900 a week at most) can therefore hope to getaway by this means.35.       Soon after the crisis broke, following a meeting held in confidence at which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the HomeOffice explained the potential problem, a consortium of British airlinecompanies put to the Department of Trade and Industry a proposal thatthey should lift those Asians wishing to come to the United Kingdom.They were told that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have no objectionto their planning for the removal of the first 3, 000 families.    east african Airways (which is owned and run by the East African Community)made it clear, however, that they would not allow any airline other thanthose operating scheduled services to Uganda, ie BOAC, BritishCaledonian and East African Airways, to share in the traffic, except assub-charterers.    Morover they wished to insist that the normalInternational Air Travel Association (IATA) fara:.of  158 should becharged, whereas the British consortium had been prepared to chargea lower fare of  70.    Accordingly the High Commissioner at Nairobiwas instructed at the end of last week to put to the East African Communityaviation authorities the proposal agreed by the three airlines that theyshould jointly handle the extra traffic by providing extra numbers ofscheduled flights and &quot;chartering in&quot; the extra capacity required.    Thelevel of fare still needs to be negotiated between the British and east african authorities.
36.       President Amin, however, has said that only East AfricanAirways may carry the Asians.    Because their management is notnotably efficient and they have no long-haul aircraft to spare, East AfricanAirways are probably incapable of moving anything like this number of passengers by the end of the time limit.    We know that foreign charter of extra aircraft is almost certainly out of the question for East AfricanAirways, since the Kenya Government have refused to put r?p the foreign exchange deposits necessary and tha Uganda Government, even if itwished, very probably could not do so either.37.       Our High Commissioners in Kenya and Tanzania have been authorised to seek support from those Governments for the approach thathas been made to the East African Community civil aviation authorities on the proposals of the scheduled airlines for pooling the traffic.    If wedo not succeed, the consequences will be:-a. We shall not be able to keep track of the movement ofAsians from Uganda to Britain.   Some will get out of Ugandaby scheduled services or impromptu charters to Europeandestinations other than London and will make their way to britain thereafter by air or surface.    In the latter case, theywill fall wholly outside our reception arrangements.    In theformer case they will do so to a large extent.b. There is a strong probability that a  .substantial number ofAsians will be left in Uganda at the end of the 90 days and thatthese will be in danger of molestation or of their lives.38.       We shall of course be able to argue that, if as a result Asianscome to harm, the responsibility is President Amin&apos;s.    If this happensafter we have deployed our best efforts to get him to agree to theestablishment of a tripartite pool arrangement, this would be a whollyadequate defence.    If we had not made every effort to avoid this outcome,we should be open to criticism for not having done so.    But there must,to put it at its lowest, be a chance that an approach to President Aminwould be successful.    This would diminish the risk to the lives of theAsians but would result in their arriving in this country in larger numbers and more quickly.39.       Procedurally the ball is now in the court of the East Africanaviatibniauthorities.    We do not believe that there is yet any very substantial number of Asians who have cleared their papers with both us and the Ugandans:  and for the time being we can wait and aee how theaviation authorities react.    If approval is given for handling this   trafficthrough the tripartite pool we should still, through the licensingmachinery, be able to control the rate at which extra flights wereorganised.    If the proposal for a pool is rejected., we can consider againwhether to make further approaches in East Africa, and elsewhere for a reversal of the decision,11CC/-PCT
40.       President Amin has also made it clear that foreign airlines willnot be able to convert into other currencies the proceeds from ticketssold in Uganda for East African shillings.    The British airlinesconcerned have been offered an informal undertaking that we will help them with the repatriation of their profits.    If the traffic is handled by the pool, we shall have to honour this obligation.    If it does not, the proposal will lapse.41.       Decisions are needed on the following points:-a. The extent to which we should in general be active in:trying to facilitate the removal before the end of the time limit of all those Asians coming to Britain.     The choice is broadlybetween on the one hand doing enough to make it clear that, ifAsians are left behind after the deadline and thereby come toharm, the responsibility and fault is President Amin^ not ours;and, on the other, going beyond this and positively exertingourselves to ensure that all those concerned are brought to britain in an orderly manner before the deadline.b. The number of Asians to whom whatever policy is agreed should apply.    Beyond the 3, 000 families mentioned inparagraph 33 no decision has been taken about the balance(estimated at 35, 000 persons at the maximum).    There seems nological distinction between the two groups.    Indeed, it is arguable that, since the first group comprise those who bydefinition were the more eager to leave Uganda, our obligationis greater towards the other group, who are being expelled against their will.Sea Transport42.       The possibility of bringing Asians to Britain by sea has been examined.    This would have some advantages;  but the numbers who could be lifted in this way within the timescale are relatively so smallthat the difficulty and very high cost of movement by sea rule it out.Transit Arrangements &apos;43.       There may be a need to bring to Britain in transit Asian UKPHgoing to certain other countries.    Any going to India would go direct.The Canadians are intending to make their own arrangements.    But anygoing to South America or to the Continent of Europe may need to stagethrough Britain, where arrangements will have to be made for them to besorted out for onward movement in accordance with whatever may beagreed with the Governments concerned.    It might be best for all thosegoing eastwards, including some of the Ismailis settled by the Aga Khan,to travel direct.
Reception and Resettlement44.       We cannot yet define the scale of the problem we have to face inthis country, either in respect of the numbers to be dealt with or in the timing of their arrival;  this depends on the outcome of the diplomaticactivity described earlier.    But we have thought it right to take as thebasis for our contingency plans the assumption that the first 3, 000families (some 10-15, 000 people) might have to be brought here by theend of September.    This may be an over-estimate in the light of recent information about the rate of clearance by the authorities in Uganda.It is, however, the assumption we have felt bound to make.45.       The Uganda Resettlement Board is in working order and will beready to receive newcomers from the beginning of next week.    The HighCommissioner in Kampala has been asked to inform Asians before theyleave that in a number of named areas in this country they would facegreat difficulties because of pressure on housing, school places and other services.     When the newcomers arrive the Board*s aim will be tosteer them to areas of less pressure and to draw their attention to offers of work and accommodation.    They will enlist all possible help from the asian communities already settled here.46.       On the assumption noted in paragraph 44 above the existingschedule flights (about 4 a week to Gatwick and 11 to Heathrow) wouldhave to be supplemented by 4 or 5 extra flights a day.    It would bedifficult to shift the scheduled flights away from Heathrow andGatwick without attracting attention and criticism;   but the extraflights could with advantage be concentrated at Stansted.     Lutonwould be in reserve,47.       Enough accommodation has been secured on the RAF stations atStradishall (Suffolk) and Hemswell (Lines) to take some 2, 500 people.The duration of stay in these temporary reception centres, and others which are being examined, will have to depend on experience.48.       The terms of the Trust Deed under which the Board is to operatehave been agreed between the Home Office, the Treasury and the Board.The grant-in-aid will be charged to a Home Office vote; and control overthe Board&apos;s actions will be exercised through directions from the HomeSecretary.    There is general agreement about the content of these; but2 points are outstanding:-a. Whether and, if so, how provision should be made forresettlement grants to be paid to passport holders who come here and then emigrate.b. Whether the Board should be enabled to meet (or advance on loan) the cost of furniture and household equipment where this proves to be needed.
49.       The point at a. is discussed in paragraphs 15-26 above.    Asregards b., Asians arriving without property in this country may gosometimes to furnished accommodation, sometimes to unfurnished.In furnished accommodation the Supplementary Benefits Commission(SBC) would assist them with rent payments under their usual rules.But in unfurnished accommodation some necessities might need to beprovided.    The SBC have power to make grants for furniture and household necessities in exceptional circumstances.    But the commission have expressed concern that the numbers involved may make itimpossible for them to apply their normal stringent standards toimmigrants.    This, they feel, could lead to an embarrassing increasein pressure for more generous treatment for all supplementary benefitcases.    They therefore would prefer to be relieved of this obligationto the Asians;  and they suggest that it should be met by enabling the resettlement Board to make loans to immigrants.    They point out thatthey themselves are empowered only to make grants, not loans.50.       The Treasury, the Home Office and the Resettlement Board thinkthat this would be liable to be widely interpreted as a special andadvantageous provision for the Asians as compared with the rights of the indigenous population.    A system of loans would not be free from this difficulty.    It would moreover involve problems of assessing how muchto advance in each case - a task requiring staff to be recruited andtrained to do a job similar to that of the Commissions staff; and itwould also involve continuing problems of recovering the money in atleast some cases.51.       The least embarrassing arrangement might be to encourage theuse for these purposes of charitable funds, attracting in particularcontributions from the existing Asian community in the United Kingdomand with the support of a Government contribution also.Local Authorities52.       Rate support grant.   Government financial assistance towardslocal authority services is given predominantly through rate support grant.53.       The total amount of grant for 1972-73 is already fixed, apart fromallowance for price increases.    The distribution of this amount amonglocal authorities will be based among other things on the number ofschoolchildren on the school registers at 1 January 1973.    If individual authorities can provide by late December figures of the expected increasein numbers on their school registers at 1 January, because of an influx of Ugandan Asians, this could be taken into account in a recalculation of grant distribution; and the authorities would receive an extra share oftotal grant for 1972-73 which could be paid during the first quarter of 1973.Assuming a typical proportion of secondary to primary schoolchildrenamong the immigrants, authorities would receive roughly  180 for eachadditional child on their school registers.14
54.       The total of rate support grant for 1973-74 could be increasedwhen it is settled in November this year, in recognition of the extraburden.    The distribution of grant will utlimately reflect the incidence of the additional population in any case.    But it would be possible to takethe existence of concentrations of new Ugandan Asian immigrants intoaccount in the initial distribution, thus giving the particular authoritieshelp a year earlier than they would normally receive it.55.       Specific Grants.    Authorities may argue, however, that the rate support grant factors are based on normal costs per head for education,welfare and other services, and that costs for Ugandan Asian will be much higher.    If so, Section II of the Local Government Act 1966 will help,since it enables the Government to pay a special grant of 75 per cent onextra staff engaged by local authorities for dealing with language or other problems created by the presence of substantial numbers of immigrants.56.       Thus, the ordinary arrangements for assisting local authoritiesthrough rate support grant, together with the specific grant referred toabove, will go a long way to provide the support that local authorities need.The Government may, however, want to consider giving immediatefinancial assistance to those local authorities who incur extra expenditurein providing for a sudden inflow of Asian UKPH.    If so, we suggest thatthere should be a limited scheme which could be discontinued when thenewcomers have been integrated into the economic life of the country(so that they are earning incomes and paying rates).57.       We think it would be best to enable the Ugandan ResettlementBoard to make 75 per cent grants direct to local authorities for expendi-ture on special projects such as the provision of temporary classrooms,school transport and health centres which would fall outside their normalprogramme of expenditure.    Grants would be made on a once-for-allbasis or for a limited period, up to a fixed total ceiling.    No special legislation would be necessary so long as the scheme were restricted to the Board.    Local authorities would have been invited to submit theirprojects to the Board.    The Board would have the function of siftingand assessing applications but would be given guidance on the criteria for making grants.    The detailed arrangements would have to be worked out between the Home Office and the Board.The Employment Voucher Scheme58.       This scheme now provides for issue of 2, 250 vouchers a year -roughly half to the Old Commonwealth and half to the New (includingMalta and the Dependencies).    Doctors and dentists do not need vouchers.It has so far been felt that, since the number coming from the new commonwealth is modest;  since suspension might nevertheless damagesome of these countries;  since the Old Commonwealth would take offence;and since suspension might prejudice our efforts to get India and Pakistanto take UKPH, it would be better not to suspend the scheme for the timebeing.
59.       The Australian Government are sensitive to restrictions on thefreedom of Australians to enter the United Kingdom;  and suspensionmight therefore involve us in reviewing policy in regard to aliens as wellas Commonwealth citizens.    If this covered Community nationals, we might have to consider whether the provisions of the Treaty of Romeregarding mobility of labour would be affected;  and, if we decided to seek permission to suspend these provisions, we would risk reopeningthe general question about freedom of movement for colloured citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies within the Community.60. But the question remains open. The scheme could be suspendedat short notice by administrative action.61.       D ecisioae are needed on the following points:-a. Whether and, if so, how grants should be paid to assistresettlement overseas (cf paragraph 26).b. Whether furniture and household equipment should beprovided through charitable appeal.c. Whether the Resettlement Board should pay specific grants at 75 per cent of the cost of special projects which fall outside the normal programmes of expenditure of localauthorities.d. Whether the scheme of employment vouchers for commonwealth citizens should be suspended.16
Uganda 50,000Kenya 50,000Tanzania 20,000Zambia 6,000Malawi 6,000India 25, 000Pakistan 1,000Malaysia/Singapore 140,000The last figure is large;  but so far the people concerned have show no disposition to want to come to the United Kingdom and are under nopressure to do so.63.       There is in addition a large number of people, including abouta million in Malaysia (The Queen&apos;s Chinese) and some in Hong Kong,who hold the citizenship of their country of residence as well as ourcitizenship.    They are not part of the present problem, which affectsonly those who have no other citizenship.64.       What it comes to, therefore, is that there may be 130, 000-140,000UKPH in East Africa (including 50, 000 in Uganda) and 25, 000 in India inrespect of whom we are at risk;  and that, subject to some uncertainty about the 140,000 in Malaysia and Singapore, there are no other liabilities of a serious order,65.       To deprive UKPH of their citizenship would involve legislation toamend the British Nationality Act, 1948, and, as a matter of presentation,would probably be best achieved by some form of fragmentation or sub-division of our present composite citizenship into citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and citizenships of the several Colonies.    Unless a person fellinto one or other of these categories he would cease to be a citizen under our nationality law.    Broadly, citizenship of the United Kingdom, woiildbe restricted to those who are patrial and have the right to enter theUnited Kingdom under the terms of the Immigration Act, 1971.    some preliminary thought has been given to legislation on these lines.    Butit is clear that very considerable difficulties, both political and technical,would arise; and the whole question needs more detailed examinationbefore any policy  decision on so sensitive an issue could be contemplated.62.       Estimates of the number of people whom, because they have noother citizenship, we might be obliged to admit if they were expelled fromother countries are unreliable.    The best estimate we can make is asfollows:
66.       Another question is whether anything should be done to limit the entry of dependants of Commonwealth citizens.    On the showing of lastyear, the total Commonwealth intake for this year is likely to be about25, 000, of whom about 20, 000 will be dependants of people already here -many of them from India and Pakistan.    (The number of aliens accepted as permanent residents, including dependants, comes to much the sameannual total - 20, 000-25, 000).67.       The arrival of these dependants cannot be suspended or phasedwithout legislation.    Under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962,as amended by the 1968 Act, the wife or (subject to certain conditions)child up to age 16 of a Commonwealth citizen resident in the United Kingdomcannot be excluded.    When the 1971 Act comes into force on 1 January 1973wives and children will have only such rights of entry as are accorded bythe Immigration Rules, which are subject to Parliamentary approval.    Butas respects the wives and children of Commonwealth citizens who were settled in the United Kingdom at the coming into force of the Act, section(5) provides that the Rules must preserve the effect of the 1962 Actprovisions.68.      It is plain that legislation of the kind required would be technicallyeasy.    But it would give rise to great political difficulties, bothdomestically and internationally; and it would be likely to be particularlyresented in the Indian sub-continent.    In addition, Article 8 of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for private and family life.    The Commission have established, in anumber of cases brought before them, that, depending on the circumstances,where one member of a family has the right to reside in a country, a refusal to admit a near relative may be a breach of the Article.69.       In the light of the above it seems very desirable that a further study should be commissioned forthwith to establish the scope for, andthe implications of, amending the existing provisions as regards UnitedKingdom citizenship and the admission of dependants.    It will, of course,be essential to maintain complete secrecy about this study in order toprevent forestalling.
