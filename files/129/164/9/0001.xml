CIVIL EMERGENCIESNote by the Prime Minister1. At an early stage in the railway dispute the ad hoc Group ofMinisters under my Chairmanship felt the need for greater co-ordinationof the information available to us and of action planned to offset theconsequences of the work-to-rule;  and since then the small inter -departmental group of officials under the Chairmanship of the Lord privy seal (GEN 96) has continued to operate.2. Subsequent events make it clear that we are likely to have to facefurther disruptions as a result of industrial action and that they will notnecessarily come singly.    And there is also the question of majoraccidents or natural disasters.    I have therefore arranged for a full-scalereview of our civil contingency planning.    It is not just a question of looking at existing plans to see if they are up to date.    We must also identifypressure points on the economy and seek ways of relieving them:  and wemust be in a position to spot possible emergencies before they arise andassess both their consequences and the remedial measures that can betaken.    This review is being conducted under Cabinet Office chairmanship:and Departments have designated an officer of at least Under Secretarystatus to take part in this review and to be responsible for their civilcontingency planning generally.3, So much for the strategic aspects.    When we are faced with a tactical situation we must be able to act quickly and flexibly.    TheEmergency Committees (both Ministerial and Official) have not been welladapted to present circumstances.    I am therefore making the following arrangements: -a. A Committee, which will be chaired by myself (or in myabsence by the Home Secretary) and will report to the Cabinet as necessary, to provide the necessary oversight at Ministerial levelof major issues of industrial policy which may develop into anemergency.COPY no cp(72) 841 August 1972CABINET
b. Below this, and under the Chairmanship of the Lord privy seal, the group of senior officials from the Departments directly concerned with a particular dispute (and normally the individualsalready designated with emergency responsibilities) will beresponsible for co-ordinating information and action.    In theabsence of the Lord Privy Seal this group will meet under cabinet office chairmanship;  and arrangements have been made for it to function in accommodation with special communications facilities to the Departments likely to be affected.c. The Cabinet Office will be responsible for keepingDepartments less directly concerned informed about a situation as it develops.I hope that these arrangements will provide the strategic planning we needand also the necessary co-ordination in a tectical situation, but needlessto say they imply no change in the normal doctrine that the executive responsibility for dealing with an emergency rests with the Department,or Departments, concerned.E H10 Downing Street31 July 1972V
