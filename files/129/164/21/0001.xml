WINTER HEATING payments memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesINTRODUCTION1. When the Cabinet considered my proposals for lump-sumsupplementary benefit payments for heating next winter(CM(72) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5), they concluded that such payments should not be made, and that it was preferable to deal with the problem by seeking out those in real need and ensuring that they received thediscretionary additions to benefit for heating needs.     I was invited toarrange, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theHome Secretary and Lord President, for an effective campaign of publicity to be undertaken on the help at present available towards heatingcosts under the supplementary benefits scheme;  and for the intensification of efforts to identify those in need.PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN2. I have now considered how such a campaign could be mounted, andwith what results, and have reported the outcome to the Home and social affairs Committee.    The Committee concluded that % campaign might wellbe counter-productive and politically disadvantageous.    This is because it would benefit at most 150, 000 old people (that is, the number thought tobe entitled to extra supplementary benefit help with heating costs not nowreceiving it), and widespread publicity would inevitably lead many people to claim extra benefit who would not in the event qualify.    It should not therefore be undertaken.LUMP SUM PAYMENTS3. The Committee considered however that serious political dis-advantages might well follow if no steps were taken to deal with theproblem of the &quot;old and cold&quot; next winter, though they recognised the needfor savings in public expenditure.    They agreed that the Cabinet should begiven an opportunity to consider   a more limited form of the lump-sum payment scheme.16 5CP(72) 96 COPY NO26 September 1972CABINET
4. My previous proposal was that payments should be made to allrecipients of supplementary benefit who receive the long-term addition,ie to about 1. 9 million supplementary pensioners and 300, 000 long-termbeneficiaries under pension age (notably the chronically sick and singleparent families).    I would now propose to exclude all those under pension age, and further to make the payment only to people over pension age who could in some sense be said to be isolated, that is, to single and marriedsupplementary pensioners who live on their own.    This would meanexcluding pensioners living with relatives or who are or have boarders.The number of beneficiaries would be reduced to about 1.4 million, andfurther still to about 1 million if an age condition also applied and thepayment were made only to single and married supplementary pensionersaged 70 or over who live alone.    (I do not think any higher qualifying agewould be defensible. )5. If the payment were  10 as I originally proposed, the cost wouldbe either about  10 million or about  14 million, depending on whether theage 70 condition applied.    I do not think the payment could be much lowerman  8, and on this basis the cost would be either about  8 million or about  11 million.6. Even on this more limited basis, payments would still be made tosome old people who did not in practice have special heating needs,although they would clearly be amongst the most vulnerable members of society.    And since the qualifying conditions would be to some degreearbitrary there would inevitably be pressure to extend the payment to long-term beneficiaries who were excluded.    A scheme on these lines would however be much more selective (a consideration to which theCabinet attached much importance) since the number of beneficiariescould be reduced by over half.    This scheme would in consequence beless costly than my previous proposal, and a smaller administrativeburden.LEGISLATION AND TIMING7. My advice (which I am confirming with the Law Officers) is thatlump sum payments of this nature could not be made under the supplementary Benefits Com-nission^ discretionary powers to makeindividual payments in exceptional circumstances.    A short Bill would therefore be necessary.    Ideally we should need to announce our intentions in October, and to legislate at the beginning of the new session.Payments could then begin in late November or early December, and becompleted soon after Christmas.    All this must however be subject to animprovement in the situation in my Departments local offices which are working under considerable strain in the light of an overtime ban.2

My proposals would benefit the very poorest and most helplessin the land at a time when they will be attracting almost universalsympathy.    I therefore ask the Cabinet to approve them and to decide:i.       whether age 70 should be a qualifying condition;ii.       the amount of the payment.
