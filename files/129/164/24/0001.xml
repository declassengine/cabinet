CP(72) 99 COPY NO6527 September 1972CABINETTRIPARTITE MEETINGS WITH THE CB1 AND TUC:THE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALSMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. I am circulating with this memorandum copies of the Press Noticeissued after our meetings yesterday with the Confederation of BritishIndustry and the Trades Union Congress, together with the note of the government&apos;s proposals (which is slightly amended from the provisionalversion which was circulated yesterday as CP(72) 93).    I also attach atranscript of what I said when I introduced the proposals at a press conference.    This, together with the subsequent questions and answers(extensively reported in today&apos;s Times), gives the general atmosphereand background to the proposals.2, The initial reception of the proposals in the Press and broadcasting media has on the whole been good.    But they will be attackedfrom both extremes of the political spectrum;  and it is very important that between now and the next meeting on 16 October we should do all we can to mobilise the force of public opinion behind the need to deal with inflation,the benefits of working by voluntary agreement between the Governmentand the two sides of industry and the merits of the specific proposals,3. I therefore ask all my colleagues in the Government to use every opportunity which presents itself in the next three weeks to commend theproposals to public opinion in the general context of the need to dealfairly with inflation and to enlist the greatest possible degree of public support for what we are seeking to achieve.    Supporting material will bemade available to all Ministers.4. I should be grateful if Ministers in charge of Departments would bring this memorandum and the attachments to the attention of all ministers and junior Ministers in their Departments.E H10 Downing Street:;7:.:&apos;:;:: 727 September 1972
10 Downing StreetWhitehall, SWT26 September 1972There was a further meeting chaired by the Prime Minister at chequers today in the series of tripartite discussions between theGovernment, the TUC and the CBI.    The meeting began at 11. 00 am andlasted until 4.45 pm with a break for lunch.At the last meeting on 14 September, it had been agreed that further work should be done with a view to defining more precisely the issues and means by which the agreed aim of increasing the real prosperity of thenation as a whole, whilst paying particular regard to improving therelative position of the lower paid and the pensioners and slowing down the rate of inflation, could be achieved.Arising from this further work, at today&apos;s meeting the PrimeMinister said that he was talking in the context of a situation in whichtripartite discussions of this kind on the questions of economic managementwould continue to be held.    In this context he put forward proposals(described in the attached memorandum) for the next twelve monthsdesigned to meet the immediate situation and to work towards the agreedobjectives of the three parties.After a general discussion of the Governments proposals, the tuc and the CBI brought up a number of issues which they wished to consider further.    It was agreed that another tripartite meeting would take placeon Monday, 16 October, to agree proposals for submission to the councils of the two Bodies.The discussion brought out the need that would arise, if theproposals were adopted, for the three parties jointly to set up new machinery to help the development of traditionally low paid industries,new machinery to monitor retail price increases, and a continuing organisation to watch over the implementation of the proposals and toundertake work for and report to the main tripartite meetings.    The staffs of the three parties were instructed to work out proposals for consideration at the next meeting.
THE GOVERNMENTS proposals at previous meetings the Government, the TUC and the CBI haveagreed on objectives for economic management in the present situation:faster growth in national output and real incomes;  an improvement inthe relative position of the low paid;  and moderation in the rate of costand price inflation.    The Government believes that the specific proposals set out below offer the best means of moving towards these objectives inthe next twelve months, as well as looking after the interests of pensioners.    During this period the Government, the TUC and the CBIwill meet regularly to discuss objectives for the ensuing phase and how best to achieve them.The proposals are:-ECONOMIC GROWTH1. The Government would extend its commitment to achieve a5 per cent rate of growth to cover the next two years.    This is necessarynot only to increase the national prosperity and to provide additional resources for investment and the social services but also to reduce unemployment below its present unacceptable level.PRICES2. The aim should be to keep the growth of retail prices resultingfrom increases in costs within a limit of 5 per cent over the next twelve months.3. This aim requires that price increases of manufactured products,which will benefit from a larger than average increase in productivity,should be kept within a limit of 4 per cent, and that this limitation shouldbe fully reflected in retail prices.    Nationalised industries would beexpected generally to match the performance of the private sector,4. The Government would be prepared, as part of a tripartiteapproach to consider taking further action to limit price increases, whereit has the ability to influence them.pay. Over the next twelve months increases in pay for a normal working week, which should come into effect not less than twelve months after theprevious increase, should be a cash sum of  2 a week.    In industries where pay is largely or wholly governed by existing incentive arrangements,any changes negotiated, whether at national, company or plant level,should be so designed that pay does not rise by more than  2 a week forthe same output.    This approach would both help the low paid and ensurethat the package as a whole reduced the rate of inflation.    Due account would have to be taken of any reduction in hours.1
6, These proposals on pay and the foregoing proposals on prices are closely interconnected, the relationship between them is demonstrated inthe annex to this note.7. A new body should be set up to help the traditionally low paidindustries to achieve greater efficiency as a basis for paying higher wages;  and should be available to help employers and unions to improve the position of the lower paid in other industries.8. Certain once-for-all factors could in 1973 have the effect of causingretail prices to rise by somewhat more than the 5 per cent envisaged inparagraph 2.    It is therefore proposed that threshold agreements shouldbe adopted to meet this contingency.    The compensation would be a flat rate amount, say 20p for each increase of 1 per cent above a threshold of6 per cent.    This would ensure that the low paid maintained a substantialreal increase throughout the year.PENSIONS9. Pensioners would benefit from the reduced rate of inflation whichwould result if these proposals were observed without any exceptions.In addition, the Government would be prepared as part of the tripartiteapproach to take appropriate action to ensure that in the coming yearpensioners also had the benefit of a share in the nation&apos;s increasingprosperity.The Government recognises that the TUC and CBI will need timeto consider these proposals.    In the meantime, to avoid the risk ofprejudicing the prospects of these proposals being applied over the next twelve months, the Government expect all those concerned with pay and price determination not to take any action inconsistent with paragraphs 1to 8 above.2
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND TO THE GOVERNMENT&quot;SPROPOSALS1. If the rate of economic growth over the next twelve months is takento be 5 per cent and if the rise in home costs per unit of output is takento be no more than 5 per cent the current value of gnp a year from nowwill be  60, 250 million.2. On the assumption that the share of gnp which will go to wages and salaries will be 61 per cent - the average for the past 10 years - the totalof wages and salaries will rise over the next twelve months to 36, 750 million at an annual rate, some  3, 000 million more than atpresent.    The number of wage and salary earners is taken to rise to22j million.    This is equivalent to a rate of average earnings (wages and salaries per head) some  2.60 per week higher than now.    the relationship between actual average earnings and basic settlements is notfixed and some allowance has to be made for &quot;drift1.    An across-the-boardrise of  2. 00 per week would be compatible with earnings on averagerising  2.60 per week.3, A change in standard working hours or in the length of paidholidays as part of a pay settlement, or in place of a cash increase, hasimplications for labour costs.    To the extent that such arrangementsimply more people are needed to produce a given output or more hoursare paid at overtime rates the scope for increasing cash pay for a normalhour, consistent with a given rate of increase of costs and prices, islessened.    A cut of one hour in the standard week, with no change in pay,is equivalent, other things being equal, to a pay rise of about Z\ per centor about 75p a week.
INTRODUCTION BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT PRESS CONFERENCEON 26 SEPTEMBER 1972What we have embarked upon is the management of the economy by thethree parties - the Government, the CBI and the TUC.&apos;    Of course theGovernment has its direct responsibilities.    But both the other parties in the discussion have realised that they have their responsibilities aswell.    In the four meetings that we have had before today we have discussed a wide range of issues in order to focus our minds on what should be the priorities.    I regard the meetings we&apos;ve been having, asdo the other two parties after today&apos;s discussions, as part of a continuingprocess in which together we can, periodically and at regular and frequent intervals, review the working of the economy in all its aspects, the progresswe&apos;re making and what we require to be doing in order to achieve our objectives.In the first meetings we had we marked out our objectives, the first being to improve the real standard of living of the people of this country.    Thismeans a policy of expansion and growth.    At the same time all three parties recognised that the reduction of inflation must be a prime objectiveto achieve these.    Then great emphasis has been placed upon improving the real position of the lower-paid worker and the pensioner.    At the sametime we&apos;ve all recognised that if we are to have efficient expansion,improve the real wealth and have a change of improving the position ofthe low-paid and the pensioner, we have to have greater investment andthat investment must come from profitability.    Firms therefore musthave the opportunity of the investment.But we&apos;ve also all recognised that to have investment firms must have confidence that inflation is being dealt with and workers must have confidence that in the increased wealth of the country they are goingto improve their own real position.    So it has been a question ofconfidence on both sides - industry to invest and expand, and tradeunion workers to know that the benefits are going to the people of thecountry as a whole allowing, of course, for investment.Then we had to decide priorities.    It was agreed between the three groups at the last meeting that the priorities should be for the lower-paidworker in the context of reducing inflation.   /At the last meeting the partiesasked the Government to put forward a proposition which could then beconsidered for the achievement of these objectives.    What we have been working on is the proposition which I put to the other two parties today.The details of the meeting are in the covering statement.    We met fromeleven until a quarter to five.    We had a very full discussion and it wasin my view an extremely valuable and useful discussion to have had.Mr Jack Jones had to leave at lunchtime for this very important meeting this afternoon, but he was there for the proposition and for a large partof the discussion.    Mr Scanlon is on his way back from the Far East.
Otherwise the group was the same as it has been on previous occasions,except as far as the Government is concerned - the Chancellor of theExchequer and Sir Douglas Allen are in Washington for the IMF meeting.So we came to the proposition.    The proposition is set out in the paper before you.    I hope it&apos;s clear.    The proposition is that for this coming year - and I&apos;ve already emphasised that this is in the context now of the continuing discussions for the management of the economy - we concentrate on the priority of breaking down inflation and helping the lower-paidworker.    We agreed today that there should also be the priority of helping the pensioner.    Now in this context we put forward the proposition thatthe wage award should be a year after the last one was made and thatduring this process in the coming year the award should be two poundsfor a normal working week - a cash award over the board.    Thistherefore proportionately helps the lower-paid worker and this achievesour prime objective.    A very considerable portion of lower-paid workers are women, so it also helps a subsidiary objective which is already underway in equal pay.We then said that to achieve our target in the price sphere there should notbe a greater increase than 5 per cent, and that to achieve this the CBItarget would have to come down to 4 per cent.    Now the figures for this are in the last page of the paper which has been given to you.    In other words we started off with our gnp - and the Government is committed to5 per cent growth in gnp for the next two years.    We have shown clearly that we intend to bring that about by the budgetary measures we have taken,by the results we are getting and by the fact that we have floated sterling in order that our reserves should not be run down, and that we should beable to keep up our expansion.    So our commitment to growth is there andhas been demonstrated.    We then work out what trill be available with thegrowth - we are not doing anything before we have got it - and from that,as a result of reducing the increase in prices to 5 per cent in the year, wesay then it is possible to make these arrangements on wages.Now we want a safeguard to give confidence to trade unions and workersbecause the second half of this year, with which we are now dealing - inother words starting from the spring of &apos;73 - contains certain particularfactors which cannot altogether be quantified at this stage.    We want togive safeguards if the increase in the second half of the year becomesgreater than envisaged.    This is why we have the proposal for thresholdagreement at a level of 6 per cent * for each increase of 1 per cent above that figure there would be an increase in pay of 20p.Now industrial correspondents and others know that in dealing with an overall across the board arrangement of this kind which is for a normal working week - and we deliberately use the phrase normal working weekbecause in industry the make up of pay in a normal working week varies -this is a matter for the particular industry concerned.    In addition to thatthere are other negotiated factors which lead to drift, overtime and so on,and you will see that the figures show the calculations which have been2
made allow for this up to  2. 60 a week.    So to achieve our aims we have 2 for the normal working week and we take account of drift for theadditional part of the wages structure up to 60p.This then is the main part of the scheme.    The Government has takenresponsibility for the nationalised industries and there are also otherspheres in which Government has its influence and for which it is responsible outside the nationalised industries.    We accept responsibilityfor that.We have also said that, in the context of this package breaking throughinflation and dealing with our other objective of the lower-paid worker,we can then give greater help to the pensioner.    As you know, the pensioner is already getting an annual review out of this Government&apos;arrangements.    They are due for an increase of 75p for a single person and  1,20 for a married couple in October.    There will be the review inthe spring and a further increase in the autumn of next year.    Wetherefore believe that, in the context of this package, if it is accepted,greater help can be given to the old age pensioner.    And this has beenthe genuine desire of all three parties to these talks.Now what emerged today as the next stage to be done is, of course, forthe two other parties to have discussions with their own groups;  butmeantime we have commissioned the work which is set out in the press notice for devising means by which we can best help the development ofindustries which have a majority of lower-paid workers.    This is a matterof the economic development of those industries.    A lot of detailed work has already been done on this question and we now want to set up themachinery for tackling the problems.    That is the next stage on which work will be done.    There is also the question of the machinery formonitoring retail prices and the examination of that will now be done.And there will be, I think, special machinery required for the staff workof reviewing the progress of this package if it is accepted.    Meantime the strategy will be dealt with at the top level as we have been dealing with itsince 18 July.What I want to say in conclusion is that I think these are ambitiousproposals.    If they are accepted and implemented they mark a major step forward in the management of our economy for the benefit of everybodyconcerned.    And the opportunities open to us if we achieve this are Ibelieve simply tremendous, and I think this view is shared by all of uswho have been taking part in these talks.So those were our objectives;  we were asked to put forward a proposal -we have put it forward, we believe it is realistic;  we can&apos;t solve all theproblems at once.    What we have done is to concentrate on two priorities and in our continuing discussions we can deal with the other problems asexpeditiously as possible.    There are a considerable number of other problems and I have no doubt that many commentators and other people
will pick on particular aspects and say that this or that point is not satisfied or that there is some other weakness or imbalance.    This is all very well.    The plain fact is that all three parties are determined todeal with inflation to deal with it fairly, and to reach the two objectives which we have at the moment set outselves and then to move onto the others.    That is our approach and we believe it is the best that we canput forward.
