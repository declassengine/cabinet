WINTER HEATING payments memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The Secretary of State for Social Services proposed earlier(CP(72) 82) that a  10 contribution to heating costs should be paid this winter to the 2.2 million recipients of supplementary benefits who receivethe long-term addition, ie. to supplementary pensioners, and to those under pensionable age such as the chronically sick and single parent families who have been on benefit for at least two years.    As a groupthese are people known to be among the most hard-pressed.    Theestimated cost was  22 million.    The Cabinet did not accept this proposal(CM(72) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5):  they wished to seek out those in realneed rather than to give across-the-board payments.    They suggested apublicity campaign to tell the public what was already available to them through the Supplementary Benefits Commission (SBC).2. The Secretary of State has produced cogent arguments against sucha publicity campaign (CP(72) 96, paragraph 2);  Ministers may thereforedecide not to pursue this suggestion,3, The Secretary of State is also seeking the advice of the Law officers on whether the SBCs discretionary powers can be used more widely or toassist certain groups without considering individual applications.Ministers will wish to hear what that advice is.4.        The Secretary of State&apos;s new proposals (CP(72) 96), designed toreduce the cost of his original proposal, are to exclude:-a. All those under pension age (300, 000).b. Old people living with relatives, or who are or haveboarders (about j million).c. Possibly, all pensioners below the age of 70 (a little over400, 000).165CP(72) 97 COPY NO26 September 1972CABINET
If all these exclusions were made, only about 1 million supplementarypensioners aged 70 or over who live alone would receive the payment.The cost of the scheme would be between  8 million and  14 million,depending on the groups covered (a. to c. above) and whether the payment was  8 or  10.QUESTIONS FOR DECISION5.        The choices facing Ministers are as follows:-1. A lump sum winter heating payment would be widelyregarded as a sign that the Government cares about a group of people who will be cold during the coming winter, and some ofwhom may become ill as a result.    Ministers will therefore wishto consider whether such a payment is imperative, and whetherthis should override considerations of public expenditure control,the safeguarding of tax objectives, and the legislative programme.2. If Ministers feel that a less expensive measure than thefull  22 million originally proposed is needed, the following questions arise:-a. Could the matter be left to the SBC to use itsdiscretionary powers (paragraph 3 above)?b. Would the exclusions proposed by the Secretary ofState (paragraphs 4-6 of CP(72) 96) be the best way of achieving this limited objective;  or would they, by selectingthe beneficiary group by reference to age and the extent towhich the pensioner lives alone rather than by real andidentified need, create so many anomalies and complaintsthat the Government would appear penny-pinching andmisguided?    Is this really what the Government means by&quot;selectivity&quot;?c. Would a smaller lump sum, say  5, paid, withoutany exclusions, to all those receiving the long-termaddition, be preferable?dr        Should the payment be described simply as a winterallowance, and not specifically for heating?3. If Ministers decide that some payment is needed, shouldthe Secretary of State find the extra money from within his presentbudget, by displacing some lesser priority item;  or should otherMinisters1 programmes bear the cost?Cabinet Office26 September 19722
