CP(72) 90 COPY no. 7 August 1972CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE NUCLEAR industry note by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry i attach, for consideration by the Cabinet at their meetingtomorrow, the draft of a Parliamentary Statement on the future ofthe nuclear industry, which I have prepared in the light of thediscussion at this morning&apos;s meeting of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy.    I would propose to make the Statement, if theCabinet so approves, tomorrow.J d department of Trade and Industry7 August 1972
DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRYNUCLEAR REACTOR policy      Decisions in the field of nuclear reactor policy have immenseimportance for the future strength of British industry and forthe security and cost of energy supply.   The government is resolved to build upon the major achievements of the sea in the past andto ensure the development of a powerful capability for the future in which the sea will continue to play a vital part.   We havedecided therefore to intensify the installation of nuclear plantsas far as technological progress, environmental constraints,industrial capability and generating plant requirements permit.As far as Research and Development are concerned the government intends:-To pusi ahead as rapidly as possible with the developmentof the sodium-cooled fast reactor, which it sees as the mainelement^ in the long-term^of our nuclear generating programme.A small experimental reactor of this type has been running at iDounreay since 1960, and a 250 MW(E) prototype is expected to -*run next year.   In addition, to arrange for a major programme ofwork to be carried out over the next 5 years at an estimated cost/of ..
of  15 million, largely directed towards component development.It is expected that this system might &quot;be ready for a first full-scale order to be placed in the latter part of the &apos;70&apos;s and for it to &quot;be assuming the major part of nuclear plant orders from the mid-80*s.To commission a complete and specific design and componentdevelopment programme for SGHVR to: run in parallel, with the work required to establish the safety of this system.     A 100MW prototypeof this reactor has been operating satisfactorily for 4 years atVinfrith in Dorset and it is accordingly a strong contender for adoption in the UK grid system.   This work is likely to take^ some18 months.To complete urgently work on the AGE with a view to optimisingthe benefit to he achieved from the five generating plants of this type currently under construction: in addition to study whetherdesign improvements can be made with a view to maintaining it as apossibility for future construction. iFor the other two systems currently under active consideration -the HTE and the LWE - to engage in international collaborative work.For the HTE this would be collaborative work of a developmental kindwith a view to exploring the prospects of this reactor system which necessarily are in the medium term.     For the LWE the objective would be to achieve reassurance   about the questions that have arisen as to its safety.CONFIDENTIAL /Within ..
Within about 18 months it should prove possible to evaluateall this work to the point of being able to place firm orders.I shall take into account the healthy development of the nuclearindustry at that time when considering the needs of the generatingboards.As to the structure of the industry the nuclear plants needsof the generating boards look to be - at least from the late 70&apos;s on -of a scale requiring a much stronger design and construction capacitythan is presently available.It is also reasonable to envisage that the combination of the extensive E &amp; D effort intended and the level of home orders should lead to valuable export business if we have available a strong design and construction capability.To this end the Government proposes to encourage the consilidation of the present industry into a single strong unit.   It should be closely involved with the sea in reactor E &amp; D and with sea and ENFLin fuel development and fabrication..   It should also have powerfultechnical and commercial backing.   Finally it should be capable ofplaying its part in international and- especially European collaboration in the development and exploitation of nuclear reactors, to whichthe Government attaches much importance.   I am commencingdiscussions forthwith with all interested parties with a view toconstituting as soon as possible the strong unit I envisage./In ..
In addition, I propose- to set up a nuclear power board whichwill &quot;bring together all those having a major part to play in providing me with concerted advice on all aspects of nucleargeneration policy and on the Government&apos;s role in ensuring themost effective progress in this field.   The board will have a major part to play in the decisions to be made in 18 months timeabout the ordering of generating plants.The plans announced in this statement do not require legislation.I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with any necessary consultations with the interests covered in this country and abroad.4
