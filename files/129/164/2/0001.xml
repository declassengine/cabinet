US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(72) 77 COPY NO12 July 1972CABINETLAND TENURE REFORM IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. In the 1970 Conservative Manifesto for Scotland we stated our intention &quot;to carry out a major reform of the system of land tenure inScotland and abolish feuduty&quot;.    I now attach for the information of mycolleagues the text of a Green Paper containing proposals for this majorreform.    The Green Paper relates solely to Scotland; land tenurearrangements in England and Wales are quite distinct.2.        The Green Paper was considered on 30 June by the Home and social affairs Committee, who approved it for publication, subject to my giving further consideration to two points in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor the Environment - with whom I have subsequently agreed some detailedadjustments which are incorporated in the text now circulated.    TheCommittee also agreed that, subject to consultation with the Lord President,I should make an early Parliamentary statement announcing my intentionto publish the Green Paper.3. I hope to publish the Green Paper towards the end of July. There-after I intend to make an early start with the necessary process of detailedconsultation with legal and other organisations. These discussions will inevitably take a good deal of time, but my aim is to have legislation ready for introduction in the 1973-74 Parliamentary Session. Unless any of mycolleagues sees any difficulty, I propose to make a statement on 13 July byway of a Written Answer to a Parliamentary Question.G scottish Office12 July 1972&apos;:- vis&apos;!1 m;;!-1&apos;&apos;! vl
IN CONFIDENCEGREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION I - INTRODUCTIONHISTORICAL1,      Most land in Scotland is still held on   one form or another of feudal tenure, asystem dating from the eleventh and twelfth centuries.   Originally, the basiccharacteristic of the feudal system was that, with a few minor exceptions, only theCrown could own land absolutely.   Certain other persons hold their lands in return for services and payments rendered to the Crown.   They in turn, as vassals-in-chief ofthe Sovereign, might similarly make grants of land to vassals of their own, inrelation to whom they themselves were in the position of superiors;   and this processwould often be repeated several times, thereby creating a superior-vassal chain whichstretched from the Sovereign (as paramount superior) to the proprietor having legalpossession of a particular piece of land.   In this way a number of simultaneous interestsin the same piece of land could be created.   In addition to the interest of the Crown,which still subsisted except in so far as rights had been granted to the vassal-in-chief, there were usually the rights of at least one other superior (the dominiumdirectum) and those of the vassal who actually occupied the land and who had nobodylower than him in the feudal chain (the dominium utile).    (The right of the ultimatevassal to grant a lease of the land is not a feudal right.)2.      The basic system has of course been very considerably modified with the passageof time.   The grant of land by a superior to a vassal, which originally was only forthe vassal&apos;s lifetime, came to be perpetual and heritable;   and, certainly by the lateeighteenth century, the lowest vassal in the feudal chain had for most practical purposes become the owner of the land - provided always that he observed the terms ofhis feudal charter.   Moreover, the system had been simplified to the extent thatvarious distinct forms of feudal tenure had largely fallen into disuse and beengradually replaced by the form known as feu-farm.   This term is itself now archaic;in practice, tenure in feu-farm is referred to simply as feudal tenure.   In course oftime also the services (as distinct from the payments) which might be due from a vassal!
to ILd superior, together with certain of the rights which the superior might have over the vassal&apos;s land or person, were either abolished or were commuted to monetarypayments.   This process of modification has been a gradual and continuing one - forexample, it was only as a result of the Feudal Casualties (Scotland) Act 1914 thatfeudal casualties (additional payments due to a superior on the occurrence of certain specified events such as the death of the vassal) were finally abolished.3,     The principal remaining features of the feudal system in Scotland are theobligations placed on vassals i. to pay in perpetuity an annual sum (feuduty) to theirsuperiors and ii. to observe conditions and limitations on the use of land (referred toin this paper as &quot;land conditions&quot;) which may be enforced - or waived, sometimes fora monetary consideration - by the superior alone.   A point of nomenclature whichsometimes gives rise to misunderstanding is the continued use of the terms &quot;superior&quot;and &quot;vassal&quot;;    there is the further complication that, as mentioned in paragraph 1,the same person may be both a vassal and a superior in a single feudal chain.   It willbe necessary in this paper to employ the terms &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;vassal&quot; (particularly the former) because they have a technical meaning which it is difficult to expresswith adequate precision in different words.   For practical purposes, however, &quot;vassal&quot;can often be replaced by &quot;proprietor&quot;, in the sense of the person having right to thedominium utile of land (cf paragraph   1 );   and the term &quot;proprietor&quot;, as used in this paper, should be interpreted in that way.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS4.     As indicated in paragraph   2,  the feudal system has over the centuries been substantially modified.   This process has continued in this century and there have beenimportant developments within the last decade.    In 1959 &quot;the Conservative Governmentappointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Reid to consider the case for introducing in Scotland registration of title to land.   Following the recommendations contained in the Report (Cmnd 2032) of that Committee in 19631 *he conservative government appointed in June 1964 a Committee on Conveyancing Legislation and Practiceunder the Chairmanship of Professor J M Halliday &quot;to examine and report on existing
IN CONFIDENCEconveyancing legislation and practice in relation to heritable and moveable property and to make recommendations with a view to amending or new legislation&quot;;   and theLabour Government appointed in August I965 a Committee under the Chairmanship of professor G L P Henry to prepare a detailed scheme for registration of title.   TheHalliday Committee&apos;s Report (Cmnd 3118), which was published in December 1966, not onlyrecommended various reforms relating to conveyancing legislation and practice but also made a number of suggestions for more fundamental changes in the law relating to land tenure;   and the Henry Committee&apos;s Report (Cmnd 4137), which was published in October1969, made specific proposals for a scheme of registration of title.5.     The Halliday Report met with a wide measure of approval from the legal profession and from bodies concerned with the sale and development of land;   arid theprevious Government introduced a Bill to implement some of its recommendations.   this measure received general Parliamentary support and became the Conveyancing and FeudalReform (Scotland) Act 1970.   In addition to introducing a new form of standardisedheritable security and simplifying conveyancing practice in a number of ways, the 1970Act brought about two important changes in the feudal system:-i.     It gave a vassal the right to apply to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland forthe variation or discharge of certain land conditions and it empowered the lands Tribunal to effect such variation or discharge (subject in certain cases to the payment of compensation by the vassal to the superior) if itconsidered the conditions in question to be unreasonable, inappropriate,unduly burdensome or impeding some reasonable use of the land,ii.     It gave a vassal whose feuduty is &quot;unallocated&quot; (which is the situationobtaining when a property subject to a single feuduty has- been sub-divided,but the proprietor of each part can still be called upon by the superior topay the whole feuduty) the right to secure from his superior, failing which from the Lands Tribunal, an allocation limiting his liability to paymentof his own share.
These changes removed features of the feudal system which were generally felt to be out of place in modern conditions.   The question of a major reform of the land tenuresystem remained to be tackled, as was made clear in the White Paper (Land Tenure inScotland - A Plan for Reform, Cmnd 4099) published by the previous Government inJuly 1969.6.     The present Government came into office in 1970 with a programme for Scotlandwhich included an undertaking to &quot;carry out a major reform of the system of land tenurein Scotland and abolish feuduty&quot;.   The Government recognise, however, that the radicalreform of arrangements which have existed for many centuries is an exceedingly complexmatter and they therefore wish to see a wide discussion of the problems involved andto have consultations with those principally concerned.   For this reason the Governmenthave decided to publish this Green Paper as a basis for such discussion andconsultations.
IN CONFIDENCEGREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION II - THE FEUDAL SYSTEM TODAYKAIN SURVIVING FEATURES7.    As indicated in paragraph 3j the most obvious surviving features of the feudalsystem in Scotland are i. the annual feuduty payable by the proprietor in respect of apiece of land and ii. the land conditions which may have been written into the feucharter relating to that land.   Neither of these can be said to be wholly a blessingor wholly an evil.TEE FEUDUTY8.     Historically, the feuduty represented the annual payment due to the superior inreturn for a grant of land which was held subject to such payment and to any other conditions contained in the original grant.   In other words, no initial payment (or only a nominal one) was made for the land, and the feuduty served as a kind ofperpetual ground rent.   Indeed, land is still occasionally conveyed without anycapital payment at all or with a nominal capital payment only.   Nowadays, however,this is certainly not general practice;   and it is doubtful whether the price paid bya present-day house purchaser is always less, because of his liability to pay feuduty,by an amount representing a capitalisation of that feuduty.9.     It should be borne in mind too that the amount of the feuduty (like most otherfeudal provisions) cannot be altered except by agreement between theparties.   If afeuduty was fixed many years ago, this means that, because of the fall in the valueof money, the burden on the vassal and the return to the superior have progressivelydecreased.   On the other hand, there has been an increase in real money terms in thelevel of new feuduties in recent years;   and, where a higher feuduty has not been reflected in any corresponding restriction of the purchase price of the property andthus has not served to spread the cost of acquisition, it clearly represents a continuing burden upon the proprietor for which he has received no equivalent return.IN CONFIDENCE
IN CONFIDENCELAND CONDITIONS10.    Land conditions are multifarious in nature.   The obligations and restrictions which are contained in most feu charters were no doubt generally reasonable and useful when they were first drawn up, and a great many of them remain so today.   this applies, for example, to some conditions designed to ensure that the property is kept in good repair or that the amenity of the area is preserved in one way or another;others, relating to properties in which more than one proprietor has an interest,provide that each pays a fair share of the cost of upkeep of those properties, and often they establish also a mechanism for their management and for the resolution of disputes.   Other feudal land conditions, however, have outlived their original useful-ness and have become merely unjustifiable restrictions upon the property.   For example,some restrict the materials which   may be used in the upkeep and repair of the property in a way which is no longer appropriate - perhaps by specifying slate or stone from aparticular quarry;   while others continue to prohibit some particular use of theproperty which, in view of changed circumstances, may now be reasonable.11.    The enforcement of land conditions has, moreover, become increasinglycontroversial.   A feudal condition is normally enforceable only by the superior;   a neighbouring proprietor, unless he has a specific right of enforcement (ius quaesitumtertio), has no standing, however great his practical interest may be.   This has ledto two main types of difficulty.   On the one hand, it has been open to a superioreither to prevent a proprietor from carrying out some reasonable development of his property by refusing to waive a land condition prohibiting such development or toagree to waive the condition only for a large payment.   On the other hand, difficulty has sometimes arisen from the very readiness of a superior to agree to a proprietor^request for a waiver of a land condition - for example, when the property concernedwas one of a number on a feudal estate and the waiving of the condition, althoughimmaterial to the superior himself, was inimical to the interests of neighbouringproprietors who had no say in the matter.   As noted at i. in paragraph 5t    one of the reforms brought about by the 1970 Act was to empower the Lands Tribunal to vary or
discharge land conditions in certain circumstances;   and the statutory procedure gives the Tribunal discretion to hear other interested parties, such as a co-vassal orneighbour, before reaching a decision.12.    Although the 1970 Act has thus ameliorated the situation by providing a remedy for an aggrieved proprietor, it remains the general position that the enforcement ofland conditions operates in an arbitrary manner - whether for good or for ill.   Somefeudal land conditions have provided what is in effect a type of private planningsystem, antedating the statutory planning law and now complementary with it, whichserves to benefit residential proprietors in particular by controlling development andpreserving amenity in ways which would not necessarily come within the ambit of normalplanning control.    Others, however, have inhibited proprietors unreasonably in the enjoyment and use of their property.   In short, although most superiors may choose to act reasonably and fairly in the enforcement of land conditions, there can be no guarantee under existing arrangements that the rights of superiors will necessarily be exercised in the general interest.    Inequity may arise not only from the harshenforcement of some particular land condition which is now outdated, but also from thefailure of a superior to enforce a condition which is still of real practical benefitto others.13.    In this connection it is relevant to note that there has been an increasingtendency for feudal superiorities to pass from individual persons to companies and large trusts of various kinds.   7.&apos;hen, as often in the past, the superiority was heldby a local land-owner, it was common for him to take a personal interest in the enforcement of land conditions, particularly those affecting the amenity of the area,as a whole.   When, however, the superior has no personal interest in the locality - and perhaps more particularly when the superior is a corporate body of some kind whoseprimary interest in the feu is, naturally enough, a financial one - it is only to beexpected that the superior will be less concerned to enforce land conditions and indeedthat he will be less likely even to be aware whether such conditions are beingobserved.
ASSESSMENT OF tee present WORKING of THE FEUDAL SY15TEK14.    It is against this background that one must try to form some total assessment of the working of the feudal system in Scotland today.   There are of course arguments in its favour.   The feudal system has in practice proved able to accommodate mostforms of land use and development.   It has provided a simple mechanism for establishing conditions to run with land, many of which have been beneficial in their effect.   The fact that the proprietor of land which is feued can hold it in perpetuity,subject always to payment of the feuduty and observance of any land conditions, msansthat he has security of tenure;   and, this being so, the feudal system does not giverise to the type of social problem which can occur, for example, at the termination ofa long lease.15.     On the other hand, the feudal system undoubtedly suffers from serious disadvantages.   The feuduty, whether or not it serves as a method of enabling the purchaser of property to spread his capital costs over a lengthy period, is certainly not always regarded in that light by the purchaser himself, who indeed is rarely given any choice   0 f   whether or not he pays feuduty.   In practice,        feuduty is increasingly becoming resented as simply an unjustified burden.   For the reasons givenin paragraph  13   land conditions are more likely than formerly to be enforced onlyerratically, and sometimes they are unjustifiably operated in a restrictive way.Furthermore, as the Halliday Committee pointed out, the fact that the feudal systempermits the creation of a multi-tier structure of land ownership undoubtedly complicate the practice of conveyancing;   and this can result in additional expense and inconvenience to buyers and sellers alike.16.    The Halliday Committee canvassed the possibility of Modifying the objectionablefeatures of the feudal system, while still retaining its basic structure, and they suggested that on balance such modification might be preferable to abolition of thewhole system of feuing.   As they were at pains to explain, however, this view was formed primarily from the fairly narrow standpoint of conveyancing practice, whereas the pattern of land tenure in the future must be determined by wider caonsiderations and (as the Halliday Report put it) &quot;the system of conveyancing must adapt itself to
tenure and not tenure to conveyancing.&quot;   The Government are of opinion that any effective modification of the feudal system would present very much the same problemsas would arise       from total abolition of the system - for example,problems relating to the termination of the payment of feuduty and to thepreservation and enforcement of feudal conditions;   while modification, as distinct from abolition, would inevitably leave intact the framework of a system of complexmulti-tier ownership of land which is unacceptable on social grounds in the latter part of the twentieth century.17.    The Government consider that, in these circumstances, the major reform of land tenure to which they are committed must involve the abolition of feudal tenure.   It isimportant, however, that this should be carried out in a way which is fair tosuperiors and vassals alike - superiorities are of course an entirely legitimate formof investment in land - and that the good points of the present arrangements shouldbe preserved so far as possible.   The s\ibsequent sections of this paper outline pro-posals designed to achieve these ends.
GREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION III - ABOLITION OF FEUDUTYINTRODUCTION18,    From the date of the abolition of feudal tenure no new feuing will be permitted.Any writ executed thereafter which purports to grant a feu will be invalid and willDOt. be recorded in the General Register of Sasines.19.   The abolition of feudal tenure will of course include the abolition of existingfeuduties.   Since, however, this will relieve the proprietor of land of a continuingobligation to pay and will at the same time deprive the superior of income from areputable investment, it is clearly right that there should be arrangements for payment of compensation by the vassal which are fair to both parties.   Many charitableand similar organisations derive income from feuduties, which means that inadequatecompensation would penalise the wider public who benefit from their activities.EHMS OF REDEMPTION OF FEUDUTY20.    The Government consider that it would be inappropriate for them to specify inthis paper any precise basis of compensation;   and indeed no decision on this has yetbeen taken.   As has already been indicated, however, their aim is to be fair to bothsuperior and vassal.   In reaching a conclusion about compensation, the following areamonp the points which will, have to be borne in mind:-i.     Whether a fair basis generally would be a capital sum which would yield an income equivalent to the amount of the feuduty.i i -.     Whether some different formula would be appropriate in respect of a verysmall feuduty.iii.     Whether th* amount of compensation should be adjusted in any way to take account of the cost of collection or any other considerationsfsuch as the unusualcase where the current value of the land is not sufficient to provide adequatesecurity for payment of the feuduty).IN CONFIDENCE
iv.     Whether there axe any special considerations affecting compensation inconnection with an unallocated feuduty.    (The Government&apos;s provisional view is that there should be provision for deemed allocation of the unallocatedfeuduty on the general lines of the scheme of allocation contained in the1970 Act.)21.    Subject to the Government&apos;s basic requirement of equitable treatment forsuperior and vassal, the views of interested parties are invited on the general question of possible terms of redemption of feuduty and specifically on the pointsset out in paragraph 2 0 .  These points should not, however, be regarded as exhaustive;they are listed merely in order to initiate discussion.METHOD OF REDEMPTION OF FEUDUTY22.    Whatever basis may be fixed for the redemption value of feuduties, the question will arise of the method by which the redemption value should be paid.   The government intend that, on a day to be appointed, feuduty as such will be abolished and the superior&apos;s right to receive feuduty will be converted into a simple right to obtainpayment of the redemption value from his former vassal.   The relationship will then become one of secured creditor and debtor.   It would not be reasonable, however, to expect every proprietor to be able to pay the redemption value immediately, and theGovernment propose that the arrangements for redemption should incorporate thefollowing features:-i.     Payment will be due on the appointed day, but a proprietor should beallowed to choose before then whether to pay in a lump sum or by instalments.   If he failed to exercise his choice by the appointed day, hewould be deemed to have opted to pay by instalments over the fullredemption period (subject, however, to what is said in paragraph 2 6 ).ii.     There must be a terminal date, on or before which the redemption value musthave been paid in full (whether by lump sum or by instalments),iii.     The redemption period (the period between the appointed day and the terminal date) must not be too lengthy.   It is undesirable that theprocess of moving over to the new arrangements should be allowed to take
IN CONFIDENCEj, longer than is strictly necessary.   The Halliday Committee envisagedextinguishing feuduties over a period of 60 years.   The Government, however,feel that a redemption period of not more than 20 years would best serve the general interest,iv.    The redemption value of every feuduty should be fixed as at the appointed day.   Where it is paid by instalments, these will be calculated as a fixed annuity.   This will have the advantage of certainty in thatintervening changes in interest rates will be ignored.23.   Redemption by lump sum has the obvious merit of simplicity.   Some proprietorswould have the necessary capital readily available to enable them to adopt this method and others would be in a position to borrow for the purpose.   On the other hand, therewould be some who could not pay a lump sum without financial embarrassment and whowould find difficulty in raising a loan, either because of their personalcircumstances or because of a scarcity of funds for lending.24.   Redemption by instalments has the disadvantage of lengthening the redemptionprocess.   Furthermore, until redemption is complete, the proprietor would be payingto the superior total instalments greater than the amount of his former feuduty.Undoubtedly, however, there will be many who prefer to redeem by instalments ratherthan to pay immediately what might be a sixbstantial capital sum.25.    A scheme whereby a proprietor was given the general option of choosing betweenredemption by lump sum and redemption by instalments might work as follows.   Thelength of the redemption period would bo fixeds sayt at 20 years;   and at the appointed day the proprietor would know the redemption value of his feuduty (which, as explainedat iv. in paragraph 2 2 , would not thereafter change).   If the proprietor chose to effect redemption by lump sum, he would have to do so forthwith.   Alternatively, hewould start to pay by instalments, on the basis that payment must be completed by theend of the redemption period. s26.    The Government consider that, where a proprietor has initially elected to paythe redemption value by instalments, he should always have the option, on givingnotice, of completing payment at the next term day.   They take the view also that, on
IN CONFIDENCEtl   &apos;first sale of the land after the appointed day, payment of any outstandingbalance of the redemption value should fall due.   The Government do not considerthat, in the circumstances of a sale, any financial hardship is likely to arise froman obligation to complete redemption.   This obligation, however, would not apply onthe occasion of a transfer of property otherwise than by sale, for example when   a widow succeeds to the house of her late husband.27,    The views of all interested parties are invited on the method of redemption offeuduty.   In particular, comments will be welcomed on the suggestions made in this paper about the maximum length for the redemption period and about the optionalmethods of repayment which might be offered to proprietors.MISCELLANEOUS ADDITIONAL POINTS28.    As the land itself is at present security for the payment of feuduty to the superior, it will be necessary to continue this -security, from the beginning of theredemption period, by means of a statutory security over the property for the amountof the redemption value due to the superior.   A formal discharge of the redemptionvalue would be recorded in the General Register of Sasines when redemption is complete,either in a separate document or by endorsement on the last recorded title deed.29.     The superior will have the remedies available to the holder of a standardsecurity to enforce payment;   irritancy and other feudal remedies will no longer becompetent.   Provision will be necessary also in cases of property subject to aliferent to secure equitable treatment as between the liferenter and the fiar.30.     Where the superior is liable to pay feuduty to an over-superior, both superiorswould have a statutory security over the same land and it will be necessary to providefor their ranking.   It would obviously be unfair if a vassal, having paid in full theredemption value to his own superior,were subsequently called upon by the over-superior to pay him the full redemption value of the over-feuduty.   To cope with this problemit may be necessary to provide for a deemed allocation of the over-feuduty among theformer vassals of the mid-superiority.   This would have the effect of restricting theredemption value which an over-superior could claim from any single sub-vassal.   Whereover-superiorities do exist, it is to be hoped that, when a vassal completes payment
of the redemption value to his own superior, a practical arrangement could be made whereby the over-sup-.prior also would endorse the discharge for his interest in theland concerned.   Similarly, arrangements would have to be made to safeguard theposition of a heritable creditor in a security over a superiority estate.
IN CONFIDENCEGREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION IV - THE FUTURE OF EXISTING LAND CONDITIONSINTRODUCTION31.    Although the ending of feudal tenure will necessarily bring about theabolition of feuduty, it is a more open question whether it should involve thecomplete termination of the land conditions which constitute the other main feature of the system.   The ability to establish enforceable conditi&apos;,&apos;.s which run with theland - and thus provide a desirable measure of stability - is widely regarded as an advantage of the Scottish system of land tenure.32.    As has been brought out in paragraphs 10 - 13 , these land conditions (whichmay be operated     among co-vassals as well as between superior and vassal) are manyand various.   Some serve a valuable purpose;   others have been rendered obsolete bythe passage of time and by the development of statutory provision in the planning,building and public health fields.   A mechanism for getting rid of unreasonable andinappropriate land conditions has been provided by the19 7 0   Act but this involves a separate application to the lands tribunal in each case and it can do no more than produce a partial solution of theproblem.   Moreover, even where land conditions are beneficial, their value dependsvery largely upon the extent to which they are enforced by the superior;   and the likelihood of such enforcement has in many cases been reduced because to an increasing extent the superior is simply an investor with no personal interest inthe locality.33.    The ending of the payment of feuduty will break the direct financial tie betweensuperior and proprietor and it seems reasonable to suppose that this will furtherreduce the likelihood of land conditions being enforced.   In these circumstances, theGovernment do not consider it appropriate that former superiors as such shouldcontinue to be entitled to enforce whatever land conditions may survive afterfeuduties have ceased to be payable.ARRANGEMENTS FOR PRESERVATION OF FEUDAL LAND CONDITIONS34.    The previous Administration&apos;.&quot;. White Paper (referred to in paragraph 5)suggested that land conditions which satisfied a criterion of &quot;continuing usefulness&quot;
should be allowed to remain enforceable, but that the right of enforcement should pass to a category of &quot;affected proprietors&quot;, for example owners of neighbouring land.The Government have given careful thought to the concept of conditions of &quot;continuingusefulness&quot; (such as conditions designed to safeguard amenity), but have concluded that it would not be practicable to formulate that concept in a satisfactory generalstatutory definition.   In the first place the diversity in land conditions is too great;   and secondly a particular type of condition might be amply justified inrelation to one piece of land but not in relation to another.35.    &apos;^he Government do accept that some land conditions are worthy of preservation.They suggest, however, different arrangements both for determining which land,conditions should be preserved and for their future enforcement.36.    There are cogent arguments in favour of a basic presumption that, from a dateappointed by statute, existing land conditions enforceable only by the superior should become void.   Land conditions enforceable among proprietors and servitudes which imposeby agreement rights enforceable by the proprietor of one piece of land against theproprietor of ether land will not be affected.37.     In the Government1 s view, hov/ever, there is probably a good case for expresslycontinuing: by statute a limited number of specific types of condition at presentenforceable only by the superior.   It is arguable also that there should be some provision for the more general retention of such conditions.   Three possiblearrangements are described in paragraphs 38-47*i.      Possible continuation by statute of certain types of feudal land condition38.    As has been indicated in paragraph  34* the Government do not think it practicable to create a blanket saving for all land conditions of &quot;continuingusefulness&quot;.   They do, however, take the view that a saving might be made forconditions which relate to the upkeep and repair of property in which more than oneproprietor has an interest and which are enforceable only by the superior (andnot directly by co-vassals).   Conditions of this type, providing a basis for agreement on necessary repairs and apportionment of expenditure, are to be found,for example, in tenement property.   It could be to the disadvantage of the proprietors
themselves if such conditions v/ere permitted to lapse, and they might therefore be preserved on the basis that the affected proprietors would be given the right of enforcement.39,    The Government do not consider that it would be practicable to extend theprinciple of specific statutory savings much beyond this fairly narrow field.   Theremay, hov/ever, be a few other limited and readily definable types of land condition which could appropriately be treated in similar fashion and any suggestions for these will be carefully considered.40.     Under the basic presumption referred to in paragraph 36,   all other landconditions at present enforceable only by the superior would simply be allowed tolapse.   An arrangement of this sort would have the merit of being comprehensive andspeedy.   It would reduce any risk of confusion about which land conditions were stilleffective and which not.   It would mean that in future a proprietor would not besubject to non-statutory restrictions on the use of his land deriving from a systemof land tenure which had itself been abolished.ii.     Possible continuation of particular feudal land conditions by specificapplication to the Lands Tribunal41.    It can be argued, however, that, under the arrangements described inparagraphs   38 - 40 , some land conditions of benefit to proprietors (apart from anyclasses which might be specially saved by statute) would lapse together with conditions which were clearly inappropriate and that simply to allow the generality of feudal land conditions to become void would be going   too   far .      Forexample,    some   land   conditions   have   served   to   preserve   the   character   of whole streets by prohibiting the sub-division of houses and others have had the effectof preserving a high standard of amenity over fairly extensive built-up areas.   Thesystem of land conditions has also facilitated the use of land for specific charitableor educational purposes.142.    An alternative arrangement which would make it possible for particular landconditions to be preserved might work on the following lines.   Legislation couldinprovide that any feudal land condition   (other than those/classes statutorily saved)
jould full unions before an appointed day an application to preserve the conditiondad been made to the Lands Tribunal.   If such an application were so made and upheld,the condition would continue to run with the land.   This right to apply to the lands tribunal for preservation of a specific land condition might rest with the proprietor,any co-proprietor or any other person (such as an adjoining proprietor) who couldsatisfactorily shew an interest in the continuation of the condition.   The lands tribunal might have power to reject the application, if the condition was one whichthey would have waived if an application to that effect had been made to them under the1970 Act, or to preserve the condition, either in perpetuity or for a limited periodonly.   V/here the Lands Tribunal approved the preservation of a condition, title toenforce it would vest in the party who made the application and would pass tosuccessors in title.43,   It seems clear, however, that the sort of arrangement described in paragraph 4?would involve serious drawbacks.   It would compel proprietors to go to the trouble and expense of searching their own and other proprietors titles if they wished to prevent any risk of loss of possible advantages;   it might lead to a rush of applications tothe Lands Tribunal (many being merely precautionary) before the expiry of the time-limitand it would place upon the Tribunal the difficult task of applying in the abstract,rather than in the context of concrete proposals affecting a particular condition, the1970 Act criteria about what constitutes, for instance, reasonable use of land.Moreover, it would have the very unfortunate consequence that either the abolition offeuduty would itself have to be postponed until the expiry of the period allowed for application to the Tribunal (which might have to be several years after enactment ofthe legislation) or there would be an interval of time during which there would be a(ireat deal of uncertainty about which land conditions were still enforceable and by whom, since the superior1s title to enforce would disappear with the abolition offeuduty (seeparagraph 3 3).jii.   Possible continuation of feudal land conditions with enforcement by &quot;Qualifiedproprietors&quot;44.    A third possibility would be a scheme whereby land conditions at presentenforceable only by the superior would be retained, but would instead be enforceable
by certain proprietors (as defined in paragraph 45 ) and would be liable toextinction by agreement or by application to the Lands Tribunal.45.   The White 1-aper published by the previous Administration proposed that conditions should be enforced by &quot;proprietors likely to be affected by breach of a condition&quot;,and it went on to suggest that this category of affected proprietors could be definedperhaps by reference to &quot;the geographical proximity of their land&quot;.   There are,however, obvious objections to allowing the rights of enforcement of a single superior to pass in this way to any extensive group of neighbours.   The Government are moreattracted to the view that, in any such scheme, enforcement rights should be restricted to a smaller category of &quot;qualified proprietors&quot;.   This category might comprise only those persons who satisfied the tests both that they had formerly been the superior, ora co-vassal, of the owner of the burdened land and that they owned land sharing acommon boundary (which for this purpose might inclxide a public road) v/ith the burdenedland.   However, satisfaction of the tv/o tests would establish only a proprietor^ title to enforce conditions;   he would, in addition, require to shew that he had an interestto enforce them.46.    If feudal land conditions were to be retained in this way, there would need tobe a simple procedure for securing their extinction where they became inappropriate.One possibility would be to permit a property owner to make application to the lands tribunal to discharge a specified condition or conditions burdening his land, servingcopies on all &quot;qualified proprietors&quot;.   The Lands Tribunal might then be permitted to grant the application without a proof unless a &quot;qualified proprietor&quot; chose to oppose it.   In addition, the rules of law relating to prescription of rights might be altered to facilitate the removal of obsolete conditions.47.    An arrangement on the lines described in paragraphs   4 4-46 would avoid oneserious disadvantage of the scheme set out in paragraph   4 2    in that it need notoccasion any period of uncertainty or delay in the abolition of feuduty.   It would,however, have certain other drawbacks.   In particular, it would mean that a very largenumber of feudal land conditions would, initially at least, remain intact and that
(thereafter the erosion of the main body of feudal conditions would be spasmodic andslov/ - with the result that little early progress would be practicable in reducingthe burden involved in searching titles in the course of conveyancing transactions.Moreover, it must be recognised that enforcement rights would rest not in a singlesuperior but in a plurality of &quot;qualified proprietors&quot; who would in effect be givenpowers which hitherto only their superior had possessed.48.    The different approaches described in paragraphs 38-40, 41-43 and 44-4.7are put forward as a basis for discussion.   The Government would be glad toreceive comments on them.MISCELLANEOUS ADDITIONAL POINTS49.    Conditions in a contract of ground annualThis section of the paper has referred specifically to feudal conditions because theseform the majority of land conditions.   The proposals would, however, apply equally to conditions enforceable by the creditor in a contract of ground annual (seei. inparagraph 55,   and paragraph 56).50.    Rights of reversion, redemption and pre-emptionFeudal titles are occasionally granted subject to rights of reversion, redemption orpre-emption.   Under a right of reversion, the land reverts to the superior in certainstated circumstances (for example, if it is no longer used for the express purpose forwhich it was ciginally feued);   where a power of redemption is reserved, the superiormay buy the property at any time on payment of a price which is normally (but not always) fixed by agreement or arbitration;   a power of pre-emption in effect gives the superior &quot;first option&quot; to buy the property (usually at market value or at theactual price offered for it) if the proprietor wishes to dispose of it.   TheGovernment are inclined to the view that these various rights and powers should becomevoid on the abolition of feudal tenure, subject in appropriate cases to the payment ofcompensation to the former superior.   It might be argued, however, that, if provision ismade for the continuation of other types of feudal land condition under one or other ofthe arrangements described in paragraphs 3 8 -47,   there should be some similar
Cprovision for continuation of existing rights of reversion, redemption and pre-emptionat least in certain cases.   Comments will be welcomed on the general question of thetreatment of such rights.51.   Mineral rightsWhen land is feued, minerals are frequently reserved to the superior even where thereis no real prospect of their being worked.   After the abolition of feuduty the formersuperior will usually have no interest in exercising his right to the minerals and itis for consideration whether rights to the minerals should be left to be heldseparately from the ownership of the land.   If a separate estate of minerals were tobo retained, a record of this separate interest would have to be maintained as aseparate title, which could cause unnecessary complications in the majority ofconveyancing transactions.   One way of dealing with this night be to make itnecessary for a superior who wished to retain his interest in reserved minerals to notify the vassal accordingly.   If he failed to do so, it would be assumed that he accepted the compensation for redemption of feuduty as covering the reserved rights,and the right to the minc-als would vest automatically in the proprietor of the land;if he gave the notice, the minerals would remain vested in him as proprietor of the separate interest in minerals.   The further question then arises whether the formersuperior should be required to record a new title to the hitherto reserved minerals,or whether his right to them should rest upon the reservation in the original feucharter or contract.5 2.   Statutory arrangements the proposed arrangements in regard to feudal land conditions would leave intact theexisting statutory arrangements whereby an owner of land may voluntarily submit to restrictions on the use of his land by agreement recorded in the General Register ofSasines and enforceable against the owner and his successors at the instance of public bodies such as the local planning authority or the Forestry Commission.
GREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION V - OTHER FORMS OF LAND TENURE AND OTHER MONETARY BURDENS ON LANDINTRODUCTION53. Although most land in Sootland is held on feudal tenure, certain otherancient forms of tenure have survived, more or less unchanged, to the present day.   Like feudal tenure, some of these involve annual monetary payments orthe creation of land conditions or both, with the possibility of dispossessionif the proprietor does not pay the appropriate duty or observo the conditions.In addition, there still exist various kinds of perpetual money burdens on land,not neoessarily connected with the actual form of tenure of the land.   Some ofthese other types of tenure and money burdens are described briefly inparagraphs 5 4 and 5 5 .   (Leasehold is dealt with in Section VI.)OTHER FORMS CF LAND TENURE54. Other surviving forms of land tenure include the following:-i.  Udal tenure, which is one of the oldest surviving forms of land tenure, is found in Orkney and Shetland and dates back to thesettling there of &quot;odal&quot; families from Norway; these familiesappear to have been under two obligations - to take up arms in defence of their country and to pay a &quot;skat&quot; or land tax.   Skat was atfirst a payment in kind; nowadays, however, it is invariably a moneypayment (often a very small one) to the udal overlord, which was relatedoriginally to the price of such produce as butter, malt and meal,ii.   Kindly tenancy or &quot;kyndnes&quot; constitutes a form of tenure under whichthe tenants or rentallers have full proprietorship of the land,although they do not possess a formal written title.   Entry in therental book of the landlord is accepted as proof of ownership.   the proprietors cannot be dispossessed so long as they pay the rent; andthey are entitled to dispose of their land at any time.   This form of tenure was at one time fairly widespread throughout Scotland, but itis now found only in the Four Towns of Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire.
TIT nPTOTiMTilfiWaiii.     So-called tenancies at will (although this is an English rather than a scottish term) are still found in parts of north-east Scotland and ofthe Highlands and Islands.   Under this form of tenancy the builder ofa house or other premises rents, usually for a nominal sum, the pieoeof ground on which he builds, without any deed regulating the rights of either party except an entry in the estate book of the landlord.   Thisarrangement has sometimes given rise to difficulty irs modern times becauseloans for building purposes cannot usually be raised on the securityof a tenancy at will,iv.    The terms burgage tenure and mortification are still found in some titledeeds.   Holdings on these forms of tenure, however, have largelybeen converted to the feudal system.   Mention should be made also ofblench holding, which is a purely feudal form of tenure differing fromthe normal form merely in that the land is held subject to payment of a nominal sum only, eg &quot;a penny, if asked&quot;.OTHER MONEY BURDHNS UPON LAND55. other types of nrr^jrburdens upon land include the following:-i.     Ground annuals are common, although few new contracts of this type havebeen created in recent years.   The deed of contract normally providesfor payment of   a   ground    annual    in perpetuity and usually containsland conditions similar to those in a feu charter.   The relationshipofcreated, however, is one of debtor and creditor, rather than/vassal andsuperior.   The annual payment is frequently quite substantial,ii.     Multures were originally payments in grain, exigible under the obligationknown as thirlage which required proprietors of specified lands to have their grain ground at a particular mill.   This obligation still remainseven where the mill no longer exists, but the multuresnow take   the formof an annual money payment,iil.    Teinds were originally the proportion which was made over to the church of profits from land.    When in course of time the right to reoeive teinds
passed into secular hands, statutory provision was made for the owners of the teinds to pay out of them an annual stipend to the clergy, while retaining the surplus.   The payment of teinds is still extensive.THE FUTURE OF NON-FEUDAL FORMS OF LAND TENURE AND MONEY BURDENS UPON LAND56. These and similar minor forms of land holding and of burdens on land areinteresting historical survivals, but they make conveyancing more complicatedthan it need be and less exact than it ought to be.   They often display thesame disadvantages as the feudal system in requiring perpetual T)ayments or imposingrestrictive conditions which may inhibit desirable development.   The government propose, therefore, that these forms of tenure and of burdens on land should bebrought to an end at the same time as the feudal system, thus enabling a uniformsystem of land tenure to be introduced.   They consider that, in general, whereeither perpetual payments or land conditions or both are involved, these shouldbe treated in the same way as feuduties and feudal land conditions and that payments should be redeemed and land conditions be subject to discharge on the general lines of sections III and IV.   Where neither payments nor land conditions are involved, provision would simply be made for the tenure in question to be converted to the proposed new form of land ownership.57.  The Government are aware that the land held on some of these minor holdingsis not always clearly defined.   For example, sometimes entry in the estate rentalbook is the only proof of entitlement and, if no clear estate plan has been maintained, there may be no written evidence of the boundaries.   It may thereforebe necessary to make provision for the drawing up of estate plans and for ensuring that the boundaries are agreed before conversion of the holdings to a new system can take place.58. The legislation proposed in this paper will not affect the existing law relating to the tenure of crofts and other subjects under the Crofters Acts, to whichthe Government are giving separate consideration; nor will title proposed legislationaffeot the tenure of holdings held by landholders or statutory small tenants underthe Small Landholders Acts, or agricultural holdings held under the agricultural holdings Acts.
(59. The Government will welcome comments relating to non-feudal forms of land tenure or money burdens upon land and will of course be ready to give furtherconsideration to any particular circumstances which may be brought to notice in regard to any such form of tenure or money burden.
IN CONFIDENCEGREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION VI - LEASEHOLDPOTENTIAL EFFECT ON LEASEHOLD OF THE ABOLITION OF FEUDAL TENURE60.    The abolition of feudal tenure will not of course remove the need on occasion to lease property rather than to buy or sell it outright.   This is so both for private individuals, who may wish to take a lease of residential property for a limited time,and for firms, which may wish to lease rather than purchase office or factoryaccommodation.   The abolition of feudal   tenure, however, v/ill undoubtedly carry with it implications for the future of leasehold in Scotland.61.    From the point of view of the landowner, there are potential advantages inleasing his property rather than selling it.   He may receive a capital payment forthe grant of the lease;   if the lease is a very long one, he will receive a quasi-perpetual payment;   if, as is common, the lease contains a provision for breaks at intervals when the rent can be reviewed, he will be able, by increasing the rent, to share in any rise in the value of his property;   and, when the property eventuallyreverts to him at the termination of the lease, he may stand to gain from improvements which have been made to it by the tenant during the currency of the lease.   Equally,there may be advantages for the tenant.   He will not have to find so much capital toobtain the leasehold as to buy the property;    in return for his rent he may be relieved of some of the normal duties and expenses of ownership;   and, at least inthe early years of a long lease, he may feel that his enjoyment and use of theproperty are not very different from what they would have been if he had bought it.62.    Moreover, the potential of a lease for allowing some continuing control of theland for planning purposes is attractive to some landowners.   The landlord may imposeenforceable conditions on leased property, for example in relation to its use andappearance.   If such conditions are breached, or if the rent is not paid, the remedies open to the landlord are very similar in effect (although not always inname) to those available to a feudal superior if his vassal is in breach of a feudalland condition or has failed to pay the feuduty.   In other words, there are features of leasehold which differ little in practical effect from corresponding features ofthe feudal system.___ IN CONFIDENCE
63.     Given the attractions of leasehold (particularly for the landlord) and thesimilarity in practice between the position of the landlord in a long lease and thatof the feudal superior, it seems reasonable to suppose that, if they could no longerdispose of land by feuing, some landowners would seek to retain most of theadvantages of feuing (and perhaps gain some additional advantages into the bargain)by adopting long leasehold.   If this were to happen to any appreciable extent, the objects of the legislation abolishing feudal tenure would be frustrated.   Against this background consideration must inevitably be given to the possible need to imposelimitations upon the leasehold system in the context of abolition of feudal tenure.SOCIAL OBJECTIONS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF LEASE64.    In the Government&apos;s view there are valid social objections to many residentiallong leases, and especially to leases of undeveloped land for house-building.   Thelegal principle is that any buildings erected on ground leased by a landlord revert tohim when the lease terminates, whether or not he met any of the cost of theirconstruction.   One result of this can be that a tenant may not fully realise untilthe terminal date of his lease is approaching that the house which he occupies,which he may have built (or at least improved, extended or maintained) from his own resources, and which indeed he has perhaps come to think of as his own, will revert to his landlord, who is often not liable to pay compensation;   and obviously this may cause hardship.   Moreover, as the terminal date of a lease approaches, a householderwho does realise that he is only a tenant will naturally become less ready to maintainthe property, which may deteriorate seriously.   Social disadvantages of this sort ledto the enactment of the Long Leases (Scotland) Act 1954 under which certain tenantsunder long leases could for a limited period require their landlords to grant feurights of the property.PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS IN LEASEHOLD6 5.    Residential LeasesThe chief argument in favour of residential leases, and in particular of residentiallong leases, is that they allow the creation of conditions for the good management and maintenance of an estate, the preservation of amenities and related purposes;
in confidence&apos;t, if it remains possible to attach such conditions to land under the proposed new system of ownership, leasehold will not be required for that purpose.   On the otherhand, the letting of houses and flats, which is in any case already extensivelycontrolled by the Kent Acts, must clearly continue to be possible.   The llallidayCoRiiittee took the view that &quot;the use of long leasehold tenure of dwelling-house property should be strongly discouraged&quot;.   In view, however, of the hardship andresentment often resulting from leases of this type, and because of their potentialuse for effectively perpetuating the feudal system under another name, it would seemreasonable to go even further and to prohibit long residential leases entirely.   Such a prohibition would operate against the creation of any residential property on land heldon a long lease (whether or not it was subject also to a sub-lease, of whateverduration).   For the purposes of this   paper , it is proposed to assume that theprohibition might relate to all residential leases for a term in excess of 20 years orliable to extension beyond that period by virtue of an option to renew, and thefollowing paragraphs of this section are framed on that assumption.   It is thought thata restriction of this sort would not have any discernible effect on current acceptableletting practices;   and it would not be the intention to prevent the holding of residential accommodation in liferent.66.   Non-Residential LeasesThe previous Administration^ White Paper recognised that non-residential leases hadvaluable features and were widely used in the conveyancing of commercial and industrialproperties, but it went on to propose that there should be a 60-year limit on suchleases.   Non-residential long leases are largely free from the social objections to residential long leases - industrial and commercial tenants, unlike residentialtenants, normally have the advice and resources to enable them to make appropriatefinancial provision for the termination of the tenancy.   The Government for their parttake the view that to impose a limit on the length of non-residential leases would tendto inhibit economic development in Scotland and that it would be wrong to introduce any statutory restriction which is not absolutely necessary.   They therefore do not proposeto place any limit on purely non-residential leases.67.   In order, however,  to prevent leases originally granted for non-residentialpurposes from acquiring a residential character, it would be made a statutoryrequirement that all leases for a period of more than 20 years (hereafter
referred to simply as &quot;long leases&quot;) must incorporate in their terms a condition thatthere should be no residential use of any part of the subjects covered by the lease.The purpose of this requirement would not be to render such changes of use impossible -they will sometimes be justifiable or even desirable economically or socially - but rather to ensure that, where they occur and the parties desire to continue in a lease-hold relationship, the lease would be subject to the restrictions on residentialleases.   This is considered further in paragraph 72.68.    There is one further point which should be made about non-residential leases.It is sometimes necessary for predominantly commercial or industrial subjects toinclude a relatively small residential component for the express use of an employeewhose presence on the property is essential (for example a manager&apos;s flat in a hotel).The Government propose that it should be permissible to include a residentialcomponent of this kind in a non-residential lease.69.    Mixed Residential and Non-Residential DevelopmentsBecause it is proposed to place restrictions on residential leases but not on non-residential leases, it will be necessary to determine what arrangements should applywhere it is desired to create a mixed development of residential and non-residential property.   There is no doubt that mixed development (say, shops with flats above them)is sometimes socially desirable - for example in town centres, in order to ensure thatthese areas are not limited to commercial use and thus left devoid of activity afterbusiness hours.   On the other hand, it would not be right to allow a lease for mixeddevelopment to be used as a method of evading the suggested prohibition on residentiallong leases.70.     The Government take the view that, because of the complications that might beexpected to flow from mixed leases when there were statutory restrictions on purelyresidential leases, the balance of advantage lies in prohibiting also any mixedresidential and non-residential long lease.   This will not of course make mixeddevelopment impossible.   Where a mixed development consists of neighbouring non-and residentialresidential/subjects on separate plots of land, it will always be practicable -
whatever the form of the developer&apos;s title and whether or not the land lias alreadybeen developed to some extent - to grant either a lease or an outright conveyance ofthe non-residential subjects and to grant either a short lease (for not more than 20years) or an outright conveyance of the residential subjects.   Even where the mixedresidential and non-residential development takes place on a single site - as in thecommon case of shops with houses above them - there seems no reason for a mixed longlease  to    form an essential part of the development arrangements.   Conveyancingprocedures and contract documentation can be devised to meet each of the various types of situation which might be encountered.   In short, the Government are satisfied thatthe prohibition of mixed residential and non-residential long leases would not giverise to any insuperable conveyancing problems;   nor in their view need it in any wayinhibit desirable development.   It would on the other hand have the advantage of creating a comprehensive, uniform legal structure.71.     Defective leasesAs has been said in paragraph 67, it will be a requirement that every longlease must include in its terms a condition forbidding any residential use of any partof the leased subjects.   If it does not contain such a condition, it will be what is referred to in this paper as a &quot;defective lease&quot;.   Since it is the intention alsothat long leases should beregistrable     in a prescribed standard form(paragraph  7 7)* defective leases are unlikely to occur frequently.   If neverthelessa defective lease    is     granted,   the Government propose that at any time during the currency of the lease the tenant of any residential property covered bythe lease (whether existing at the date of the lease or appearing later by constructionor by change of use) should have the right, at his option, either (a) to have thedefective lease replaced by a lease for a term, running from the date of the exerciseof the option, of either 20 years or the purported remaining term of the lease(whichever is less), subject to any relevant provisions of the Rent Acts and otherwiseon the terms and conditions of the original lease;   or (b) to convert the residentialpart of the d e fective lease to ownership, with compensation to the landlord for thevalue of the property assessed as at the date of granting of the lease and under
deduction of any capital sum already paid by the tenant.   In order to allow a landlordwho may have granted a defective lease to regularise his position as soon as possible,he would be permitted to serve notice on the tenant requiring him to exercise the option within a period of, say, 6 months;   and, if the tenant failed to do so, hewould be deemed to have chosen course (a).   Provision would be needed also for anycase involving a sub-lease.72.   Change of use the proposal that all long leases should contain an express prohibition on residentialuse, coupled with the suggested rules about defective leases, would serve to protect the tenant against any risk arising from the possibility that he might unwittingly findhimself the occupier of residential premises held on a long lease.   There may beoccasions, however,r, when because of some change in circumstances the tenant of non-residential property himself wishes to change to a residential use of the property.    Itwould then be open to him to seek to reach agreement with the landowner either thatthe property should be conveyed to him outright or that he should be given a lease ofit for a term of not more than 20 years. - If, however, the tenant were simply to change the use of the premises contrary to the express prohibition in the original lease, hewould be in breach of that lease, and the penalty would be that the property wouldrevert to the landlord.EXISTING LEASES73.   Provision will be needed to bring certain existing leases into line with theseproposals.   A very long residential lease is for most practical purposes the equivalent of a feu and it would seem appropriate that such a lease should be dealt with as if itwere in fact a feudal holding.   It is suggested, therefore^ that, in the case ofany residential lease with more than 60 years to run from the day appointed forthe abolition of feudal tenure, parallel arrangements should be introduced.   Thiswould mean that the property held on any such lease would be converted to the tenant&apos;sownership and the tenant would become liable to pay compensation to the formerlandlord as if the rent were simply the equivalent of a feuduty.   (No allowance
( IN CONFIDENCEv/ould need to be made for any reversion value because the reversion date would be sofar distant.)   The compensation figure would be regarded in the same way as theredemption value of a feuduty;   and the former tenant would have the same methods of repayment open to him - in particular, he could choose before the appointed daywhether to pay by lump sum or by instalments and he would be required to completepayment before assigning the lease.   Leasehold conditions would be treated as if they/ere feudal land conditions.74*   The parallel with feudal arrangements does not apply in the case of shorterleases.   For residential leases with 20-60 years to run from the appointed day, themost practical solution appears to be that the tenant should simply be given the option of converting the lease to absolute ownership at any time during its currency.The compensation in such a case would include an element for the reversion value;   andthe landlord might have a right of appeal against conversion of the lease on thegrounds that conversion would cause him undue hardship.7 5*   Provision will be made also for (a) existing mixed leases containing a residentialelement extending beyond 20 years and (b) existing non-residential leases extendingbeyond 20 years which become residential.   In case (a), it is envisaged that theresidential element in a mixed lease would (subject to compensation) be converted tothe tenant&apos;s ownership if the lease had more than 60 years to run and could be soconverted (at the tenant&apos;s option) if the lease had 20-60 years to run.   In case (b),the position would be the same, except that, if the existing lease contained acondition prohibiting change of use, the landlord would have the option of resumingthe property because of breach of that condition.MISCELLANEOUS ADDITIONAL POINTS76.    Leasehold CasualtiesUnder existing law a lease may still contain provision for special payments to be madeby the tenant when specified events take place, for example the transfer of the lease.(The corresponding feudal arrangements have already been abolished - see paragraph  2.)
It is intended that the forthcoming legislation should make it incompetent for newleases to contain provisions of this sort, although it would remain lawful for a lease to provide for periodic variations of rent based upon a formula specified inthe lease.77.    Registration of LeasesAt present a lease of land not exceeding 50 acres for a term of 31 years or more canbe registered in the General Register of Sasines.   It is proposed to remove thelimitation on area with retrospective effect;   and, from a prescribed date, to permitall new leases for a term of more than 20 years and all existing leases which still have more than 20 years to run to be recorded in the Register.   A standard form for new registrable leases, incorporating the statutory prohibition on residential use,will be prescribed by statute.SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS FOR LEASEHOLD78.    In summary, the Government&apos;s proposals for leasehold are as follows:-i.     New residential leases for a term of more than 20 years should be prohibited.(Paragraph 65. )ii.     The length of new non-residential leases need not be restricted.(Paragraph 66. )iii.     All leases for a period of more than 20 years should incorporate a statutory condition that there must be no residential use of any part ofthe subjects.   (Paragraph 67. )iv.     A lease for predominantly commercial or industrial subjects which includes a relatively small residential component for use by an employee whosepresence is essential should be treated as a non-residential lease.(Paragraph  68. ) *v.     Leases for mixed residential and non-residential purposes for a term ofmore than 20 years should be prohibited.    (Paragraph  7 0.)vi.     If a landlord purports to grant a defective lease (ie, a lease not inconformity with iii.   abov e),    the tenant of any residential property
concerned should have the right either (a) to have the lease replaced byone for a term of 20 years or the purported remaining term of the lease(whichever is less), or (b) to convert the lease to ownership, with limitc-acompensation.   (Paragraph 71*)vii.     If the use of leased premises is changed from a non-residential to aresidential one contrary to the terms of the lease, the property shouldrevert to the landlord.    (Paragraph 72.)viii.     Existing residential leases with more than 60 years to run should be converted to the tenant&apos;s ownership, on compensation terms parallel withthose for redemption of a feuduty.   Such leases with 20-60 years to runshould be liable to conversion, at the tenant&apos;s option, on compensationterms which would include an element for the reversion value.   (Paragraphs73 and 74.)New leasehold casualties should be incompetent.    (Paragraph 76.)The limitation on area for the registration of a lease should be abolishedwith retrospective effect.   All new leases for a term of more than 20 years should be registrable and be in a prescribed form.    (Paragraph 77*)79.    The views of all interested parties are invited on the proposals summarised inparagraph 78 and, in particular, on the suggestion that 20 years would be an appropriatmaximum permissible term for a residential lease.IX,X./
GREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSECTION VII - LAND TENURE IN THE FUTUREGENERAL80,     The preceding sections of this paper (in particular sections III and IV) have described the steps which will be taken to dismantle the existing system of feudalland tenure, including the requirements upon the proprietor of land to pay feuduty andto observe land conditions enforceable only by the feudal superior.   The purpose ofthis section is to set out the Government&apos;s proposals for land tenure in the future.81.    As noted in paragraph 18,   new feuing will be prohibited.   It is theGovernment&apos;s intention that, from the appointed day, land in Scotland will be held under a system of absolute ownership.   The seller of land will retain no rights init simply by virtue of his position as seller;   nor will the buyer be liable to makeany continuing payments comparable with the present feuduty.   The rights in anyparticular plot of land will belong absolutely to the proprietor, subject only tocertain rights at present vested in the Crown (for example rights in relation to theseabed and foreshore, and certain mineral and sporting rights) and any restrictions imposed on the use of land by statute, byelaw etc.82.    These proposals will not of themselves involve any change in the present systemof recording title to land in the General Register of Sasines.   Nor will they affectthe borrowing of money on the security of land by granting a standard security.   Thepresent distinction between heritable and moveable estate, both in succession and inrelation to fixtures, will be unaffected.LAND CONDITIONS ,83.    Section IV of this paper has suggested for consideration, in relation to existing feudal land conditions which are at present enforceable only by the superior, the possible different approaches i. that such conditions should beextinguished automatically at the appointed day except for any expressly continued by statute;   ii. that any such condition should fall at the appointed day unless before then the Lands Tribunal has upheld an application for its preservation from aninterested proprietor and has conferred upon him a title to enforce it;   and iii.
that such conditions should initially remain in being after the appointed day, but onthe basis that enforcement rights would pass from the former superior to a category of &quot;qualified proprietors&quot; and that there would be a simple procedure for theextinction of conditions where they become inappropriate.   Where someone other thanthe superior has at present a title to enforce a land condition against anotherproprietor, he will in any event retain that title.84.    It is possible under existing law to create land conditions which areenforceable among proprietors of land without creating a feudal relationship ofsuperior and vassal.   This is most commonly done when a proprietor sells part only ofhis land;   but it is competent also for a group of proprietors to agree to theimposition of certain rights and liabilities in relation to their properties byexecuting and recording a deed of conditions binding upon them and their successors.In addition, a proprietor may acquire specific rights over land (relating, for example,to height of buildings, access, water and drainage) by obtaining a servitude from theowner of the land over which these rights are to be exercised.   The fact that landconditions may be established among proprietors in these ways is an aspect of land tenure in Scotland which is admired in other countries.   The Government consider thatthe retention of these existing non-feudal methods of creating land conditions willbe sufficient to ensure the continuance of a desirable degree of flexibility in land tenure in Scotland.   The 1970 Act already permits the variation or discharge by the lands Tribunal for Scotland of non-feudal land conditions which have become unreasonableor inappropriate.85.    In the event of failure to observe a land condition, it will of course not inany circumstances be competent in future to use the feudal remedy of irritancy.   Landconditions will be enforceable by interdict or specific implement;   damages may be awarded for breach of conditions.    It is for consideration also whether there shouldbe an additional statutory remedy whereby a proprietor who benefits from a conditionwill be able, when appropriate, to do necessary work which a proprietor burdened bythat condition is required to do and to recover the cost as a debt from the burdenedproprietor.
miniiiiiiiiiifliMISCELLANEOUS ADDITIONAL POINTS86.    Standard FormsAs an aid to conveyancing and in the interests of simplicity, it is proposed - inaccordance with a recommendation of the Halliday Committee - to prescribe by statutestandard forms for certain types of deed.   These will include dispositions andregistrable leases (see paragraph 7 7)* and perhaps also some deeds of conditions.87.    Scheduling of Land conditions for the same reasons - and again following a recommendation of the Halliday Committee -it is intended that new land conditions should be set out in a schedule to the deed bywhich they are created.   This will facilitate examination of title.THE PROPOSED FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS COMPARED WITH THE FEUDAL SYSTEM88.   The main differences between the feudal system of land tenure and the future arrangements proposed by the Government may be summarised as follows:-i.     The proprietor of land will have absolute ownership of it.   No estate ofsuperiority will remain in the same land,ii.     The proprietor of land will no longer be liable to pay a continuing feudutyor any other quasi-perpetual money payment in respect of that land,iii.     There will no longer be a superior who can impose or enforce landconditions.   Only the proprietor of land will be able to create a newcondition in respect of that land.8 9 . What the Government intend to achieve is a radical revision of the Scottishsystem of land tenure.   This will involve the complete abolition of feudal tenure.At the same time, however, there will be carried over into the new arrangements thosefeatures of the existing system which are recognised to be of value - namely itsflexibility in accommodating different forms of land use and its ability to incorporate beneficial conditions running with land, coupled always with securityof tenure for the proprietor of land.   The Government will welcome comments on their proposals.
GREEN PAPER ON LAND TENURE REFORMSHCTIOK VIII - CONCLUSION90.    As explained in paragraph  6,   this paper is designed as a basis for consultations intended to lead to the major reform of the land tenure system inScotland to which the Government are already committed.   It indicates a number of basic points on which the Government consider that action must be taken and it sets out also a variety of matters for comment and discussion.   These two groups of items are summarised in paragraphs 9 1 and 9 2 .91.    Basic points which the Government consider should be covered in the proposedlegislationThe Feudal System - general .     Feudal tenure should be not merely modified, but abolished.   Abolition,however, should be carried out in a way which is fair to superiors andvassals alike, and the good points of the present arrangements should be preserved so far as possible.    (Paragraphs   16 and 17*)Feudutyii.     From the date of the abolition of feudal tenure no new feuing will be permitted.   (Paragraph 18.)iii.     Feuduties will be abolished, with compensation arrangements which are fairboth to superiors and to proprietors.   (Paragraph 19.)iv.     The superior1s right to receive feuduty will be converted into a right toobtain payment of the redemption value.   Redemption will be possible either by lump sum or by instalments;   there will be&quot; a fixed redemption period;the redemption value of every feuduty will be fixed as at the appointed day and, where it is paid by instalments, these will be calculatedap a fixed annuity.   (Paragraph 22.)Feudal Land Conditionsv.     After feuduties have ceased to be payable, former superiors should not continue to be entitled to enforce whatever land conditions may survive.(Paragraph 33.)
vi.     Conditions enforceable by the creditor in a ground annual should be treated in the same way as feudal conditions.   (Paragraph 49*)Other forms of land tenure and monetary burdens on landvii.     Various minor forms of land holding and of burdens on land should bebrought to an end at the same time as feudal tenure, with similar arrangements for the redemption of monetary payments and the discharge ofland conditions.   (Paragraph 56.)Leaseholdviii.     The use of the leasehold system should not be allowed to frustrate the objects of the abolition of feudal tenure.   (Paragraph 63.)Land tenure in the futureix.     In future, land will be held under a system of absolute ownership.(Paragraph 81.)x.     The existing non-feudal methods of creating land conditions will beretained.   (Paragraph 84.)xi.     Statutory forms should be prescribed for certain types of deed;   and landconditions should be scheduled.   (Paragraphs 86 and 87.)92.    Particular points for comment and discussionFeudutyi.     What should be the detailed basis of the terms of redemption of feuduty?(Paragraphs 20 and 21.)ii.     What rhould be the length of the redemption period?   (iii. in paragraph22.)iii.     WhaL detailed options should be open to proprietors for payment of theredemption value of their feuduties?   (Paragraphs 23-27.)iv.     What arrangements would be appropriate for safeguarding the interests ofsuperiors, over-superiors etc in relation to the redemption value offeuduties?   (Paragraphs 28-30.)
Feudal land, conditionr.v.     What arrangements (if any) should be made to continue feudal landcon-&apos;iLions which are at present enforceable only by the superior?(Paragraphs  38-48.)     More particularly, if it should be decided toproceed by way of statutory saving of specific classes of condition, are there any types of condition (in addition to those relating to the upkeepand repair of property in which more than one proprietor has an interest)which might appropriately be treated in this fat hion?   (Paragraph 39.)vi.     What arrangements would be appropriate for dealing   with rights of reversion,redemption and pre-emption?   (Paragraph 50.)vii.     What arrangements would be appropriate for dealing with mineral rightsreserved to superiors?   (Paragraph 51*)Other forms of land tenure and monetary burdens on landviii.     Are any particular difficulties foreseen in relation to non-feudal formaof land tenure or money burdens upon land?   (Paragraph 59*)Leaseholdix.     Are the detailed arrangements proposed for leasehold appropriate?(Paragraphs. 78 and 79*)land tenure in the futurex.     Are the arrangements proposed for a system of absolute ownership of landappropriate - with particular reference to land conditions within that system?   (Paragraphs 84 and 85.)93*    The reform of land tenure is a very complex subject and the Government recognisethat it has not been practicable in this paper to present an exhaustive study of it../.ithin the feudal system there- are various complications which have been mentionedonly in passing or not at all;   and, so far as other forms of tenure etc are concerned,Section V has merely referred briefly to some of the main features.   Moreover, theproposals in this paper may well have special implications for some proprietors ofIN CONFIDENCE
land or some superiors - for example, there are bodies like the National Trust forScotland, concerned to act in the public interest, who make special use of feudalarrangements in furthering their objects.   Comments are invited from any who wish todraw attention to specific difficulties which might arise in connection with suchspecial uses.94,    As noted in paragraph   4 *   &quot;the Henry Committee made proposals on registration of title.   It is clear that any legislation on feudal reform would substantially affectthe form of an,y subsequent legislation on registration of titles   It might be arguedLhat, if registration of title were introduced before the feudal reforms discussed inthis paper, these reforms would themselves be facilitated;   on the other hand, ifregistration of title came first, there would probably have to be a period of delaybefore feudal reform could take place - to introduce simultaneously, or almostsimultaneously, two fundamental reforms affecting the holding and transfer of land would clace a very considerable burden upon the legal profession.   Registration of title is itself a technical and largely non-controversial matter with which theGovernment have not thought it necessary to deal in this paper.   Nevertheless, theGovernment will rt quire to reach a view, in the light of the considerations set outin this paragraph., on the relative priorities which should be accorded to it and tofeudal reform.95.    ^he Government will not reach firm decisions on the precise shape which legislation on land tenure reform should take until there has been adequate time forcomment and consultation on the basis of the proposals described in this paper.   Inorder, however, that further progress may be made on this important subject, anyorganisations or individual persons wishing to offer comments on these proposals areinvited to do uo as soon as they conveniently can.Scottish Home and. ilealth Department10 JuLy 197
