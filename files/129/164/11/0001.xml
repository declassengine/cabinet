TAX-CREDIT SCHEME:  DRAFT GREEN paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord President of the council. The Cabinet discussed a draft Green Paper on the Tax-credit scheme at their meeting on 27 June (CM(72) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 1),and invited my predecessor to examine the draft with other ministers concerned and consider the publicity arrangements in greater detail.I have accordingly had discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Social Services, the Lord Privy Seal, theSecretary of State for the Environment, the Minister of Agricultureand the Secretary of State for Employment.2. The Cabinet commented in particular on the payment of childcredits, the implications of the scheme for the financial position of strikerand the treatment of non-resident dependants.    Our conclusions on thesematters are as follows:-a. Child Credits .It would be simplest to pay all credits to the father;  but there willbe public pressure for some and possibly all of them to go to the mother.    The fairest answer would probably be to split thembetween the parents, giving the father credit for the first child(or perhaps the first two children), and the mother the creditsfor the others.    But our conclusion is that it would be wrong toreach a decision on this controversial matter at this stage.    Wetherefore propose that the arguments for and against paymentswholly to the father, split between father and mother, or wholly! to the mother, should be objectively set out in the Green Paper;and it should be stated that the Government regard the issue asentirely open, and that a decision will be reached in the light ofpublic discussion and the views of the Select Committee.b. StrikersStrikers and their families do not forfeit income tax allowances,family allowances or family income supplement, all of which the tax-Credit Scheme will in whole or in part replace.    Any proposalCP(72) 86 COPY NO   g g1 August 1972CABINET
that they should be forfeit would be extremely controversial.    TheSecretary of State for Employment, the Chancellor and theSecretary of State for Social Services are looking at this further;but our first impression is that it would not be justifiable to use the scheme as a means of penalising strikers, and in any case todo so would almost certainly put at risk the support for the schemewhich the Opposition have so far displayed.    Moreover, it would still be possible for lost Tax Credits to be claimed at the end ofthe year as an additional tax allowance, which, unlike credits paidduring a strike, could not be offset against any supplementary benefits claimed: if Tax Credits were not paid during the dispute,therefore, strikers would in fact be better off.    We do not considerthat we should volunteer any statement in the body of the green paper itself.c.    Non-resident DependantsThis again is likely to be a controversial issue, particularly amongimmigrants;  and we think that the best course is to set out theposition and see how public discussion develops.    We therefore propose to explain in the Green Paper that child credits for overseas dependants would probably be payable in all caseswhere we at present have reciprocal arrangements with thecountries concerned on family allowances;  and that where wedo not, the question is for the moment being left open for further study.3. Although the scheme cannot come into effect for another five or six years, it proposes the application of a very large sum of money, 1, 000 million or more;  and in presenting the scheme we must be careful that the impression is not gained either that this sum, which on the whole will benefit the hard-pressed and slightly better-off ratherthan the poorest members of the community, will diminish what would otherwise be done for the latter, or that the scheme is being launchedwithout regard to the general context of the Governments social policies.The Chancellor cf the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for social services are drafting a foreword which is intended to cover these points on lines which we have discussed.    We have also considered thesuggestion that there might be a simplified version of the green paper.    On the whole, we believe that the Green Paper, as a documentfor discussion, should stand on its own, and that a simplified version might lead to confusion and misunderstanding of proposals which must be explained in some detail if they are to be justly understood.    We are however considering whether it would be feasible to produce a pamphletto promote the Green Papert and if so what distribution it should be given,4.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer considers that the most opportunetime for publication of the Green Paper might be in September.    Ourconclusion was that we should at least be ready to publish then.    It isdesirable that publication should not be delayed, because even as things are the timetable for bringing the scheme into effect in April 1977 is very
tight.    Furthermore, publication is expected soon, and too much delay-may well be interpreted as disagreement.    The Chancellor would proposeto consult those colleagues principally concerned about the precise date of publication.    Meanwhile we have considered the detailed arrangements for publicity, which will probably include attributable briefing of the Press,television and radio, and extended briefing of selected commentators and specialist publications.RECOMMENDATION5, I invite my colleagues to agree that the Green Paper, as amendedon the lines set out above, should be published in September: the date tobe fixed in consultation with the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for Social Services and myself.    Unlessany of our colleagues raise any objections by midday on Friday 4 Augustwe will assume that we have the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to proceed accordingly.R home Office31 July 1972
