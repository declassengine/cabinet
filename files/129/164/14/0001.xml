CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1972-73 session memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord President of the council. We approved the legislative programme for next Session(CM(72) 24th Conclusions, Minute 7) on the basis that a significantlylighter programme was desirable.    The strain of this Session, bothin the Commons and in the Lords, amply confirms the wisdom of that view.    The position has, however, worsened in a number of respectssince we considered the programme in May.    First, we have, unavoidably,to make provision for a number of additional Bills (see Annex).    Secondly,on some of the major Bills in the programme we shall find our own supporters at best lukewarm and at worst divided (particularly on WaterReorganisation and on Local Government Finance and miscellaneous provisions).    Thirdly, preparation of a number of major Bills has beenheld up awaiting policy decisions;  and in consequence drafting has not begun,so that the Bills are likely to be late, thus adding to the difficulty of accommodating them (this applies to the two Bills I have already mentioned,to Consumer Credit and to Training and Employment).2. In this situation I am prepared to defer Criminal Evidence, on whicha draft Bill has been prepared by the Criminal Law Revision Committee.The deferment will satisfy those who are saying that we should not rush intothis measure without proper consideration and I believe will be accepted by our own supporters providing we carry conviction that we intend to pass aBill in the Parliament.3, The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has agreed that theBill on Consumer Credit should be deferred, but on the basis that itspreparation would proceed, as drafting resources permit, in order thatwe would be ready to introduce it without fail next Session or in this Sessionif, unexpectedly, an opportunity arose for it.    He attaches importance,however, to the addition to the programme of a Bill on Insurance.    i recommend that we agree to this, provided that policy questions anddrafting instructions can be settled urgently and that.the Bill will beready for introduction not later than immediately after the christmas recess,CP(72) 89 COPY NO 654 August 1972
4, I have discussed with the Secretary of State for the environment the deferment of Water Reorganisation and Local Government Finance and miscellaneous Provisions.    Drafting has not yet begun on these Bills; theywill be late, difficult, and liable to be controversial among our own supporters who have already been severely tested by the pressure oflocal loyalties aroused by the reform of local government.    While itwould be desirable for both Bills to be passed next Session, in orderthat they could take effect at the time of the reorganisation of the localgovernment in April 1974, we could only accommodate them at the expenseof other measures.    The Secretary of State for the Environment feels very strongly that the Bill on Water Reorganisation should not be deferredalthough he is prepared to exclude certain pollution provisions from it.He is prepared to shorten Local Government Finance and miscellaneous provisions somewhat;  but he would then propose a separate Bill (perhaps in 1973-74) to provide for a local government ombudsman.    He is willingto defer the Bill on Road Traffic (which has also been intended to includethe &quot;Keeper Liability&quot; proposals with which I am concerned as HomeSecretary),    In these circumstances, I feel I must recommend that weshould proceed with Water Reorganisation next Session provided agreement can be reached on the treatment of land drainage but defer Local government finance and Miscellaneous Provisions and Road Traffic/Keeper Liabilityuntil 1973-74.    We could also keep open the possibility of finding a place for a short Bill on a local government ombudsman in the 1972-73 Session;and would, as drafting resources permit, proceed with the preparation ofthe Bill on Road Traffic/Keeper Liability on the same basis as the Bill onConsumer Credit.    The Secretary of State has asked for Bills on NatureConservancy and Night Assemblies to be added to the programme but these could only be included at the expense of other measures,    I have agreed with the Secretary of State that the Bill on Urban Motorways/LandCompensation should be enlarged,conclusions, To sum up, my conclusions are -a. We should make provision next Session for the additionalBills set out in the Anaex,b. &quot;We should defer until 1973-74 Criminal Evidence, ConsumerCredit, Local Government Finance and Miscellaneous provisions and Road Traffic/Keeper Liability.I invite the agreement of the Cabinet to these conclusions.R home Office3 August 1972
