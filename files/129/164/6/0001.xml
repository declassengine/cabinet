These will be considered by aDocks Delegate Conference called for Thursday,   27 July.    The main points  in the Committee&apos;c report have been outlined, to us by thejoint Chairmen.    The emphasis will be on measures to eliminate theTemporary Unattached. Register  (TUR) by improved severance, mainly for unfit and older deckers,   coupled v/ith some temporary worksharing.    Without this the strike would not be called off.WORK SHARING2        The Committee envisage that for a limited period the re-allocated dockers would bo paid full wages subject to some form of pay sharing still to be agreed.3        Details have still to be settled and it is difficult toestimate the cost.    For si;: months it might amount to anything from 2.6m to  5m.    Any consequential increase in the levy payable by employers to the National Dock Labour Board  (NDLB) would in theCommittee&apos;s view be too much for the industry to bear and government help has been requested.SEVERANCEk        The Committee propose that for six months the maximumentitlement for dockers who are not fully fit or who are over 55should be increased from  2,,300 to  3i800;  anc1 that the minimumseverance for all dockers should be increased, to  1,500.The Committee estimate that something over 2,500 men might be induced to take severance.

(confidential)ANNEX IIINTRODUCTIONWe outlined in Gen 92(72)3 the background to the national docksdispute and put forward proposals which were considered by theCommittee on 24 May.    We stated that our aim should be to bring about an orderly reduction in the industry&apos;s labour force and that if a lasting solution could be found we should be prepared to spendGovernment money.THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISPUTE2.      When the Committee considered our earlier paper we faced theprospect of a national dock strike starting at the beginning of June.In the event a number of the matters in dispute were settled throughthe industries&apos;  National Joint Council ie the guarantee to beincreased from  20 to  23;     a fourth week&apos;s holiday to be given by1973?  also an additional severance payment of  500 to men leaving the industry from the temporarily unattached register  (TUR)  and a&quot;disturbance allowance&quot; of  50 to men who    had been on the TUR for more than four weeks.    These offers were accepted at a delegate conference on ik June when it was decided to defer notice of strike action for six weeks.    The further delegate conference is to be heldon 27 July. ,THE ALDINGTON/JONES COMMITTEE3-      At the end of May a joint authoritative committee was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Aldington and Mr Jack Jones,    its terms of reference covered the problems of container work,  the TURand other related matters.     xhe Committee was to produce an interimreport within six weeks.1(confidential)
(confidential)Last week the Joint Chairmen came to see us to report progress and more specifically to indicate what financial assistance theCommittee will be seeking from the Government. The Committee&apos;sinterim rejoort will concern measures to eliminate the TUR by some form of work-sharing coupled with improved severance mainly forunfit and older dockers.    The study of other problems including thequestion of container work is continuing.WORK SHARING5.      We were told that if the union is to persuade the delegate conference to call off the strike it is essential to eliminate theTUR.    The Committee is considering doing this either by directre-allocation to permanent employment,  or (in London) by transfer from the TUR to a new port employment agency.    It might recommenda combination of both measures.6.      The joint Chairmen told us that arrangements for work sharingcould be financed partly by the National Dock Labour 3oard  (NDL3)to the extent of the guaranteed wage of  23 per man which it.ispaying to men on the TUR.     In addition there should be some contribution from workers.    An arrangement of this kind is currentlyunder negotiation at Hull.    Employers who could absorb additional labour without over-manning should bear the full cost.    After taking into accov.it these contributions any short fall might have to be met by increasing the NDL3 levy.    But the levy is already lk^% and with-out additional financial help    to NDLB it will have to be increasedto  lo-g-%,   simply to meet the cost of the enlarged TUR.    We were told that increases of h.% or more might cause some firms to go out ofbusiness.7.      The joint Chair-men said that full details of a scheme for worksharing had still to be agreed by the Committee.    It was verydifficult to estimate cost since this would be affected by factorsinfluencing the  future size of the labour surplus,   ie the successof severance and the possible demise of other stevedoring companies.They reckon that the cost of operating work sharing for six monthsmight amount to  anything from about  2.6m to  5m.  and suggestedthat Government might make some contribution.SEVERANCE8.      The Committee&apos;s severance proposals are as follows:-for a limited period - say until the end of the year -the severance entitlement of dockers-/who are not fullyfit or who are over 55 should be increased by  1,500 toa new maximum of  3,800.    In addition the Committeeenvisages raising minimum severance entitlement for alldockers to  1,500.    At present the minimum is about  300for fit dockers and  1,000 for unfit.2(confidential)
(confidential)9o      A sufficient response to this offer should put a term to worksharing and consequential over-manning.    The joint Chairmenestimate that some k.0% of the 3 ? 500 unfit men in the industry might accept severance and possibly 20% of 9,000 men over 55&quot;But the offer to the latter group would probably be selective anddepend upon the labour supply situation in each port.    They couldnot ssry how many might respond to increases in minimum severance.Taking into account all three categories they thought the totalnumber might amount to something over 2,500.    On this basis thecost of the improvement over and above present rates of severancewould be of the order of  ^i-g-m.10.    The possibility of the Government foregoing interest on thepresent NDL3    loan or of converting the loan into a grant was mentioned by the joint Chairmen.       Alternatively they suggestedthat improvements in severance pay should be financed by government grant.3(confidential)
(confidential)COMMENTS11.      17*5 cannot challenge the jud,Mr Jones,   that to get the  strikeeli:.iinate the TUR. The unoithe judgment of Lord: Aldington end   .strike called off it is necessary toThe unofficial shot) stewards&apos;  committeestill has support from many moderate minded dockers because oftheir fear about job security.    The unofficial container disputes which are the subject of legal proceedings could indeed lead to strike action quite apart from&quot; the national dispute.    It is howeverpracticable to do something about the TUR whereas the containerproblem may prove to be well nigh insoluble.    Hence althoughwork-sharing is objectionable in principle we think that an agreed scheme to operate for a limited   period while a specialeffort is made to get the unfit and older men to leave shouldnot be resisted.12.      We told the joint Chairmen that the Government would be reluctant to vary the terms of the NDL3 loan;    also that wecould not give financial support to a %vork-sharing scheme.    Anysuch scheme should contain provision for pay-sharing by dockers.The Government was sympathetically disposed to help with the socialproblem of rundown by a &quot;once for all&quot; improvement in severance.The extent and nature of the Government *s financial contribution would have to be discussed with our colleagues.     Any help wouldbe conditional on complete withdrawal of the strike notice.    Weundertook to let the joint Chairmen know the Government&apos;s views before the  end of this week.    The Committee&apos;s recommendations will probably be made known on Monday 24 July.13.      It is important that the severance offer should have maximumimpact.    We think there is a case for increasing the maximumpayment to unfit dockers and those over 55 to  4-, 000.    It mightbe reasonable to increase the minimum for the unfit to  2,000.But we do not think there is a good case for increasing theminimum for all fit dockers.    Increases confined to the unfit andolder dockers should be less repercussive than a general offer.lA.      We propose that the Government should offer to finance thetotal cost of severance to unfit dockers and the cost of theproposed improvements in severance for dockers over 55.    Theseoffers should be available for a period of six months only.It is difficult to estimate what this would cost.    If the ratesof severance available to  the unfit and older dockers were increased as we have suggested the total numbers taking severancemight exceed 3,000 and the cost of the Exchequer contributionwe have suggested might be about  8m.15.      The  effect of giving grant support to  the total cost ofseverance for the unfit would be to relieve the NDLB of some partof their present financial responsibility for severance.    Thisshould enable the NDLB to finance work-sharing for a limited period without increasing the levy.
(confidential)l6o      Existing legislation in this field - the Dock Workers(Regulation of Employment)  Act 19^6 - provides for government loans to the NDL3 but makes no provision for grants-     In general it is appropriate to introduce specific new legislation in orderto extend powers under existing legislation.    However,  in an exceptional case such as this where the measure is of anemergency character and of limited duration we can justifyproceeding on the basis of a Vote Estimate deriving its authority from the Appropriation Act;    with recourse to theContingencies Fund if necessary in the meanwhile,  provided that parliament is informed without delay of our intention.RECOMMENDATION17.      We recommend that subject to the strike being called off theGovernment should make available to NDLB for a period of 6 monthsa grant to finance the total cost of severance payments to unfitdockers and the cost of improved severance to men over 55* .Parliament should be informed by a Ministerial Statementprobably on 2k July.M V MJ PDEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SWl18 July 1972(confidential)
