CP(72) 98 COPY NO ,27 September 1972CABINETOFFICIAL SECRETS ACTNote by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord President of the council. The report of the Departmental Committee on section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act, 1911 (under the chairmanship of Lord Franks) isto be published on Friday, 29 September.2.        I attach, for the information of my colleagues, a confidentialadvance copy of the report, together with a summary of the mainconclusions.3. I have discussed the report with the Prime Minister, andwe agree that it ought to be the subject of public discussion beforethe Government commit themselves.    I therefore propose to say no more about the Governments attitude to the report when it is publishedthan that it will need careful study.4. I am arranging for the report to be examined by the Departmentsprincipally concerned;  and recommendations will be submitted to ministers in due course.R home Office27 September 1972
General considerations (Chapter 1)1. The Committee were concerned only with section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act 1911, which makes the unauthorised disclosure of official information an offence.    In a general opening chapter they say that there is an inevitable and increasing tension between the needfor the wide diffusion of information in a democracy, and the need tokeep some matters secret for the safety of the State.    They regardtheir proposals for the replacement of section 2 by provisions reduced in scope and less uncertain in operation as providing the necessaryminimum of criminal law required for national security.The main features of section 2 (Chapter 2)2. The Committee describe the leading characteristic of section 2as its catch-all quality.    Everything which a Crown servant learns inthe course of his work is &quot;official&quot; for the purposes of section 2.    Thesection prohibits all Crown servants from making any unauthorised disclosure of any kind of official information, regardless of the effectof the disclosure.    This prohibition extends to Government contractors,to persons entrusted with official information in confidence, and also toany person who comes into possession of official information which hasbeen disclosed contrary to the Official Secrets Acts.    The unauthorisedreceipt of official information is by itself an offence.Section 2 in operation and what people think of it (Chapter 3)3. The Committee were asked first to review the operation ofsection 2, then to make recommendations.    In describing the resultsof this review they say that prosecutions under the section, which require the consent of the Attorney General, have been infrequent, butthe section has a general deterrent effect, and may help to create anaura of undue secrecy in the Civil Service.    Owing to its wide terms the section can be misused;   The Committee found no evidence of widespread abuse, but were told of a small number of specific instances.The evidence and opinion given to the Committee showed a wide spectrumof views on section 2,    Some would repeal it without replacement.Others would retain it.    There is a considerable variety of suggestions for replacing it by different provisions.    Most people agree thatcriminal sanctions should be used to prevent disclosures damaging to thesecurity of the nation; there is less agreement what this phraseembraces.    Some witnesses evinced unhappiness about the control of prosecutions by the Attorney General, because he is both a Law Officerresponsible for law enforcement and a politician who is a member of theGovernment.1
Other safeguards for official information (Chapter 5)4. The Committee place considerable weight on the existence of anumber of other factors which serve to prevent unauthoriseddisclosures of official information and which determine the opennessof government.    In this context they refer to the control of policy by ministers accountable to Parliament;  the natural desire of public servants to perform their duties conscientiously;  the disciplinarysanctions of the public service; vetting and similar measures;  thesystem of security classification;  and &apos;D&apos; Notices.    The Committeeregard these other influences as more important than the criminal law.Open government and overseas experience (Chapter 6)5. The Committee say that their inquiries into the law and practice in certain other countries, including the United States and sweden, illustrate the general truth that the degree of openness in a country&apos;s government depends largely on constitutional and politicalfactors.    They found considerable agreement in these countries aboutthe need to safeguard information in the fields of defence and foreign relations, and confidential information entrusted to the Government by private firms and individuals.    A few witnesses suggested to them thatthe law in this country should confer a right of access to some kinds of official information, on the lines of the United States and Swedish lawswhich confer such a right.    This suggestion, they say, raisedimportant constitutional questions going beyond their terms ofreference.    They add that such laws cannot simply be transplanted intothe very different British context, and that the law is anyway not one ofthe most important influences on openness in government.The Committee&apos;s general approach (Chapters 7 and 8)6. The Committee say that much official information clearly doesnot require the protection of criminal sanctions.    Section 2 is extremely wide, its drafting is obscure, it is very uncertain inoperation, and its inclusion in the Official Secrets Acts obscures theimportant distinction between espionage and leakage.    In their viewthese are defects which provide a clear case for change.    Yet thecomplete removal of criminal sanctions would go too far, sinceleakage can cause as much damage to the security of the nation asespionage, and the other provisions of the Official Secrets Acts do not cover leakage.    Their first main proposal is that section 2 should be repealed, and replaced by new provisions much narrower in scope,which should form a statute separate from the Official Secrets Acts, tobe known as the Official Information Act.    In considering the scope ofthis new Act, they draw a sharp distinction between official information which needs some protection against unauthorised disclosure, and official information which should be protected by criminal sanctions.    It isbasic to their approach that the use of the criminal law, in addition tothe other safeguards mentioned in paragraph 4, should be reserved forthat official information which it is most important to the nation tosafeguard.2
National Security (Chapter 9, Section A)7. Chapter 9   is the heart of the Committee^ report.    Here theydiscuss what official information requires protection on grounds ofnational security, in a wide sense of that term, and how this information should be identified in the law.    They say that a two-part definition isrequired.   First, the law should describe in general terms thosecategories of official information the unauthorised disclosure of whichmay injure the security of the nation, thus excluding all other kinds of official information.    Second, the law should identify, with as muchcertainty as possible, those particular items of information within these categories the unauthorised disclosure of which might cause serious injury, so as to exclude less important matters and to enablethose handling such information to know where they stand in relation tothe law.    The Committee accept that there is much official informationnot coming within this two-part definition which Governments properlykeep to themselves, but regard the safeguards mentioned inparagraph 4 as sufficient protection for this other information.8. The Committee propose that the general part of their national security definition should comprise three categories only:-a. Defence and internal security,   covering information about troops, weapons and equipment, and plans, intelligence and security matters, military treaties and the defenceinformation of our allies, and internal defence and securityincluding measures to maintain and restore public order and essential supplies and services.b. Foreign relations, that is, relations between the UnitedKingdom Government and other Governments and international organisations.c. Proposals, negotiations and decisions connected withalterations in the value of sterling, and information relatingto the reserves.The Committee say that these categories cover the basic functions ofGovernment, and that leakages of other economic and financialinformation, or concerning other important or sensitive issues of domestic policy, would not cause the kind of damage to the nation as awhole warranting criminal sanctions.The use of the classification system (Chapter 9, Section B)9. The only satisfactory method, in the Committee&apos;s view, ofidentifying the particular information, within the above three categories,which the criminal law should protect, is for the Government to identifyand mark this information.    The three categories relate to basicfunctions of the central Government, which is accountable to parliament and the electorate for its discharge of these functions.    The courts3
should not be given responsibility for deciding what may cause serious injury to the nation, since this involves political rather than judicialissues, and some of the evidence bearing on these issues might itself be secret.    The Government already operates a system of classificationto identify matters requiring special protection from disclosure, andthe criterion for classifying as secret is that unauthorised disclosurewould cause serious injury to the interests of the nation.     Thus the classification system can be adapted for use as the means ofidentifying information within the three categories protected by the criminal law, provided that there are adequate safeguards to ensureagainst the possibility of a prosecution for the leakage of information which should not have been classified, or have remained classified atthe level attracting criminal sanctions.10.       The Committee^ specific proposals are:-a. The law should cover information within the three categories which is classified SECRET or above, or which relates to military weapons and is classified DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL.    (The latter marking is intended to covercertain defence information which is classified confidential for practical reasons although its disclosure would cause serious injury to the nation. )b. Such a marking should be attached to official informationonly on the ground that unauthorised disclosure might cause serious injury to the interests of the nation.    regulations should be made by the Secretary of State setting out thearrangements for classifying and declassifying informationcovered by the law.c. A prosecution should be possible only if the responsible minister certifies to the court that the information in question was properly classified in accordance with a. and b. at thetime of the leak.The processes of Government and the Cabinet (Chapter 11)11.       It is implicit in the Committee&apos;s general approach that the criminal law should be confined to specific kinds of important official information, and should not give general protection to all the internalprocesses of decision-making within the Government.    They accept theneed for a degree of privacy for these internal processes, but see no justification for prosecuting those responsible for leaks which fall outside the specific categories of subject matter to which they think thelaw should be confined.    They attach special importance, however, tothe proper functioning of the Cabinet, and they regard privacy for cabinet discussions as important for the preservation of its collectiveunity.    They accordingly propose that criminal sanctions should be4

It is implicit in the Committee^ general approach that the criminal law should be confined to specific kinds of important official information, and should not give general protection to all the internalprocesses of decision-making within the Government.    They accept theneed for a degree of privacy for these internal processes, but see no justification for prosecuting those responsible for leaks which fall outside the specific categories of subject matter to which they think thelaw should be confined.    They attach special importance, however, tothe proper functioning of the Cabinet, and they regard privacy for cabinet discussions as important for the preservation of its collectiveunity.    They accordingly propose that criminal sanctions should be4
retained for the unauthorised disclosures of papers of the Cabinet and ministerial committees of the Cabinet, though not for oral disclosuresabout Cabinet business.Other matters to be protected by the Criminal law (Chapters 10 and 12)12.       The Committee propose that, in addition to the mattersmentioned in paragraphs 8-10, the criminal law should also coverthree other fields:-a. Law and order, (Chapter 10).    Section 2 now coverspolice and prison information, and the Committee proposethat the criminal law should continue to cover leakages of official information likely to be helpful in the commission of offences, or in facilitating escapes from legal custody orother acts prejudicial to prison security, or likely toimpede the prevention or detection of offences or theapprehension or prosecution of offenders.b. The confidence of the citizen, (Chapter 12).    TheCommittee point out that Government today is involved inmany aspects of the lives of private citizens and the affairs of private concerns, and in consequence it accumulates aconsiderable mass of information about them, often of aprivate and confidential kind.    They recommend that theprotection of the criminal law for this information should be preserved.c. The Committee propose that the leakage or use of official information for purposes of private gain, which isakin to corruption but is not fully covered by the law oncorruption, should be an offence (C&amp;ajrter 12).Who should be under a duty to protect official information (Chapters 3.3-15)13.       The new provisions the Committee propose will, they say, be restricted to official information which is genuinely secret orconfidential, and it is in the interests of everyone that this information should be properly protected.    The main onus of protection rests onCrown servants who handle this information as part of their job, but the citizen should also have a duty to protect it.    In their view, however,no-one should be liable to conviction if he lacks the appropriate mens reaor guilty knowledge, or simply for receiving official information, butonly for communicating it improperly.    They make detailed proposals about the classes of person to whom the law should applyand the circumstances in which disclosure should be an offence,including the mens rea involved.    For the most part these would clarifythe present law on these aspects without substantially changing it.    The5
main change would be the repeal of the provision making simplereceipt of official information an offence.    The Committee regard this provision as unjustifiable, and at the same time as of smallpractical utility.Control over prosecutions (Chapter 16)14.       The Committee say that there will remain a need for acentrally exercised control over prosecutions under the new provisions they propose.    In relation to law and order and the use of official information for private gain, this control can appropriately be exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions.    In relation to defence, foreign relations, the currency, the Cabinet, and theconfidences of the citizen, the isuues of public policy involved are ofa kind which they regard the Attorney General as best fitted to judge.They say they went carefully into criticisms made to them about thecontrol of prosecutions under section 2 by Attorneys General, and aresatisfied that Attorneys take these decisions in their capacity asLaw Officers responsible for law enforcement and   are not motivatedby any party considerations.6

PREFACEi. We were appointed by the Home Secretary on 20 April 1971 &quot;to review the operation of section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 and to make recommendations&quot;. We held our first meeting on 4 May 1971 and have held 46 meetings in all.ii. Early in June 1971 we invited a number of representative bodies, mainly in the fields of the press, broadcasting and the law, and Government Depart-ments, to make written submissions. At the same time the Chairman issuedan open invitation to other organisations and to individuals who wished tosubmit evidence, information, views and constructive suggestions. We receiveda considerable volume of written evidence in response to these invitations. Weare most grateful to all those organisations and individuals who took time andtrouble to assist our work in this way.iii. We subsequently took oral evidence from representatives of a numberof organisations and Government Departments, and from individuals, who had made written submissions. We also saw a small number of other individuals who agreed to help us. We recognised that, from the nature of our subject,some evidence could only be made available to us on a basis of confidence.Our oral sessions were held in private, but on the understanding that everythingsaid to us would be available for publication except where the witness indicatedotherwise. Only a small proportion of our evidence was given on a basis ofconfidence. None of this confidential evidence has had a decisive influence onour recommendations.iv. The evidence which we received is being published with our Report in three companion volumes. One volume contains all the written evidence submitted to us. The other two volumes contain all the oral evidence, except the small amount given in confidence. A complete list of all those who gavewritten and oral evidence is in Appendix VIII.v. We also made inquiries about the law and practice in certain countires overseas. We decided that studies of the position in Canada, France, sweden and the United States of America would be those most likely to help us. Firstwe obtained factual information about the laws of these countries. Subse-quently small parties of members visited Sweden and France. The Chairmanhad discussions in the United States, and Sir Patrick Dean had discussions inCanada, in the course of visits to those countries. The members making thesevisits had informal discussions with representatives of the Governments andof the news media and others. We wish to express our gratitude to all those concerned in these countries for their help and their hospitality, and our thanks to the Foreign-and Commonwealth Office and to Her Majesty&apos;s Heads of mission and their staffs for the excellent arrangements they made for the visits. Appendix IV gives a factual summary of law and practice in the four countries. The bearing on our work of what we learnt is discussed in theReport.
vi. We wish to express our gratitude to those who have formed the staff ofthe Committee. We wish particularly to thank Mr Alec Gordon-Brown, ourSecretary, for the skill, energy and thoughtfulness with which he has carriedout his heavy responsibilities. His wide knowledge has been of great helpin clarifying the matters we had to consider. We thank Mr Jon Davey, the assistant Secretary, who took the minutes of our meetings and shared in the.work of research and drafting papers. We also owe a debt to Miss PatriciaStack and Mr Philip Knowles who performed their secretarial duties with highcompetence.   We have been excellently served.vii.

This is the main class of person subject to section 2; it includesMinisters of the Crown, members of theHome Civil Service, the Diplomatic Serviceand the Armed Forces, and police officers.&quot;Official information&quot;        documents and information which a personhas obtained, or to which he has hadaccess, owing to his position as a crown servant or Government contractor.

Part ITHE SITUATION NOWCHAPTER 1SECRECY IN ITS WIDER CONTEXTGovernment secrecy and democratic control The Official Secrets Acts have been in existence in this country for onlyeighty years. Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, which is our concern,has been in force for sixty-one years. But from the earliest times governmentsof all types have been anxious to preserve secrecy for matters affecting the safety or tactical advantage of the State. It is, however, the concern of demo-cratic governments to see that information is widely diffused, for this enablescitizens to play a part in controlling their common affairs. There is an inevitable tension between the democratic requirement of openness, and the continuing need to keep some matters secret.2 This tension has been increasing in recent years. In part this is becausethe dangers to the State have changed in character and become more complex,and have come to seem internal as well as external. The processes of govern-ment have become more sophisticated; the activities of a government increasinglyaffect all the affairs of the citizen. Its economic manoeuvres have come to beconsidered no less vital to the basis of the life of the community than themovement of its troops. Many new advances in science have both peace-timeand military applications. Rapid changes in society, and the increasedinfluence of centralised institutions, further complicate the issue. More andmore information about the private affairs of citizens comes into the possessionof the Government: there is a feeling that the Government should safeguard the confidences of the citizen almost as strictly as it guards information of use toan enemy.3 Such developments have increased the pull towards secrecy. Theyhave at the same time made more obvious the need to improve the effectiveness of democratic control. This must mean more information to enable citizens tomake rational decisions about matters which affect so much of their lives.Progress in education and in technology has increased the possibility of cir-circulating information on a wide scale and in considerable detail. It has also increased the possibility of effective propaganda, centrally controlled. those concerned with the mass media of communications in Britain have felt theneed not just for more openness in government but for a loosening of controlof information at all levels in the machinery of government. Only thus, theyhave argued, could they play a developing part in the operation of a moderndemocracy.&quot; We are faced, therefore, with an increased area in which con-siderations of secrecy may arise, and at the same time with an increased needfor the diffusion of information together with the technical capacity to supplythis need.
4 It is against this background that we have investigated the operation ofsection 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. The section is part of the criminal law, aimed at preventing unauthorised disclosures of official information. Inthe changing circumstances we have indicated it would be very unlikely that legislation passed two generations ago would not require reconsideration.The reasons for our appointment5 There has, however, been misunderstanding about the more immediatereasons for our appointment in 1971. It is important to make clear whatthese reasons were, if the scope of our investigation is to be appreciated. Ourappointment can be traced directly to the Report, published in 1968, of theFulton Committee on the Civil Service. It was there suggested that theadministrative process was &quot;surrounded by too much secrecy&quot; and that &quot;thepublic interest would be better served if there were a greater amount of open-ness&quot;. The Report welcomed recent trends in this direction but stated that&quot;there must always be an element of secrecy (not simply on grounds of national security) in administration and policy making&quot;. It then went on to proposethat &quot;the Government should set up an enquiry to make recommendations forgetting rid of unnecessary secrecy in this country. Clearly, the Official secrets acts would need to be included in such a review&quot;.6 The Labour Government of 1966-70 published in June 1969 a white paper on this subject &quot;Information and the Public Interest&quot;. This statedthat the Government had carried out the enquiry recommended by the FultonCommittee &quot;on a wide inter-departmental basis, studying comprehensivelyboth the existing trend and its possible further development&quot;. It referred tothe increasing amount of information published by governments in recentyears and the trend towards wider and more open consultation before decisions are taken. Towards the end the White Paper contained a passage on the official secrets Acts which said that there was a case for protecting much official information from unauthorised disclosure, and that a criminal sanction was needed for the protection of some official material. It then argued that theOfficial Secrets Acts as such were not a barrier to greater openness in govern-ment since they did not inhibit the authorised release of information in anyway. The Conservative Party manifesto at the 1970 General Election promised to eliminate unnecessary secrecy concerning the workings of government, andto review the operation of the Official Secrets Acts. We were appointed in fulfilment of that undertaking.The case of the Nigerian Report7 It is nevertheless commonly supposed that our appointment was theresult of a recent prosecution under section 2. This is not so. Our appointment was announced shortly after the conclusion of this case. This was becausethe Government had deferred its announcement while the case was being tried.The case was not the cause of our appointment but the cause of our appointmentbeing deferred.  We should, however, make some reference to it.
8 This case involved four defendants, who were charged under section in connection with the communication and receipt of a confidential assessment of the situation in Nigeria written by the Defence Adviser at the British high commission in Lagos. A copy of this report passed through a number ofhands and eventually came to the Sunday Telegraph, which published it. As aresult, the newspaper, its editor, and two of those along the chain of communi-cation, were prosecuted. In February 1971 all four defendants were acquitted.In the course of his summing up Mr justice Caulfield made the suggestion that section 2 should be &quot;pensioned off&quot;. This dictum was widely reported andwas widely represented as a call for the simple repeal of section 2. The full text of the summing up shows that Mr Justice Caulfield was in fact suggesting the replacement of section 2 by new provisions which would, as he put it,enable people like the four defendants to determine without great difficultyin what circumstances the communication of official information would put them in peril of prosecution.9 Even without these remarks by the Judge, the case of the Nigerian report would have occasioned much public interest for two reasons. First, it related to a matter of political controversy on which strong opinions were held.Secondly, a case which involves those who work in the communications mediaappearing in the dock to face a criminal charge for publishing information will rightly attract close attention. These two factors, followed by the remarksby the Judge and the acquittal of the defendants, made this a cause celebre.The case, the summing up, the verdict, were much discussed in the press.A common theme was the need to do something about section 2.10 It is not surprising in these circumstances that some of the evidencepresented to us was influenced by the Nigerian case. It was difficult to avoid the feeling that a few witnesses were inviting us to draw conclusions on thebasis of this one case alone. The case was indeed important and we did give it proper attention. It was nevertheless but one case out of a number of casesover the years. Though it happens to be the most recent, undue concentrationupon it would give a misleading picture of the way in which section 2 hasoperated and would shut out other issues of great significance.General issues underlying our work11 We have so far indicated these wider issues in the most general terms.But they can be more simply expressed. Even a democratic governmentrequires a measure of secrecy for some of its functions, as a means whereby itcan better carry out its duties on behalf of the people. Among the primarytasks of government are the defence of the nation from external threats, themaintenance of relations with the rest of the world and the preservation oflaw and order. Defence against external attack would be severely prejudicedif potential enemies had access, directly or indirectly, to the details of our plans and weapons. It would be impossible to negotiate with other countries if alldiscussion, however delicate, was conducted completely in the open. Somemeasures -for the prevention or detection of crime would be ineffective if theywere known to criminals. Some of the internal processes of governmentshould be conducted in confidence if they are to result in effective policies.
The presentation of clear issues to Parliament and to the electorate depends upon Ministers and administrators being able, in some instances and at somestages, to argue out all possibilities with complete frankness and free fromthe temptation to strike public attitudes.&apos;12 A totalitarian government finds it easy to maintain secrecy. It doesnot come into the open until it chooses to declare its settled intentions and de-mand support for them. A democratic government, however, though itmust compete with these other types of organisation, has a task which is complicated by its obligations to the people. It needs the trust of the governed.It cannot use the plea of secrecy to hide from the people its basic aims. Onthe contrary it must explain these aims: it must provide the justification forthem and give the facts both for and against a selected course of action. Normust such information be provided only at one level and through one means ofcommunication. A government which pursues secret aims, or which operatesin greater secrecy than the effective conduct of its proper functions requires,or which turns information services into propaganda agencies, will lose the trust of the people. It will be countered by ill-informed and destructivecriticism. Its critics will try to break down all barriers erected to preservesecrecy, and they will disclose all that they can, by whatever means, discover.As a result matters will be revealed when they ought to remain secret in theinterests of the nation.13 The means of preserving secrecy in any operation are various. Theneed for keeping some discussions confidential is felt in private undertakings and in business as it is in public affairs. Not all discussions can be carried proportionate noon in the market place any more than at midnight in a debating chamber.The discipline of a service, the penalty of dismissal, may often be enough tomaintain the confidences of private concerns. But the affairs of governmentare of a different order of difficulty and importance from those of ordinary business. They affect the whole community, for good or ill, and special measures are needed both to inform the public and to protect the public againstdamaging breaches of trust in a dangerous world. There is, therefore, ajustification for using the criminal law as well as professional discipline toprotect secrets of the State.14 Our direct concern is the part which the criminal law should play in theprotection of official information. In this context we have had to consider how the demands of Parliamentary democracy for the fullest information andfor efficiency in operation can be reconciled. The present law, contained insection 2, is notable for its extreme width and for the considerable uncertaintyattaching to its interpretation and enforcement. It does not carry public confidence. We propose its replacement by provisions reduced in scope and less uncertain in operation. We believe that these provisions provide thenecessary minimum of criminal law required for the security of the nation andthe safety of the people, and for the constructive operation of our democracyin the conditions which obtain today.15 To determine the right point of balance between these interests we havehad to sift a great deal of material and weigh many opinions. The considera-tions are complex.  Although in the course of more than a year&apos;s intensive
study we have familiarised ourselves with them, we do not pretend that they make for easy reading. Nor can the solutions we have preferred be quite assimplistic as some protagonists on both sides of the argument desire. the issues touch the heart of government in a Parliamentary democracy too closely.We think it prudent to say as much at the outset.
THE MAIN FEATURES OF SECTION 216 Although we have been concerned with only one section of one Act ofParliament, this section has extensive ramifications. Section 2 is short, butit is in very wide terms and it is highly condensed. It covers a great deal of ground, and it creates a considerable number of different offences. Accordingto one calculation over 2,000 differently worded charges can be brought under it. It is obscurely drafted, and to this day legal doubts remain on some import-ant points of interpretation. The section forms an integral part of the official secrets Acts 1911-1939, and its relationship with section 1 of the 1911 Act is ofparticular importance. The starting point in any examination of section 2 is tounderstand it. The text of sections 1 and 2 is set out in full in Appendix I,which also explains their meaning and summarises related provisions of theOfficial Secrets Acts.Section 2 is a catch-all17 The main offence which section 2 creates is the unauthorised com-munication of official information (including documents) by a Crown servant.The leading characteristic of this offence is its catch-all quality. It catches allofficial documents and information. It makes no distinctions of kind, and nodistinctions of degree. All information which a Crown servant learns in thecourse of his duty is &quot; official&quot; for the purposes of section 2, whatever its nature, whatever its importance, whatever its original source. A blanket isthrown over everything; nothing escapes. The section catches all crown servants as well as all official information. Again, it makes no distinctionsaccording to the nature or importance of a Crown servanfs duties. All are recovered. Every Minister of the Crown, every civil servant, every member ofthe Armed Forces, every police officer, performs his duties subject to section 2.The dispensation from the catch-all: authorisation18 Nevertheless governments regularly reveal a great deal of official information. These disclosures do not contravene section 2. A Crown servantwho discloses official information commits an offence under the section only if the information is disclosed to someone &quot;other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it, or a person to whom it is in the interest of theState his duty to communicate it&quot;. The Act does not explain the meaning ofthe quoted words. We found that they were commonly supposed, by personsoutside the Government, to imply a fairly formal process of express authorisation-tion. Actual practice within the Government rests heavily on a doctrine ofimplied authorisation, flowing from the nature of each Crown servanfs job.In the words of the Home Office, &quot;the communication of official information is proper if such communication can be fairly regarded as part of the job ofthe officer concerned&quot;. Ministers are, in effect, self-authorising. They decide for themselves what to reveal.   Senior civil servants exercise a considerable
degree of personal judgment in deciding what disclosures of official informationthey may properly make, and to whom. More junior civil servants, and those whose duties do not involve contact with members of the public, may have avery limited discretion, or none at all.Section 2 and the private citizen19 It is not only Crown servants who are affected by section 2. Thesection specifies five situations in which other persons are also caught.a. Government contractors and their employees are treated in the same way as Crown servants. Information which they learn in that capacitycounts as &quot;official&quot; for the purposes of the section, and the unauthorised disclosure of such information is an offence. The nature of theinformation is irrelevant.b. Any person to whom official information is entrusted in confidenceby a Crown servant is prohibited from making any unauthorised disclosure of that information.c. Any person in possession of official information &quot;which has beenmade or obtained in contravention&quot; of the Official Secrets Acts is prohibited from making any unauthorised disclosure of that information.This provision makes it possible to have a &quot;chain&quot; of unauthorisedcommunications, with each link in the chain committing an offenceby passing on the information. In effect, the unauthorised handling of official information is an offence in much the same way as handlingstolen goods is an offence.d. Any person coming into possession, by whatever means, of a secretofficial code word or pass word, or of information about a defenceestablishment or other &quot;prohibited place&quot;, is prohibited from making any unauthorised disclosure of that information. It is also an offence to communicate information about munitions of war to any foreign power or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests ofthe State.e. Subsection (2) of section 2 goes even further, by making the merereceipt of official information an offence. It has to be proved thatthe recipient knew, or had reasonable ground to believe, at the timeof receipt that the information was communicated to him in contra-vention of the Official Secrets Acts. He can defend himself by proving that the information was communicated to him contrary to his desire.But the offence itself under section 2 (2) consists of simple receipt.It is immaterial whether the recipient subsequently passes on theinformation or makes any other use of it.Mens rea20 Mens rea, or guilty knowledge, is an essential element of most criminal offences. If a defendant does not have the mens rea appropriate to the offencewith which he is charged, he will be acquitted. Section 2 (2) states explicitlythat the defendant must have known or had reasonable ground to believe,
at the time he received the information, that it was being communicated to him in contravention of the Official Secrets Acts. By contrast section 2 (1) (a),which creates the offence of unauthorised disclosure, contains nothing to implydirectly that mem rea is an ingredient of the offence. There has been onerecent judicial decision, not binding on the higher courts, that mens rea is aningredient of this offence. On the other hand two previous obiter dicta byeminent Judges have described this offence as an &quot;absolute&quot; one not involvingany element of guilty knowledge. The evidence we received showed that thereis still uncertainty on this point.Section 121 Section 2 is concerned with the leakage of official information. Section 1is concerned with spying. The main offence created by section 1 is committed by any person who, &quot;for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of theState&quot;, obtains or communicates any document or information &quot;which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy&quot; (including a potential enemy). Section 2 covers a much wider range of information than section 1, but the two sections overlap. A person who commits an offence against section 1 may well be contravening section 2also. In the main offences created by section 2, however, the intention of the offender is irrelevant, whereas in section 1 it is vital. The words &quot;purposeprejudicial to the safety or interests of the State&quot; in section 1 are not directed to the effect of the offenders action; they relate to his intention. Section 1does not cover all communications prejudicial to the safety or interests of theState, or even all communications of information potentially useful to anenemy. A communication may be seriously damaging to the State although not made with that intent. The damage caused by an unauthorised disclosuredepends on what is disclosed, and to whom, not on the reason for the disclosure.22 The Official Secrets Acts contain two provisions relating to the kindof evidence required to prove an offence under section 1. Section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act 1920 provides that the fact that a person has been in com-munication with a foreign agent shall be evidence that he has, for a purposeprejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, obtained or attempted toobtain information which might be useful to an enemy. Then section 1 itselfprovides that the court may infer that the accused had such a purpose from thecircumstances of the case, or from his conduct or character. In consequenceof these provisions direct evidence of the intention of the accused is seldomadduced. Nor is there normally much argument in court whether the informa-tion concerned might be useful to an enemy. In the typical section 1 case,either the defendant is an agent of a foreign Power, or it is proved that hecommunicated with a representative of a foreign Power. Such evidence, unlessrebutted by the defendant, goes most or all of the way towards proving the prosecution&apos;s case.The control over Official Secrets Act prosecutions23 No prosecution may be brought under any provision of the official secrets Acts without the consent of the Attorney General, or in Scotland ofthe Lord Advocate.
The deterrent effect of section 226 The evidence which we received reflected widely differing generalviews on section 2. But witnesses from both the Government and the newsmedia shared the view that the effect of the section was not to be judged by thenumber of unauthorised disclosures actually resulting in prosecution. A num-ber of Government witnesses said to us that section 2 had a widespread deterrent effect in preventing improper disclosures by Crown servants. The news mediasaid to us that the section frequently deterred or prevented Crown servantsfrom disclosing information of public interest which, in their view, shouldhave been disclosed. Section 2 is rarely activated in the court room, but is seen by many as having a pervasive influence on the work and the behaviour of hundreds of thousands of people.27 We were able to obtain remarkably little direct evidence about theactual effect which section 2 has on the behaviour of those most affected by it, Crown servants. There are other important influences on their behaviour,which we mention in Chapter 5. It is not a simple matter to isolate the effectof section 2.&apos; We think that the section has a deterrent effect on some people,but this effect is not measurable.24 The evidence we received and the information we collected aboutsection 2 and its operation comprises part fact, part interpretation and partopinion. It is difficult to disentangle the three. The concrete, ascertainablefacts about the operation of section 2 represent much less than the wholepicture. The opinions which people hold of the section, the importancethey attach to it, and the interpretations they place upon it, are also an important element of the total situation.Prosecutions under section 225 Appendix II gives a complete list of prosecutions under section 2 sincethe war. No comprehensive list of earlier prosecutions is available, but theAppendix also gives details of several of the more noteworthy prosecutionswhich took place before 1945. Prosecutions have been few. Recently theyhave averaged about one a year. From 1945 to 1971 twenty-three prosecutionswere brought, involving thirty-four defendants, of whom twenty-seven wereconvicted and six acquitted; in one case the charge was withdrawn. nearly two-thirds of the defendants were Crown servants or former Crown servants,including a number of police and prison officers. Only two cases since thewar have involved professional journalists. Well over one-third of the twenty-three cases involved information relating to matters of defence, national security or intelligence. One-third concerned police or prison information.In three cases the information related to international affairs.
The misuse of section 228 There was some evidence that the wide terms of section 2 lent them-selves to misuse. A number of witnesses from the news media told us thatthe threat of prosecution under section 2 was used regularly to prevent thepublication of official information which had come into the hands of themedia. Only two witnesses who appeared before us had first hand experienceof receiving such threats, and one other witness was able to cite a specificinstance of which he had heard. An example given by Mr Chapman Pincherconcerned his discovery in 1950 that there was a serious defect in the con-struction of the nuclear reactor at wind scale, then being built. A senior civil servant told him that if his newspaper printed the story they would be prosecuted. They did not print. A year later, when the defect had been putright, this civil servant admitted to Mr Pincher that the threat had been anempty one. Apart from these three witnesses, however, we received no otherspecific evidence, written or oral, of threats of this kind. Some news mediawitnesses said expressly that neither they nor their staff had ever received suchthreats.29 We received written submissions from a small number of Crown servants and former Crown servants to the effect that the possibility of prosecutionunder section 2 had been drawn to their attention, directly or by indirectmeans, in the course of disputes on various subjects with their Departments.Some of these disputes concerned questions of policy, and the gist of the complaints in these cases was that section 2 had been used to prevent theventilation of issues of public interest. Some concerned the personal positionof the Crown servants involved, and the complaint was that the section hadbeen used, or the Crown servant believed it had been used, to keep the disputewithin the Department and thus to hamper his efforts to obtain redress.30 Where an unauthorised disclosure would cause serious damage to thenation, and the possibility of prosecution for that disclosure would be real,it is clearly proper for those in authority to draw attention to these facts.Some of the instances given to us were not of this kind. The evidence did not suggest that section 2 is commonly used as a basis for empty threats or as a weapon of staff management. Our proposals to replace section 2 by narrowerand more specific provisions would mean that such abuses ceased to be possible.The disregard of section 231 It was commonly asserted, in evidence from non-Government sources,that section 2 is frequently broken or disregarded with impunity by crown servants and journalists alike. Some alleged daily breaches. We received no concrete evidence to support these assertions; for they stem from a misunderstanding about the proper interpretation of section 2. The conceptsof self-authorisation and implicit authorisation, which we have described inparagraph 18, are little known outside the Civil Service. Consequently manydisclosures by Crown servants which are authorised and legal are apparentlyregarded by others as unauthorised and technically illegal. The fact thatsuch widespread misunderstanding exists is itself a significant commentary onsection 2. One aim of our proposals is to reduce the scope for this kind ofmisunderstanding.
32 Official information is disseminated, in a properly authorised manner,in a variety of ways. Ministerial statements in Parliament and elsewhere,Government publications, and written and oral statements by GovernmentPublic Relations Officers, are by no means the only ways in which this is done.A great deal of information is also given by Ministers and by civil servants(mainly senior ones) by less formal means. Much of this is given by word ofmouth, often on social or informal occasions when the Crown servant concerned is not obviously &quot;on duty&quot;. Some of this information is given openly andmay be published by its recipients as coming from a Government source.Some is given on a &quot;non-attributable&quot; basis, which means that it may bepublished by its recipients provided they do not identify its source. Some isgiven as &quot;background&quot;, which means that the recipient may take account of it(e.g. it might affect the interpretation of events made by a journalist) but theinformation itself may not be used directly. Some is given in confidence, forinstance in the course of consultations between the Government and outside interests, and such information is not intended for general disclosure.33 A number of those who gave evidence to us apparently assumed thatwhen a Crown servant even a Minister specified that official information which he disclosed was non-attributable or was given as background or in confidence, or when he talked informally about his work when not actually onthe job, he was not &quot;authorised&quot; under section 2, so that technically both heand the recipient of the information were in breach of the section. This is amisconception. It is part of the job of Ministers and senior civil servants tocommunicate information in these ways. They are &quot;authorised&quot; to do so interms of section 2. We received no evidence that the section is in fact beingbroken daily in the manner suggested. Crown servants may, of course,exceed their authority and disclose more than they should. When they do so,it can be difficult for the recipient to know which is the information he shouldnot have been told. This is a different point, though an important one. an object of our proposals is to enable members of the public to tell with greatercertainty whether they are free to pass on or publish official information whichthey receive.Official Secrets Act declarations34 Every civil servant signs what is known as an Official Secrets Actdeclaration at least twice in his career. Such declarations are signed onentering and on leaving the Civil Service. They may be signed on other occasions too, e.g. on ceasing to be concerned with secret work. Declarationsare also signed by numbers of non-civil servants, e.g. employees of Governmentcontractors working on classified contracts, officers of public authoritiesinvolved in planning for war or emergency, and members of official com-mittees, consultants and research workers who are given access to official information in confidence. Copies of the forms of declaration most commonlyused are at Appendix VI.35 These declarations, which have no legal force, have two objects. Thefirst is to draw the attention of civil servants and others to provisions of theOfficial Secrets Acts which affect them. The provisions printed on the backsof the declarations are the whole of section 2, and section 1 (2) of the Official
Secrets Act 1920. Sir William Armstrong explained to us that the secondobject of these declarations, and the one which in fact gave rise to their intro-duction, was to draw attention to Civil Service regulations governing the useof official information for non-official purposes. The rule of the Service isthat a civil servant who wishes, for his own purposes, to publish material which includes official information should obtain prior official sanction in writing.In the declarations this rule is presented as a gloss on section 2. The incorrectimpression can thus be given that &quot;authorisation&quot; under section 2 meansexpress prior authorisation. This confusion results from trying to achieve two distinct objects, both proper, by means of a single declaration.36 These declarations are also misleading in that they draw attention to section 1 (2) of the 1920 Act by itself. That subsection refers to &quot;any officialdocument&quot;. In section 1 of the 1920 Act, however, the term &quot;official document&quot;has a highly restrictive definition. This definition is hidden away in section 1(1) (c), and says that &quot;official document&quot; means an official pass, permit,certificate, or licence, or other similar document. This means that all thosewho sign these declarations, and who read section 1 (2) alone on the back,almost certainly receive the erroneous impression that this subsection applies to official documents of all kinds.Control over prosecutions by the Attorney General and the Lord Advocate37 Proceedings under the Official Secrets Acts are normally brought inEngland and Wales by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The institution ofsuch proceedings requires the consent of the Attorney General (or the solicitor general), who takes his decision only after he has received the Directorsadvice. This decision is taken by the Attorney in his capacity as the Crown&apos;ssenior Law Officer, responsible for the enforcement of the criminal law, notin his capacity as a Minister in the Government of the day. In deciding whether to prosecute he applies his judgment to the balance of public interestinvolved. The Attorney General may consult Ministerial colleagues before taking his decision. He will do this in cases where he thinks there may be important considerations of public policy or of a political or international character to be taken into account.  The final decision, however, is his alone.38 Part of our evidence on the way in which Attorneys General exercisethis function came from those who had direct personal experience of this matter,either from inside the Government or in other ways. All these witnesses saidthat this function is exercised impartially in accordance with the Attorney&apos;judgment of the public interest, and that there is no question of party con-siderations intruding. A number of other witnesses expressed the opinionthat it must be difficult for an Attorney General, when taking decisions con-cerning the enforcement of the law, to divorce himself from his position as amember of the Government and to exclude from his mind all party considerations.Nearly all those who made this point were quick to stress that they themselveshad no evidence of partiality or impropriety by an Attorney General. Theirargument was that it must be difficult for the outside world to understand theposition. The evidence certainly indicated quite widespread unhappinessabout the Attorney General&apos;s control over prosecutions under section 2. we found no facts to indicate that there had been, for many years past, any objective
foundation for this feeling of unease. Some witnesses, however, asked us ineffect to regard the appearance as more important than the reality. we discuss these matters further in Chapter 16.39 In Scotland the position is somewhat different. Prosecutions in Scotlandare in any event taken by or on behalf of the Lord Advocate. But the 1911Act provides that a prosecution in Scotland under the Act shall not be institutedexcept by or with the consent of the Lord Advocate. This appears to be theonly provision of this kind in Scottish law. We received no suggestion thatthe position in Scotland should be changed. As it happens there has been noprosecution under section 2 in Scotland within living memory.The broad spectrum of views on section 240 Views on section 2 range from almost unqualified approval to totalrejection. At one extreme, the evidence from a number of GovernmentDepartments, and from several individuals, implied that they would be happyif section 2 remained substantially as it is. At the other extreme, organisationsrepresenting the editorial and proprietorial sides of newspapers and periodicalswere among those who advocated total repeal. Those advocating the replace-ment of section 2 by narrower provisions, rather than its retention or its completeremoval, also included organisations representing journalists, in addition tothose representing broadcasting, lawyers and senior administrative civil servants.Viewpoints in between the two extremes covered a wide range. Some witnesseswho favoured the replacement of section 2 proposed that it should be limitedstrictly to matters of defence security. Some proposed a less strict limitation,and would retain criminal sanctions also for matters of such importance to thenation as foreign relations, international negotiations and certain aspects of themanagement of the currency and the economy. Some suggested that section should continue to cover all kinds of official information, but that anunauthoriseddisclosure should be an offence only if the information concerned was classified,or the disclosure could be shown to have damaged the national interest, or both.There were various other suggestions for reforming section 2.Some common criticisms41 Certain general themes run through a great deal of the evidence fromthose who advocate the removal or replacement of section 2. A clear distinctionis commonly drawn between espionage and leakage, often with the corollarythat the Official Secrets Acts should be confined to the former. Journalists,in particular, find it offensive that the performance of their job may place themin peril of prosecution under the Act used to deal with spies and traitors.There is widespread agreement that the criminal law should be used to preventdisclosures damaging to the security of the nation, but less agreement on what this phrase embraces; some witnesses regard section 1 as adequately serving thispurpose. In much of this evidence a distinction is drawn between the interestsof the nation and those of the Government. It is pointed out that section 2protects all Government information and can therefore be used to protect thepolitical interests of the Government. Some witnesses then suggest that theposition of the Government is the same, in this respect, as that of any other
large organisation which, wishes to keep aspects of its own business to itself.Other organisations, it is said, manage this without the protection of the criminal law; let the Government do likewise. Other witnesses take the view that theGovernment is unique in that it acts on behalf of the whole people and is respon-sible for the security of the nation, and therefore cannot be equated with any otherinstitution. Another related theme is that criminal sanctions may be justifiable to prevent leakage by the Government^ own servants, but should not be used against other citizens to prevent the further disclosure of information which theGovernment has already failed to protect effectively.42 On one point critics and defenders of section 2 alike are agreed. Thesection has a number of unsatisfactory features. It cannot be put forward as ashining example of our criminal law. In the next Chapter we describe howsection 2 came into being in its present form.
The Official Secrets Act 1889 and the prevention of leakage44 The first Official Secrets Act was passed in 1889. This Act soon provedinadequate, in the view of governments. For nearly twenty years there wasa desire within government circles for stronger legislation. This strongerlegislation was eventually passed in 1911. The Official Secrets Act 1911 wasnot fresh legislation in a virgin field. It was a replacement, in wider andstronger terms, of legislation passed twenty-two years earlier. These facts are essential to any understanding of the 1911 Act and of its objects as seen by the Government of the day.45 A major object of the 1889 Act was to provide stronger measures against the leakage of official information by civil servants. Leaks of official information of all kinds had been causing concern to governments for years.Exhortations, threats and discipline had proved inadequate to stop them. Twoleaks occurring in quick succession in 1887 led to the eventual decision to legislate; one came close to espionage, the other involved publication in thepress. The 1889 Act dealt with both espionage and leakage. Section 2 ofthe Act covered the latter. The original section 2 was a catch-all; but itsgrasp was less comprehensive than that of section 2 of the 1911 Act. It caughtall Crown servants and some Government contractors, but no-one else.It caught all kinds of official information; but an offence was committed only if official information was communicated to a person to whom it ought not&quot;in the interest of the State or otherwise in the public interest&quot; to be communi-cated. Remarks made during the brief Parliamentary debates on the 1889legislation showed a recognition that the original section 2 was a general provision against unauthorised disclosures by Crown servants. One Memberof Parliament forecast that a section which only caught Crown servants and government contractors would have limited effectiveness.43 A number of witnesses have appealed to the history of the official secrets Acts in support of their views, and have referred to parlimentary debates on the Acts. We have undertaken some research of our own, especiallyinto official files. There is a contrast between the inside view of the originsand objects of section 2, as it emerges from the files, and the public view whichemerges from the debates. This contrast is particularly striking when oneexamines the circumstances surrounding the preparation and passage of thelegislation of 1911. The House of Commons took half an hour to pass the1911 Bill through all its stages, but the long series of official files recording the events leading up to this legislation stretches well back into the nineteenth century. There is a summary of our research in Appendix III. This Chapterbrings out the main points.
The reasons for the 1911 Act46 The inadequacies of the 1889 Act were not long in showing. Leakagesof official information of all kinds continued, despite the risk of prosecutionnow involved. The provisions on espionage imposed a difficult burden ofproof on the prosecution, and lacked adequate powers of enforcement. A Billto rectify the latter deficiencies was introduced in 1896, but not proceeded with. Legislation was considered on some other subsequent occasions, and in1908 a further Bill was introduced. This was designed not only to strengthen the espionage provisions of the 1889 Act, but also to prevent the unauthorisedpublication of certain kinds of official information. Representations by thepress and lack of Parliamentary time led to the abandonment of this Bill.47 Meanwhile there was growing concern about German espionage. ASub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was set up to examine this subject and reported in 1909. One of its recommendations was that theprovisions of the 1889 Act on spying should be strengthened along the linesalready attempted in the abortive Bills of 1896 and 1908. Later in 1909another leak in the press gave rise to questions in Parliament, and a further serious leak in 1910 underlined the conclusion already reached in governmentcircles that section 2 of the 1889 Act also required strengthening.48 The decision to legislate in 1911 was thus one step in a sequence ofevents which had started many years previously. Governments wanted to stopleakage as well as espionage. When administrative measures proved insuffi-cient, they tried legislation. When the first, restricted Act proved inadequate,they decided on stronger legislation. For some years the Parliamentaryclimate was not favourable to such legislation, and in 1908 a Bill designedovertly to restrict the press incurred strong criticism. By 1911, however, amore favourable climate had developed.The passage of the 1911 Act49 In the summer of 1911 the Government, and the country, were besetby the constitutional crisis over the Parliament Bill and by the Agadir crisis.The Official Secrets Bill was not introduced into Parliament until July, and did not reach the House of Commons until August. The Bill was put forward by the Government as a measure which was aimed at spying and was essentialon grounds of national security. These were indeed its main objects.Government spokesmen explained that the Bill was intended to serve, but more effectively, the same objects as the 1889 Act which it would replace.They did not conceal the facts that the new section 2 was designed to impose amuch tighter grip on all unauthorised disclosures of all kinds of official information than its forerunner of 1889, and that it would affect the press aswell as Crown servants. Nor did they think it necessary to draw attentionto these facts.   Section 2 was not once mentioned in the Parliamentary debates.50 It was in these circumstances that the 1911 legislation passed through parliament with little debate. The country was in crisis and it was late summer.The debates on the Bill in the House of Lords were brief, and the House ofCommons passed it in one afternoon with no detailed scrutiny and virtuallywithout debate. The debates give a clear impression of crisis legislation,aimed mainly at espionage.  Closer study, and reference to official sources,
reveal a different story. This legislation had been long desired by governments.It had been carefully prepared over a period of years. One of its objects was togive greater protection against leakages of any kind of official information,whether or not connected with defence or national security. This was clearenough for the text of the Bill alone. Although section 2 of the 1911 Actwas much wider in a number of respects than section 2 of the 1889 Act, thefiles suggest that the Government in 1911 honestly believed that it introducedno new principle, but merely put into practice more effectually the principle of using criminal sanctions to protect official information. At all events, theGovernment elected not to volunteer complete explanations of their Bill inParliament. And Parliament, in the special circumstances of that summer, didnot look behind the explanations offered.The Official Secrets Act 192051 The 1920 Act made a number of amendments to section 2 of the 1911Act. It inserted the references to secret code words and pass words, and the paragraphs which now form section 2 (1) (aa), 2 (1) (c) and 2 (1A). these provisions were added to the 1920 Bill at a late stage in the parliamentary proceedings, and almost without debate. The main object of the Bill was to enact in permanent form certain Defence of the Realm Regulations which theGovernment wished to preserve in peacetime. Some of the provisions of this bill were controversial, and were fully debated in Parliament. But these provisions did not impinge on section 2, and the debates of 1920 were not concerned with section 2.Some common views on the history of section 252 Some of the evidence we received, and some other works on the official secrets Acts which we studied, put forward a different view of section 2 andits history, on the following lines. The Official Secrets Act 1911, it is sug-gested, was hurriedly put together and hurriedly passed by Parliament without proper debate, in the stress of a national emergency. Section 2, it is said, wasnot intended by the Government of the day or by Parliament to have in practice the catch-all quality described in Chapter 2. The very wide terms of thesection are explained as having simply been intended to make doubly sure, inconjunction with section 1, that no actions imperilling national security couldinadvertently escape the net. It is then argued that advantage has subsequently been taken of this wide drafting to extend the application of section 2 over theentire field of government, in a way never contemplated in 1911. This is said tohave been done despite the explanations given in Parliament in 1911 that theAct was concerned only with spying and the defence of the nation. The originalintentions of Parliament, according to this view, should now be fulfilled by the repeal or drastic narrowing down of section 2.53 These views are consistent with what was said in Parliament in 1911.But Parliament was not given full explanations of the 1911 Bill, and did notexamine it in detail. It may be that most members of the legislature, when theypassed the Bill in such haste, were thinking only of the need to protect thesecurity of the nation. There was no doubt, however, that the Bill had, andwas intended by the Government to have, a wider scope.  Governments did not
extend the scope of section 2 later. They acted from the moment of its passingon the basis that it meant what it said ; and a leading court case in 1919confirmed that this supposition was correct.54 We have thought it right to put the historical record straight, but theworld has changed greatly since 1911. National security today means muchmore than the Navy and the dockyards. A new law for the 1970&apos;s is bestjustified by contemporary rather than by historical considerations. Neverthe-less we share the view that the Official Secrets Acts would be better limited tospying and related matters. We also share the view that the main justification,though not the only one, for the use of criminal sanctions to protect official information from harmful leakage is to guard the security of the nation andthe safety of the people.
OTHER SAFEGUARDS FOR OFFICIAL INFORMATION55 Civil servants are noted for discretion rather than the reverse. we found some indications of frustration at this fact. A number of those whothink government should be more open would like civil servants to revealconsiderably more official information than they do. There is a tendency to regard section 2 as the reason why this does not happen. Some critics see section 2 as the ultimate bastion defending an unduly secretive system ofgovernment. Some Government witnesses regard section 2 as the ultimateguarantee of the reliability and discretion of the public service. Both view-points exaggerate the effect of the section. There are other, more important,factors which influence the behaviour of civil servants and which determine theopenness of government. These influences will continue whatever the fate ofsection 2. No assessment can be made of the present situation, or of the effectof possible changes in the law, without taking full account of these otherinfluences.Constitutional factors56 The way in which our constitution works determines both the degree ofopenness in government and the role and behaviour of the Civil Service.In this country Ministers take decisions and lay down policy. ministers are held responsible for their decisions and are accountable to parliament for them. It is the function of Ministers to explain and defend their decisions and their policies and to decide what official information shall be revealed.The function of the Civil Service is to advise Ministers, and to carry out their decisions and their policies. Owing to the wide range of governmentalfunctions today, and the sheer size of the Government machine, senior civilservants in practice take many decisions within the ambit of broad Ministerialpolicies, and have a substantial role in explaining official policies and dis-closing official information. Senior civil servants also engage in consultations,soundings and discussions, both formal and informal, to enable them to formulate advice to Ministers. In doing so they inevitably give information and views as well as receiving them. Junior civil servants are more circum-scribed, but those whose work involves contact with the public may also have a function of explaining policy and giving information.57 There is no direct connection between these constitutional arrangements and section 2. The section does not fetter Ministers in any way in deciding what to disclose and what to withhold. . Their decisions are influenced mainly by the normal operation of the system of Parliamentary government, by theattentions of the media and by public pressures of all kinds. Senior civilservants who disclose official information do so on behalf of Ministers, andin accordance with their express or implied wishes. Junior civil servants actin accordance with their instructions.
Civil Service sanctions58 Section 2 provides one sanction to ensure that civil servants do not make unauthorised disclosures. This sanction is rarely invoked. Othersanctions, formal and informal, are of greater practical consequence. the informal sanction lies in the fact that a civil servant who is regarded as un-reliable, or who tends to overstep the mark and to talk too freely, will not enjoy such a satisfactory career as colleagues with better judgment and greaterdiscretion. He may fail to obtain promotion, or he may be given less important and attractive jobs. The great majority of civil servants wish to perform their duties conscientiously and to enjoy successful careers. Theseare powerful natural incentives to proper behaviour. Temporary civil servants,those not wedded to a career of public service, and those close to retirement,do not, however, have the same incentive; their number is not inconsiderable,and their existence cannot be disregarded in considering the need for moreformal sanctions.Civil Service discipline59 On top of the natural incentives to good behaviour lies the formaldiscipline of the Civil Service. There is a detailed code of discipline governing the official conduct of civil servants and the procedures and penalties for breaches of discipline. These penalties range from reprimand to dismissal.Serious or repeated unauthorised disclosures of official information may result in dismissal. In those cases of this kind which were brought to ournotice the civil servants concerned were dismissed, but not prosecuted undersection 2. Again, these formal sanctions naturally have less effect on thosewho do not expect to remain in the Civil Service for long, or who for other reasons do not mind dismissal. Neither the informal incentives nor the formaldiscipline reach those who have already retired, many of whom retain importantofficial information in their memories, whether or not they retain any official documents. There was until recently a provision for the forfeiture of a CivilService pension for misconduct. There is, however, the greatest reluctance to take away the pension which an officer has earned by his years of publicservice. Under the new Civil Service pensions scheme, forfeiture is no longer possible.Recruitment, vetting and training60 The Government does not rely entirely on sanctions after entry toensure the reliability and discretion of Crown servants. Its recruitmentprocedures are designed to ensure fitness for appointment in these as well asin other respects. Those whose work involves regular access to sensitiveinformation receive appropriate training and instructions. There are alsovetting procedures to check further the suitability of those with access toparticularly sensitive information.Security classifications and privacy markings61 In addition to the restraints upon unauthorised disclosure which wehave mentioned, the Government uses various systems of marks to identifyofficial information which requires special protection. Security classificationis the most important and most widely known of these systems.  We found that
some witnesses were uncertain about the significance of security classification,and its relationship to section 2. As the law now stands, there is no con-nection between them. Security classification is a purely administrativesystem, unrelated to the criminal law. The classification of a documentdetermines the precautions to be taken in handling it. The higher the classi-fication, the more stringent the physical precautions required (e.g. locking upin safes), and the more restrictive the rules about who may have access to the document. Classification does not determine the sanctions taken forunauthorised disclosure.62 There are four levels of classification, and the criterion for awarding aclassification is the degree of damage that would be caused by the unauthorised disclosure of the information in question. The four classifications, and the criteria for awarding them, are:TOP SECRET Exceptionally grave damage to the nationSECRET Serious injury to the interests of the nationCONFIDENTIAL Prejudicial to the interests of the nationRESTRICTED Undesirable in the interests of the nationThe &quot;interests of the nation&quot; are interpreted broadly, and are not confined to questions of national security in the military sense.63 Privacy markings are used by Departments to identify information which does not warrant a security classification but which nevertheless needsprotection. For instance, it may have been entrusted to the Government in confidence, or it may relate to the private affairs of a firm or an individual.Examples are:COMMERCIAL-IN CONFIDENCE   Confidential information ofa commercial natureSTAFF-IN CONFIDENCE Confidential information aboutstaff and appointments inGovernment Departments.64 It is worth noting that in common parlance &quot;confidential&quot; meanssomething less than &quot;secret&quot;. In the Governments system, the markingCONFIDENTIAL represents a secret, not a confidence.&apos;D&apos; Notices65 There is another administrative system for protecting certain official information, the &apos;D&apos; Notice system. Unlike the various means of protectionmentioned earlier in this Chapter, &apos;D&apos; Notices are addressed to the news media,not to Crown servants. The &apos;D&apos; Notice system is entirely voluntary and hasno legal authority. A &apos;D&apos; Notice may be issued only on the authority of theDefence, Press and Broadcasting Committee, which is composed of officials from Government Departments concerned with defence and national security and representatives of the press and broadcasting organisations. The Noticesare addressed to editors of newspapers, to those concerned in broadcasting,and to others concerned with publications on defence and related subjects.
Their purpose is to advise editors that the Government regards certain categories of information, which the Notices usually but not always define ingeneral terms, as being secret for reasons of national security, and to askeditors to refrain from publishing such information. An editor who is in doubt can contact the Secretary of the Committee for advice. There is no direct relationship between this system and the Official Secrets Acts, andnothing in the &apos;D&apos; Notice system relieves an editor of his responsibilities underthe Acts.The Public Records Act 195866 This Act requires mention because, like section 2, it is concerned withdisclosures of official information. It lays down procedures for deciding whatofficial records shall be preserved, and the period after which such records shallbe available for public inspection. Most records are now made available tothe public after 30 years, but some particularly sensitive ones are kept closedf for longer periods ranging up to 100 years. The Public Records Act and section 2 are connected in that, once an official record has been made publiclyavailable under the Act, the question of a prosecution under section 2 for the disclosure of that record can no longer arise. The Act, however, is concernedwith the disclosure of old records. Our prime concern is with contemporarydisclosure.The place of the criminal law67 This Chapter has shown the relatively limited part played by section in preserving official secrecy. It was described to us by some Governmentwitnesses as a long-stop or a safety net. These are apt descriptions. Section 2is not the main protection: its function is to provide an extra margin of protec-tion, in case other measures should fail. At present this extra protection isspread over the entire business of government. It is based on the idea ofdefence in breadth rather than in depth. Much of the evidence suggested that defence in depth, concentrated on that relatively small proportion of official information the protection of which is of major importance to the nation,would be a more effective and appropriate role for the criminal law.
OVERSEAS EXPERIENCE AND OPEN GOVERNMENTSection 2 and practice abroad68 We have recorded in Chapter 1 how our appointment can be tracedback to what the Fulton Committee said about openness in government. in chapter 5 we have described the limited role played by section 2 in the enforce-ment of government secrecy. We have also mentioned in these two Chaptersthe political and constitutional factors which determine the degree of opennessin our government. This is not to say, however, that section 2 has no connectionwith the question of openness. Evidence from the news media suggested that section 2 created a general atmosphere of unnecessary secrecy, and wassometimes used as an excuse for refusing to reveal official information. Theoral evidence we received from some former Ministers and from Heads ofGovernment Departments satisfied us that Ministers and senior civil servantsworking in London are in no way inhibited by section 2. They rarely haveoccasion to give the section even a passing thought. But the evidence as awhole, from within the Government as well as outside it, indicated that section 2has some effect in creating a general aura of secrecy. As a result some civilservants are probably less forthcoming than they would otherwise be. this applies particularly to junior civil servants, and some of the evidence suggestedthat those working in the provinces are more affected than those in London.69 We were urged by a number of witnesses to repeal or severely curtailsection 2 so as to get rid of such inhibitions upon openness. So far as section 2now acts as a barrier to openness on matters not requiring the protection ofthe criminal law, our proposals will remove that barrier. We were also urged by a number of witnesses to study the example of other countries which, it wassuggested, had more open systems of government because they lacked any lawcomparable to section 2. A small number of witnesses went further, and suggested the introduction of legislation to give a general right of access tocertain kinds of official information, on the lines of the laws in the UnitedStates and Sweden.70 In deciding to study the law and practice in Canada, France, sweden and the United States we had four objects in mind. First, our examinationof the situation in this country suggested strongly that openness in governmentdepended on political and constitutional factors rather than on legal provisions.A study of the situation in other countries, including one which has a lawvirtually identical to ours and two which have laws giving rights of access to official information, would enable us the better to judge the correctness of thatconclusion. Second, we wished to inform ourselves how laws giving such rights of access operate in other countries, and whether it would be practicable to transplant them into a very different constitutional background, to help usdecide how far it was our business to consider the possibility of such legislation
in this country. Third, we wished to find out what official matters are regarded in other countries as secret or confidential, so as to compare these views withthose of our witnesses. Fourth, we wished to ascertain to what extent the criminal law is used in other countries to protect such matters, and how theirlaws are formulated.71 A factual summary of the laws of the four countries is in Appendix IV.In the rest of this Chapter we discuss the results of our study of these laws and our visits to these countries, and the conclusions we have drawn.72 In Canada the Official Secrets Act follows closely the terms of theUnited Kingdom legislation, and the same range of official information is covered by the law. Actual prosecutions, however, are infrequent. In France,Sweden and the United States the basic nucleus of official information protected by the criminal law goes much wider than defence, narrowly construed, and ineach case includes questions of foreign relations. French law is in terms ofthe &quot;defence of the nation&quot; but this concept covers all kinds of threat, internalas well as external, to the security and integrity of France and to the life ofthe population; important matters in the diplomatic, economic and technological-logical fields are covered as well as military matters. In the United States the concept of &quot;national security&quot; covers foreign relations as well as defence and intelligence matters; information relating to law enforcement is excepted fromthe provisions on public access to official documents. In Sweden official documents about major defence matters, about Sweden&apos;s relations with foreign powers, and about law enforcement, are secret and are protected by criminal sanctions.73 Although the basic nucleus of secret matters is thus broadly similar in the countries we visited, the detailed formulation of their laws differsconsiderably. In each case the law on this subject is part of a wider systemof laws which, as a whole, is much influenced by the legal and constitutionaltraditions of the country. The adoption in this country of laws based on a french, Swedish or United States model would involve amendments to ourstatutes going well beyond section 2. While there are a number of points of interest about these other laws, we came to the conclusion that any new provisions replacing section 2 must be formulated in terms of the situation inthe United Kingdom and the existing legal and constitutional framework ofwhich these new provisions will form part.74 We also found general agreement that the considerable volume ofprivate information from firms and individuals which a modern Governmentreceives ought to be kept confidential. In France there is a general provision in the penal code which prohibits the disclosure of personal informationentrusted to someone by reason of his profession or status, and this applies to Government officials in the same way as to other citizens. In Swedendocumentary information of this kind is protected by the secrecy legislation.In the United States such information is excepted from the provisions on access to official documents in the Freedom of Information Act.
75 Governmental representatives in all four countries took it for granted that a Government cannot function completely in the open, but must be able to preserve the confidential nature of its internal processes, especially at thehighest levels of policy making. In France, Sweden and the United Statesthere is no general provision of criminal law to secure this confidentiality, andits maintenance rests upon internal discipline.The Swedish and United States laws on access to official documents76 The Swedish Constitution confers a general right, which is subject to exceptions, to inspect and to publish official documents. Anyone who wishesmay inspect official documents on their arrival at or despatch from public offices. There is also a right to see documents held in public offices. TheUnited States Freedom of Information Act requires governmental agencies to publish information about their organisation, procedures and policy decisions.It then confers a general right, which again is subject to exceptions, to seeidentifiable documents held by agencies. Incoming and outgoing documents of United States agencies are not made available for inspection, as in Sweden;specific documents have to be requested.77 In both countries the law incorporates an extensive list of kinds of official documents which are excepted from the right of public access. Theseexceptions include documents relating to defence, foreign relations and lawenforcement, and those containing personal, commercial and industrial informa-tion of a private nature. In Sweden they include Cabinet documents. Inrelation to defence and foreign relations, both laws leave the Government todecide what must be kept secret. In addition to these extensive exceptions,both laws are drafted in a way which protects the internal processes of govern-ment from compulsory disclosure. In Sweden this is done by an exception for &quot;working papers&quot; prepared by an authority for the purposes of reaching a decision. Such documents are not open to public access unless they are placed on the official file after the decision has been taken, which is done insome cases but not all. The United States law is in terms of settled decisions and procedures and identifiable documents, and does not cover internaldocuments such as &quot;working papers&quot;. Both laws relate only to documents;they do not touch oral discussions and information.Comparative degrees of openness and their causes78 In consequence of these laws, official documents outside the exceptedcategories can be and are inspected by the press and by ordinary citizens in sweden and the United States, in circumstances where comparable documentsare not automatically available in this country and may in practice be withheld.In some of the evidence this fact seems almost to be regarded as sufficient by itself to establish that government in these two countries is &quot;open&quot;, and that similar legislation in the United Kingdom would make our government &quot;open&quot;too.  The position is not so s mple.79 In the United States the Espionage Act makes it an offence for anyperson to communicate information relating to national defence with reasonto believe that it could be used to the injury of the United States or to the
advantage of any foreign nation. Another title of the United States Codemakes it an offence for a Government employee to communicate classifiedinformation, without authorisation, to a foreign Government or a communistorganisation. It is not an offence under United States law to give classifiedinformation to any other person, or to publish it, unless that informationrelates to &quot;national defence&quot; as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Thusinformation about foreign relations or past events is not fully covered. So faras the United States law affects disclosures of official information, authorisedor otherwise, this limitation on the protection given to much sensitive informa-tion has greater importance than the Freedom of Information Act. That Actis less useful to the press than might appear, since an official document must first be identified and then asked for, and this requires time.80 In Sweden the news media make more use of the legal right of access,since incoming and outgoing documents are available for inspection at public offices without the need for a special request. Nevertheless, Swedish law makessubstantial allowances for the demands of government secrecy, contrary tothe impression of almost total openness conveyed to us by some of those whoextolled the Swedish system in their evidence. There is a major piece oflegislation (the Secrecy Act) devoted entirely to spelling out in detail the numerous classes of official document which are not available to public inspec-tion. The need to keep some of the internal processes of government confidentialis met by the exception for &quot;working papers&quot;.81 We make these comments to underline the point that too much emphasis should not be placed on the nature of a country&apos;s laws when consideringopenness in government. In each of the four overseas countries which wevisited, as in this country, there is a variety of factors affecting openness.Constitutional arrangements, political tradition, and national character,habits and ways of thought, all have their influence. Our examination of theposition in five countries, differing from each other in all these respects buteach within the broad tradition of western democracy, has confirmed that thelaw is by no means the most important influence on openness. In some countries it is not even a major one. A particular national law cannot inany event be sensibly assessed apart from the whole national context.82 The context of the Swedish and United States laws on access to official documents is very different from the context of section 2 in the United Kingdom.The United States and Sweden both have written constitutions, and a degreeof separation of powers foreign to a parliamentary system of the British kind.In the United States the Administration and Congress are separate, each withits constitutionally defined sphere of responsibility. The constitution incorporate-ates a series of checks and balances, and the right of access to certain official documents can be seen as a natural part of this system.83 The Swedish system makes a clear-cut distinction between the functionsof law-making and policy-formulation on the one hand, and executive functionson the other hand. The Ministers forming the Government, the small numberof civil servants in the central Ministries who advise them, and the legislature,
are concerned with the formulation of law and policy. The execution of lawand policy (outside the fields of defence and foreign affairs) is the function ofautonomous Boards. These Boards are not responsible to Ministers or to thelegislature. A central feature of the British system of government -theresponsibility of Ministers for the execution of policy and their accountabilityto Parliament is absent in Sweden. In its place, the Swedish system containsfour different kinds of mechanism for controlling the work of the Boards:a. Public servants are directly responsible to the law, and can be prosecutedfor breach of duty.b. There is a Supreme Administrative Court, which decides disputes overthe way in which the Boards apply the law.c. Every citizen with a complaint has the right of direct access to theOmbudsman.d. The citizen has the right to see and to publish official documentsoutside the excepted categories.The right of access to official documents in Sweden must therefore be viewedas one part of a system which differs in many ways from the British system.Another major difference lies in Sweden&apos;s relatively small population, which means that the system of government as a whole is smaller and less complex.84 The British system combines Parliamentary control with a strongexecutive. The Government decides how to manage its business, includingthe release of information and the timing of statements. A large amount of official information is in fact given to Parliament and the people, partly on theinitiative of the Government and partly in response to requests and pressures.Our own experience and inquiries do not lend support to the stark contrast,drawn by a few witnesses, between an obsessively secret system in this countryand gloriously open systems in some other countries. All the countries weexamined preserve secrecy for some of the basic functions of government. Inother matters each country has open and closed aspects, according to its ownsystem and habits, and its own method of managing the tension betweenopenness and secrecy. Comparison is not a straightforward matter. It is,incidentally, not the case, as implied by some of the evidence, that section 2is the most restrictive law in any democracy. Other Commonwealth countries as well as Canada have very similar laws.The scope of our task85 It was against the background set out in this Chapter that we approached the suggestion that we should consider recommending legislation on the linesof the Swedish and United States laws on public access to official documents.It was put to us that such legislation would &quot;positively assist the public toobtain information about government&quot;. This was an interesting suggestion,but we decided on reflection that it was not one which we should adopt. it seemed to us that this suggestion raised important constitutional questionsgoing beyond our terms of reference.
86 Accordingly we have not gone fully into the possibility of such legislation in the United Kingdom, in the sense of treating it as if it fell within our terms ofreference. Such laws cannot simply be transplanted into the very differentBritish context, without consideration of the constitutional repercussions.Moreover, as we have said, the law is not one of the most important influenceson openness in government whether it be a law to protect official information from disclosure or one to confer a right of access to some official documents.Some of the evidence we received in this country suggested a belief in a directconnection of cause and effect between the existence of laws on public access in sweden and the United States and open systems of government in thosecountries; what we found through our own inquiries there does not suppor tsuch a belief.87 To the extent that there is a connection between openness in governmentand the law relating to official information, our proposals to replace section by much narrower provisions would represent a move towards greater openness.These proposals would mean that the use of the criminal law to protect official information would be confined, broadly speaking, to those areas of governmentin which the Swedish and United States laws on public access do not operate.The succeeding Parts of this Report discuss the questions what official informa-tion should remain protected by the criminal law, by what classes of person,and in what circumstances.
PartnTHE ISSUESCHAPTER 7RETENTION, REMOVAL OR REPLACEMENTThe need for change88 The first part of our terms of reference was to review the operation ofsection 2. Part I of this Report has described what we found as a result ofthis review. We found section 2 a mess. Its scope is enormously wide.Any law which impinges on the freedom of information in a democracy shouldbe much more tightly drawn. A catch-all provision is saved from absurdityin operation only by the sparing exercise of the Attorney General&apos;s discretion to prosecute. Yet the very width of this discretion, and the inevitably selectiveway in which it is exercised, give rise to considerable unease. The draftingand interpretation of the section are obscure. People are not sure what it means, or how it operates in practice, or what kinds of action involve real risk of prosecution under it.89 A quite different issue arises from the taint of espionage which surroundssection 2. There is a widely held view that the Official Secrets Acts shouldbe concerned only with spies and traitors. For the most part these Acts dealwith espionage, the protection of defence establishments and matters of that kind. Section 2 stands out as a conspicuous exception. It deals with infor-mation of all kinds, and it catches people who have no thought of harmingtheir country. Many consider it wrong that such a provision should appearside by side with the rest of the Official Secrets Acts.90 These factors convinced us that change was essential, and we consideredafresh what the law on this subject should be in the circumstances of the 1970s.An analysis of the existing situation and of the evidence shows that there are three broad possibilities. One is to retain a catch-all section. If this were done, a new section could be drafted in much clearer terms, removing someunsatisfactory features of the present section. The second possibility issimply to remove section 2, without replacement. The third is to repealsection 2 and to replace it by new provisions narrower in scope. The firstmajor question facing us, once we had completed our review of the presentsituation and our examination of the evidence, was which of these threepossibilities to recommend.The case for retaining a catch-all91 The main feature of section 2 is its catch-all quality. No GovernmentDepartment claimed in its evidence, however, that all the various kinds of official information with which it was concerned required the protection of
criminal sanctions. Indeed, it is not in dispute that a great deal of official information does not require such protection. This fact alone might bethought sufficient to undermine the case for a catch-all. The criminal lawon this subject ought, if at all possible, to be confined to those kinds of official information for which the protection of criminal sanctions is really required.Sir Peter Rawlinson, the Attorney General, told us that his personal reaction to section 2, as a lawyer, was one of gross distaste, because it involved the criminal law in matters which the criminal law should not be involved in.This is a widely held viewpoint. Sir Peter went on to say that nevertheless,because of the great difficulties in the way of identifying and defining with certainty those kinds of official information which should be covered, and because the control over prosecutions under section 2 exercised by AttorneysGeneral ensured that in practice the section operated in a reasonable way,he thought it preferable on balance to retain a catch-all section, together withthe Attorney&apos;s control over prosecutions, as the lesser of two evils.92 Two main points were put to us by those who wished to rebut theprima facie case for narrowing down section 2. The first argument is that theexistence on the statute book of a provision of the criminal law which admittedlygoes much wider than is strictly required should not be considered a seriousevil in itself, without any regard to how this provision operates in practice.The second argument is that the case for reform depends upon the questionableassumption that it is possible to devise a satisfactory alternative, which wouldidentify and define in a workable manner the kinds of official informationrequiring protection and would be free of fresh drawbacks. Those who take this view then point out, in positive support of the case for a catch-all, that section 2 has the merit of covering all the official information requiring theprotection of the criminal law. This ensures that the section achieves itsprotective purpose. Some of the criticisms of the section, it is suggested, are based upon misunderstandings and others are exaggerated. The control exercised by the Attorney General means that the section operates quitesatisfactorily in practice. It does not bear with undue harshness either uponCrown servants or upon others. Putting these negative and positive factorstogether, it is then argued that the balance of advantage may lie with theretention of a catch-all.93 Arguments of this kind were put forward by several eminent witnessesas well as by a number of Government Departments. Mr James Callaghansummarised his viewpoint as &quot;different does not necessarily mean better&quot;,though he thought it worth consideration whether, while retaining section 2 inits present form, there should be a new defence that publication was in thepublic interest. Lord Brooke of Cumnor stressed the difficulties of devisinga satisfactory alternative. He recalled that the Homicide Act 1957, which sought to find a half-way house between the retention and the abolition ofcapital punishment, had proved unsatisfactory and anomalous in practice.He thought it likely that similar problems would arise in any attempt to finda half-way house in the law on official secrecy. Lord Parker thought thedifficulties surrounding any satisfactory revision of the law so great that hepreferred the status quo, with the possibility of some reinforcement of thearrangements for controlling prosecutions.
94 We gave all these arguments careful attention. We came to the con-clusion, however, that the unsatisfactory features of the present situation,which we have set out in Part I of this Report, presented an overwhelming case for change. We did not find the formulation of alternative provisionsimpracticable.The case for and against the removal of criminal sanctions95 Those who advocate the removal of criminal sanctions agree that thereis some official information which the Government should protect, and that theexistence of criminal sanctions adds to the effectiveness of the protection.They put forward two main arguments for holding that section 2 should never-theless be repealed without replacement. First, they point to a variety ofdefects in section 2, which we have described in Part I of this Report. We agreewith the view that the only satisfactory treatment for a law suffering from so many defects is to sweep it away entirely. This still leaves open the questionwhether or not section 2 should be replaced by new, narrower provisions free of such defects.96 The second argument for removing criminal sanctions is of a more fundamental nature. It is that the use of the criminal law to restrict thepublication of matters of public interest is undesirable in principle, smackingof censorship, and something to be kept to an absolute minimum. Accordingto this viewpoint, the use of criminal law to deal with spies and traitors, as insection 1, is legitimate. The use of a voluntary system of guidance to editorson matters affecting the defence of the nation, as in the &apos;D&apos; Notice system, islegitimate. But these measures are thought to cover all that is of real importance to the nation. Over the rest of the field, it is suggested, theGovernment may properly protect by other means what it wishes to protect,but should not use the criminal law to deal with failures in its protectivemeasures. Those expressing such views do not generally believe that the repeal of section 2 would in practice result in any significantly increased riskof disclosures seriously damaging to the nation as a whole. The news media,they say, have a public function as well as the Government and would actresponsibly by refraining from any seriously damaging disclosures of official information.97 It seemed to us that this second argument rested upon a number of premises of doubtful validity and we discussed it closely with the representativesof organisations holding such views who came to see us. Reliance on voluntaryrestraint would be unsatisfactory for several reasons. There is a danger ofconfusing two different meanings of the word &quot;responsibility&quot; the duty to perform a particular function, and acting with common sense and restraint.The Government and the news media should both act responsibly, in this secondsense, but their duties are distinct. The constitutional responsibilities of theGovernment and Parliament for protecting the nation cannot be abdicatedon the basis that a failure to exercise them will be made good by the responsiblebehaviour of others. The same degree of responsible behaviour is not, in any event, shown by all those who may publish or communicate official information.Restraint in publication varies from one kind of publication to another.  Any
system which covered only one class of recipients of unauthorised disclosures-the news media would be seriously incomplete. An effective system ofprotection must cover damaging disclosures to whomever they are made.98 Most advocates of the removal of criminal sanctions, however, placetheir main reliance on the proposition that section 1 adequately covers all matters of importance to national security. We have described in Chapter 2 theeffect of section 1 and its limitations. A conviction under section 1 requiresproof that the defendant acted with a particular kind of bad intention, i.e., thathe had a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State. Damage tothe nation, however, is not caused by bad intentions alone. It is caused whencertain kinds of official information get into the wrong hands. It makes no difference whether the information reached those hands as a result of espionageor of leakage. The damage to the nation is the same in either case. Theintention of the person communicating the information is irrelevant, and inany case may be difficult to prove. It follows that, whether one takes a broador a narrow view of the kinds of official information requiring the protectionof the criminal law, section 1 does not provide full protection. effective protection requires that the law should cover leakage of information, as well asespionage.99 Some of those with whom we raised this point in discussion accepted that they might not have fully appreciated the limitations of section 1. they agreed that it would be consistent with the grounds on which they advocatedthe removal of criminal sanctions if section 2 were replaced by limited new provisions covering leakage of information important to national security. Afew witnesses maintained their view that section 1 was sufficient by itself.They argued that an intention to harm the nation was a proper criterion forthe use of criminal sanctions to protect official information. If damage was caused by a person who did not intend it, then they thought it better thatthe country should suffer the consequences, however serious, rather thanthat those responsible for such leaks should be liable to punishment under the criminal law.Replacement as the answer100 Many witnesses advocated the replacement of section 2 by narrowerprovisions. The weight of the evidence points strongly in that direction.Our review of the present situation, the outcome of which is described inPart I of this Report, points with equal strength in that direction. Most ofthose who advocate the retention of a catch-all provision do so only becausethey see great difficulty in the way of formulating satisfactory narrowerprovisions. A number of those advocating the removal of section 2 withoutreplacement accept that important matters of national security should be effectively protected by the criminal law. No convincing argument was put to us for the proposition that section 1 alone provides such protection. Wehave discussed in Chapter 1 the tension between openness and secrecy. Acatch-all provision goes too far towards the protection of secrecy. Repeal ofsection 2 without replacement would go too far in reducing the protection of necessary secrecy. A proper balance between openness and secrecy requires a reformed law, in place of the present section. Our first major proposal is that section 2 should be repealed, and replaced by narrower and more specificprovisions.
CHAPTER 8THE LEMES OF REFORMAn Official Information Act101 We have mentioned in paragraphs 41, 54 and 89 the taint of espionagewhich surrounds section 2, and the widespread feeling that the Official secrets acts should be confined to provisions dealing with spies, traitors and others who intend harm to the nation. A number of witnesses suggested to us thatany provisions to replace section 2 should go into a separate Act with a differenttitle. The new provisions which we propose all relate to official information,that is, information in the possession of the Government. Some of this information is secret as well as official, in the ordinary and proper sense ofthose words. Our proposed new provisions will on occasion be used, assection 2 has been used in the past, in cases which might be regarded as close to espionage but in which the defendant did not have, or could not be shown to have, a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State. &quot;Officialsecret&quot; is not, however, so apt as a description of some other official information which requires the protection of the criminal law because of its confidential orpersonal nature.102 But the more important consideration, in our view, is that the official secrets Acts are associated in the public mind with spying, and with the punishment of those who deliberately harm the security of the nation. Indeed,following the repeal of section 2, the remaining provisions of the official secrets Acts could appropriately be renamed the Espionage Act. The distinc-tion between espionage and leakage that is, between those who intend tohelp an enemy and those who disclose information with no such intention isimportant. This distinction should be reflected in the structure of the law.It has been obscured by the inclusion of section 2 in the Official Secrets Acts.This is one reason for the dislike of the section which emerges in much of theevidence.103 A new statute separate from the Official Secrets Acts, with a new titlefree of the emotive overtones of the existing title, is therefore necessary if thenew provisions which we propose are to command public confidence. these provisions will fit together naturally in a separate statute. There is no technicalreason why they should form part of the Official Secrets Acts; they can stillbe used in cases where the evidence does not justify a charge under section 1although the circumstances are close to espionage. Our second major proposals is that the new provisions which we recommend, in replacement of section 2,should form a separate statute, to be known as the Official Information Act.
Problems of definition and presentation104 Under the existing section 2, the absence of authorisation for a dis-closure of official information may be enough to make that disclosure criminal.The essence of our proposals is that the criminal law should not be invokedexcept where there is a specific reason for giving this special protection to theinformation in question. We were warned by a number of witnesses that itwould not be easy to reach clear and acceptable conclusions about whichmatters required the protection of the criminal law on this basis and which did not. We were told that it would be hard to produce a practicable schemewhich would enable people to identify without too much uncertainty on whichside of the line a particular matter fell. It was put to us that we were legislatingfor the future as well as the present, and must not produce a scheme whichwould fail to cater for the unforeseen threats and contingencies of tomorrow.These points are all cogent, but they are inherent in any attempt to replacesection 2 by narrower provisions. We do not regard them as a decisive objectionto a policy of change.105 It is not enough, however, to roll back the frontiers of the criminal law to the place where we believe they belong. The new law, operating within these revised frontiers, should also be clear and comprehensible, and shouldcommand public confidence. Section 2, though short, is too compressed to be clear, too obscure, and too wide to be certain in operation. Our aim is toreplace this short but unsatisfactory section by a body of law which, thoughlonger, is narrower in scope and more certain in operation. The objectsserved by the new provisions should be easier to discern from the text itself.These provisions should define in a comprehensible way both those kinds of official information covered by the law, and the particular circumstances inwhich Crown servants, private citizens and others may become liable tocriminal penalties. A section which has been described as an ancient blunder-buss, scattering shot in all directions, needs replacement by a modern weapon.The need for secrecy and the need for criminal sanctions106 In considering what specific reasons may justify the use of criminal sanctions, the first step is to identify that official information which warrantsprotection. When issuing our invitations to submit written evidence in June1971 we asked all Government Departments to tell us what official information in their various fields was thought to require the protection of section 2, and why. We found that they did not, in general, distinguish between the needfor secrecy and the need for criminal sanctions to protect that secrecy. Aftersixty years of section 2 it was perhaps natural to take for granted that, havingidentified that official information which needs to be protected againstunauthorised disclosure, one had at the same time identified the information which requires the protection of the criminal law. These two questions are,however, distinct.107 We have summarised in Chapter 5 the various ways in which official information is protected from disclosure. There is very considerable pro-tection, for all official information which the Government wishes to protect,
quite apart from the criminal law. A choice has to be made between con-concentrating the additional protection of criminal sanctions where it is most needed, and giving this protection to all official information which the Govern-ment may reasonably wish to withhold. It might be argued that any breach isclearly undesirable, and that it would be perverse to surrender without good cause any available means of preventing it. This argument was not, however,pressed by all those Government witnesses with whom we discussed this point.The description of section 2 as a long-stop or safety net, used by some of them,implies an expectation that other measures of protection should normally sufficeand that the section need seldom be brought into play. This expectation isborne out by experience. There are some kinds of unauthorised disclosureswhich never lead to a prosecution. In relation to such disclosures, the present law is effectively inoperative. We see no justification for drafting the new lawin such a way that criminal sanctions continue theoretically to apply insituations where there is no practical prospect of a prosecution.108 It was, however, put to us by some Departmental witnesses that theremoval of the catch-all section 2 might have an appreciable effect in under-mining the discipline and discretion of the Civil Service. They pointed outthat the modern Civil Service has operated under a catch-all provision for over eighty years, and suggested that this underpins discipline in a way notobvious to the observer. They feared that the removal of the safety net nowcould have an effect which the Committee neither expect nor desire, lesseningdiscipline to an unacceptable degree. The Director General of the security service went further, and stressed to us the important role which section in his view played as part of the foundations of the country&apos;s securityprotection.109 Most of the Government witnesses with whom we discussed this pointagreed on further questioning that the proportion of civil servants whosebehaviour might be affected in this way would be very small. Section 2 can have no significant deterrent effect in relation to disclosures of official information of a kind which have never formed the subject of a prosecution,and are never likely to. The risk of undermining Civil Service discipline isinherent in any proposal to replace section 2 by provisions narrower in scope.It has to be weighed against the disadvantages of the status quo. We believethat, provided the nature of the reform and the reasons for it are properlyexplained, this risk will be small. More reliance might well be placed infuture on giving civil servants clear guidance and proper training on therequirements of secrecy, in place of the present tendency, in those areas wherenot much information is genuinely secret, to rely upon a doctrine of blanketsecrecy supported by a catch-all criminal law. We do not expect our proposals to have any adverse effect on the basic reliability of the Civil Service.110 We therefore reject the notion that criminal sanctions should beretained for all official information which a Government may reasonably wishto withhold, whatever the reasons for withholding it and irrespective of its importance.  The additional protection of the criminal law should be reserved
for that official information which it is most important to protect. It is not enough to distinguish the information which requires protection of some kindfrom disclosure. A second stage is then required, to identify which of this information it is most important to the nation to safeguard.Ill Our analysis of the evidence which we received shows four distinctreasons which were put to us for the use of criminal sanctions to protect somekinds of official information: a. The most important and most widely accepted reason put to us for theuse of the criminal law is to protect the security of the nation and the safety of the people. This expression can be given a wide interpretation,including police and prison information, or a narrow one.b. A second reason, advanced to us by some witnesses but rejected by others, is to preserve the ordinary confidentiality of the internalprocesses of government.c. Most witnesses agreed that the Government should protect the large amount of information in its possession relating to the private affairs of firms and individuals. Some thought that the criminal law shouldbe used for this purpose and others did not.d. Some witnesses pointed out that improper or premature access tocertain kinds of official information may be a means of making privategains, and thought that the criminal law should be used to protect such information.112 We accept that these are all valid reasons for taking measures to preventthe unauthorised disclosure of some kinds of official information. We have explained in the preceding paragraphs why, in our view, it does not necessarily follow that they are also valid reasons for the use of the criminal law as partof that protection. The next step, therefore, is to take these reasons in turnand to consider how far, if at all, they provide grounds for the use of criminal sanctions.  This is the subject of Part III of the Report.113 Part III is confined to the consideration of these four reasons. we see no other reasons which could validly be advanced for the use of the criminal law to protect official information. A number of witnesses pointed out that section 2 could be used to serve the political interests of a Government, or to save Ministers or officials from embarrassment. No witness suggested thatthis was a proper use of the criminal law. We reject entirely the use of criminal sanctions for such purposes.The content of the rest of the Report114 In Chapter 9 we consider the need to protect official information on grounds of national security, in the widest sense of that expression. Thisis the prime justification for the use of criminal sanctions, and the main question is how to define and identify the particular kinds of informationrequiring this additional protection. We regard the maintenance of law andorder as part of the security of the nation, but we deal with this separately in Chapter 10 because the method of identifying information requiringprotection in this field is different.  In Chapter 11 we consider the arguments
for giving special protection to the internal processes of government; we donot see justification for protecting all these processes by criminal sanctions,but special considerations attach to Cabinet documents. Chapter 12 thendiscusses the case for criminal sanctions to protect confidential information about private citizens and concerns, and to deal with the use of official information for private gain.115 Having identified in Part III the official information requiring theprotection of the criminal law, the next stage is to consider what classes of people should be liable to prosecution for the unauthorised disclosure of such information, and in what circumstances. This is the subject of Part IV.Part V covers the control of prosecutions, and other aspects of the enforcementand operation of the law, such as its territorial extent and penalties. Part VIcontains a complete statement of all our proposals.
Part HIOFFICIAL INFORMATION REQUIRING THEPROTECTION OF CRIMINAL SANCTIONSCHAPTER 9THE SECURITY OF THE NATION AND THE safety of THE people the touchstone for the use of criminal sanctions116 National security is widely accepted as the prime justification foremploying criminal sanctions to protect official information. But this is toovague a concept by itself to be of much help in identifying the major categories of official information requiring special protection for this reason. Closeranalysis indicates that the kinds of information coming within these categorieshave several characteristics in common. They all go to the fundamentals ofgovernment. They are all matters of major importance. They are all matters which affect the nation as a whole. A safe and independent life for a nation and its people requires effective defence against the threat of attack from outside. It requires the maintenance of the nation&apos;s relations with the restof the world, and of its essential economic base. It requires the preservation of law and order, and the ability to cope with emergencies threatening the essentials of life. The country&apos;s constitutional arrangements should be capableof fulfilling these requirements. It is information relating to these basicfunctions of a central Government which most requires protection. It ishere that a threat to the nation can have the most serious consequences. Themost appropriate general description for all these matters is that they concern the security of the nation and the safety of the people.117 It is in this context that strong measures are clearly justified in preventing serious injury to the nation. It is less clear that the criminal lawmust be brought in to reinforce other means of protection where the possibleinjury is of a less serious nature. The most obvious example is defence.Some defence information is highly secret: its unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the nation, and it requires full protection. Somedefence information is public knowledge. In between these two extremes,there is a continuous gradation. There is some defence information whichcould be published without harm, or with little harm, to the nation. Andthere is a considerable range of information the unauthorised disclosure ofwhich would be prejudicial to the interests of the nation, but would not cause serious injury. We gave in Chapter 8 our reasons for proposing a strict testfor the use of the criminal law, reserving it for those kinds of information which it is most important to protect. In our view, the appropriate test onthis basis, in relation to national security, is that unauthorised disclosurewould cause serious injury to the nation.118 This means that the criminal law would not apply to information the unauthorised disclosure of which would cause some injury to the interestsof the nation, but short of serious injury.  We realise that it may appear
anomalous to some that in the area of national defence, where the security ofthe nation and the safety of the people are most closely affected, there shouldbe any relaxation in our measures to protect any information which could beof value to a potential enemy. We do not, however, believe that the restriction of the criminal law to disclosures causing serious injury to the nation wouldinvolve significant risks. Restricting the scope of criminal sanctions in thisway seems to us preferable to their retention for a wide range of less importantinformation, which can be protected by other measures.119 We believe that most of those who have given evidence to us, andmost reasonable people, would accept as a proper basis for the employment of criminal sanctions the unauthorised disclosure of official information whichwould be likely to cause serious injury to the security of the nation or the safety of the people. If criminal sanctions are justified at all, they are justifiedfor this purpose. If they are to be reserved for what is most important, theyshould not go any wider.   We have therefore adopted this as our touchstone.The need for a two-part definition120 The identification by the law of official information which warrantsthe protection of criminal sanctions in accordance with this touchstone mustserve two purposes. The first is to describe in general terms those categories of official information the unauthorised disclosure of which may injure thesecurity of the nation or the safety of the people. The object of this partof the definition is simply to exclude all other kinds of official information,and a definition in broad terms is called for. It is immaterial that such a definition will cover a great deal of information which does not need theprotection of criminal sanctions. For it is the function of the second partof the definition to identify, with as much certainty as possible, those particular items qf information, within these broad descriptive categories, the unauthorised disclosure of which might cause serious injury. The objects of the second part of the definition are to exclude less important matters, and to enablethose handling such information to know where they stand in relation tothe law.121 The rest of this Chapter accordingly falls into two sections. Insection A we discuss the general categories of official information affectingthe security of the nation or the safety of the people. This is done underthe headings of defence and internal security, foreign relations, the currency and the reserves, and information falling outside these categories. In section Bwe then discuss the means of identifying those particular disclosures capableof causing serious injury.Section A.  General categories of official information affectingthe security of the nation and the safety of the peopleDefence and internal security122 It is generally accepted that secrecy is an important element in the effectiveness of defence measures and equipment, and that a breach of secrecycould seriously damage the nation. On the other hand Parliament and thepeople have a close and proper interest in questions of defence.  An appreciable
proportion of the country&apos;s resources is spent on defence equipment of allkinds. Thus the requirements of secrecy on the one hand, and of political control over defence policy and defence expenditure on the other, may conflict.This consideration does not affect the general part of our definition. It isthe second part of the definition which, by restricting the criminal law todisclosures likely to cause serious injury, is intended to ensure that the lawdoes not cover information which could and should be disclosed.123 Defence is traditionally thought of in terms of troops, weapons andequipment, and plans. Intelligence is also an important aspect of defence,and comprises both our own intelligence operations and measures taken against the intelligence operations of others. All defence matters must betreated in terms not just of this country, but of the United Kingdom and her allies taken together. The Government are under an obligation to protect the defence information of our allies in the same way as our own. For thepurposes of our broad categories, we regard defence as including home defence and internal security.124 We propose that the Official Information Act should apply to official information relating to matters which concern or affect the defence or securityof the realm, including in particular those matters set out in the sub-paragraphsbelow. Information relating to the defence or security of allied Powers, coveringmatters of the kind mentioned in sub-paragraphs a to f (but not sub-paragraph g),should be included in this category. It must be remembered, in reading thesesub-paragraphs, that criminal sanctions will only cover such informationwithin this category as also comes within the second part of the definition,on the ground that its disclosure could cause serious injury: a. the Armed Forces of the Crown and matters relating thereto;b. military weapons, stores and equipment of all kinds, including nuclear weapons, ships, aircraft, vehicles, communications systems and all means of warfare;c. the research, development and production of all items covered by sub--paragraph b;d. defence policy and strategy and other military planning, includingplans and measures for the maintenance of essential supplies and services in the event of war;e. intelligence and security services, and information obtained by them;f. military treaties and arrangements with other Powers, and negotiationsof such treaties and arrangements;g. internal defence and security, and plans and measures relating thereto,including plans and measures for the maintenance and restoration ofpublic order or of essential supplies and services in contingenciesshort of war. &apos;125 The &apos;D&apos; Notices (described in paragraph 65) contain a fuller description of defence matters. These Notices are issued to editors on a private and confidential basis. To a considerable extent, the &apos;D&apos; Notices cover the sameground as paragraph 124.
Foreign relations126 The field of foreign affairs is more controversial. A number of witnesses who agree to the use of the criminal law to prevent leakages ofdefence information wish to go no further. They do not regard questions offoreign affairs as requiring comparable secrecy. These are questions of greatpublic interest. A great deal of what is going on between governments andin international organisations is public knowledge, contemporaneously or nearly so. Such knowledge serves the public interest, and is essential to anadequate measure of democratic control over the conduct of the country&apos;s foreign policy.127 It is nevertheless the fact that much official information concerningforeign relations is kept secret. This practice is internationally accepted.It is significant that in the other countries which we visited, defence and foreign relations are seen as going together, and as jointly comprising the essentialnucleus of government affairs requiring secrecy. A similar view emerged from much of the evidence we received. Moreover secrecy in foreign relationsis mutual. One country cannot breach secrecy unilaterally, without damagingits relations with others. The field of international relations is full of difficult,sensitive and contentious issues, some of them long-enduring. It is a fact of international life that the resolution of such issues without resort to force,and the maintenance of our national position and interests, often depend upon a measure of secrecy. In effect there is a tacit international agreement for a degree of secrecy in international affairs, and there are strong reasons why all nations should honour it. At the same time, as we emphasised in chapter 1, a democratic government should not use the plea of secrecy tohide from the people its basic aims and policies, in foreign any more than in domestic matters.128 There are thus compelling grounds of a general nature for regardingforeign relations as one area of government where some secrecy is essential for the security of the nation and the safety of the people. It is, however,equally clear that some foreign affairs, as distinct from foreign relations between governments, are not secret at any stage. The work of a commercial sectionof a British Embassy in helping British firms with their overseas business,for instance, or the work of a British consul in helping British citizens, orarrangements for a trade fair in another country, do not warrant the protectionof criminal sanctions. A criterion is required for distinguishing those aspectsof foreign affairs in which unauthorised disclosures may seriously damage thesecurity of the nation or the safety of the people. The nature of the appropriatecriterion can be elucidated by an examination of the main kinds of information which may need to be kept secret.129 Information in the field of foreign affairs can be divided into twobroad classes. First there is information shared between the United KingdomGovernment and one or more other governments. Examples are exchangeswith other governments, including negotiations of all kinds, and informationcirculated by or within international organisations. Some international legislation succeed in being conducted in secrecy. The frank and honestexposure of differing points of view, the exploration of possible concessions,
the striking of bargains, is handicapped if conducted in the open. This isparticularly so where sensitive issues of national prestige and pride are involved,and the glare of publicity would convert a negotiation into a propaganda war.130 Exchanges between governments not amounting to negotiations are often on a confidential basis. One nation may entrust to a second nation orto its friends or allies information which it is on no account prepared to allowto go further. A breach of this trust could have a seriously adverse effecton relations between the countries concerned, which might extend well beyondthe particular matter which leaked.131 The second area of secrecy in the field of foreign affairs covers informa-tion within the United Kingdom Government which relates to our relationswith other governments. Much of this information consists of or is basedupon reports from our representatives overseas. The value of reports of thiskind is limited if they cannot be completely frank, and in this context secrecyis an essential condition of frankness. They include information and assess-ments of all kinds on the situation in other countries, including, for instance,comment on leading political and other personalities. Unlike Crown servantsat home, those serving overseas cannot normally ensure the secrecy ofparticularly sensitive information of this kind by making direct oral reports totheir superiors. The information in reports from posts abroad is then a major ingredient in the assessments which form the basis of policy decisions by Ministers in London on the conduct of our relations with other countries.The conduct of these relations could be severely prejudiced by leakage.132 The distinguishing feature of the information mentioned in para-graphs 129-131 is that it all relates to matters which concern or affect therelations of the United Kingdom Government with another government or aninternational body. The reasons for secrecy which we have discussed above all attach to matters dealt with between governments, and not to the wider field of trade and consular affairs when these are not being handled between governments. Once a matter reaches the inter-governmental level, it attractsa political element, and secrecy may be required for one of the reasons wehave mentioned. Many matters dealt with among governments are not of sufficient importance to warrant the protection of criminal sanctions, but these cannot be distinguished on the basis of subject matter. We discuss insection B of this Chapter the method of excluding disclosures not causingserious injury. In terms of subject matter, the single characteristic whichshould attract the possibility of criminal sanctions is that relations between governments are involved.  Other aspects of foreign affairs should be excluded.133 One other point about foreign relations deserves mention. Somefour-fifths of the Diplomatic Service are stationed overseas and are, therefore,liable to be in a more isolated position than Crown servants in this country.Yet they may be subjected, more continuously and with greater intensity, to pressure to make unauthorised disclosures, or even to threats or blackmail.134 We propose that the Official Information Act should apply to official information relating to any matters which concern or affect foreign relations
or the conduct of foreign relations. By &quot;foreign relations&quot; we mean relationsbetween the United Kingdom Government and any other Power or any international body the members of which are governments.The currency and the reserves135 There are some economic and financial matters of major importance which many, though not all, witnesses accept as secret. There are othereconomic and financial matters the unauthorised disclosure of which clearlywould not cause serious damage to the security of the nation or the safety ofthe people. There is, at first sight, no clear means whereby one can identify the point at which the first kind of information ends and the second kind begins.Once one accepts the possibility of damage to the economy as a criterion forthe use of the criminal law, an enormously wide range of official informationbecomes a candidate for protection information about economic manage-ment, fiscal measures, the currency, industry, trade and commerce, public investment, industrial relations, and so on. Should all official information relating to any of these matters be covered by the criminal law?136 We came to the conclusion that the possibility of some harm to the economy is not a sound criterion for our purposes. The responsibility ofthe Government for economic management is important, but it is not exclusive.In this respect, therefore, it is different from the Governmenfs sole respon-sibility for defence, foreign relations and law and order. There are aspectsof economic management which the Government properly keeps secret, though in many instances the information in question is eventually made public.But the fact that an unauthorised disclosure would damage the economy,rather than some other aspect of the national life, does not distinguish economicmanagement from the rest of the Governmenfs ordinary domestic functions.Here, as with these other domestic functions, reliance can properly be placedon all the other means of protection available, without involving the ultimatesanctions of the criminal law.137 It nevertheless seems clear to us that exceptionally grave injury to the economy qualifies for the protection of criminal sanctions, on the basis ofour touchstone. It is not simply a question of a drop in the standard of living;such injury could have wider repercussions on the life of the nation. Thereis only one instance, it seems to us, where an unauthorised disclosure couldcause economic injury of this degree of seriousness, and that is the currency.Ever since the war the maintenance of the reserves, and the exchange rate,have been central preoccupations of our economic policy. Weakness herecan seriously undermine our freedom of action, both domestically and inter-nationally. Mr Roy Jenkins expressed to us the view, as a former Chancellorof the Exchequer, that there had been occasions when these matters had been more sensitive, and more important for the country, than anything in the fields of defence or foreign affairs. Changes in the exchange rate, or arrange-ments to support the reserves, involve international negotiation or consultation,and to that extent would come within the foreign relations category. Pro-tection here would have to embrace discussions and decisions within theUnited Kingdom Government if it was to be effective.
138 Crises involving the exchange rate or the reserves are invariablyaccompanied by much public discussion and speculation, and the information on which the Government must base its decisions is, to a greater or lesser extent, public knowledge. But in this field there is all the difference in theworld between knowing the whole truth and knowing part of the truth; thereis a crucial difference between speculation, however well based, and certainty.Some but not all information about the state of the reserves is publishedregularly. Certain knowledge of a Government decision to alter the exchange rate would enable speculators to raid the reserves with far greater confidence and on a far greater scale than they could do on the basis of speculation.The far greater degree of injury to the nation that would thereby ensue justifiesthe use of criminal sanctions to protect such information. A change in thevalue of sterling may be accompanied by other measures, e.g. the raising ofinternational loans. Where there is a &quot;package&quot; of this kind, all the elements of the package should be covered.139 We propose that the Official Information Act should apply to official information relating to any proposals, negotiations or decisions connected withalterations in the value of sterling, or relating to the reserves, including theirextent or any movement in or threat to them.Information falling outside our categories140 The three categories which we have defined in this section of this chapter cover only the basic functions of government (except for law andorder, which is discussed in Chapter 10). The effect of our proposals, there-fore, is to exclude information about most of the domestic functions of a modern government. Such information will no longer receive the additionalprotection of the criminal law (unless it is covered by our proposals aboutCabinet documents, the confidences of the citizen and private gain, in chapters 11 and 12). Any inhibiting effect which section 2 now has ondesirable openness about these functions will be removed. The additionalprotection of criminal sanctions will be concentrated where it is most needed.This will mean a radical reduction in the scope of the criminal law comparedwith the catch-all section 2. It is worth mentioning some of the main kinds of official information that will no longer be caught by the criminal law, to illustrate the effect of our proposals.141 Governments take particular precautions to maintain the secrecy ofthe Budget, of other fiscal changes, and of changes in the Bank Rate. Theseprecautions include the rigid restriction of who may have access to such information, which is usually the most effective form of protection. Thesematters are traditionally included in any catalogue of secret official information,and a number of witnesses regard them as warranting the protection of the criminal law. By the touchstone of serious injury to the nation as a whole,however, they do not qualify. Any injury resulting from premature revelationwould not in our view be such as to warrant criminal sanctions in additionto the other protections available. One of the main effects of a fiscal leak is often political embarrassment, rather than injury to the economy, and this does not justify the use of the criminal law.  Governments will still take
appropriate measures to protect such information, without the use of criminal sanctions. There will remain the sanction of loss of career facing any crown servant found to have leaked. But one mischief which may be caused by theleakage of impending fiscal changes is that those thereby put in the know canuse their knowledge to make money. Leakages of this kind are covered by our proposal in Chapter 12 that the use or disclosure of official information for purposes of private gain should be made an offence.142 Another kind of economic information not covered by our proposalscomprises forecasts and assumptions, for instance about wage and pricemovements and levels of unemployment, made as part of the process of formu-lating economic policy. These are ordinarily never published. Such forecasts are also made by non-official bodies, but the fact that a forecast is a Governmentforecast gives it an altogether different significance. The Treasury say, intheir written memorandum, that if a leak gives people cause to fear a certainturn of events, they may take action in their own interests which will producethat very turn of events; the Governments ability to meet this situation is then prejudiced, and the country suffers. Premature knowledge of impendingpolicy changes, it is said, including tax changes, can have a similar effect.On the other hand the Treasury stated that changes do occur in the viewstaken by Governments about the extent to which their planning and decision-making processes in this field should be revealed. Our proposal is not that governments should no longer protect economic and financial informationof this kind. It is that those leaking such information should no longer be liable to prosecution and imprisonment, unless it is done for private gain.143 There are other issues of domestic policy, outside our categories,which may also be important or sensitive. There may be good reasons whyGovernments should wish to avoid unauthorised disclosures concerning their internal discussions of such matters, or concerning negotiations or consultationsabout such issues with those outside the Government. But what we have toconsider is the different question whether those responsible for such disclosuresshould be liable to the pains and penalties of the criminal law. We proposethat these pains and penalties should be retained for disclosures of informationwithin our categories, if sufficiently serious. These categories cover the basicfunctions of government, which have remained largely unchanged in essencefor hundreds of years. We believe that they embrace all those disclosurescapable of causing serious damage to the nation as a whole, and will prove toleave sufficient room to cater for unforeseen future developments.Section B.  The identification within the categories of disclosuresserious enough to warrant criminal sanctionsThe case for a system of marking documents144 In section A of this Chapter we have identified three broad categories of official information which affect the security of the nation or the safety of the people. We explained in paragraph 120 why the generalised descriptions of these categories which we propose should be combined with a more precisemethod of identifying that particular information within them the unauthorised
disclosure of which is likely to cause serious injury to the nation. There isonly one method which in our view is capable of achieving this object satis-factorily. This is for each individual item of information to be identifiedand marked by the Government in a way which enables those who come intopossession of it to recognise that it is covered by the provisions of the new law.We give the reasons for this conclusion in the next paragraph.145 a. We have mentioned in paragraph 104 the warnings we receivedfrom some witnesses about the difficulties of definition and of drawing lines.It is true that there would be problems about the drawing of general lineswithin our three categories between the serious and the not so serious, andthis could not be done with any precision. A system which involves the identification and marking of individual items of information enables a preciseline to be drawn between what is covered by the law and what is not. the acceptability of such a system depends upon the marking being carried outcorrectly and consistently, but this is a separate point, which we discuss later in this Chapter.b. The damage caused by a particular disclosure may depend very much on the surrounding circumstances. On occasion the timing of the disclosuremay be the crucial factor. For instance, the leakage of a report by an ambassador to the Foreign Secretary might cause grave injury on one occasion,yet for fortuitous reasons the damage might be slight on another ostensiblysimilar occasion. Moreover the seriousness with which particular kinds of injury to the nation are viewed by Governments, Parliaments and the peoplechange over time. These considerations underline the advantages of a systemof marking each individual item of information, and reviewing these markingsas circumstances change.c. A correct assessment of the damage which a particular disclosure would cause often depends upon knowledge of a number of other related factors.In many cases these related factors are likely themselves to be secret, and to be known only to the Government. This would be a major drawback to any system which left all those coming into possession of official informationwithin the categories to work out themselves, as best they could, whether ornot that information came within some general criterion. There would bethe risk of seriously damaging disclosures being made inadvertently by people who, through no fault of their own, lacked the information necessary to makea proper assessment.d. In relation to these basic functions of government, the question of injury to the nation is essentially political, in the broadest sense of the term,not judicial. It is essentially a Government responsibility to assess theimportance of information in our three categories. The Government isaccountable to Parliament and the electorate for its discharge of these basicfunctions. Any system which placed this responsibility elsewhere woulddetract from the responsibility of the Government to protect the security ofthe nation and the safety of the people. It would remove the element of constitutional accountability.e. One major defect of section 2 is its uncertainty in operation. any scheme which left individuals to work out whether a disclosure by them of
particular information within the categories would cause serious injury tothe nation would likewise be very uncertain in operation. It would not bepossible to forecast with any confidence what view a court would take in a prosecution. The only effective method of enabling those who handle infor-mation in these categories to know where they stand is to mark the particular items to which the criminal law applies. Only the Government is in a positionto do this.146 The considerations set out in the previous paragraph constitute astrong case for the adoption of a system of identifying and marking information.A number of witnesses put forward proposals for amending the law whichwould involve the courts in deciding whether a disclosure had caused injury to the nation. In several cases the proposal was on the lines that it should bea defence to a charge under section 2 that the disclosure in question was not likely to harm the national interest and was made in good faith and in thepublic interest. We considered whether such a responsibility could appro-appropriately be placed upon the courts, but decided that it could not, for two main reasons: a. Contentious political issues, of the kind likely to arise in these cases,would be very different from those issues which a jury is normallyexpected to decide and is regarded as best fitted to decide. Juriescould find these issues difficult to handle. There are some relativelyrecent decisions of the House of Lords which indicate that in any event, as respects defence and foreign relations, the courts would be slow to allow arguments before them on what constitutes the national interest, which they regard as a matter for the Government of the day.b. The questions arising in these cases would, by definition, concernmatters which the Government wished to keep secret. It might beimpossible to show why the information disclosed by the defendantwas secret, except by revealing other secret matters in the evidence.Cases of this kind have arisen in the past and will arise in the future.It might not be sufficient for the court to sit in camera, since the accused himself, his legal advisers and the jury would all remainpresent. The Government might not be prepared to take the risk ofletting them hear the secret evidence. Yet it is basic to natural justicethat an accused person should know the evidence against him. Casesof espionage under section 1 are not directly comparable. The issues arising under section 1 are whether the information disclosed mightbe useful to an enemy, and the intention of the defendant. In mostsection 1 cases both these issues are settled by evidence that the infor-mation was communicated to an agent of a foreign Power.Classification and the law147 The Government already operates a system for identifying official information which needs special protection. This is the classification system,which we described briefly in paragraphs 61-2. Information within our three categories requiring special protection is already identified, and documentsare already marked, by the Government.  The classification system goes a
good deal wider than our proposals, and covers information the disclosure ofwhich would injure the nation but not seriously. Nevertheless, there is no need to set up a wholly new system of markings for the purposes of our proposals.The need is to adapt part of the existing system for these purposes. Severalbodies suggested in their evidence that a new, narrower law on the protection of official information should make use of the classification system as one means(not necessarily the sole means) of identifying the information requiring theprotection of criminal sanctions. In the light of discussions which we had with sir William Armstrong, Sir Philip Allen, Sir James Dunnett, the representativesof the Association of First Division Civil Servants and others, we are satisfiedthat this is practicable. The advantages which we set out in paragraph 145 canaccordingly be obtained without the expense and inconvenience of establishingcompletely new arrangements within the Civil Service for identifying individualitems warranting the protection of the Official Information Act.148 A satisfactory scheme for linking the classification system to the criminal law in this way, and thus making liability to criminal penalties depend, in part,on classification, must meet two requirements: a. The classification system is a purely administrative system. At present it has no connection with the criminal law; the way in which it operatesis governed by internal Civil Service instructions. As a consequenceof linking part of the system with the criminal law, the main features of the operation of that part of the system should be set out in the law.In particular, the criterion for attaching a classification at the level which attracts the criminal law should be made statutory, and the law should specify the way in which documents fulfilling this criterionare marked.b. The criterion for classification at the level attracting criminal sanctionsmust be applied correctly and consistently in accordance with the intentions of Parliament, if the system is to operate fairly and to command public confidence. The law must contain adequate safe-guards for this purpose.Consequential adjustments of the classification system will also be required,since our proposals involve the application of the criminal law only to a propor-tion of the official information which is classified under present arrangements.-149 Subject to the points in paragraph 148 (which we discuss in more detail in the rest of this Chapter) we propose that the Official Information Act should apply to official information within the three categories described in section of this Chapter if it has been classified, in accordance with the provisions proposedin paragraph 157, on the ground that its unauthorised disclosure would cause atleast serious injury to the interests of the nation. The prosecution should have tosatisfy the court that the information fell within a category, and that it was soclassified, but the court should not be concerned with the effect of the disclosureon the interests of the nation.Legal provisions on classification150 The present criterion for classifying official information as SECRET isthat its unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the interests of the
nation. This injury may vary according to the nature of the information andthe circumstances of its disclosure, and may not be felt immediately in practicalterms. For instance, the premature disclosure of a decision to alter the exchange rate of sterling could have an immediate serious effect on the reserves. by contrast, an unauthorised disclosure of defence information might mean thatthe country&apos;s ability to defend itself was seriously impaired; but, provided thatthe country was not engaged in hostilities at the time of the disclosure, there might be no immediate tangible effect comparable with a drain on the reserves.The criterion of serious injury to the interests of the nation must be understood as covering both disclosures which have an immediate serious effect, and thosewhich might have a serious effect in the future, for instance by impairing thecountry&apos;s ability to deal with future contingencies.151 The general effect of the proposal in paragraph 149 is that the official information Act should apply to official information within one of the three categories which is properly classified SECRET or above. The greater includes the less, and we use the words &quot;at least serious damage&quot; to make clear that thisproposal covers cases where unauthorised disclosure would cause exceptionallygrave damage to the nation, which is the criterion for classifying as TOP SECRET.Under existing arrangements documents within the categories classified asSECRET or above may also be marked with other words. As well as TOPSECRET there are various other additional markings used by the Governmenton classified documents, for instance to indicate that a classification is a NATOone, and it will remain necessary to use such other markings. These markingsare well understood by those Crown servants and Government contractors whohandle such information in the course of their work. No confusion need be caused to other people provided that the word &quot;secret&quot; is used as the basicmarking on documents covered by the criminal law, whether or not in con-junction with other words. We are here concerned with the major secrets ofthe State: the information in question is secret in the sense of the word commonlyused by ordinary people. &quot;Secret&quot; is therefore the appropriate word to markofficial documents protected under our proposals by criminal sanctions.152 Classification applies to information, by whatever means it may be recorded or communicated. But non-documentary communications cannotbe marked in the same way as documents. When secret information is com-municated by non-documentary means, the fact that it is classified may or maynot be made explicit. In oral discussions within the public service, for instance,it may be assumed, quite correctly, that all those present are aware of the factthat the information under discussion is classified. When someone outsidethe Government comes into possession of secret information as a result of anon-documentary method of communication, however, he may have no reasonto be aware that the information is classified unless he is expressly told. Never-theless, the effective protection of the secrets of the State requires that anyunauthorised communication of information within the three categories towhich the Official Information Act applies should be caught, by whatever meansit is made, provided that the accused knew, or should have known, that theinformation was of this nature. It might not be so easy to prove such knowledgeto the satisfaction of a court as it would be to prove that a document wasmarked SECRET, but this is not an insuperable difficulty.  Most classified
information is recorded in documentary form, and the reading of documentsis the most common means of obtaining classified information. We discuss inPart IV the questions what the prosecution should prove in court, and whatdefences should be available to the accused. The immediate point is that all means of communication should be covered.153 Internal Civil Service instructions on classification cover not only the criteria for classification at the various levels (set out in paragraph 62) but alsosuch matters as the avoidance of classifying at too high a level (known as&quot;over-classification&quot;); the need to restrict authority to classify, and especially at the levels TOP SECRET and SECRET, to the most senior practicable levelof staff; and the need for systems of checking and reviewing classifications,especially the classifications TOP SECRET and SECRET when applied to information in current use, with a view to removing the classifications or sub-stituting lower ones. Detailed instructions on these matters vary from one department to another, and from one kind of information to another, depending on the particular circumstances, and legal provisions on these matters are appropriate to statutory regulations rather than to the Official InformationAct itself.154 Paragraphs 150-3 have discussed various general aspects of the inter-pretation and operation of the proposal in paragraph 149. There are also some particular considerations relating to defence. The Ministry of defence and their contractors handle a very large amount of information about militaryweapons and equipment classified TOP SECRET, SECRET and confidential -TIAL. The Ministry told us that, largely for this reason, much considerationhas been given over the last few years to the down-grading of security classifica-tions in the defence field. The measures specified for the protection of TOPSECRET and SECRET information are expensive in terms of staff effort. Themore information that is graded as SECRET or above, the less the effort that can be devoted to the close protection of especially sensitive information. TheMinistry also said that, in their view, serious damage could result from the disclosure of information about weapons and equipment which had properlybeen classified as CONFIDENTIAL. For example, many details of the performance of new military equipment are graded CONFIDENTIAL. Inmany cases, however, if a large number of these individual items were assembledtogether, e.g. on a computer tape, and this assembled information was disclosedwithout authority, serious injury would undoubtedly be caused to the national interest.155 A great deal of defence information is exchanged between the UnitedKingdom and our defence partners. The levels of security classification, theway in which they are used, and the nature of the protective measures taken at each level, are internationally agreed with our allies. There are special arrangements, particularly with the United States of America, for the safe-guarding of atomic information. Much of this information, though highlysensitive, bears a security marking of CONFIDENTIAL in agreement with theUnited States authorities. They have been prepared to accept this becausespecial limitations on access to the information have been applied and becausethey knew that those handling such atomic information would be liable tocriminal prosecution if they disclosed it without authority.
156 The situation described in paragraphs 154-5 means that there is informa-tion about military weapons and equipment which should continue to be protected by criminal sanctions, because its unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the interests of the nation, but which is classifiedCONFIDENTIAL under existing arrangements. To re-classify this informa-tion as SECRET would considerably increase costs and reduce efficiency, andwould run counter to arrangements with our allies. This, however, is a field which can be clearly defined, where the need for full protection is widely recognised. Nearly all those who handle this kind of information are crown servants and employees of Government contractors. The situation canaccordingly be met by a special marking to indicate that the information isprotected by the Official Information Act although classified CONFIDENTIAL.157 We have proposed in paragraph 149 that the Official Information Actshould apply to information within the three categories described in section of this Chapter which has been classified on the ground that its unauthorised disclosure would cause at least serious injury to the interests of the nation.In the light of the considerations discussed in paragraphs 150-156, we proposethat the Official Information Act should contain the following further provisions on classification: a. Information should count as &quot;classified&quot; within the meaning of theAct if-i. in the case of a document, it is marked with the word SECRETor with words including the word SECRET, or it relates to militaryweapons or equipment (as defined in paragraph 124 b. and c.) andit is marked DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL an  in either case it has been classified in accordance with the provisions of the Actand of regulations on classification made under it;ii. in the case of a communication by non-documentary means, theinformation relates to the contents of a document which is classifiedin accordance with i., or is information which, if it had been containedin a document, ought to have been so classified.b. The Secretary of State should make regulations about the classificationand declassification of documents, which should include provisions onlevels of authority at which decisions on classification may be taken and on arrangements for review and declassification.c. The unauthorised removal of a classification mark, or the making of acopy of a classified document without the mark, should not affect theclassified status of that document. (This might affect the criminalliability of those handling the document: this point is discussed inPart IV.)Safeguards against over-classification158 We have mentioned in paragraph 154 the consideration given inrecent years to down-grading certain defence information. With specificinformation such as performance or design details of weapons, it is possibleto formulate fairly precise guidance about the level of classification to be
awarded. This is less easy with information of a more general kind, especiallywhere the content is not factual and issues of policy, or assessments or forecasts,are involved. The classification of such information involves a degree of personal judgment, and there is a tendency to &quot;over-classify&quot;-that is, toplay safe by awarding a classification at a higher level than is justified. Over-classification is kept in check partly because documents which are classified,especially at the higher levels, have to be handled with special care: the incon-venience and expense which this causes are unnecessarily increased by over-classification and are kept to a minimum by its avoidance. Nevertheless,constant vigilance against over-classification is required. Under our proposals,documents within the three categories which are classified SECRET or above,or DEFENCE CONFIDENTIAL, would be protected by criminal sanctions,and those marked CONFIDENTIAL would not. This might increase thetendency to over-classify the more important CONFIDENTIAL informationby marking it SECRET.159 A closely related problem is the difficulty of reviewing classifications.A document may have been correctly classified initially, but may subsequentlycease to merit classification, or classification at so high a level. The numbersof classified documents are large, and staff competent to review classificationsare likely to be preoccupied with problems which seem more immediatelypressing. Outside the field of military weapons and equipment, it is not easy to maintain an effective system for reviewing classifications. Some reviewingof classifications is possible while information is still of current interest. when a particular subject is no longer active, and documents relating to it havebeen put away, a fully effective and comprehensive system of declassificationand reclassification would require disproportionate effort and expense.160 It would clearly be unacceptable that people should be prosecutedfor disclosing information which should never have been classified withinthe meaning of the Official Information Act, or which should no longer havebeen classified at that level at the time of its disclosure. Government and non-Government witnesses alike agreed on the need to keep over-classificationin check and to review old classifications. There were various proposals inthe evidence for doing this, for instance by restricting authority to classify to asmall number of very senior officers. We are satisfied that such methodswould not be practicable, or necessarily effective. This is not to suggest thatlevels of authority to classify should not be as high as possible, or that rigoroussteps should not be taken to check and to review original classifications. Itis not, however, feasible to ensure that a situation never arises in which some-one outside the Government service comes into possession of information which is covered by the Act, but which ought never to have been classifiedat a level attracting criminal sanctions, or ought to have been declassified orreclassified at a lower level.161 A safeguard is therefore essential to avoid the risk of a person actuallybeing prosecuted and convicted on the basis of such an over-classification.For reasons given in paragraph 146, there are strong objections to giving thecourts responsibility for reviewing a Government classification as part of a criminal trial.   For reasons given in paragraph 145, this responsibility should
not be removed from the Government and placed on some other body lackingresponsibility and accountability for the security of the nation. The solutionwe propose is that, before a decision is taken whether to prosecute, there shouldbe a review of the classification of the information which had allegedly been disclosed without authority. This review should be carried out by the responsible minister himself. He should be required to consider whether, at the time ofthe alleged disclosure, that information was properly classified SECRET or above or DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, in the sense that its unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the interests of the nation. If he wasnot satisfied on this point, then no prosecution would be possible. If he was satisfied, he should give a certificate to that effect to the court. This certificateshould be conclusive evidence of the fact that the information was classifiedwithin the meaning of the Act. All other ingredients of the offence should beproved by evidence in the usual way.162 We are aware of the general objections to a provision which removesfrom the court the decision on one of the issues arising in a criminal trial.The alternative to the proposal in the previous paragraph, however, wouldbe to make the fact that the information in question was classified conclusive,without any check on the validity of the classification at the time of the allegeddisclosure. Our proposal provides an additional safeguard against a prosecutionbased on an unjustified classification. The Minister would take personal responsibility for the judgment that this was a disclosure which would cause serious injury to the interests of the nation, and would be answerable inParliament for his decision.163 The proposal in paragraph 161 deals with situations where anunauthorised disclosure is thought to have been made, and the question ofprosecution is under consideration. Such situations are unlikely to arisewith great frequency. This proposal does not cover situations where a person who comes into possession of information which is classified SECRET or above or DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL thinks that it ought not to be soclassified, and wishes to disclose or publish the information. The evidence we received suggests that such situations are likely to arise more frequently.There is dissatisfaction, which is not confined to the news media, at the absenceof any machinery for challenging a classification in circumstances of thiskind. If the Department concerned is asked, it may well simply reply thatthe information is indeed classified and should not be published. It wouldnot be practicable to put every inquiry of this kind to the Minister personallyso as to ascertain whether, if the information was disclosed, he would give his certificate to enable a prosecution to take place.164 For the reasons we have given, decisions about classification are of a kind which ought to be reserved to the Government. Responsibility forthese decisions cannot be shared with or transferred to some other person orbody with no constitutional accountability. Yet the evidence indicates thatclassification is not well understood outside the Government service. Thereare suspicions that considerable over-classification takes place and that classifi-cation is used to prevent the disclosure of matters of public interest. our proposal to link the criminal law with the higher levels of the classification
system will not work satisfactorily if there is a lack of public confidence in thesystem. The proposals in paragraphs 149 and 157 will bring into the open the main features of the system, which will help but may not by itself suffice to rectify this situation.165 We think it would be valuable if a Committee were to be establishedwhich, without detracting from the ultimate accountability of Ministers formatters of national security, performed two functions. The first function isto help those outside the Government who may come into possession of official information of this kind as part of their work to understand better the operationof the classification system and the reasons why particular kinds of informationare classified at a level attracting criminal sanctions. As part of this function,this Committee would be consulted about the regulations proposed in para-graph. 157 b., before they are laid before Parliament. The second function isto provide a central point of reference for any person to ascertain whetherinformation which he has received (not necessarily in documentary form) is classified, and also to jquestion the validity of a particular classification. this second function would cover both classified information relating to currentevents, and classifications of documents relating to past events which havenot been declassified. It would be important that the Committee should beable to make arrangements for dealing speedily with urgent requests for guidance.166 We think that this Committee should be non-statutory, and shouldbe established by agreement between the Government and the outside interestsmost closely concerned, which include the news media. It should include representatives of the Government and of these interests, and should beappointed by and report to the Prime Minister as the Minister with overallresponsibility for matters of national security. We make no specific recom-mendations about the nature and composition of the Committee becauseonly the Government and the interested parties can decide, after discussion,what detailed arrangements would be most useful and practicable. Werecommend that the Government, and the representatives of the news mediaand of any other interests directly affected, should enter into discussions witha view to the establishment of a Committee of the kind outlined above.Repercussions on the present classification system167 The classification system covers the entire area of government. It is used most extensively in the fields of defence, security, and foreign relations,and for certain economic and financial matters. Its use in other areas ofgovernment is not, however, negligible. If classification in certain fields ofgovernment only was linked to the criminal law, the Government would undoubtedly continue to maintain in other fields the same kinds of physicalprecautions and restrictions on access for the protection of information as it applies now. Indeed, it is an essential feature of our proposals that, whilethe protection of criminal sanctions should be withdrawn from much official information of a confidential nature, Governments should continue to protect,by the other means available, a substantial amount of official information which would no longer be protected by the criminal law.  For instance, the
Budget, and other important matters of domestic policy such as we have mentioned in paragraphs 141-3, should continue to be protected by suchmeans as locking up in safes, and restricting the number of people with access to the information. It will remain necessary to identify and to mark such information for these purposes, although its unauthorised disclosure will nolonger be an offence. It would be sensible, in order to avoid confusion, ifsuch markings no longer included the word &quot;secret&quot;. It would then be clearthat, if a Government document relating to one of the three categories wasnot marked SECRET or DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, it was not coveredby the Official Information Act (subject to what we say in paragraph 157 c.about the unauthorised removal of marks).168 Under our proposals information classified CONFIDENTIAL orRESTRICTED would not be protected by criminal sanctions, whatever itssubject matter. Classification at these two levels could therefore continue as hitherto, except in relation to military weapons and equipment, where someCONFIDENTIAL information would become DEFENCE-CONFI-DENTIAL. It may nevertheless be the case, in some circumstances, thatthe considerations bearing on such matters as the need to lock up in safesand to restrict personal access to information are not quite the same as thosebearing on the question what disclosures of information should involve liability to prosecution. We have mentioned in paragraph 158 that our proposals may increase the tendency to classify important CONFIDENTIAL informa-tion as SECRET. We do not expect that this tendency will go very far. the inconvenience flowing from over-classification, measures taken to keep it incheck, and common sense, should keep it in bounds.169 It is not our business to make recommendations about the detailedrepercussions on the classification system of our proposals. Our job is toput forward proposals concerning the application of the criminal law to official information. The need for other means of protection, the nature of those other means, the marking of official information for other purposes, will allremain separate administrative matters unconnected with the law. our proposals would introduce an element of duality into the present classificationsystem at the levels SECRET and TOP SECRET, since some information nowclassified at these levels is not within our three categories, and would no longer be covered by criminal sanctions. There are, however, already two mainsystems of marking documents within the Civil Service the classificationsystem, and the systems of privacy markings (see paragraphs 62-4). It maybe that an adjustment of the boundary between the two, with some extensionand modification of privacy markings, would meet the situation. While it isnot for us to consider these matters as part of our terms of reference, we have gone into them sufficiently to be satisfied that no insoluble problems needarise. We have no doubt that the Civil Service will be able to devise appro-priate and practicable adjustments of the present arrangements, to fit in withour proposals for the amendment of the law.
170 The maintenance of law and order is a basic function of government.It is of the same importance to the domestic life of the nation as defence andforeign relations are to the nation&apos;s international life and survival. A generalthreat to law and order is a threat to freedom and to a civilised way of life.But unauthorised disclosures of official information affecting the maintenanceof law and order cannot appropriately be dealt with in the lav/ by the samemeans as the three categories of information discussed in Chapter 9. Thetouchstone of serious damage to the security of the nation and the life of thepeople does not apply in quite the same way. It would be unusual for any single disclosure of official information concerning the maintenance of lawand order to cause serious damage to the nation as a whole. The test of serious damage is appropriate to the fields of defence, foreign affairs and the currencybecause it is related to the tension between the right of the public in a democracyto know as much as possible and the need of the Government to keep certain information secret; this calls for a strict test for the application of criminal sanctions.171 The unauthorised disclosure of official information for criminalpurposes, or to subvert the enforcement of the law or the preservation of order,is on a different footing. Such behaviour is similar to other kinds of behaviourwhich are made offences against the criminal law because they are in them-selves undesirable and anti-social. Where a servant of the Crown, for instanceone whose duties involve the enforcement of the law or the custody of offenders,uses his official position for purposes directly contrary to his duties, so as tofurther a breach of the law, most people would agree that he ought to be liable to criminal penalties. Such behaviour may amount to corruption,incitement to crime or conspiracy. But a simple disclosure of official infor-mation which may be useful for such purposes may not contravene any otherprovision of the criminal law apart from section 2.172 There is no public right to know this kind of official information.The public have a right to information about such matters as general policemethods and procedures, and prison treatment. These are matters of publicinterest, and Parliament and the people need adequate information to satisfy themselves that proper and effective measures are being taken and properstandards of behaviour are being observed. But the public have no right to information of a kind which would, for instance, be of direct use in the corn-mission of an offence, or in evading detection or in escaping from prison.Such information requires effective protection.173 We received relatively little evidence about the need to protect informa-tion relating to the maintenance of law and order. This may be becausesection 2 is assumed by many to apply only to central government information.
Police officers are, however, Crown servants for the purposes of section 2, andso are officers of the Post Office. Prison officers are civil servants. Thuspolice, prison and Post Office information is official information for ourpurposes. Nine out of the twenty-three section 2 prosecutions since 1945 haverelated to the disclosure, or alleged disclosure, of information of this kind.Such official information is now protected by section 2, and most of thosewitnesses who mentioned the subject agreed that some of this information should continue to be protected by the criminal law.174 The classification system does not, in general, apply to official informa-tion in this field. For the reasons given in paragraphs 170-2 there are not inany event the same grounds here for making use of classification as in the caseof the three categories of information discussed in Chapter 9. It is possible to define in general terms the behaviour which should be penalised, in the same way as with the majority of criminal offences. We propose a definition basedon suggestions made to us by the Home Office in a paper (published in Volume 2)prepared at our request.175 We propose that the Official Information Act should apply to official information (including police, prison and Post Office information) which comes within one of the three following descriptions: a. it is likely to be helpful in the commission of offences. Instances areinformation about the route and timing of the runs of vehicles carryingmoney or other valuable loads, or about a burglar alarm system and how to neutralise it.b. it is likely to be helpful in facilitating an escape from legal custody orother acts prejudicial to prison security. This group includes information about the premises, security measures, organisation or routine ofprisons and other places where persons are held in legal custody whichmight enable persons in custody to escape, or to circumvent measuresof control. It does not include information about treatment and discipline in such establishments.c. its disclosure would be likely to impede the prevention or detection of offences or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. This groupincludes information about police measures and equipment for theprevention and detection of crime, criminal intelligence, the identity of informers, information about police plans for dealing with a possibleserious public disturbance, and information in the hands of the police or of prosecuting authorities which might enable an offender to escapejustice.
THE PROCESSES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE CABINET176 In Chapters 9 and 10 we have discussed kinds of official information which require protection because their disclosure would have damaging effects.These kinds of information can be described in the law by subject matter, or bythe effect of a particular disclosure, or by a combination of these two methods.An argument of a quite different kind for protecting official information wasalso put forward in the evidence. We have referred in paragraph 11 to theimportance of Ministers and administrators being able, in some instances and atsome stages, to discuss matters frankly and fully in private. This need may arise whatever the subject under discussion; it may be felt irrespective of whether an unauthorised disclosure would, by itself, be particularly damaging to thenation. It was put to us in some of the evidence that there was a generalneed to maintain privacy for the processes of policy-formulation and decision-taking within the Government, irrespective of subject matter, and that section 2played an important part in preserving this privacy.177 The Civil Service Department state in their written memorandum that ministers and their advisers, and civil servants, must be able to exchange viewsfrankly and fully among themselves without the risk that details of their discussions will be made public. If an amendment of section 2 were to under-mine this position, the Department say, the frank discussion of the merits ofdifferent policies might be inhibited, issues might not be so thoroughly debated,and unpopular or minority views might not be so fully considered. TheDepartment suggest that, where discussions did take place, the risk of disclosure perhaps for reasons of political sympathy, perhaps for private gain mightbe much greater.178 The Civil Service Department go on to say that disciplinary sanctions would, in many cases, provide an adequate deterrent, but &quot;have some veryserious shortcomings which appear to preclude their use as the only sanction&quot;.They could not, it is said, be applied effectively to those who left the publicservice, or to persons outside the Service brought into consultation on confidentialmatters; they could not apply to those who induced public servants to makeunauthorised disclosures; and they would be of very limited value in relation to civil servants with short service, who might have little to lose by dismissal andmight be compensated by payment for the information.179 We accept that there are grounds for maintaining a measure of privacyin the conduct of the Governmenfs business. In part this is needed for thereasons given by the Civil Service Department. In part it is an instance of theneed for keeping some discussions confidential which is felt in undertakings ofall kinds.  We accept that these considerations apply over a wide range of
Government business, irrespective of subject matter. The questions whichwe have to consider are these: would this position in fact be undermined bythe amendments of the law which we propose ? Is there a case for the use of criminal sanctions to give general protection to the internal processes ofgovernment, in addition to the specific protection given by the other new provisions which we propose?180 We answer both these questions in the negative. We propose in chapter 9 that the unauthorised disclosure of official information whichwould cause serious injury to the interests of the nation should remain an offence. We propose in Chapter 10 that criminal sanctions should apply todisclosures impeding the maintenance of law and order. We propose in chapter 12 that the disclosure of the confidences of the citizen entrusted tothe Government, or of official information for private gain, so far as not already covered by the law on corruption, should be offences. These proposalscover those kinds of information about the Government^ business which it is most important to protect by the criminal law. We have explained inparagraphs 107-109 why we do not expect the removal of the present catch-allcriminal sanction to have an adverse effect on the basic reliability of the CivilService. Departmental witnesses with whom we discussed this point agreedthat few civil servants would be likely in practice to behave any differently ifthe ambit of criminal sanctions was substantially reduced on the lines whichwe propose.181 In these circumstances we do not think there is justification for theview that certain aspects of the entire range of Government business should remain within the scope of the criminal law. Acceptance of that view wouldbe inconsistent with our main aims. The leakage of information aboutdiscussions within the Civil Service cannot, as such, be regarded as sufficient justification for imposing criminal liability. The criminal liability which nowexists in relation to disclosures of the ordinary processes of government isnominal rather than real, since they do not in practice result in prosecution.The discipline of the public service is in our view an adequate means, as wellas being the appropriate means, of dealing with such matters.The Cabinet182 It is implicit in some of the Government evidence that the considerations set out in paragraphs 176-8 apply with very special force to the top level ofgovernment, i.e. the Ministers forming the Cabinet. The operation of ourentire system of government turns on the proper functioning of the Cabinet.Unauthorised publication of Cabinet documents could undermine public confidence to a point where the Government would find it difficult to perform the essential functions of governing. Even if breaches did not occur oftenenough to have this effect, they would certainly lower the quality of governmentin this country.183 The classical argument for this view is on the following lines. Theultimate responsibility for the decisions of the Government lies in the Cabinet.The Cabinet works on the doctrine of collective responsibility.  Whatever the
individual views of its members, when the Cabinet reaches a decision it is thedecision of them all. Each shares in the collective responsibility for thatdecision. Anything which damages this collective unity and integrity of theCabinet damages the government of the country. Privacy for the internaldeliberations of the Cabinet, it is argued, is an essential condition of thiscollective unity. Cabinet Ministers must be able to discuss matters with their colleagues in an uninhibited way. It is in the nature of the system that cabinet ministers are sometimes overruled by their colleagues, and sometimes change their minds. Equally, a variety of possible policies and courses of action mayhave to be considered before one is decided upon. It was put to us that sucha system is not strengthened by exposure to the public eye. On the contrary,when confidentiality among colleagues in the Cabinet is lost, discussion will beless free and less frank. Its quality will be impaired and so may the quality of decisions reached.184 It is of course true that a certain amount of information about matterslikely to come before the Cabinet and conclusions reached on particular issuesbecomes known and is discussed in the press. Some but not all of this information is attributable to the briefing of accredited correspondents by ministers or by others on their behalf. A small amount does not come from such authorised briefings, but is the natural product of a place like Westminster or any centre of government -where Ministers and a hundred or morepolitical correspondents work closely together. It is unreasonable to expect the silence of the monastery in a modern centre of government. DifferentMinisters will always interpret differently the secrecy enjoined on them. Sometalk more freely than others. It is valuable to have the ear of a friendlycorrespondent, and he will appreciate a little guidance from time to time.Equally, when a Cabinet is under stress, it is tempting for a Minister to hint in private conversation with a lobby man where at any rate he stands. Anyonewith working knowledge of the system knows that this happens. But the effectof it all, even allowing for rare indiscretions, in our view still falls a long wayshort of the consequences of publishing the text of Cabinet documents ordisclosing the course of Cabinet proceedings. We must distinguish betweenthe small coin of day-to-day exchanges around Westminster and disclosuresabout transactions within the Cabinet which could destroy its effectiveness.185 Those who take collective decisions in any sphere of life will acknowledge the force of the considerations summarised in paragraphs 182-3. The Cabinetstands at the apex of our system and takes the highest decisions of the State.It is to the Cabinet that the doctrine of collective responsibility attaches. Forthese reasons we think it important that Cabinet documents should continueto receive full protection, including the protection of criminal sanctions,against unauthorised disclosure. Although the circulation of such documentswithin the Government is restricted, the number of civil servants with access to them is inevitably considerable. Those who have access are at all levels,from Permanent Secretaries to the typists who type the papers and the clerkswho file them. Thus the possibility of leakage of a document at some point is not negligible. In any event the governing factor in considering the needfor protection is the seriousness of the damage that a leak would cause ratherthan the likelihood of leakage.
186 The modern Cabinet does not operate solely through full meetings ofall its members. Because of the large amount of business to be decided, andthe difficulty of assembling the whole Cabinet very frequently, the Cabinetfunctions to a considerable degree through committees. It is mistaken to suppose that Cabinet committees merely operate as sub-committees of theCabinet and therefore simply formulate recommendations to be considered bythe Cabinet. There are certain standing committees concerned with the mainareas of government. Other committees are constituted ad hoc as occasion arises, sometimes to consider matters of the highest importance. committees of both kinds may comprise or include the most senior Ministers in the Cabinet.The Prime Minister himself takes the chair at some of them. These committees have authority to take decisions on behalf of the Cabinet. For our purposes&quot;the Cabinet&quot; means the full Cabinet, and Cabinet committees the members ofwhich are Ministers. The considerations we have mentioned apply equally to both; they do not apply any further.187 We have mentioned in paragraph 184 the way in which day-to-dayexchanges around Westminster include the disclosure of a certain amount ofinformation about the business of the Cabinet. It can be very difficult toestablish where this kind of disclosure came from, whether it was authorisedor not, and whether it is a factual disclosure or intelligent speculation. Wedo not think it feasible that communications of this kind concerning the cabinet should form the subject of criminal prosecutions. The real damage with whichwe are concerned would be caused by the publication of the actual documents of the Cabinet-that is, papers put to the Cabinet for consideration, and theminutes recording its discussions and its conclusions. Criminal sanctionsshould apply to the unauthorised communication of these papers. Such a communication need not, however, take the form of handing over a Cabinetdocument, or a copy or a part of such a document. The words on a documentcan be stored in the memory, written down, or recorded in some other way.They can then be communicated or transmitted in a way which makes it possibleto reconstruct and publish the document either verbatim or in what is to allintents and purposes its original form. The law should accordingly cover both the communication of an actual Cabinet document or a substantial partof one, and the communication of information about the document which enables another person to reproduce the document or a substantial part of itin a verbatim or virtually verbatim form. The law should not extend to the gist, or a summary, of a Cabinet document.188 Criminal sanctions should apply only from the moment when a document assumes its status as a Cabinet document. This is the point in timewhen a paper bearing the appropriate heading is circulated to Cabinet Ministers.Earlier official papers on the same subject, and drafts of a Cabinet document,are not themselves Cabinet documents, however similar their contents. We are proposing criminal sanctions for the protection of Cabinet documents not onaccount of the contents of these documents, but to safeguard the collective responsibility of the Cabinet. This collective responsibility is not engagedbefore a document is circulated to the members of the Cabinet. This, therefore,is the point in time from which criminal sanctions should apply.189 Cabinet documents are marked to indicate that this is what they are.It is important for the practical operation of our proposals that persons outside
the Government who come into possession of Cabinet documents should beable to recognise them. The Official Information Act should therefore providefor the Secretary of the Cabinet to prescribe the markings on Cabinet documents.Where the disclosure of an actual document was alleged, the prosecution shouldhave to prove that it was marked in the prescribed manner. The fact that a document was a Cabinet document or a substantial part of one, or that analleged communication had enabled a Cabinet document or a substantial partof it to be reproduced in one of the other ways mentioned in paragraph 187,should be proved by evidence in court in the usual manner. (What we say inparagraph 157 c. about the removal of a classification mark, or the making of a copy of a classified document without the mark, applies also to Cabinetmarks.)190 We propose that the Official Information Act should apply to cabinet documents, that is, documents submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet and documents recording the proceedings or conclusions of the Cabinet, irrespective of subject matter. &quot;Cabinet&quot; for this purpose includes committees of theCabinet the members of which are Ministers. Cabinet documents to which theAct applies should be marked in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of theCabinet. The Act should provide that the communication of a Cabinet documentmeans either the transmission of that document or a substantial part of it, or the communication of information about the document by other means which enableanother person to reproduce the document or a substantial part of it in verbatimor virtually verbatim form.
BREACHES OF CONFIDENCE AND THE USE OF official information FOR PRIVATE GAIN191 In this Chapter we consider the two remaining reasons for protectingofficial information, mentioned in paragraph 111 c. and d. These reasons are different from those discussed in Chapters 9, 10 and 11 in that they donot relate primarily to the interests of the nation as a whole, but rather tothe integrity of the relationship between the Government and the governed.The confidences of the citizen reposed in the Government192 The Government today becomes involved in many aspects of the life ofthe nation and the lives of its citizens. Its involvement in the management ofthe economy brings it into close contact with business and industry. the welfare State has brought it into much closer contact than in the past with the lives of individual citizens. The Government possesses some information, atleast, about every citizen and every firm in the land; in some cases it possesses avery considerable amount of such information. The Government would be quite unable to perform its functions in the modern State if it could not obtainthis kind of information. Much of this information is of a private and confidential kind. Much of it comes to the Government on an express or animplicit basis of confidence. Even where it is not supplied to the Governmenton a clearly confidential basis, it is generally accepted that the Governmentshould not use or disclose the information except for the purposes for which itwas given or obtained. The next two paragraphs give a number of examples to illustrate the wide range of information involved.193 Information about individuals in the possession of the Governmentincludes the following: that collected by the Registrars General in the courseof the registration of births, marriages and deaths, some of which is keptconfidential and is not available for public inspection or publication; censusinformation and other similar information from surveys; information in taxreturns; information acquired by social security offices in the course of dealingwith claims for benefit of all kinds; information about immigrants and thoseseeking naturalisation; information about prisoners and other criminals, orsuspected criminals; information about those seeking the exercise of the royal prerogative of Mercy or complaining against the police; information aboutNational Health Service patients; information about those holding, or considered for, judicial office, a great variety of other Crown or Government appointmentsand honours; the personal particulars of teachers; information about qualifica-tions, job record, etc., given to the employment services; and a variety of other similar kinds of information.194 Information about organisations in the possession of the Governmentincludes the following:  information about industrial, commercial, agricultural
and fishing undertakings of all kinds relating to such things as their financialand trading position; plans, policies, new projects and mergers; share of themarket, pricing policies, imports and exports; wages, conditions of work and internal relations; and products and manufacturing processes. This informationmay come to the Government in statutory returns, e.g. under the legislation ontaxation and on statistics of trade; and in connection with the administrationof Customs and Excise, applications for grants, for planning permission and forother permissions, and tenders for Government contracts. Apart from informa-tion of this kind, related directly to the execution of specific government functions,the Government also receives a considerable amount of information in thecourse of consultations with business and industry, which are intended to help the Government to formulate economic policy and to take specific decisions.Apart from the fact that this information is confidential, its publication ordisclosure, e.g. to competitors, could in many instances be seriously damaging to the undertakings concerned.195 As the list in paragraphs 193 and 194 indicates, this information comes to the Government in a number of different ways. Some is given in response toexpress statutory requirements, such as the requirements to fill in census formsand to make tax returns. Some is given by persons and firms making applica-tions or claiming benefits of various kinds. Some is given, particularly byfirms and undertakings, in the course of consultations of the kind mentioned inthe previous paragraph. Some is provided by third parties making reports ofvarious kinds, e.g. police or medical reports. Often factual information ofthis kind is inextricably mixed up with assessments and opinions, favourable andunfavourable. A great deal of information of this kind is also obtaineddirect by Crown servants in the course of carrying out their duties. this information is on an entirely different footing, as it is not entrusted to theGovernment. This does not mean that the Government should not keep such information private, but there is not the same reason for giving it speciallegal protection.Existing legal protection for the confidences of the citizen196 A considerable number of the statutes which require the giving ofinformation, or which confer powers of entry or inspection, contain provisionsexpressly prohibiting unauthorised disclosures of the information obtained inthese ways. The principle behind these provisions is that when the Staterequires the citizen to provide or reveal information which may be of a personal and confidential nature, or which should be kept confidential for commercialreasons, then the State should give to the citizen a guarantee that this information will be properly protected. Appendix V indicates the range and nature of theseprotective provisions. All but one of them relate to information obtained as aresult of statutory powers. The case for protecting information entrusted tothe State does not, however, rest on the fact that the information was provided under formal compulsion. Information obtained through compulsion doesnot form a major proportion of the information of these kinds in the Govern-ment&apos;s possession. Even in relation to information obtained through compul-sion, there are some significant gaps. For instance, census information is expressly protected by the Census Act, but there is no specific legal protection for income tax returns.  The present position is that a very large amount of
information in the Governments hands, which is confidential because of itspersonal or commercial nature, is protected from unauthorised disclosure bysection 2. If section 2 were repealed and replaced by provisions covering onlyinformation of the kind mentioned in the previous Chapters, all this confidential information would cease to enjoy the protection of the criminal law.The need to protect these confidences by criminal sanctions197 There is no argument about the need to protect this information.We found universal agreement among witnesses on this point. The questionis whether sufficient protection would be provided by the normal discipline of the public service, and the other protective measures described in Chapter 5,together with such civil remedies as the law provides. We do not suppose that the withdrawal of the present legal protection would be followed by any significant number of unauthorised disclosures of this kind of information,fn our view there are nevertheless proper reasons for maintaining the protectionof criminal sanctions. Here is a point where the requirements of governmentand the interests of the citizen wholly coincide. The Government is requiringmore and more information from citizens and bodies. This information isgiven willingly and frankly only on the assurance, implicit or explicit, that itwill be kept confidential. The Government cannot function effectively without this information. The people have the right to expect their confidences to be safeguarded by the Government. Any breakdown of this trust between government and people could have considerable adverse repercussions onthe government of the country. There is no tension in this sphere betweenopenness and secrecy. Everything points to the need for full and effective protection.198 It is not only the Government which possesses much private informa-tion about individuals. There is a more general concern today about theprotection of individual privacy. The Committee on Privacy have recently reported on this subject. They were concerned with intrusions into privacyin the private sector, and did not consider the protection of private information in the Governments hands. Their concern and ours thus met but did notoverlap. In our view there is clear justification for the use of stronger remediesin the public sector than the Privacy Committee recommend in the private sector. This justification does not lie in the fact that this information isprivate: it lies in the fact that this information is given by the citizen to theGovernment on an express or implied basis of confidence, because it is requiredfor the purposes of the government of the country. A relationship of trustbetween the State and the citizen is involved; and the consequences of a break-down of this relationship would affect the nation as a whole. None of these considerations applies in the private sector.199 A citizen or firm suffering damage as a result of an unauthorised disclosure of confidential information entrusted to the Government should certainly be entitled to pursue any civil remedies the law may provide, if hehas the desire and the means to do so. We thus welcome the Privacy Com-mittee&apos;s proposal that the Law Commissions should review the law on breach of confidence.  But the twin objects of deterring the Crown servant from
making unauthorised disclosures, and reassuring the citizen that his confidenceswill be protected, are more appropriate to the criminal law. In any event a legal provision intended to deal with a public wrong, which has resulted froma failure by the State, should not depend for its efficacy upon the injuredcitizen rather than the State taking action. The wrongful disclosure by aCrown servant of information entrusted to the Government in confidence canfairly be regarded as criminal behaviour. The appropriate form of legal action to be taken by the State, if the circumstances are sufficiently serious,is a prosecution. Some of the information concerned is admittedly of a relatively innocuous or trivial kind, and indeed may be clearly less important than some of the government information which we believe should no longer be protected by the criminal law. But the withdrawal of the existing protectionof the criminal law from information entrusted to the Government would inour view be a mistake.200 Information entrusted to the Government by citizens and privatebodies may or may not be given on the clear understanding that it is confi-dential. It seems to us proper, however, that the law should be drafted interms of all information given to the Government by individuals and privatebodies, and should not iequire proof of an express or implied condition ofconfidence. We have pointed out in paragraph 197 that there is no publicinterest in the disclosure of this kind of information, and consequently lessneed for a very tightly drawn provision. There will be two safeguards againsta provision in wide terms having an unreasonably restrictive effect or leading to unreasonable prosecutions. First, we propose in the next Chapter that nooffence should be committed except where such information is disclosed by aCrown servant contrary to his official duty. Second, we propose in Chapter 16that there should be a control over such prosecutions, as there is now overprosecutions under section 2. We propose that the Official Information Actshould apply to information given to the Government by private individuals orconcerns, whether given by reason of compulsory powers or otherwise, andwhether or not given on an express or implied basis of confidence.The use of official information for private gain201 We pointed out in paragraph 141 that premature access to information about impending fiscal changes can be used for purposes of private gain.This is not the only kind of official information which can be used in this way.There are also, for instance, Government decisions in the fields of planning,development and investment. For a Crown servant to disclose official infor-mation of this kind so that the recipient may line his pockets is a clear breach of public trust. It is offensive to morality and to public opinion alike that private firms or individuals should use official information, to which they haveimproperly obtained access, for purposes of private enrichment. Section sat  present catches both the Crown servant and the recipient in such circum-stances. The question is whether behaviour of this kind, which is certainlyimproper, should remain criminal.202 The law of corruption only covers cases where a gift or consideration is offered, given or accepted as an inducement or reward. Thus if a crown servant were to give official information to a friend so that the friend could
make money out of it, that would not amount to corruption. Nor would it becorruption if a financier were to exercise arts of persuasion to obtain official information which he could use on the Stock Exchange. Behaviour of thiskind is, however, akin to corruption, and might be regarded as corrupt in common parlance. On the other hand there are many persons other thanCrown servants who receive, in the course of their work, information whichthey should not reveal and which could be used for purposes of private gain.So far as the criminal law is concerned, there is nothing to stop the disclosureor use of such information for private gain, provided that no gift or consideration is involved.203 This is another field where the relationship between the State and the citizen involves considerations which do not arise in relationships betweenprivate bodies and individuals. The State is under an obligation to act with complete fairness and impartiality in all its dealings with the citizen. when this obligation is dishonoured through a breach of public trust by a crown servant, or when a private individual or interest gains unfair financial advantageas the result of a failure of impartiality on the part of the State, then it seemsto us that the criminal law can properly be invoked to deal with these abuses,even though it does not and need not apply in comparable circumstances not involving the Government.204 A Crown servant who, contrary to his official duty, uses information obtained by him in the course of his work for his own financial advantage doesnot now commit an offence under section 2 or any other branch of the law. Itwould, however, be illogical to penalise the communication of information toanother person to enable that other person to make a private gain, while doing nothing to prevent a Crown servant from using the information himself for thatpurpose. In terms of criminality, both the use and the communication stand ona par, and the law should cover both. Similar considerations apply toGovernment contractors and to persons entrusted with official information in confidence, whose position is discussed more fully in Chapter 14. It can be argued that, where official information is improperly communicated to aperson who has not used corruption, conspiracy or incitement to obtain theinformation, he should not be penalised for using it for his own purposes.However, a situation might occasionally arise in which the recipient could makevery large sums in this way. We believe that, provided the recipient is aware that he should not have been given the information, the criminal law shouldnot be powerless to deal with this situation. No special provision is needed to deal with a recipient who passes on the information so that another may use it for private gain, but who does not himself make such a gain; he would normally be guilty of aiding and abetting any offence committed by the crown servant or the second recipient.205 We propose that the Official Information Act should contain thefollowing provisions, which would in effect form an extension of the existing lawon corruption: a. It should be an offence for a Crown servant, contrary to his official duty,to use official information for the purpose of obtaining private gain for himself or any other person, or to communicate the information to any
other person with a view to enabling that person or any other person toobtain private gain. &quot;Private gain&quot; means the making of a gain, or the avoidance of a loss, in money or money&apos;s worth.b. This offence should also cover i. a Government contractor who uses or communicates official infor-mation for private gain, otherwise than for the purposes of the contract;ii. a person entrusted with official information in confidence, who usesor communicates that information for private gain, otherwise than for the purposes for which it was entrusted.c. It should be an offence for a recipient of official information, which he knows or has reasonable ground to believe has been disclosed by a crown servant contrary to his official duty, or by a Government contractor or person entrusted with official information in confidence contrary to babove, to use that information for the purpose of obtaining private gainfor himself or for another.Local Government206 Local authorities are involved in planning, development and invest-ment, and the placing of contracts, often in conjunction with, and usingknowledge supplied by, the central Government. For the purposes of localgovernment they also come into possession of information about private individuals and concerns which should not be spread abroad. Nevertheless,members and officials of local authorities have not been subject to section 2 inthe past, except when they are entrusted with central government information in confidence. Nor did the Association of Municipal Corporations or theCounty Councils Association in their evidence to us envisage local government information being guarded by the criminal law. On the other hand, it can be argued that, with a reform of the system by which official information is protected,an extension of the criminal law to the local government field should beconsidered. This, however, would require a wide-ranging enquiry outside thescope of our Committee.
Part IVWHO SHOULD BE LIABLE TO PROSECUTIONCHAPTER 13CROWN SERVANTS207 In Part III we have proposed that certain kinds of official information should continue to be protected by criminal sanctions. Part IV is concernedwith who should be under a duty to protect information of these kinds and liable to prosecution for failure to do so, and how this duty should be formulated.(Strictly speaking, no legal duty is involved. Our proposals are that it should,in certain circumstances, be an offence to disclose information of these kinds,which is not the same as being under a duty to protect it. The issues discussed in this Part can, however, be explained more clearly in terms of a duty to protect.We have drafted accordingly; but it should be borne in mind that &quot;duty toprotect&quot;, in our terms, means liability to prosecution for improper disclosure).In considering this duty to protect, the population can be divided into threebroad groups. The first comprises those working in the central government who handle this kind of information as part of their job; this group is considered in this Chapter. The second group comprises certain classes of people whose work is connected in one way or another with the functions of the centralGovernment, and who may for that reason handle information of this kind;this group is considered in Chapter 14. The third group comprises all othercitizens, who may on occasion come into possession of such information,and is considered in Chapter 15.The main classes of Crown servants208 The information with which we are concerned is all official information.That is, it is information which a Crown servant (or Government contractor)learns in the course of his official duties. Whatever arguments there may beabout other classes of person, it is clear that Crown servants should be undera duty to protect that official information which, under our proposals inPart III, will be covered by the Official Information Act. The only questions are, who should count as a Crown servant for this purpose, and how shouldhis duty to protect this information be formulated.209 We have been using the expression &quot;Crown servant&quot; as a convenientabbreviation of the expression &quot;a person holding office under Her Majesty&quot;,which is used in section 2. The latter expression covers most but not all ofthose working in central Government who handle information of the kindwe propose should be protected by criminal sanctions. It also covers some people who do not handle information of this kind as part of their job. Itis not therefore altogether satisfactory, and it needs replacement by a more precise and specific provision.- y &apos;i
210 There are five main classes of person who are now subject to section 2as holders, or former holders, of an &quot;office under Her Majesty&quot;, and who should be similarly subject to the Official Information Act.   These are: a. Ministers of the Crown. Ministers largely authorise themselves to disclose information. Nevertheless Ministers have the same publicduty to protect official information as their civil servants, and shouldcontinue to be subject to the law as at present. It would be wrong to place them in any special position.b. Civil servants. This is the main class of persons handling the infor-mation in question. We use the expression to cover both the home civil Service and the Diplomatic Service. By virtue of the definitionin section 11 of the 1911 Act, any office or employment in or under aGovernment Department is covered. The Official Information Actshould clearly continue to cover all civil servants in this sense of the term.c. The Armed Forces. Members of the Armed Forces handle muchdefence information and may handle some information in the other categories. They should continue to be covered as now. They arealso subject to the Service Discipline Acts, which contain separateprovisions on this subject which overlap with section 2. The general position is that a serviceman is subject to the civil law, like any othercitizen, as well as to military law. We see no reasons for any departure from this position in relation to the Official Information Act.d. Police officers. holders of the office of constable are covered bysection2at present. The police handle most of the information in the lawand order field which the Official Information Act will cover, andsome of the other kinds of information. The Act should apply to police officers, including officers of forces with limited jurisdictionset up under statutes other than the Police Acts.e. Former members of classes a.-d. Section 2 covers former crown servants as well as Crown servants. The protection provided by theOfficial Information Act would be incomplete if the lips of crown servants were unsealed as soon as they retired, or resigned or weredismissed. The Act should cover ex-Crown servants as well as thosestill serving.Those treated in the same way as Crown servants211 Section 2 applies to persons who are or have been employed underCrown servants. The Official Information Act should likewise apply to thosewho, because they are working in or with the central Government, may handleinformation to which the Act applies as part of their job. The Act shouldalso apply to officers of public bodies which are not Government Departments,but which perform functions involving the handling of information coveredby the Act. There are two such bodies whose officers are at present treatedas Crown servants for the purposes of section 2. These are the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority and the Post Office. Part of the Atomic energy authority&apos;s work is concerned with atomic information in the defence field,
and the Post Office is concerned with information about the telecommunicationssystem, and with certain information in the fields of law and order (e.g. the interception of communications, the handling of valuable packages). TheOfficial Information Act will cover these kinds of information, and should accordingly apply to members and officers of these two bodies in the same way as to Crown servants.212 The general criterion for deciding whether the Official Information Actshould treat officers of bodies which are not Government Departments in thesame way as Crown servants is whether the regular functions of the body involvedealing on its own account with information protected by criminal sanctions,and whether that body itself generates information of this kind. Public bodies which merely receive official information from the central Government on a confidential basis do not come into this category. The Atomic Energy authority and the Post Office were the only public bodies brought to our attention as requiring to be covered by the Act in this way. Should any other comparablebodies be established in the future, then the Official Information Act should apply to them in accordance with the criterion we have mentioned.Those who should be included or excluded213 There are some classes of person whose work gives them direct access to official information to which the Official information Act will apply, andwho should accordingly be subject to the Act, but who are not now covered bysection 2. Those brought to our notice as being in this position are mentionedbelow; there may be others whose position is similar: a. Police forces employ numbers of civilian personnel who do not hold theoffice of constable and are not civil servants. These employees share in the handling of police information of all kinds.b. Some persons working in prisons are neither civil servants nor employees of central Government, but have access to prison information.c. Some members of the legal profession who act for the Crown or thepolice in bringing prosecutions have access to information about policeinvestigations.214 Section 2 applies to all those who hold office under Her Majesty,whether or not within any of the classes mentioned in paragraph 210. It may apply to members or officers of a variety of public bodies which perform publicfunctions but are not part of the central Government. The evidence which we obtained from such bodies and from Government Departments shows thatdiffering interpretations can be placed on the scope of the expression &quot;officeunder Her Majesty&quot;. There has never been occasion to test in the courts thequestion whether members or officers of such public bodies hold such an officewithin the meaning of section 2. In our view, however, the Official InformationAct need not treat anyone other than those mentioned in paragraphs 210, 211and 213 as Crown servants. Other offices and public bodies should be excluded. Insofar as such persons and bodies are entrusted with official information in confidence, their position will be adequately covered by theprovision on this subject discussed in the next Chapter.
215 We propose that the Official Information Act should place the primaryduty to protect official information to which it applies upon: a. Ministers of the Crown;b. members of the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service;c. members of the Armed Forces;d. members of police forces;e. members of the Atomic Energy Authority and the Post Office;f. persons employed by or serving under the direction or control of any ofthe above classes, and members of the legal profession acting for theCrown or for the police in bringing prosecutions;g. former members of any of the above classes.References in the rest of this Report to Crown servants are references to theabove classes collectively. These classes are largely the same as those nowsubject to section 2, but differ in the ways mentioned in paragraphs 213 and 214.Authorisation and the official duty of Crown servants216 Section 2 (1) (a) prohibits the communication of official information byaCrown servant &quot;other than toa person to whom he is authorised tocommunicateit, or a person to whom it is in the interest of the State his duty to communicateit&quot;. We have described in Part I several unsatisfactory features of this formof words. Their meaning is far from clear. The way in which they areinterpreted by the Civil Service is sensible, but is not widely known outside theService. Their application to persons other than Crown servants is obscure.The evidence shows that the drafting of this part of section 2 may look as if it isthe wrong way round, in the sense that all communications appear to be madeprima facie illegal, with an exception for those which are authorised or made out of duty to the State. A clearer approach is for all communications to belegal, except for those specified as illegal in clear terms and for good reason.217 The Civil Service evidence on authorisation was to the effect that aCrown servant is authorised to make those communications which he may properly make as part of his job. The straightforward approach to thisquestion is thus to link the legality of a communication by a Crown servantdirectly with the question whether it was made in the course of his duty. we propose that it should be an offence for a Crown servant to communicate informa-tion to which the Official Information Act applies, contrary to his official duty.This is a clear form of words which should be understood both within and outside the Civil Service. It has the merit of describing, more accurately thansection 2, the actual practice of the Civil Service. This test will make clearthat it is for the prosecution to establish that the communication was contraryto the Crown servanfs duty. If an act cannot even be shown to have beencontrary to his duty, it would be unreasonable that it should nevertheless becaught by the criminal law.Mens rea218 The evidence shows considerable uncertainty about whether the offence of unauthorised communication under section 2 (1) (a) involves mensrea.  It is widely held that this is an absolute offence.  In the case of the
Nigerian Report, sixty years after the passing of section 2, this remained apoint for argument. It is most important that the Official Information Actshould be clear on this point, so that no room is left for doubt or misunder-standing.219 A Crown servant has a public duty to protect official information whichshould not be disclosed. If he fails in that duty and that failure results in the disclosure of official information to which the Official Information Act applies,we think these facts alone should suffice as the basis of a criminal prosecution.It would, in any event, involve a very difficult burden of proof if the prosecutionhad to establish facts about the state of mind of an accused Crown servantto show that he knew, or had reasonable ground to believe, that he had actedcontrary to his duty. This is not to say that a Crown servant should beconvicted in the absence of any mens rea. We agree with the view expressed to us by the Home Office that it would be wrong to put a person in peril ofconviction if he believed, with reasonable cause, that he was authorised tomake the communication in question. A proper balance will be achieved ifthe prosecution have to prove that the Crown servant has disclosed information to which the Official Information Act applies, and that in doing so he actedcontrary to his official duty. The accused should then have the defence thathe believed, and had reasonable ground to believe, that the communicationhe had made was not contrary to his official duty.220 Cases may arise where although the Crown servant knew, or hadreasonable ground to believe, that he was acting contrary to his official duty,he nevertheless did not realise that he had disclosed information to which theOfficial Information Act applied. The question arises whether this shouldalso be a defence. In the cases where classification is an ingredient of the offence, it is reasonable that the Crown servant should be able to plead thathe was not aware that the information he had communicated was classified.For instance, it might have been passed to him orally without this being made clear, or he might have received a document from which the classificationmark had been removed. It would, however, go too far to enable a crown servant to escape conviction by arguing that he did not realise that the informa-tion he had disclosed related to defence or internal security, or foreign relations,or the currency or the reserves. If the evidence shows that a Crown servanthas acted contrary to his duty, and that he knew or had reasonable ground tobelieve that this was so and that the information he disclosed was classified,no further defence should then be available to escape conviction. In relationto offences under the Official Information Act relating to law and order,Cabinet documents and the confidences of the citizen, however, classificationis not an ingredient of the offence, and it would be reasonable to give theCrown servant the defence that he did not know, and had no reason to believe,that the document was a Cabinet document or that the information was ofone of the kinds specified in paragraphs 175 and 200.221 In relation to prosecutions of serving Crown servants for the offence inparagraph 217, we propose that the Official Information Act should provide asfollows: a. The prosecution should have to prove that the Crown servant had disclosedinformation to which the Official Information Act applies, contrary tohis official duty.
b. The Crown servant should have the defence that he believed, and hadreasonable ground to believe, that he was not acting contrary to his official duty.c. The Crown servant should also have the defence that i. in the case of classified information relating to defence or internal security, or foreign relations, or the currency or the reserves, he didnot know, and had no reason to believe, that it was classified;ii. in the case of an offence of disclosing a Cabinet document, or information covered by our proposals on the maintenance of law andorder and the confidences of the citizen, that he did not know, andhad no reason to believe, that it was such a document, or wasinformation of one of the kinds specified in paragraphs 175 and 200.Mishandling of official documents222 It is an offence under section 2 at present for any person prohibited from making an unauthorised communication of official information to retainany official document when he has no right to do so, or to fail to take reasonablecare of any official document or information or to return such a document.We received no evidence relating to these two provisions. It is desirable thatsuch provisions should be retained, in relation to information to which theOfficial Information Act applies, to ensure its proper protection. The present law also penalises conduct endangering the safety of official information, butit seems to us that these words add nothing of substance to the offence of failing to take reasonable care. We propose that failure by a Crown servantto take reasonable care of an official document or information to which the official information Act applies, or failure to comply with directions given on behalf ofthe Crown about the return or disposal of such a document, or the retention ofsuch a document contrary to his official duty, should be offences.
OTHER PERSONS AUTHORISED TO HANDLEOFFICIAL INFORMATION223 This Chapter deals with two broad classes of person who handleofficial information because their work is connected in one way or anotherwith that of the central Government. Section 2 largely assimilates thesetwo classes to Crown servants. We think that they should both be under a duty to protect official information to which the Official Information Actapplies. The circumstances in which a disclosure of such information bythem should be an offence cannot be formulated in the same way, as theyare not Crown servants and accordingly have no official duty.Persons entrusted with protected information in confidence224 Section 2 now covers those to whom official information is entrustedby Crown servants in confidence. The evidence we received shows that thisprovision has a wide application. A good deal of information is entrustedin this way by central government to other public bodies. For instance localauthorities, nationalised industries and other public corporations may beentrusted with official information in confidence for various purposes, includingplanning for war and other emergencies. Departmental committees, consul-tants employed by the Government, and researchers working in fields of concern to the central Government, are likewise often entrusted in confidencewith official information to enable them to perform their functions, fn manycases where this is done those receiving the information sign Official secrets acts declarations. The evidence indicated that the existence of this provision,and the signing of declarations, are taken seriously by those concerned. Thereappear to have been no prosecutions under section 2 of such persons, butthere is little doubt that the application of the law to them gives added pro-tection. The Official Information Act should accordingly cover personsentrusted in confidence with official information to which the Act applies.225 One way in which persons in this position may come into possessionof such official information is by being allowed access to official premises.For instance, a person visiting a prison or a defence establishment may acquireduring the visit information, to which the Official Information Act applies.Provided it has been made clear to such a person that any information of thiskind so acquired is covered by the Act, it should be regarded as having been entrusted in confidence to him within the meaning of the Act.Government contractors226 It is clearly essential that the Official Information Act should coverGovernment contractors, including sub-contractors, and their employees.Much classified defence information is handled by Government contractors.But the great majority of Government contractors, who never handle the kindof information to which the Official Information Act will apply, but who arenow subject to section 2, will not be subject to the new Act.
The duty of Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information in confidence227 Persons entrusted with official information in confidence and Govern-ment contractors have no official duty as such. It is, however, possible to identify and specify the information which comes to them by virtue of their position. This might be done, for instance, by including an appropriateprovision in the contract specifying the information to which the official information Act applies, or by the signing of a declaration similarly specifyingthis information, or in some other suitable way. Given that the attention ofGovernment contractors and those entrusted with official information in confidence is expressly drawn to the application of the Official InformationAct, it is then reasonable that their treatment should be comparable to that of Crown servants in regard to ?nens rea and the defences available to a defendant.228   We propose that:-a. It should be an offence for a Government contractor to disclose informa-tion to which the Official Information Act applies (other than theconfidences of the citizen see paragraphs 200 and 234) and which hascome into his possession owing to his position as a Government con-tractor, if i. the provisions of the Act have been drawn to his attention as applying to that information or that kind of information; and ii. the disclosure is not made for the purposes of the contract or inaccordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown,or it is made contrary to restrictions imposed on behalf of theCrown.b. A person charged with this offence should have the defences i. that he believed, and had reasonable ground to believe, that he haddisclosed the information for the purposes of the contract or inaccordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown,, or that the disclosure was not contrary to any restriction imposed on behalf of the Crown;ii. that he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that the infor-mation in question was classified, or was of a kind protected by theOfficial Information Act (see paragraph 221 c).c. This offence should also cover a person entrusted with official information in confidence by a Crown servant, with the modification that a. ii. and b. i. should refer to the purposes for which the information was entrustedand not to the purposes of the contract.d. The offences of failing to take reasonable care of official documents and information and failing to comply with directions for the return ordisposal of such documents (described in paragraph 222) should also apply to Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information in confidence.
THE DUTY OF THE CITIZEN229 Chapters 13 and 14 have discussed the duty of Crown servants andothers who are authorised to handle official information as part of their work.When information to which the Official fnformation Act applies is officiallyreleased, or is disclosed by a Crown servant or other person mentioned inthese Chapters in circumstances where its disclosure involves no breach ofthe law, that information enters the public domain. Any person may passit on or use it as he wishes. The present law, however, in section 2, specifiesa number of situations in which the citizen has a duty to protect official infor-mation. (We use the words &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;subject&quot; in this Chapter asconvenient though not strictly accurate expressions to describe all those withinthe jurisdiction, including those who are not citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies). These situations are summarised in paragraph 19. The mostimportant feature of section 2, as it affects the citizen, is that if he receivesofficial information communicated to him in contravention of the official secrets Acts, both the mere receipt and the further communication of that information may constitute an offence. An unauthorised disclosure of official information does not bring it into the public domain, and those who handleit may be liable to prosecution. The question we have now to consider is how far the Official Information Act should treat the citizen in this way.A secret is a secret230 A number of witnesses, especially from the news media, argued thatcriminal sanctions, if retained at all, should be confined.to those working inor with central government. They tended to agree that other persons might reasonably be placed under some obligation to protect matters of importance for national security, but not that they should have any duty going wider than this. These arguments related directly to the facts that section 2 catchesall official information of all kinds, and that it is not clear whether mens reais an ingredient of the offence of unauthorised communication contrary to section 2. We have proposed that the catch-all section 2 should be replaced by an Official Information Act which covers only that official information which it is most important to protect, and which makes clear the element ofmens rea in offences under the Act. These changes transform the wholecontext of the argument. Our general approach has been to identify thatofficial information which requires protection because it is genuinely secret.Whoever lets out such a secret, the same damage is done to the nation. Everycitizen who knowingly handles a secret of this kind ought to protect it. If a civil servant has failed to protect a secret, there is no justification for the viewthat a citizen who thereby comes into possession of that secret, and who knowsthat it is a secret, should be free to compound the failure of the civil servant,and to harm the nation, by passing on the secret as he pleases.
231 The difference between Crown servants and others is that a crown servant is handling State secrets of this kind as part of his job, and he hasa clear public duty to safeguard these secrets. If he acts in breach of thatduty, it is reasonable that this behaviour should of itself render him liableto criminal penalties as well as the disciplinary sanctions of the Service. the citizen has no comparable public duty. He should be under no legal liabilityunless he is aware that he has come into possession of a secret, or the circum-stances are such that he clearly ought to be aware of this. If the citizen knowsthat he is in possession of a secret but chooses nevertheless to disclose it, it is then reasonable that he should be liable to criminal penalties. The impositionof legal liability on the citizen is equitable, as well as being necessary for theprotection of the nation, on two conditions. The first is that the law shouldbe strictly confined to what is genuinely secret. The second is that it should clearly specify that the citizen must be proved to have had guilty knowledge.The simple receipt of official information232 A number of Departmental witnesses argued that in addition todisclosure by the citizen remaining an offence, mere receipt should also remainan&quot; offence. Many witnesses outside the Government argued strongly against this. They pointed out that if a citizen received official information which he knew he should not have been given, but which he could not honestly sayhad been given to him against his wishes, he was liable to prosecution underthe present law, even if he acted in a completely responsible way and revealedthe information to no one. They regarded this as indefensible and unnecessary.It was urged nevertheless by some Government witnesses that if simple receiptof official information ceased to be an offence, cases would sometimes arisewhere no other offence under the criminal law could be proved, and the recipient would escape the law even although he used the information forillicit purposes.233 We examined the scope of other relevant provisions of the criminal law, to see what gaps might be created if mere receipt was no longer an offence.These provisions comprise the law on corruption, the law on inciting, aiding,abetting, counselling or procuring offences, the law of conspiracy and our own proposals relating to the use of official information to assist criminal activitiesor impede law enforcement or for purposes of private gain. It seems to usunlikely that situations will arise in which it is clearly desirable to bring a prosecution against a recipient of official information, but in which none ofthese other legal provisions could be used. In any branch of the criminal law it is inevitable that situations will occasionally arise in which there are well-founded suspicions but a prosecution cannot be brought for lack ofevidence. Subsection (2) of section 2, which deals with simple receipt, has been little used in recent years. In no case since the war does it appear to have been used by itself; it has always been combined with a charge of incitement or ofunauthorised communication under section 2 (1). We propose that the merereceipt of official information should no longer be an offence.The scope and nature of the citizen &apos;s duty234 The considerations we have set out in paragraphs 230-1 apply toall the kinds of official information to which the Official Information Act applies,
except the confidences of the citizen. The object of using the criminal law to protect the confidences of the citizen is to maintain trust between theGovernment and the citizen. The aims of ensuring that Crown servantsprotect this information, and of assuring the citizen that it will be protected,can be adequately served if the criminal law applies only to those crown servants. Once information of this kind has leaked it is in any event difficultto keep track of it subsequently, and it would not be easy for the citizen torecognise this kind of information. In relation to this one category, therefore,there is no need for criminal sanctions to apply to persons other than crown servants. We have already explained in paragraphs 204-5 how the provisions on private gain should apply to the citizen.235 In relation to all other official information covered by the official information Act, the citizen should have a duty to protect that information.This duty is not a duty attaching to his job as a servant of the Crown, but theless exacting duty of a subject of the Crown. If he comes into possession ofinformation to which the Official Information Act applies, and subsequentlydiscloses that information, he should not be in peril of conviction unless the prosecution can show that he had mens rea in the sense that he knew, or hadreasonable ground to believe, that this information had come to him as a resultof a contravention of the law by a Crown servant, Government contractor or person entrusted with official information in confidence. If he has mens rea inthis sense, it should not matter whether the information came to him direct fromthe person who originally disclosed it in contravention of the law, or throughone or more intermediaries. Under section 2 of the 1911 Act, there can onlybe a &quot;chain&quot; of unauthorised communications, as described in paragraph 19 c,if each link in the chain commits an offence. Provided, however, that a citizencan be shown to have guilty knowledge that the original disclosure of theinformation involved a contravention of the law, it is immaterial whether ornot any links in the chain of communication also broke the law. The disclosure of the information by the citizen in such circumstances, without official per-mission, should be an offence.236 We propose that where a person knows, or has reasonable ground to believe,that information in his possession has been communicated (whether or not directly to him) in contravention of the Official Information Act (other than the provisions relating to the confidences of the citizen and private gain) it should be an offencefor him to communicate that information otherwise than in accordance with anauthorisation given on behalf of the Crown. The prosecution should have to prove (a) that there had been a contravention of the Act by some other person,and (b) that the information in question was still covered by the Act at the timewhen the accused communicated it, and (c) that the accused knew that the informa-tion had at some earlier stage been communicated in contravention of the Act,or that he had reasonable ground to believe that this was the case. The accusedshould have the defence that he believed, and had reasonable ground to believe,that he had communicated the information in accordance with an authorisationgiven on behalf of the Crown to him, or given to some other person but in termsapplicable to him. It should not be an offence to communicate information forthe purpose of obtaining such an authorisation or of delivering a document to aCrown servant or obtaining directions about its return or disposal.
Protection of secret documents237 Hitherto we have discussed the duty of the citizen to protect official information which he knows, or should know, has been improperly communicate-ated to him. Section 2 also contains provisions which place a duty upon the citizen who comes innocently into possession of certain limited kinds of official information. These provisions relate to information about secret code wordsand pass words, information about prohibited places, and information relatingto munitions of war. There is also a provision covering the use of official information for the benefit of foreign Powers or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State. These provisions are unclear. They areworded in a fashion no longer appropriate. They seem in practice to havebeen little if ever used. Nevertheless if secret documents in the field of defence and internal security, foreign relations, and the currency and the reserves, areto receive the necessary protection, then it seems to us reasonable that the oldprovisions we have mentioned should be replaced by provisions in modernform, designed to provide such protection. For instance such a documentmight come into a citizen&apos;s possession by accident, or by retrieving a crown servants brief-case left in a train. Provided that a document found in such circumstances is marked SECRET, and that the citizen is not liable to convictionif he genuinely does not realise that the disclosure of the document might seriously injure the nation, he should be under a duty to protect the document.We propose that any person coming innocently into possession of a document inone of the three categories described in paragraphs 124, 134 and 139 which is classified and marked SECRET should be prohibited from communicating that document to anyone except for the purpose of delivering it to a Crown servant orobtaining directions what to do with it. The citizen should have the defence thathe did not know, and had no reason to believe, that disclosure of the documentmight cause serious injury to the interests of the nation. The provisions aboutclassification proposed in paragraphs 149 and 157 should apply for the purposesof this offence, and no offence should be committed unless the document is proved to have been marked SECRET.The protection of information obtained by spying238 There is one provision of section 2 which should be retained andshould remain in the Official Secrets Acts. When information has beenobtained or communicated in contravention of section 1 of the 1911 Act, arecipient of that information who in turn passes it on without authority nowcommits an offence under section 2. It is essential to preserve this provision,so as to give continued protection to information useful to an enemy whichpasses into other hands after it has been obtained or communicated by a spyor traitor. The proper place for this provision remains the Official secrets acts. Since we propose the repeal of section 2, and its replacement by a newseparate Act, this one remaining provision might be added on to section 1.We propose that it should be an offence for any person who comes into possessionof information which he knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, has beenobtained or communicated in contravention of section 1 to communicate that information, except by handing it to a Crown servant or telling a Crown servantthat he has it.  As with the provision proposed in paragraph 236, it is immaterial
whether the person who communicated the information to the accused had himself contravened section 1 or whether that contravention had been com-mitted by someone earlier along the chain of communications.Retired persons239 We propose that where a person has come into possession of information to which the Official Information Act applies by virtue of his position as a crown servant, or a Government contractor or a person entrusted with that information in confidence, and has retired or otherwise ceased to be concerned with the mattersby reason of which he came into possession of the information, it should be an offence for him to communicate that information otherwise than in accordancewith an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown. He should have the defence that he believed, and had reasonable ground to believe, that he had communicatedthat information in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of theCrown to him, or given to some other person but in terms also applicable to him.
Part VTHE ENFORCEMENT AND OPERATION OF THEOFFICIAL INFORMATION ACTCHAPTER 16CONTROL OVER THE INSTITUTION OF PROSECUTIONS240 Ali prosecutions under section 2 require the consent of the attorney general, or in Scotland of the Lord Advocate. A control over the institution of these prosecutions is clearly essential as the law now stands, in view of thegreat width of the present section. We have mentioned in Chapter 3 someof the criticisms contained in the evidence concerning the Attorney GeneraFspresent role under section 2, and the fact that no similar criticisms were madeof the position in Scotland. These criticisms, and the suggestions for change,cannot sensibly be discussed except in the context of the general system for bringing prosecutions in England and Wales, the part which the Attorneyand the Director of Public Prosecutions play in this system, and the reasons why numerous statutes confer a control over the institution of prosecutionsupon one or the other. The position on these matters is described inparagraphs 241-5. Appendix VII gives further details, particularly about the statutes which confer control on the Attorney.The institution of prosecutions in England and Wales and the Attorney GeneraVsrole241 Any citizen may institute a criminal prosecution. Most prosecutionsare in practice brought by the police, though an appreciable number are brought by other public authorities, and by private firms for such offences as shoplifting.The Director of Public Prosecutions is under a general duty to give advice oncriminal matters, and prosecutes himself in cases of importance or difficulty.Neither he nor the Attorney General is, however, involved in the great majorityof criminal prosecutions.242 There is a considerable number of statutory provisions containingrestrictions on the bringing of prosecutions. These affect a relatively small part of the criminal law as a whole, and some of the offences concerned arerarely prosecuted. Many of these provisions take the form that a prosecutionmay be brought only by or with the consent of the Attorney General or theDirector of Public Prosecutions. The Director exercises his functions underthe general superintendence of the Attorney General, and the Attorney isanswerable in Parliament for the Director. Consultation between them is close and regular. In practice, the difference between a control over prosecutionsexercised by the Attorney General, and one exercised by the Director of public prosecutions, is that in the latter case the Director decides straightforward caseshimself without reference to the Attorney. He consults the Attorney on casesof special importance or difficulty irrespective of whether there is any legalrequirement to do so. The Attorney decides whether to consent to prosecution,in cases where he has that responsibility, only after he has received the Directorsadvice.
243 The Home Office explained to us that there are various reasons whycertain statutes include a control over the institution of prosecutions by the attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions. These are to secureconsistency of practice or to prevent abuse, where an offence is drafted inwide terms or is open to misuse; to enable account to be taken of mitigatingfactors which cannot easily be defined by statute; to provide central controlover the use of the criminal law in sensitive areas such as race relations orcensorship; and finally to ensure that decisions on prosecution take accountof important considerations of public policy or of a political or international character. The Home Office commented that this last reason applies, forinstance, to Official Secrets Act prosecutions and to hijacking, and that control over prosecutions introduced for this reason is normally thoughtappropriate to the Attorney General. Control over sensitive issues might go either to the Attorney or the Director of Public Prosecutions; the tendency in recent years has been to give a control introduced for the other reasons tothe Director.244 Some of the evidence which we received about the control over theinstitution of prosecutions under section 2 by the Attorney General treatedthe subject in isolation, almost as if he had no other functions relating to lawenforcement. In order to understand his role in relation to section 2, however,it is also important to understand that the office of Attorney General is unlikethat of other Ministers. He is the principal legal adviser to the Government,and may appear for the Crown in civil litigation. But in addition he hasimportant duties in connection with the enforcement of the criminal law.In exercising those duties he is wholly independent of the Government, and is responsible only to Parliament. He must not take orders from the PrimeMinister, nor from the Cabinet, and it would be improper for any Ministerto seek to bring pressure to bear upon him either to prosecute or not to prosecute.   The responsibility in such matters is his, and his alone.245 The Attorney General administers the criminal law in the interestsof the community as a whole, and he must disregard the interests of his party,and those of the Government as such. When deciding whether to authorise a prosecution he must consider whether the evidence is adequate; but inaddition he must take into account the effect of a prosecution on the interestsof the community. It may be that the effect of commencing proceedingswould prove more harmful to the public interest than would be the failure to prosecute a particular individual against whom there is adequate evidence.On the other hand, a prosecution might be beneficial to the public interest.These are factors which the Attorney General must take into account indischarging his duty.The Scottish position246 The position in Scotland is different. Prosecutions in Scotland forindictable offences are taken by or on behalf of the Lord Advocate. Summaryprosecutions are mainly brought, not by the police, but by the ProcuratorsFiscal, who are subject to the control of the Crown Office and the lord advocate.  There is no difference in the method of bringing prosecutions
between one kind of offence and another. Prosecutions under section 2 arenow controlled by the Lord Advocate both by virtue of the express provisionsof the 1911 Act and as part of his general control.The need for a control of prosecutions247 Even in cases where the institution of prosecutions is not controlled by the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, there is inevitably an element of judgment, going beyond the question whetheradequate evidence is available, in deciding whether to bring a prosecution.In cases of leakage of official information, the first step necessarily involves a preliminary investigation within the Government, and a decision taken early on whether the leak should be dealt with by disciplinary measures, or handedover to the appropriate authorities with a view to a possible criminal prosecution.The question for us is whether, in addition to the kind of control implicit inthis procedure, there should still be a further control exercised by the Attorneyor the Director at the final stage, when investigations have been completed.Our proposals will narrow down the law considerably compared with section 2,and there will not be the same clear need for a control over the institution of prosecutions which arises only because of the great width of the law. On theother hand the Official Information Act will operate in an area where questionsof public policy, or of a political or international character, are likely to arise.Offences under the Act, although defined more narrowly than in section 2,will still be cast in fairly wide terms. Cases may still arise where a technicaloffence appears to have been committed but the matter is not sufficientlyblameworthy to warrant prosecution. For instance a civil servant may clearly have overstepped the mark, but in circumstances where he could not be blamedvery severely for doing so. Cases are also likely to arise where there is a balance of public interest, in that there is a clear case for prosecution but theinstitution of a prosecution might have consequences adverse to the nation.Nearly all the evidence we received, even from those who proposed the drasticnarrowing of the law, took for granted that it would remain desirable to havea control over the institution of prosecutions.  We share that view.248 The offences we propose relating to law and order and private gainseem to us to raise no special considerations of the kind which in recent years have been regarded as pointing towards a control by the Attorney Generalrather than the Director of Public Prosecutions. Accordingly we proposethat the Director should exercise control in England and Wales in relation tothese offences. Offences affecting the confidences of the citizen may, however,well involve matters of considerable sensitivity, and they are of the kind whichthe Home Office thought might be controlled either by the Attorney or theDirector according to the particular views of Parliament. In view of the considerations of public policy arising in connection with the maintenance oftrust between the Government and the people, our own preference is for control by the Attorney General. In the case of information concerningdefence and internal security, foreign relations, and the currency and the reserves, and of Cabinet documents, there can be no doubt that the issues involved in deciding whether there should be a prosecution are of the kind which have always in the past been thought to require a control by the attorney general.
249 In our discussions with the present Attorney General and his legal secretary, with the last Attorney General, with the Director of Public Prosecu-tions, and with Sir Philip Allen and Sir William Armstrong, we found agreement among all these witnesses that the control over the institution of prosecutionsunder section 2 had in the past been operated satisfactorily and with integrity,that there were strong reasons for continuing the present system, and thatthere was no satisfactory alternative. The main point made by these witnesseswas that when a decision involves questions of public policy, or of a political or international character, it is essential that the person with responsibilityfor the decision should have experience of the kind of issues involved, and essential that he should be able to consult directly the Minister concernedwith the area of Government business in question so as to ensure that, before taking his decision, he is made fully aware of the views of the Government onany questions of national interest involved. No one except the attorney general fits this specification. A number of witnesses also stressed the factthat the Attorney General is accountable to Parliament for his decisions,and that this constitutes a real safeguard which would not be available if his present responsibility were transferred to anyone else.Criticisms of the present position and proposals for change250 The general criticisms which we received of the present position were of two broad kinds. First, it was said that the Attorney Generafs discretion in deciding whether to prosecute under section 2 is so wide that it is boundto appear arbitrary and selective. This criticism relates to section 2 in itspresent form. In our view it does not apply with the same force to the muchnarrower provisions which we propose. Secondly, it was suggested that thoseoutside governmental and Parliamentary circles cannot understand the positionof the Attorney General as, at one and the same time, a politician who is amember of the Government of the day, and a Law Officer of the Crown withlaw enforcement functions of a non-political character. They said that itmust be very difficult for an Attorney to divorce his political self from his lawenforcement role when acting in the latter capacity, and that, however success-fully he succeeds in doing so, it must appear to the outside world that he is acting as a member of the Government and not as a Law Officer.251 The weight of the evidence on these lines left us in no doubt that this feeling of unhappiness about the Attorney GeneraPs role exists among many people. The evidence which we obtained about the way in which this roleis actually exercised convinced us that these suspicions are not well founded.But it does appear that the long history of the Attorney General&apos;s office, andhis wider role in the system of law enforcement, are not widely known andunderstood. The essence of the Attorney General&apos;s function under the official secrets Acts is that he draws upon his political experience, and is able toobtain the views of the responsible Minister on the national interest, for thepurpose of exercising more efficiently his impartial law enforcement role.He is not influenced by party considerations in exercising this role.252 One suggestion put to us by several witnesses was that control overOfficial Secrets Acts prosecutions should be transferred to the Director of
Public Prosecutions, who is not a member of the Government. This solution would be unsatisfactory for two main reasons. First, the very fact that theDirector works outside the political field would make it more difficult for him to carry out the functions now exercised by the Attorney, which involvethe consideration of issues of a political character. Secondly, the Directoris in any event under the control of the Attorney, who is answerable in Parlia-ment for him. Thus the change would be more apparent than real: theseare precisely the kinds of case in which the Director would expect to consult the Attorney before taking a decision. A less common proposal, but oneequally subject to the first drawback, was that these decisions should be takenby a Judge in Chambers. In our view it is important that decisions whether to institute prosecutions should be clearly distinguished from decisions takenby courts. This is another reason why this second proposal would not be satisfactory.253 Lord Parker discussed with us the possibility that a special panelmight be set up to advise the Attorney General on the exercise of his respon-sibilities under the Official Secrets Acts. We found this idea attractive, butupon examination we came to the conclusion that it was open to objections.It raised the question.who is to have the ultimate responsibility for these decisions and who is to be accountable. The transfer of responsibility to a body which was not accountable to anyone would not be an improvement.The sharing of responsibility would be impracticable. The Attorney general would have to retain the ultimate responsibility, which means that he wouldnot necessarily follow the advice of his panel. Under our proposals, the main questions of public policy which arise are likely to involve disclosures relatingto defence, foreign relations or currency matters. The Attorney Generalmust be able to obtain views on the damage done by such a disclosure, andon the possible effects of a prosecution, from Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers, whohave the constitutional responsibility for these matters. Responsibility forexpressing views on these matters to the Attorney should not be transferredto some other body, accountable to no one. Apart from these objections,there would be a number of practical problems in seeking to give effect to thisproposal. We came to the conclusion that the arguments pointed towardsthe impracticability and danger of seeking to have the Attorney Generafspresent responsibility transferred or shared.254 In addition to the general criticisms mentioned in paragraph 250,we also received some particular criticisms concerning the case of the NigerianReport. The main criticism was that an unfair selection was made in pickingout the persons to be prosecuted. There was also an ancillary allegation thatthe police had been inhibited from properly investigating the involvement of another potential defendant. In any criminal prosecution where a numberof people are involved, there is likely to be a problem whether all should be prosecuted or only those who appear on the available evidence to have beenthose directly concerned. It is also not uncommon for prosecuting authoritiesto find themselves in a position where the evidence necessary to support a prosecution depends upon a potential defendant giving evidence for the Crown.It was not our job to conduct a detailed post mortem into this case, but allegation-tions of this kind were relevant to our general view about the role of the
Attorney General. We are satisfied from the evidence about the part played by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in this case that proper grounds existed for the decisions which they took, and that neither of them in any way inhibited the police from carrying out any investigationsthe police thought desirable.Control by the Attorney General and the Lord Advocate255 We propose that the institution of prosecutions under the official information Act relating to information in the fields of defence and internal security, foreign relations, the currency and the reserves, and the confidencesof the citizen, and to Cabinet documents, should be controlled by the attorney general. With the substantial narrowing of the law which we propose, someof the arguments for change based on the width of the present law will disappear.We have taken account of the considerable public unease which exists about thepresent situation, but we are satisfied that this unease is based upon appearanceand not reality. The point of central importance is that these decisions areirremediably decisions of a political nature, in that they are concerned with questions of public policy although not partisan advantage. Control by the attorney General is a safeguard, which has the effect of reducing and notincreasing the number of actual prosecutions. He alone is in a proper positionto exercise that control, and he is accountable to Parliament for the way inwhich he does so.256 In Scotland, the only effect of the express provision requiring theLord Advocate&apos;s consent to prosecutions under the Official Secrets Acts is toensure that no prosecution can take place under the Acts unless he has personallyconsidered the matter. But the other statutes which apply to Scotland aswell as to England and Wales, and which require the consent of the attorney general to prosecutions in England and Wales, are silent about prosecutionsin Scotland. We received no suggestions for changing the present positionin Scotland, and we think that, in view of the relationship between the official secrets Acts and the Official Information Act, the least confusing course willbe to provide that, where the institution of prosecutions under the latter is controlled in England and Wales by the Attorney General, it shall be controlledin Scotland by the Lord Advocate.
THE OPERATION OF THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACTAncillary provisions in the Official Secrets Acts to be applied257 The Official Secrets Acts contain a number of ancillary provisions which now apply to section 2 as well as to the other substantive provisions ofthe Acts. Some of these will still be needed in the Official Information Act,and might be applied rather than re-enacted in full in the new Act. Section of the 1911 Act confers power to arrest a person who is found committing an offence under the Official Secrets Acts, or who is reasonably suspected of having committed or attempted to commit such an offence, or of being about to commit it. Section 9 (1) empowers a Justice of the Peace to grant a searchwarrant where there are grounds for suspecting that an offence under the Acts hasbeen or is about to be committed. Some offences under the Official InformationAct will be serious ones, directly affecting the security of the nation, and it isimportant that adequate powers of this kind should continue to be available inthe interests of effective enforcement. Section 8 (3) of the 1920 Act deals withthe place of trial of offences, and section 8 (4) confers power for the trial, or part of the trial, to be heard in camera if proceedings in open court would beprejudicial to the national safety. We propose that sections 6 and 9 (1) of theOfficial Secrets Act 1911, and section 8 (3) and (4) of the Official Secrets Act 1920,should apply to offences under the Official Information Act.258 There are three other ancillary provisions in the Official Secrets Actswhich go further than the comparable provisions of the general criminal law.These special provisions can be justified for dealing with offences of espionage.In our view they are not justified for dealing with leakage, and they should notbe applied to offences under the Official Information Act.  They are: a. Section 7 of the 1911 Act, under which it is an offence to harbour aperson who has committed or is about to commit an offence under theOfficial Secrets Acts, or to allow any such persons to meet or assemblein premises, or wilfully to omit or to refuse to disclose to a policesuperintendent information about such a person. The more restrictedprovisions of the general criminal law on such matters are containedin the Criminal Law Act 1967, which makes it an offence to assist orconceal a person who has committed an offence for which a penaltyof five years&apos; imprisonment may be imposed, or to give certain kinds of false information to the police.b. Section 9 (2) of the 1911 Act, which empowers a police superintendentinstead of a magistrate to grant a search warrant in cases of great urgency requiring immediate action in the interests of the State.c. Section 7 of the 1920 Act, which deals with incitement to commitoffences under the Official Secrets Acts, and also makes it an offence
to do any act preparatory to the commission of such an offence. It isan offence under the general criminal law to incite, counsel or procureanother to commit an offence, or to aid or abet him to do so, or toattempt to commit an offence, but not to do an act preparatory.The extent of the Official Information Act259 Section 10 of the 1911 Act deals with the extent of the Official secrets acts. The Acts originally applied throughout Her Majesty&apos;s dominions.They now apply to the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan, and to other British possessions overseas. In addition to this, they applyto &quot;British officers and subjects&quot; everywhere in the world. We have interpretedour terms of reference as requiring us to consider the application of section in the United Kingdom and Islands, and its application to citizens of thiscountry and those in the service of the Crown elsewhere. Two questionsarise. The first is the territorial extent of the Official Information Act, and thesecond is its extra-territorial extent.260 The provisions of the Official Information Act relating to defence,foreign relations, the currency and the reserves, and Cabinet documents areof a kind which the Parliament at Westminster normally enacts for the UnitedKingdom and Islands as a whole. The new provisions relating to law and order,the confidences of the citizen and private gain would be within the competence of the other legislatures concerned. There was no suggestion in the evidence we received that section 2, or its successor provisions, should not apply through-out the United Kingdom and Islands. The United Kingdom Government will no doubt consult with the other authorities concerned about whether the wholeof the Official Information Act should apply in this way, or only those partsdealing with matters within the sole competence of the Parliament at westminster.261 The criminal law of this country generally applies to all persons withinthe jurisdiction, regardless of nationality or citizenship. In some circumstances the criminal law also applies to acts committed elsewhere. In the case of theprovisions of the Official Information Act on defence, foreign relations, the currency and the reserves, and Cabinet documents, it seems to us right that theservant of the Crown and the subject of the Crown should take with himeverywhere in the world his duty under the Act to protect secrets of the State.There may not be the same need for the other provisions of the Act to extendin this way to acts committed outside the United Kingdom and Islands. our attention was drawn to the fact that the meaning of the words &quot;British officers or subjects&quot; in section 10 of the 1911 Act may not now be wholly clear, owingto changes in British nationality law since 1911, although no serious problemsseem to have arisen in practice. We have not, however, considered in detail the overseas extent of the new provisions we propose. Section 10 of the 1911Act applies to the whole of the Official Secrets Acts, not just to section 2. Itwould cause confusion if the new provisions replacing section 2 contained adifferently worded provision on this subject. The international application of english criminal law is a complex subject, which the Law Commission for england and Wales are considering.  Although circumstances have changed
considerably since section 10 of the 1911 Act was enacted it seems to have operated well enough in practice. If the Law Commission^ examination ofthe extra-territorial application of the criminal law generally reveals a need for changes, these can be made as part of any wider changes recommended by theCommission.262 Subject to consultations with the other authorities concerned, and tothe outcome of the Law Commission^ study of the extra-territorial applicationof the criminal law, we propose that section 10 of the Official Secrets Act 1911should apply to the Official Information Act.Protecting the information of allies and partners263 Under section 2 information is &quot;official&quot; once it comes into the handsof a Crown servant or Government contractor in the course of his job, what-ever its original source. The position under the Official Information Actwill be the same. The Act will apply automatically to information coming to crown servants from other Governments and international organisations,without normally needing amendment in consequence of new international obligations or arrangements. This means that information entrusted to theUnited Kingdom Government by other Governments will be treated in exactly the same way as official information from British sources. The informationof our allies and our international partners will be safeguarded by the official information Act if it comes within one of the categories to which the newAct applies. If it does not come within these categories, it will be safeguardedin the same way as British official information outside the categories, by the discipline of the public service and the other methods described in Chapter 5.As we have said in paragraphs 109 and 118, we do not believe that our proposals will affect the reliability of the Diplomatic Service and the Home Civil Service,or involve any significant risks of increased leakage of information no longercovered by the criminal law. We were not required to consider the protectionof British official information by other Governments and by international organisations; this subject is outside the scope of United Kingdom criminal law and of section 2.264 We should mention that the Euratom Treaty contains an expressobligation to protect Euratom classified information. Section 2 does not wholly meet that obligation. The legislation relating to the European Com-munities which has been before Parliament contains a provision intended togive effect to this provision of the Euratom Treaty. Apart from the possible effect of this one Treaty provision, it does not seem that our proposals arelikely at present to be affected by United Kingdom membership of theEuropean Communities. So far as the United Kingdom has other expressinternational obligations to protect the information of allies and partners,we understand that these require us to protect that information in the same way as our own, and not to give it protection by criminal sanctions when wedo not do so for our own information. We do not wish the repeal of section 2,and its replacement by narrower provisions, to put the United Kingdom in breach of any international obligation. It is our understanding that our proposals will not do so.
265 There may, however, be one gap. In a modern military alliance amember State does not normally rely entirely upon military weapons andequipment produced in its own country. Under our proposals for the official information Act, as under section 2, if-an ally or an international defence organisation places a contract direct with a British firm the Act will not applyeven if a British Government contract for the same equipment would be covered by the Act. There may be a case for considering how far the sameprotection could and should be given, under the Official Information Act,in relation to defence contracts placed by allied Powers as the law gives tocontracts placed by the British Government.Penalties266 Section 8 of the Official Secrets Act 1920 provides that a person guilty of an offence under section 2 shall be liable on conviction on indictment to not more than two years&apos; imprisonment, or on summary conviction to notmore than three months&apos; imprisonment or to a fine not exceeding  50 or to both. We received no evidence relating to the adequacy or otherwise of thesepenalties. It is, however, obvious that the appropriate maximum fine for an offence changes in a way that the appropriate maximum terms of imprisonmentdo not.267 Section 8 of the 1920 Act provides nothing about fining a personconvicted under section 2 on indictment. We regard the maximum fine on summary conviction of  50 as now clearly inadequate. The Criminal LawAct 1967 provides that, where a higher court has power to impose a sentence of imprisonment (as under section 8 of the 1920 Act) it may, unless there isan express provision to the contrary, impose a fine of any amount instead ofor as well as a sentence of imprisonment. The Magistrates&apos; Courts Act 1952,as amended, provides that the maximum fine which a magistrates&apos; court mayimpose for an indictable offence is  400. These two general provisions are quite widely followed in modern legislation creating offences triable either on indictment or summarily. We see no special reason why the level of finesunder the Official Information Act should differ from the current generally accepted levels. We accordingly propose that there should be an unlimitedpower to impose a fine on conviction on indictment, and that the maximum fineon summary conviction should be  400.268 The most serious offences under the Official fnformation Act will becomparable in their gravity to the most serious offences under section 2 ofthe 1911 Act. On several occasions since the war the maximum sentenceunder section 2 has been imposed. We have no doubt that offences sufficientlyserious to warrant imprisonment for two years may arise under the official information Act. It would be wrong for us to propose any increase in thismaximum in the absence of any evidence of inadequacy or other reason for doing so. No such evidence or reason was presented to us. We proposethat the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment of an offence under theOfficial Information Act should be two years&apos; imprisonment.269 Where a magistrates&apos; court has power to try an indictable offence,it has power in many cases to impose up to six months&apos; imprisonment.  Given
the seriousness of some offences under the Official Information Act, and thefact that such offences may merit up to two years&apos; imprisonment on convictionon indictment, we think that six months, rather than three, is an appropriatemaximum for offences under the Official Information Act. Where a person is tried summarily for an offence carrying a maximum penalty of six months&apos;imprisonment, he has the right to claim trial by jury. We see no reason whythose brought before a court of summary jurisdiction under the new Actshould not have this right. We propose that the maximum term of imprisonmenton summary conviction of an offence under the Official Information Act shouldbe six months&apos; imprisonment, with the two exceptions mentioned in the nextparagraph.270 A catch-all section cannot differentiate between different kinds ofoffence of differing degrees of gravity. The main new offences which we propose will all be of a kind which can be serious, meriting up to two years&apos;imprisonment. Two of these offences, however, are less serious. In para-graph 222 we recommend that the careless handling and improper retentionof official documents covered by the Official Information Act should be an offence, and in paragraph 237 we recommend that the private citizen shouldbe under a duty to protect secret documents relating to defence and internal security, foreign relations, and the currency and the reserves. For these twooffences we think that summary proceedings with lighter penalties should be adequate. We propose that these two offences should both be summary offencesonly, with a maximum penalty of three months&apos; imprisonment or a fine of  400or both.271 Offences under section 1 of the 1911 Act carry a maximum of fourteenyears&apos; imprisonment. The new provisions which we propose in paragraph 238will be added to section 1 and will relate to information obtained as a resultof espionage. Under the present law, however, offences against these provisions would be dealt with under section 2. The transfer to section 1 of this partof section 2 affords no reason for increasing the existing maximum penalties.We propose that the maximum penalties under the new provisions in section 1should be the same as those we recommend for the Official Information Act.
Part VIOUR PROPOSALSCHAPTER 18272 In previous Parts of this Report we have explained the facts andconsiderations lying behind our proposals, setting out each specific proposalat the appropriate point in the argument. This Part re-states these proposalswithout repeating the reasons for them.273 Our purpose has been to devise legislative provisions to take theplace of section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 which would be more limited and certain in operation. The practicability of doing this, which some of our witnesses doubted, could only be tested by working out our proposals in specific detail.  We have done this; it was inherent in the nature of our task.274 We start this Chapter with a broad description of the effect of our proposals as a whole. Then each specific proposal is set out in turn, and thenumbers of the paragraphs giving the reasons for it are indicated in brackets.THE GENERAL EFFECT OF OUR PROPOSALS275 Our main conclusion is that the present law is unsatisfactory, andthat it should be changed so that criminal sanctions are retained only to protectwhat is of real importance.276 Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 should be repealed, and replaced by a new statute, called the Official Information Act, which should apply only to official information which a. is classified information relating to defence or internal security, or toforeign relations, or to the currency or to the reserves, the unauthorised disclosure of which would cause serious injury to the interests of thenation; orb. is likely to assist criminal activities or to impede law enforcement;orc. is a Cabinet document; ord. has been entrusted to the Government by a private individual orconcern.The Act should contain safeguards relating to the classification of informationof the kinds mentioned in a. above.
277It should be an offence under the Official Information Act a. for a Crown servant to communicate information to which the Actapplies, contrary to his official duty;b. for a Government contractor or a person entrusted with official information in confidence to communicate information of one of the kinds in paragraph 276 a., b. and c, otherwise than for the purposesof the contract or for which it was entrusted;c. for any person to communicate information of one of the kinds inparagraph 276 a., b. and c, which he knows, or has reasonable groundto believe, has reached him as the result of a contravention of theOfficial Information Act;d. to communicate or use official information of any kind for purposesof private gain.Prosecutions should require the consent of the Attorney General in the caseof information of the kinds mentioned in paragraph 276 a., c. and d., andof the Director of Public Prosecutions in the case of b. and of private gain.SPECIFIC PROPOSALS278The replacement of section 21 Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 should be repealed, and replaced by narrower and more specific provisions.(Chapter 7, i.e. paragraphs 88-100.)2 The new provisions which we recommend, in place of section 2, should form a separate statute, to be known as the Official Information Act.(Paragraphs 101-3.)Information to which the Official Information Act should apply: defence, foreign relations, currency.3 Defence and internal security. The Official Information Act should applyto official information relating to matters which concern or affect thedefence or security of the realm, including in particular those mattersset out in the subparagraphs below. Information relating to the defenceor security of allied Powers, covering matters of the kind mentioned insubparagraphs a. to f. (but not g.), should be included in this category: a. the Armed Forces of the Crown and matters relating thereto;b. military weapons, stores and equipment of all kinds, includingnuclear weapons, ships, aircraft, vehicles, communications systems and all means of warfare;c. the research, development and production of all items covered by b.;
d. defence policy and strategy and other military planning, includingplans and measures for the maintenance of essential supplies and services in the event of war;e. intelligence and security services, and information obtained by them;f . military treaties and arrangements with other Powers, and negotiationsof such treaties and arrangements;g. internal defence and security, and plans and measures relatingthereto, including plans and measures for the maintenance andrestoration of public order or of essential supplies and services incontingencies short of war.(Paragraphs 122-5.)4 Foreign relations. The Official Information Act should apply to official information relating to any matters which concern or affect foreign relations or the conduct of foreign relations. By &quot;foreign relations&quot; wemean the relations between the United Kingdom Government and anyother Power or any international body the members of which aregovernments.(Paragraphs 126-134.)5 Currency and the reserves. The Official Information Act should applyto official information relating to any proposals, negotiations or decisionsconnected with alterations in the value of sterling, or relating to the reserves, including their extent or any movement in or threat to them.(Paragraphs 135-9.)Provisions on classification6 The Official Information Act should apply to official information withinthe three categories described in proposals 3, 4 and 5 above if it has beenclassified, in accordance with the provisions of proposal 7 below, on theground that its unauthorised disclosure would cause at least serious injury to the interests of the nation. The prosecution should have to satisfy thecourt that the information fell within a category, and that it was so classified,but the court should not be concerned with the effect of the disclosure onthe interests of the nation.(Paragraphs 147-9.)7 The Official Information Act should contain the following further provisions on classification: a. information should count as &quot;classified&quot; within the meaning of theAct if-i. in the case of a document, it is marked with the word SECRETor words including the word SECRET, or it relates to militaryweapons or equipment (as defined in proposal 3 b. and c.) andit is marked DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, and in either case it has been classified in accordance with the provisionsof the Act and of regulations on classification made under it;
ii. in the case of a communication by non-documentary means,the information relates to the contents of a document which is classified in accordance with i., or is information which, if ithad been contained in a document, ought to have been soclassified.b. The Secretary of State should make regulations about the classificationand declassification of documents, which should include provisions on levels of authority at which decisions on classification may betaken and on arrangements for review and declassification.c. The unauthorised removal of a classification mark, or the making of a copy of a classified document without the mark, should not affect the classified status of that document.(Paragraphs 150-7.)8 Before a decision is taken whether to institute a prosecution for the disclosure of classified information within one of the three categories, there should bea review of the classification of the information which had allegedly been disclosed without authority. This review should be carried out by the responsible Minister himself. He should be required to consider whether,at the time of the alleged disclosure, that information was properly classifiedSECRET or above or DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, in the sense thatits unauthorised disclosure would cause serious injury to the interests ofthe nation. If he was not satisfied on this point, then no prosecutionwould be possible. If he was satisfied, he should give a certificate to that effect to the court. This certificate should be conclusive evidence of thefact that the information was classified within the meaning of the Act.All other ingredients of the offence should be proved by evidence in theusual way.(Paragraphs 158-161.)9 The Government, and the representatives of the news media and of anyother interests directly affected, should enter into discussions with aview to the establishment of an informal Committee on classification ofthe kind outlined in paragraphs 165-6 of the Report.(Paragraphs 163-6.)Other information to which the Official Information Act should apply10 Maintenance of law and order. The Official Information Act should applyto official information (including police, prison and Post Office information)which comes within one of the three following descriptions: a. it is likely to be helpful in the commission of offences;b. it is likely to be helpful in facilitating an escape from legal custody orother acts prejudicial to prison security;c. its disclosure would be likely to impede the prevention or detectionof offences or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.(Chapter 10, i.e. paragraphs 170-5.)
11 The Cabinet. The Official Information Act should apply to cabinet documents, that is, documents submitted for the consideration of theCabinet and documents recording the proceedings or conclusions of theCabinet, irrespective of subject matter. &quot;Cabinet&quot; for this purpose includescommittees of the Cabinet the members of which are Ministers. cabinet documents to which the Act applies should be marked in a mannerprescribed by the Secretary of the Cabinet. The Act should provide that the communication of a Cabinet document means either the trans-mission of that document or a substantial part of it, or the communication of information about the document by other means which enable another person to reproduce the document or a substantial part of it in verbatim orvirtually verbatim form. The provisions in proposal 7 c. about theremoval of a classification mark, or the making of a copy of a classifieddocument without the mark, should apply also to Cabinet marks.(Paragraphs 182-190.)12 The confidences of the citizen. The Official Information Act should apply to information given to the Government by private individuals or concerns, whether given by reason of compulsory powers or otherwise,and whether or not given on an express or implied basis of confidence.(Paragraphs 192-200.)13 Official information used for private gain. The Official Information Actshould contain the following provisions, which would in effect form anextension of the existing law on corruption: a. It should be an offence for a Crown servant, contrary to his officialduty, to use official information for the purpose of obtaining privategain for himself or any other person, or to communicate the informa-tion to any other person with a view to enabling that person or anyother person to obtain private gain. &quot;Private gain&quot; means themaking of a gain, or the avoidance of a loss, in money or money&apos;sworth.b. This offence should also cover-i. a Government contractor who uses or communicates official information for private gain, otherwise than for the purposes ofthe contract;ii. a person entrusted with official information in confidence, whouses or communicates that information for private gain, otherwise than for the purposes for which it was entrusted.c. It should be an offence for a recipient of official information, whichhe knows or has reasonable ground to believe has been disclosed bya Crown servant contrary to his official duty, or by a Governmentcontractor or person entrusted with official information in confidencecontrary to b. above, to use that information for the purpose ofobtaining private gain for himself or for another.(Paragraphs 201-5.)
Who should be liable to prosecution14  The Official Information Act should place the primary duty to protectofficial information to which it applies upon: a. Ministers of the Crown;b. members of the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service;c. members of the Armed Forces;d. members of police forces;e. members of the Atomic Energy Authority and the Post Office;f. persons employed by or serving under the direction or control ofany of the above classes, and members of the legal profession acting for the Crown or for the police in bringing prosecutions;g. former members of any of the above classes.(Paragraphs 208-215.)Crown servants15 It should be an offence for a Crown servant to communicate information to which the Official Information Act applies, contrary to his official duty.(Paragraphs 216-7.)16 In relation to prosecutions of serving Crown servants for the offence inproposal 15, the Official Information Act should provide as follows: a. The prosecution should have to prove that the Crown servant haddisclosed information to which the Official Information Act applies,contrary to his official duty.b. The Crown servant should have the defence that he believed, andhad reasonable ground to believe, that he was not acting contraryto his official duty.c. The Crown servant should also have the defence that i. in the case of classified information relating to defence orinternal security, or foreign relations, or the currency or the reserves, he did not know, and had no reason to believe, thatit was classified;ii. in the case of an offence of disclosing a Cabinet document, or information covered by our proposals on the maintenance oflaw and order and the confidences of the citizen, he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that it was such a document,or was information of one of the kinds specified in proposals 10and 12.(Paragraphs 218-221.)17 Failure by a Crown servant to take reasonable care of an official documentor information to which the Official Information Act applies, or failure to comply with directions given on behalf of the Crown about the returnor disposal of such a document, or the retention of such a documentcontrary to his official duty, should be offences.(Paragraph 222.)
Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information inconfidence18 a. It should be an offence for a Government contractor to discloseinformation to which the Official Information Act applies (otherthan the confidences of the citizen) and which has come into his possession owing to his position as a Government contractor if i. the provisions of the Act have been drawn to his attention as applying to that information or that kind of information; and ii. the disclosure is not made for the purposes of the contract or inaccordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown,or it is made contrary to restrictions imposed on behalf of theCrown.b. A person charged with this offence should have the defences i. that he believed, and had reasonable ground to believe, thathe had disclosed the information for the purposes of the contract,or in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of theCrown, or that the disclosure was not contrary to any restrictionimposed on behalf of the Crown;ii. that he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that theinformation in question was classified, or was of a kind protected by the Official Information Act (see proposal 16 a).c. This offence should also cover a person entrusted with official information in confidence by a Crown servant, with the modificationthat a. ii. and b. i. should refer to the purposes for which the infor-mation was entrusted and not to the purposes of the contract.The offences of failing to take reasonable care of official documents and information and failing to comply with directions for the returnor disposal of such documents (see proposal 17) should also applyto Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information in confidence.14, i.e. paragraphs 223-8.)d.(ChapterThe duty of the citizen19  The mere receipt of official information should no longer be an offence.(Paragraphs 232-3.)20 Where a person knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, that informa-tion in his possession has been communicated (whether or not directly to him) in contravention of the Official Information Act (other than theprovisions relating to the confidences of the citizen and private gain) itshould be an offence for him to communicate that information otherwise than in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown.The prosecution should have to prove (a) that there had been a contra-vention of the Act by some other person, and (b) that the information inquestion was still covered by the Act at the time when the accused com-municated it, and (c) that the accused knew that the information had atsome earlier stage been communicated in contravention of the Act, or
that he had reasonable ground to believe that this was the case. the accused should have the defence that he believed, and had reasonableground to believe, that he had communicated the information in accord-ance with an authorisation given on behalf of the Crown to him, or givento some other person but in terms applicable to him. It should not bean offence to communicate information for the purpose of obtaining suchan authorisation, or of delivering a document to a Crown servant orobtaining directions about its return or disposal.(Paragraphs 230-1 and 234-6.).21 Any person coming innocently into possession of a document in one of thethree categories described in proposals 3-5 which is classified and markedSECRET should be prohibited from communicating that document to anyone except forthe purpose of delivering it to a Crown servant or obtainingdirections what to do with it. The citizen should have the defence thathe did not know, and had no reason to believe, that disclosure of the document might cause serious injury to the interests of the nation. Theprovisions about classification in proposals 7 and 8 should apply for thepurposes of this offence, and no offence should be committed unless the document is proved to have been marked SECRET.(Paragraph 237.)22 It should be an offence under the Official Secrets Acts for any person whocomes into possession of information which he knows, or has reasonableground to believe, has been obtained or communicated in contravention of section 1 of the 1911 Act to communicate that information, except byhanding it to a Crown servant or telling a Crown servant that he has it.(Paragraph 238.)23 Where a person has come into possession of information to which theOfficial Tnformation Act applies by virtue of his position as a crown servant, or a Government contractor or a person entrusted with that information in confidence, and has retired or otherwise ceased to be concerned with the matters by reason of which he came into possessionof the information, it should be an offence for him to communicate that information otherwise than in accordance with an authorisation given onbehalf of the Crown. He should have the defence that he believed, andhad reasonable ground to believe, that he had communicated that infor-mation in accordance with an authorisation given on behalf of the crown to him, or given to some other person but in terms also applicable to him.(Paragraph 239.)Control over the institution of prosecutions24 No prosecution should be brought in England and Wales for an offence under the Official fnformation Act relating to law and order (see proposal 10)or private gain (see proposal 13) except by or with the consent of theDirector of Public Prosecutions.(Chapter 16, paragraphs 240-8.)
25 No prosecution should be brought for an offence under the Official Infor-mation Act relating to defence and internal security (see proposal 3),foreign relations (see proposal 4), the currency or the reserves (seeproposal 5), a Cabinet document (see proposal 11) or the confidences ofthe citizen (see proposal 12) except by or with the consent of the attorney general, or of the Lord Advocate in Scotland.(Chapter 16, i.e. paragraphs 240-256.)Ancillary provisions and penalties26 Sections 6 and 9 (1) of the Official Secrets Act 1911, and section 8 (3) and(4) of the Official Secrets Act 1920, should apply to offences under theOfficial Information Act.(Paragraph 257.)27 Subject to consultations with the other authorities concerned, and to the outcome of the Lav/ Commission^ study of the extra-territorial applicationof the criminal law, section 10 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 should apply to the Official Information Act.(Paragraphs 259-262.)28 The maximum penalties on conviction on indictment of an offence underthe Official Information Act should be two years&apos; imprisonment, or a fine with no limit on the amount, or both. The maximum penalties on summary conviction for such an offence, other than one of the offencesmentioned in proposal 29, should be six months&apos; imprisonment, or a fine of  400, or both.(Paragraphs 266-9.)29 The offences of mishandling official documents (see proposal 17) and of failing to protect SECRET documents (see proposal 21) should be summaryoffences only, with a maximum penalty of three months&apos; imprisonment ora fine of  400 or both.(Paragraph 270.)30 The maximum penalties for the offence of communicating information which has been obtained or communicated in contravention of section 1of the 1911 Act (see proposal 22) should be the same as those in the official information Act (see proposal 28).(Paragraph 271.)
THE PRINCIPAL STATUTORY PROVISIONS : WHAT THEY SAY and what THEY mean a. SECTION 1 OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1911 AND SECTION 2OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1920Text of section 1 of the 1911 Act (as amended)&quot;Penalties (1) If any person for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interestsfor spying of the State (a) approaches, inspects, passes over, or is in the neighbourhood of, or entersany prohibited place within the meaning of this Act, or(b) makes any sketch, plan, model, or note which is calculated to be or mightbe or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy; or(c) obtains, collects, records or publishes or communicates to any other personany secret official code word or pass word, or any sketch, plan, model,article, or note, or other document or information which is calculated tobe or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy;he shall be guilty of an offence.(2) On a prosecution under this section it shall not be necessary to show that the accused person was guilty of any particular act tending to show a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, and, notwithstanding that no such act is provedagainst him, he may be convicted if, from the circumstances of the case, or his conduct,or his known character as proved, it appears that his purpose was a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State; and if any sketch, plan, model, article, note,document, or information relating to or used in any prohibited place within the meaning of this Act or anything in such a place, or any secret official code word or pass word,is made, obtained, collected, recorded, published or communicated by any person other than a person acting under lawful authority, it shall be deemed to have beenmade, obtained, collected, recorded, published, or communicated for a purposeprejudicial to the safety or interests of the State unless the contrary is proved.&quot;Text of section 2 of the 1920 Act&quot;Communications (1) In any proceedings against a person for an offence underwith foreign section 1 of the principal Act, the fact that he has been in corn-agents to be munication with, or attempted to communicate with, a foreignevidence of com- agent, whether within or without the United Kingdom, shall bemission of evidence that he has, for a purpose prejudicial to the safety orcertain offences    interests of the State, obtained or attempted to obtain information which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy.(2) For the purpose of this section, but without prejudice to the generality of theforegoing provision (a) a person shall, unless he proves the contrary, be deemed to have been in communication with a foreign agent if (i) he has, either within or without the United Kingdom, visited the addressof a foreign agent or consorted or associated with a foreign agent; or
(ii) either within or without the United Kingdom, the name and address ofor any other information regarding a foreign agent has been found inhis possession, or has been supplied by him to any other person, or hasbeen obtained by him from any other person;(b) the expression &apos;foreign agent&apos; includes any person who is or has been or is reasonably suspected of being or having been employed by a foreign Powereither directly or indirectly for the purpose of committing an act, eitherwithin or without the United Kingdom, prejudicial to the safety or interestsof the State, or who has or is reasonably suspected of having, either withinor without the United Kingdom, committed, or attempted to commit, suchan act in the interests of a foreign Power;(c) any address, whether within or without the United Kingdom, reasonablysuspected of being an address used for the receipt of communicationsintended for a foreign agent, or any address at which a foreign agent resides,or to which he resorts for the purpose of giving or receiving communications,or at which he carries on any business, shall be deemed to be the addressof a foreign agent, and communications addressed to such an address tobe communications with a foreign agent.&quot;Notes on section 11. Unlike section 2 of the 1911 Act, section 1 is not limited to official information,though in practice most information which it covers is official. Offences undersection 1 are, however, limited in two ways which make it much narrower than thecatch-all section 2. First, no action can constitute an offence under section 1 unless it was done &quot;for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State&quot;.Second, an offence under section 1 must involve either a prohibited place (see sub-section (1) (a)) or material which is &quot;calculated to be or might be or is intended tobe directly or indirectly useful to an enemy&quot; (see subsection (1) (b) and (c)).2. The words &quot;purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State&quot; involvea subjective test. These words are not directed to the actual or potential effect ofthe defendants action, but to his intention. Subsection (2), and section 2 of the 1920Act, then specify certain objective factors which may constitute evidence of this intention. Subsection (2) provides that the inference may be drawn, from the circum-stances of the case, or from the defendants conduct, or from his known character as proved, that his purpose was a purpose prejudicial. It also provides that, in thecase of information relating to a prohibited place or a secret official code word orpass word, if the defendant was not acting under lawful authority, he shall be deemedto have acted for a purpose prejudicial unless he proves the contrary.3. Section 2 of the 1920 Act provides that the fact that a defendant in a prosecutionunder section 1 of the 1911 Act has been in communication or attempted communica-tion with a foreign agent shall be evidence that he has, for a purpose prejudicial tothe safety or interests of the State, obtained information which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be useful to an enemy. In most section 1 cases there is evidence of such communication.4. Section 1 operates in peace as well as in war because &quot;enemy&quot; includes a potential enemy. An enemy, in this sense, may find a wide range of official information useful.The communication of information to a potential enemy is evidence of its possible use to him.5. The general effect of these two tests the &quot;purpose prejudicial&quot;, and use to anenemy is that section 1 covers those offences popularly regarded as spying. Thesection does not touch the communication or publication of official information ofother kinds or for other purposes.
B. SECTION 2 OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1911Text of section 2 of the 1911 Act (as amended)&quot;Wrongful (1) If any person having in his possession or control any secretcommunication official code word, or pass word, or any sketch, plan, model,etc. of article, note, document, or infoimation which relates to or isinformation used in a prohibited place or anything in such a place or whichhas been made or obtained in contravention of this Act, or whichhas been entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office under her majesty or which he has obtained or to which he has had access owing to his positionas a person who holds or has held office under Her Majesty, or as a person who holdsor has held a contract made on behalf of Her Majesty or as a person who is or hasbeen employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract (a) communicates the code word, pass word, sketch, plan, model, note, document,or information to any person, other than a person to whom he is authorisedto communicate it, or a person to whom it is in the interest of the State his duty to communicate it; or(aa) uses the information in his possession for the benefit of any foreign power or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State;(6) retains the sketch, plan, model, article, note, or document in his possessionor control when he has no right to retain it or when it is contrary to his duty to retain it, or fails to comply with all directions issued by lawful authority with regard to the return or disposal thereof; or(c) fails to take reasonable care of, or so conducts himself as to endanger the safety of the sketch, plan, model, article, note, document, secret officialcode or pass word or information;that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.(1a) If any person having in his possession or control any sketch, plan, model,article, note, document, or information which relates to munitions of war, communi-cates it directly or indirectly to any foreign Power, or in any other manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.(2) If any person receives any secret official code word, or pass word, or sketch,plan, model, article, note, document, or information, knowing, or having reasonableground to believe, at the time when he receives it, that the code word, pass word,sketch, plan, model, article, note, document, or information is communicated to him in contravention of this Act, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, unless he provesthat the communication to him of the code word, pass word, sketch, plan, model,article, note, document, or information was contrary to his desire.&quot;Notes on section 21. The main offence created by section 2 is committed by a person who, &quot;having in his possession any information which he has obtained owing to his position as aperson who holds office under Her Majesty or a contract on behalf of Her Majesty&quot;,&quot;communicates the information to any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it&quot;. In ordinary language, it is an offence undersection 2 (1) (a) for a Crown servant or Government contractor to make an unauthorised-rised disclosure of information which he has learnt in the course of his job. Theword &quot;communicates&quot; has its ordinary meaning. It covers the passing of a documentor other record, and the transmission of information orally. All kinds of informationare covered.   The section contains a list, several times repeated, which includes code
words, sketches, models, etc., but in each case this list ends with the all-embracingwords &quot;document or information&quot;. There is no limitation of subject matter; butsection 2 applies only to &quot;official information&quot;, in the sense described in notes 2and 3.2. The main class of information covered by section 2 (1) (a) is denned by referenceto two classes of persons. The first class comprises persons &quot;holding office under her Majesty&quot;. This includes not only civil servants and members of the diplomatic service, but also Ministers of the Crown, members of the Judiciary (from Judges ofthe Supreme Court to Justices of the Peace), members of the Armed Forces, police officers (by virtue of their office of constable) and others. By virtue of the definitionin section 12 of the 1911 Act it includes any office or employment in or under any department of the Government of the United Kingdom. Employees of the PostOffice and of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority are deemed by thePost Office Act 1969 and the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 respectively to beholders of an office under Her Majesty for this purpose. The above-mentionedpersons are for convenience described as Crown servants in this Report. Whethermembers and employees of public bodies on the fringes of central Government,and persons appointed by Ministers, are Crown servants for this purpose is in manycases unclear. The second class of persons specified in section 2 (1) (a) comprisesthose who hold a contract made on behalf of Her Majesty, and their employees.Former members of both classes are also covered.3. &quot;Official information&quot;, as we use the term in this Report, is information whicha Crown servant or Government contractor (in the sense explained in note 2) learnsin his capacity as such. The unauthorised communication of such information by such a person is an offence under section 2 (1) (a). A person who is in neither of these classes also commits an offence under section 2 (1) (a) if he makes an unauthorisedcommunication of official information which has been entrusted to him in confidenceby a Crown servant. The meaning of &quot;entrusted in confidence&quot; is not defined. these words may bring within the scope of section 2 (1) (a) a wide range of people, forinstance those involved in the outside consultations frequently undertaken by centralGovernment, which may be conducted in confidence.4. Note 3 has described offences under section 2 (1) (a) committed by those whoare properly in possession of official information. It is also an offence undersection 2 (1) (a) to make an unauthorised communication of information &quot;whichhas been made or obtained in contravention of this Act&quot;. Some uncertainty attaches to these words, since nothing in section 2 speaks of its being a contravention of thesection to make or obtain anything, whereas section 1 (1) (b) and (c) create offenceswhich use these words. The commonly accepted interpretation, however, is thatwhen official information has been communicated in contravention of section 2,the recipient commits an offence if he in turn communicates that information withoutauthority. This means that it is possible to have a chain of unauthorised communica-tions, each link in the chain committing an offence under section 2 (1) (a).5. A Crown servant or Government contractor does not commit an offence undersection 2 (1) (a) if he communicates official information to a &quot;person to whom he is authorised to communicate it, or a person to whom it is in the interest of the Statehis duty to communicate it&quot;. The Act provides no guidance on the interpretation of these words. The way in which they are in practice interpreted by Crown servantsis explained in paragraph 18 of the Report. In brief, implicit authorisation to discloseofficial information is regarded as flowing from the nature of each Crown servanfsjob. This interpretation can be adapted so as to apply to Government contractors and persons entrusted with official information in confidence. The meaning of thewords quoted above in relation to other persons is obscure.
6. Section 2 (1) (a) is concerned with the communication of official information,and section 2 (2) with its receipt. Section 2 (2) provides that, where a recipient of official information knows or has reasonable grounds to believe, at the time, that itscommunication to him constituted a breach of the Official Secrets Act, he is alsoguilty of an offence unless he proves that the communication to him was &quot;contraryto his desire&quot;. It is immaterial whether the recipient makes any use of the information.If he in turn communicates it, he may then commit an offence under section 2 (1) (a)(see note 4).7. There are a number of other offences under section 2, less important than thosediscussed in the notes above.(a) Under section 2 (1) (a), an offence is committed by a person possessing anysecret official code word or pass word, or any information relating to orused in a prohibited place, or anything in such a place, who communicatesit without authority. This offence is not restricted to the Crown servants and the other classes of person mentioned in notes 2 and 3. All persons are forbidden to pass on information about prohibited places, howeveracquired. Prohibited places are defined in section 3 of the 1911 Act, and include any defence &quot;establishment or station, factory, dockyard, mine,minefield, camp, ship or aircraft belonging to or occupied by or on behalfof Her Majesty or any telegraph, telephone, wireless or signal station oroffice&quot;. The Secretary of State has power to declare other places (such as public utilities) to be prohibited places on the ground that information about them would be useful to an enemy.ib) The other offences created by section 2 (1) (ad), (1) (b), (1) (c) and (1a) are relatively straightforward. Subsection (1) (ad) and subsection (1a), whichwere added by the 1920 Act, both include the words &quot;manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State&quot;, which gives them an affinity with section 1. The offence in subsection (1a), like that relating to prohibitedplaces, can be committed by any person who has information aboutmunitions of war in his possession, however he obtained it.C.   OTHER RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACTSThe 1911 ActSection 5 allows a court trying a person for a section 1 offence to find him guiltyinstead of one of the lesser offences under section 2.Section 6 provides a power to arrest any person who is found committing an offence under the Act, or who is suspected of having committed or of being about to commitsuch an offence.Section 7 makes it an offence for any person knowingly to harbour a person whohas committed or is about to commit an offence under the Act. The sidenote is&quot;Penalty for harbouring spies&quot;, but the section is not restricted to offences undersection 1.Section 8 provides that no offence under the Act shall be prosecuted except byor with the consent of the Attorney General, or in Scotland of the Lord Advocate.Section 9 gives a power to grant search warrants where an offence under the Actis suspected.
Section 10 applies the Act to all offences committed in any part of Her Majesty&apos;sdominions and to offences committed by British officers or subjects elsewhere.The 1920 ActSection 7 makes it an offence to attempt to commit any offence under the official secrets Acts, or to solicit or incite or endeavour to persuade another person to commitsuch an offence, or to aid and abet and do any act preparatory to the commissionof such an offence. The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that the second &quot;and&quot;in this section, which appears to have been a misprint, should be read as &quot;or&quot;.Section 8 provides the maximum penalties for offences under both Acts. A personguilty of an offence under section f of the f 911 Act is liable to fourteen years&apos; imprison-ment (and the court has a general power to impose a fine of any amount); undersection 2 the maximum term is two years (again with an unlimited fine in addition toor instead of imprisonment). There is also power, with the consent of the attorney general, to try section 2 cases summarily, when the maximum penalties are threemonths&apos; imprisonment or a fine of  50 or both. Section 8 also empowers the court to exclude the public from the trial of an offence under the Official Secrets Acts, ifthe prosecution apply for this on the ground that the publication of evidence wouldbe prejudicial to the national safety.   But sentence must be passed in open court./
OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT PROSECUTIONSThis Appendix gives details of prosecutions under section 2 of the 1911 Act and asummary of prosecutions under section 1. There is no comprehensive record ofsection 2 prosecutions during the period 1911-1945, and a selection of the known cases is given. The list of cases from 1945 onwards is based on information provided bythe Home Office and is believed to be complete.Prosecutions under section 21916 A War Office clerk regularly passed official information, some of it critical of senior War Office officials, to the Deputy Chairman of the publishers of the&quot;Military Mail&quot;. This was published in a column in the paper entitled&quot;Heard in Whitehall, by Mars&quot;. The case was heard in a magistrates&apos; court and both were sentenced to two months&apos; imprisonment. This seems to havebeen the first case taken under section 2 which involved the publication of official information in the press.1919 A War Office clerk passed information about contracts for army officers&apos;clothing to the director of a firm of tailors. Charges against both defendantswere dismissed by a Metropolitan Magistrate on the ground that this kind of official information was not within the scope of section 2. A Bill of indictmentwas preferred in order to test this view in a superior court, and Mr JusticeAvory held that section 2 applied to any information obtained by a personthrough his official position, rejecting a submission that only secret information was covered.  Both defendants were fined.1926 A retired Governor of Pentonville Prison wrote for a London evening news-paper a series of articles containing his reminiscences, in the course of whichhe disclosed statements made to him by a convicted murderer on the morning of his execution. During his trial at the Central Criminal Court a submissionthat section 2 must be limited to information which it was contrary to thepublic interest to disclose failed.  He was fined.1932 A clerk in the Principal Probate Registry gave a journalist information aboutcertain wills. The information was published in a daily newspaper on the morning of the day on which it was to be officially published. The case washeard in a magistrates&apos; court and both defendants were sentenced to imprison-ment, the clerk for six weeks and the journalist for two months. The attorney general himself appeared in court to argue against the journalists appeal against sentence.1933 An author included, in the manuscript of a book, confidential information to which he had had access as an officer in the Royal Marines while engaged on intelligence duties in Athens in 1916. He then communicated this manu-script to his publishers. He pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal court and was fined. Mr Justice Hawke commented that the advice which the author had received, to plead guilty, was inevitably right, as the section wasabsolute in its terms.1934 The son of a political leader was charged with receiving Cabinet memoranda,which he had used in writing a book about his father. He was convicted atBow Street magistrates&apos; court and fined. He could only have broken section 2,by receiving the documents, if they had been communicated to him in contra-vention of the section. His father was recognised as having given them tohim, but was not prosecuted.
1937 This case does not strictly belong to this list, because it was brought undersection 6 of the Official Secrets Act 1920. We include it here because it isconnected with section 2 and led to an important judicial decision on the scopeof section 2. The case concerned a journalist whose newspaper published a police document describing a wanted man. He was not charged with com-communicating an official document or with receiving it. He was prosecutedunder section 6 of the 1920 Act for failing to give information required inconnection with a suspected offence under the Act that is, for refusing toname his source when questioned by the police. (Partly in consequence ofthis case, section 6 was limited two years later to requiring information aboutoffences under section 1 of the 1911 Act.) The hearing was at a magistrates&apos;court, where the journalist was convicted and fined. He appealed to the divisional Court on a point of law, and it was this case (Lewis v. Cattle, 1938)which established that police officers hold office under Her Majesty for thepurposes of section 2.1945 A civil servant handed to a ships&apos; broker official information about the disposalof tanker tonnage by allied Governments during the war. Magistrates&apos;court hearing; both were fined.1946 Charges were brought against two defendants, relating to a publication statingthat one of them had been employed by British Military Intelligence.Magistrates&apos; court hearing; both fined.1948 A telephone operator passed information about police activities to a journalist.Magistrates&apos; court hearing; both were fined.1951 Three young men, two of them employed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment,kept each other supplied with details of aircraft under production. Magistrates&apos;court hearing; all were fined.1951 Charges were brought against the author of a book, not yet published, which contained copies of official documents retained by him. The charges were withdrawn when the documents were returned and publication not proceeded with.1956 A police officer and his female accomplice were charged under section 2 withcommunicating and retaining police records. Related activities gave risealso to charges of conspiracy to procure abortions and conspiracy to pervertthe course of justice. After a trial at the Central Criminal Court the policeofficer was sentenced to a total of four years&apos; imprisonment, and his accomplicewas placed on probation.1956 A photographer unlawfully retained a sketch used in a prohibited place, an aircraft factory, and communicated it. Magistrates&apos; court hearing; six months&apos;imprisonment.1958 Two Oxford undergraduates published in &quot;Isis&quot; details of monitoring stationsacquired while they were on military service. Tried at the Central CriminalCourt; both sentenced to three months&apos; imprisonment.1958 An engineer involved in secret work under a Government contract tried to sellinformation to the press.  Tried at assizes; two years&apos; imprisonment.1961 A Royal Navy radio operator retained official documents and showed them toa friend.  Magistrates&apos; court hearing; fined and given one day&apos;s imprisonment.
1961 An Admiralty clerk retained official documents. Magistrates&apos; court hearing;fined.1962 A Centrat Office of Information official passed documents to an official ofthe Yugoslav Embassy. Tried at the Central Criminal Court; two years&apos;imprisonment. In the course of an appeal against sentence the Lord chief justice referred to the offence in section 2 as absolute.1966 A police officer passed on information about a proposed police search.Magistrates&apos; court hearing; fined.1966 An ex-royal Air Force officer retained classified documents. Magistrates&apos;court hearing; fined.1967 A Cabinet Office typist passed details of Cabinet documents to a man whopurported to be an intelligence agent. Tried at the Central Criminal Court.He received a total of five years&apos; imprisonment on four charges, and she receivedsix months&apos; imprisonment.1967 An ex-postman serving a sentence of imprisonment was alleged by fellowprisoners to have disclosed how a Post Office van could be robbed. Tried atassizes; acquitted.1968 A prison officer was alleged by prisoners to have sold them prison documents.Tried at assizes; acquitted.1968 A police officer passed on information about a mail van&apos;s run with a view toits robbery. Tried at assizes and also convicted of incitement to rob. Suspendedsentence of imprisonment.1968 A police cadet passed confidential police bulletins to a criminal. Magistratescourt hearing; suspended sentence of imprisonment.1968 A photoprinter at the Royal Aircraft Establishment sent classified documents to the Soviet Embassy.   Magistrates&apos; court hearing; fined.1969 A postman gave information enabling criminals to rob a post office. Triedat assizes; twelve months&apos; imprisonment.1970 A police officer offered to supply a criminal with information, the resultingproceeds of crime to be shared. Tried at assizes and also convicted ofcorruption and incitement to commit burglary. Total sentence of five years&apos;imprisonment.1971 A confidential report by the Defence Adviser at the British High Commissionin Lagos passed through a number of hands before being pubiished in a Sundaynewspaper. Two of the links in the chain, as well as the newspaper and itseditor, were tried at the Central Criminal Court. All the defendants wereacquitted.Prosecutions under section 1There have been twenty prosecutions under section 1 since 1946. These casesinclude all the major post-war spy trials. In eighteen of these cases the defendantswere convicted for passing information to a foreign Power-Russia in fourteen cases,Czechoslovakia in two, Poland and Iraq. In one case two defendants were convicted of conspiracy to commit a breach of section 1 by obtaining information on behalf
of the Russians, and one of the defendants was also convicted of an offence againstsection 1. In all these nineteen cases sentences of imprisonment were imposed,ranging from forty-two years (consecutive sentences on three counts) to three years.In one case the defendant was acquitted.In one other post-war case six defendants were convicted on charges of conspiringto commit a breach of section 1, by entering a prohibited place as part of a nucleardisarmament demonstration. Five were sentenced to eighteen months&apos; imprisonment,the sixth to twelve months./
LEAKAGE AND THE LAW: A BRIEF HISTORY OF SECTION 21. Chapter 4 describes briefly how section 2 came to be passed in its present form.The Chapter concentrates on why Governments introduced the Official Secrets acts of 1889, 1911 and 1920, and on the Parliamentary debates in these years, so far asthey related to section 2 and its predecessor. This Appendix takes the history furtherback into the nineteenth century, and up to the present day. In order to preservea continuous narrative, it repeats the historical material in Chapter 4, with a littlemore detail.Leaks of the nineteenth century2. Governments, and senior civil servants in particular, have been worried aboutunauthorised disclosures of official information of all kinds not just of defencesecrets since long before the first Official Secrets Act. Nearly 100 years ago, in1873, after a series of cases involving the use of official information by civil servantsfor journalistic purposes, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury wrote: &quot;Theunauthorised use of official information is the worst fault a civil servant can commit.It is on the same footing as cowardice by a soldier.   It is unprofessional&quot;.3. Some of the best-known nineteenth century examples concerned foreign affairs.For instance, in 1837 the Foreign Office took objection to the proposed publicationof Lord Wellesley&apos;s dispatches from Spain in 1809. The substance of these olddispatches was known, but the Foreign Office did not want to establish a precedentby sanctioning publication. Ten years later the Government wished to preventThe Times newspaper publishing Lord Castlereagh&apos;s correspondence at the congress of Vienna in 1815, but had no means of doing so. The Times upheld its decisionto publish in terms of &quot;the rights of the public&quot;, but implicitly conceded the Govern-ment&apos;s right to prevent the publication of such papers &quot;as often as their suppressionmay be presumed to be most expedient to the interests of the country&quot; a commentreflecting the tension between the needs of openness and of secrecy to which we refer in the opening paragraph of our Report.4. In 1878 Charles Marvin, a temporary copying clerk at the Foreign Office, gave the press details of a secret Anglo-Russian treaty concerning the Congress of Berlin.This case is sometimes looked upon as the cause of the first Official Secrets Act, thoughit was not. Marvin was charged under the Larceny Act 1861 with removing a docu-ment from a government office and with stealing the paper on which he had writtenthe information which he had passed to the newspaper; but although it was not in dispute that Marvin had passed information to the press, the charges were dismissedon the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the particular offencescharged.5. The Marvin case occurred ten years before the first Official Secrets Bill was introduced into Parliament. It was only one of many unauthorised disclosureswhich caused concern to Governments during the second half of the century. Theserelated not only to foreign affairs but also to such matters as the organisation of theExchequer and Audit Office, the premature disclosure of a possible pay rise for suburbanletter carriers, and the supply to the press in 1884 of General Gordon&apos;s proclamationbefore Members of Parliament had received their copies. Concern in governmentcircles about leaks of this kind persisted throughout the 1870s and 80s and wasreflected in three strongly worded circulars issued by the Treasury during this period.The first circular, issued in 1873, referred to these &quot;breaches of official confidence&quot;as &quot;offences of the very gravest character&quot; which caused &quot;extensive mischief bysowing suspicion and by discrediting the Service&quot;.  Officers guilty of such irregular
practices were threatened with dismissal. In 1875, following further leaks of official information to the press, another circular was issued, threatening with dismissal anyofficers who infringed the rule against unauthorised communications to the press.In 1884, after the premature leakage of General Gordon&apos;s proclamation mentionedabove, a third circular was issued, stressing that this rule was &quot;not confined to matterstill under discussion but includes also the unauthorised disclosure of matter finally decided upon&quot;. The three circulars of 1873, 1875 and 1884 were presented toParliament as a Command Paper.6. All this exhortation was apparently to little avail. Leaks continued. In 1887two incidents arose in quick succession which led to the decision to introduce thelegislation which became the Official Secrets Act 1889. One incident involved thepublication in the press of the text of the instructions to the Intelligence Departmentof the Royal Navy. In replying to a Parliamentary Question on the matter the FirstLord of the Admiralty described this leak as &quot;a grave breach of trust&quot;. The otherincident involved the sale by a dockyard draftsman of confidential tracings and designsof warships, possibly to a foreign Power. The draftsman, named Young Terry,was dismissed for betraying the trust reposed in him but could not be prosecutedas the law then stood. The First Lord told Parliament that a criminal law whichallowed someone like Young Terry to escape unpunished could not be regarded as satisfactory, and promised that consideration would be given to strengthening it.The preparation of legislation was started immediately, and an Official Secrets bill was introduced in 1888 but made no progress.The Official Secrets Act 18897. The first draft of what became the 1889 Act was entitled &quot;Breach of OfficialTrust Bill&quot;. This title reflected an important element underlying the concern which ministers and senior civil servants felt then (and feel now) about unauthoriseddisclosures of official information. It was not just the damage caused by leakswhich worried them: the fact that leaks took place indicated the presence in the publicservice of men who were deliberately disobeying instructions and thereby betrayingtheir trust, and who might make other, far more damaging, disclosures unless identifiedand dealt with. In subsequent drafts of this Bill, provisions on spying were pro-promoted above those on breaches of trust. The 1888 Bill, which was re-introduced in1889, was entitled &quot;Official Secrets Bill&quot;.8. This Bill became the Officiai Secrets Act 1889. It dealt with two distinct,though overlapping, problems: spying, covered by section 1, and breaches of officialtrust, covered by section 2. An offence was committed under this original section by a Crown servant, or by a Government contractor whose contract contained an obligation of secrecy, if he communicated official information &quot;corruptly or contraryto his officiai duty&quot; to a person to whom it &quot;ought not, in the interest of the state or otherwise in the public interest, to be communicated at that time&quot;. Thus thissection was in several respects narrower than section 2 of the 1911 Act. It established the principle that the communication of officiai information by a person in a positionof public trust was, in certain circumstances, amenable to the sanctions of the criminal law; but, although presented in terms of breach of trust, it was also in terms limitedto breaches which could be shown to be contrary to the public interest.9. The Parliamentary debates on this legislation were brief, but in the House ofCommons Members voiced criticisms which are remarkably similar to some currentcriticisms of section 2 of the 1911 Act. One Member expressed the fear that clause 2of the 1889 Bill might prevent the exposure of &quot;jobs&quot;. Another feared that it mightimpair Parliamentary control over Departments. This Member drew a distinctionbetween the interests of the State, the protection of which he saw as a proper objectof the criminal law, and the interests of Government Departments, which he did not.
An amendment was made to meet this point. A third Member forecast that the bill would be of &quot;no practical use&quot;, because the Government were only &quot;attacking the poor clerk&quot; and lacked courage to &quot;attack the real offenders the people who obtainsecrets and publish them for profit&quot;.The period between 1889 and 191110. Even the passage of legislation providing criminal sanctions as a means of protecting government information did not prove wholly effective. Nor were the1889 provisions on spying satisfactory. As early as 1896 the Government of the dayintroduced an abortive Bill to strengthen section 1 of the 1889 Act, and the questionof strengthening the law on spying was also considered by the Government on other occasions between then and 1911. Meanwhile section 2 of the 1889 Act provedunsuccessful in preventing leaks. For instance, in 1900 there was a premature leakageto the press of the Home Secretary&apos;s decision to authorise an increase in the pay ofthe Metropolitan Police. In 1908 the Government plucked up the courage which its predecessor had been accused of lacking in 1889. It introduced a Bill which containednot only provisions strengthening the law on spying, but also a clause prohibiting theunauthorised publication by any person of certain official information, if publicationwas not in the interests of the State. The strong representations against this clausemade by the press, and lack of Parliamentary time, led to the abandonment of this Bill.11. At about this time there was considerable concern about German espionage.A Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence reported to the ministers on the subject in 1909. This Report recommended legislation to strengthen section 1of the Official Secrets Act 1889, on lines already attempted in the abortive Bills of1896 and 1908. In the same year information about undelivered old age pensionbooks appeared in the press before it had been given to Parliament. The FinancialSecretary to the Treasury admitted to the House of Commons that inquiries had failedto reveal who was responsible for &quot;this serious breach of official regulations&quot;. A yearlater the premature leakage of the Report of the Welsh Church Commission causedconcern both to the Commission and to the Home Office. Consultations betweenthe Home Office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Treasury Solicitorrevealed no way of proceeding against the newspapers concerned. The conclusion was reached that this was a deficiency in the law which should be rectified. TheDirector commented, and the Treasury Solicitor agreed, that the Official Sectets Act1889 needed amendment in more than one direction, and certainly in a manner toinclude the receiver as well as the thief of stolen confidential information.The Official Secrets Act 1911. 12. Within a few months, in July 1911, a new Official Secrets Bill was brought before Parliament. This Bill was introduced because Governments took the viewthat both section 1 and section 2 of the 1889 Act had proved, over a period of morethan twenty years, inadequate to their respective purposes. The effect of the 1911legislation was to repeal the 1889 Act and replace it with an amended law designedto repair these deficiencies. The Bill contained new provisions in place of sections 1and 2 of the 1889 Act. The new provisions on spying included the espionage pro-visions of the unsuccessful Bills of 1896 and 1908. The new section 2, however,was a wider version of the original section 2; the 1908 approach, which involved a prohibition on the publication of certain kinds of official information, was not pursued.The new section 2 was in terms of unauthorised communication and receipt. Theeffect, however, was similar to that of the 1908 Bill. For the new section 2 was not confined to Crown servants and Government contractors. It brought within thenet all those who communicated or received official information without authority.As with section 2 of the 1889 Act, all kinds of official information were covered.
However, clause 2 of the 1911 Bill was not once mentioned in the parlimentary debates. The Government presented the Bill as a measure which was aimed at spyingand was essential on grounds of national security. In contrast to the furore in 1908,the press took no interest in clause 2: their attention was elsewhere, monopolisedby the Parliament Bill and the associated constitutional crisis.13. Although surviving official papers are incomplete, there is no evidence in themto suggest that those who drafted the 1911 Bill were not very well aware of theexceedingly wide scope of the new section 2. They clearly intended it to operate asa general check against civil service leaks of all kinds. Official papers show that from 1889 to the present day the Civil Service has always seen this as one of the objects of the Official Secrets Acts, and has never regarded the Acts as being confined to matters connected with the safety of the State. Nor was the 1911 Bill prepared in haste. The Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence on Espionage was presented two years before the introduction of the Bill. The WelshChurch Commission leak occurred late in 1910. The first draft of the Bill found on official papers is dated a full year before its introduction. Some of its provisionscan be traced back to the 1896 Bill. Some of the wording of the new section 2 derives from the 1908 Bill.The Official Secrets Act 192014. The object of the next Official Secrets Act, in 1920, was to enact in permanentform certain Defence of the Realm Regulations which the Government wished to preserve in peacetime. This Act was concerned almost entirely with questions ofspying, and Sir Gordon Hewart, Attorney General of the day, made frequent remarks to that effect in the debates on the Bill in the House of Commons. All but one ofthese remarks related only to the provisions of the 1920 Bill and their relationship to section 1 of the 1911 Act. In one speech, however, Sir Gordon implied that thewhole of the 1911 Act, including section 2, was concerned only with spying. In thecourse of dealing with criticisms of clause 6, which gave power to require information in connection with offences under the Official Secrets Acts, Sir Gordon said: &quot;We are dealing only with offences or suspected offences under the principal Act or this Act.In other words, to put it shortly, we are dealing with spying and attempts at spying&quot;.It is not clear how he came to make this obviously erroneous statement. It wasonly the previous year that a test case had been brought under section 2 against aWar Office clerk who had disclosed without authority details of contracts for armyclothing, and against the recipient of this information, a director of a firm of tailors.The Judge had ruled that section 2 clearly applied to any documents or informationcoming into the possession of a Crown servant, confidential or not. In any event,none of the Parliamentary controversy over the 1920 Bill was concerned with section 2of the 1911 Act, and nothing said in the course of this controversy is evidence of whatParliament and Government had intended nine years previously.15. The 1920 Act did make a number of amendments to section 2, by insertingthe provisions about code words and pass words, and section 2 (1) (aa) and (c) and2 (1a). These added provisions were inserted at a late stage, after most of the contro-versy about the other provisions. Sir Gordon Hewart explained them very briefly,and they were passed with no real scrutiny or debate.Between the Wars: the controversy over section 6 of the 1920 Act16. Between the wars there was recurrent controversy about section 6 of the 1920Act. Eventually the Official Secrets Act 1939 limited this section to offences undersection 1 of the 1911 Act. The immediate controversy that led to this legislationarose first out of the conviction of a journalist, Mr E. D. G. Lewis, for failing to
reveal his source of certain police information published in his newspaper. ThenMr Duncan Sandys, MP, was questioned by the then Attorney General, Sir donald somervell, about the source of information concerning anti-aircraft defences which mr Sandys had sent to the Secretary of State for War. The Attorney mentioned to Mr Sandys that section 6 created an offence of failing to give information aboutoffences of unlawful disclosure. Mr Sandys raised this as a matter of parliamentary privilege, and a Select Committee of Inquiry was set up. Before the Select Committeehad finished its work the Government introduced its Bill. In the course of the Parlia-mentary proceedings on this Bill, it was pointed out that the Bill did not affect section 2of the 1911 Act, which would continue to go wider than questions of national security.An unsuccessful attempt was made in the House of Lords to amend section 2 bylimiting it to disclosures made for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests ofthe State.Recent discussion of section 217. Since the 1939 attempt to limit section 2, there have been other similar attempts.The amendment of section 6 of the 1920 Act made in 1939 resulted in part from concern about its effect on journalists. Similarly, it was the potential effect of section 2 onthe practice of journalism which set off one of the two main post-war discussions about the latter section. This discussion did not, however, arise out of an actual or threatened use of section 2, but out of the imprisonment of two journalists who refused to disclose their sources of information to the Tribunal on the Vassall case.This led to the establishment in the spring of 1964 by &quot;Justice&quot; (the British Sectionof the International Commission of Jurists) and the British Committee of the Inter-national Press Institute of a Joint Working Party on the Law and the Press, whoseterms of reference included the Official Secrets Acts. The Working Party recom-mended in its report, published in 1965, that section 2 should be limited by allowing a defence that communication was not likely to harm either the national interest or legitimate private interests confided to the State and that the information was passedand received in good faith and in the public interest.18. This report led to a debate in the House of Lords in 1966, and to severalattempts by private Members of Parliament to amend section 2 along the lines recom-mended in the report. None of these Bills reached the statute book, but in 1969Mr Reginald Eyre&apos;s Bill reached the third reading stage, when it was talked out, andin 1970 Mr Jasper More&apos;s Bill was briefly debated before the second reading wasnegatived.19. The most recent post-war discussions of section 2 are covered in paragraphs 5to 8 of the Report.
LAW AND PRACTICE IN OTHER COUNTRIESThis Appendix summarises the information which we obtained about the law relating to the protection of official information, and access to official information,in Canada, France, Sweden and the United States of America.Canada1. The Canadian Official Secrets Act 1939 is closely modelled on the UnitedKingdom Official Secrets Acts 1911-1939. The wording of section 4 of the CanadianAct is almost identical to that of section 2 of the United Kingdom Act of 1911.2. In one important respect section 4 of the Canadian Act might be interpreted bythe Canadian courts more narrowly than the British section 2. Decisions of theBritish courts have firmly established that section 2 applies to all official information,secret or not. Both sections contain the words &quot;secret official code word, or password, or any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information&quot;. In theUnited Kingdom it is clear that words &quot;secret official&quot; qualify only the words &quot;codeword, or pass word&quot;. There has been no decision of the Canadian courts to settlethis point, but a decision in 1962 concerning the interpretation of similar words insection 3 of the Canadian Act suggests that section 4 might be held to apply only todocuments and information which are both &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;official&quot;.3. As in the United Kingdom, prosecutions can be brought in Canada only withthe consent of the Attorney General. Responsibility for law enforcement is aprovincial matter, so this means the Attorney General of the Province concerned,though he may well consult the Federal Attorney General. (There is no Directorof Public Prosecutions in Canada).4. In the United Kingdom the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for an offence against section 2 is two years; the maximum for offencesunder section 1 is fourteen years&apos; imprisonment. The Canadian Act provides thesame maximum term of imprisonment, fourteen years, for all offences under theAct. Offences may be tried summarily if the Attorney General so elects, in which casethe maximum penalty is twelve months&apos; imprisonment or a fine of 500 dollars or both.5. Prosecutions under the Canadian section 4 are infrequent. We were told thatthere had been only one recent case; this came close to espionage, and involved thepassing of maps to agents of a foreign Power.6. The Report of the Canadian Royal Commission on Security, published in 1969,contained a passage on the Official Secrets Act 1939. The Commissioners recom-mended that the Act should be reviewed and that consideration should be given tolimiting the Act to classified information. At the time of presenting our Report, theCanadian Government had announced no conclusions on this recommendation.France7. The French Penal Code protects two classes of information: first, informationaffecting national defence, and second, information entrusted to certain persons byreason of their profession.
8. There is a series of provisions protecting information &quot;which ought to be kept secret in the interests of the defence of the nation&quot;. Articles 72 and 73 cover the delivery of such information to a foreign Power. This is treason if done by a Frenchcitizen and espionage if done by a foreigner. The penalty in each case is death.If a person who is responsible for such information by reason of his function or statusdiscloses it to an unauthorised person or to a member of the public or reproduces ordestroys it, without intending treason or espionage, he is liable under Article 75 to imprisonment for ten to twenty years, or for five to ten years only if the offence was due to imprudence or inattention to rules. Where such a disclosure is made by aperson without special responsibility for the information the penalty under Article 76is imprisonment for five to ten years. Article 76 applies to all persons, whetherFrench or foreign, including journalists who publish such information or reproduceor destroy it. Article 76 also makes it an offence for any person to obtain possessionof such information without authority. There are a number of other related offencesin this part of the Penal Code. One of these, Article 80, provides that a person whomaintains, with the agents of a foreign Power, contacts of a kind prejudicial to themilitary or diplomatic position of France or to her essential economic interests, is liable to imprisonment for ten to twenty years.9. The concept of &quot;the defence of the nation&quot; is given a broader interpretation inFrance than would be normal in this country. It includes protection against all formsof aggression affecting the security and integrity of the territory and the life of thepopulation. No distinction is drawn between internal security and external defence.Under Article R.24 offences against other members of NATO are treated for thispurpose as offences against France. The respect of alliances, treaties and international agreements is regarded as coming within the scope of defence. In an individual case it is for the Court of State Security to decide what &quot;ought to be kept secret inthe interests of the defence of the nation&quot;. This court hears all cases under this partof the Penal Code. There has not been occasion, since the Court was established, todetermine precisely how far the concept of national defence goes, but it is commonlyregarded as including important matters in the diplomatic, economic and technological-logical spheres that could affect the stability of the State anything, that is, affecting&quot;la collectivite francaise&quot;.10. Prosecutions under this part of the Penal Code are instituted by the PublicProsecutor, but only on the written instructions of the Ministry of Justice. To assistthe Court of State Security to decide the issue whether the interests of national defencerequire the information in question to be kept secret, a &quot;technical opinion&quot; is providedby the Minister of Defence or other Minister concerned. This sets out the reasons forregarding the information as secret. If highly secret documents are involved theopinion may summarise their contents so that the documents themselves need not beput before the Court. The Court is not obliged to accept the technical opinion, buttreats it with great respect. In practice, most cases brought under these provisionshave been espionage or close to espionage rather than leakage.11. The other kind of information protected by the Penal Code extends far beyondthe confidences entrusted to the Government. Any person who is entrusted withpersonal information by reason of his profession or status and who discloses that information is liable under Article 378 to imprisonment for one to six months or a fine of 500 to 3,000 francs. This Article covers, for instance, doctors, midwives,lawyers and priests as well as certain classes of civil servants. A person who receivesinformation given in breach of this professional secrecy is not himself liable to criminal sanctions, even if he communicates it further, unless his role in soliciting or incitingthe breach was such as to make him an accomplice in the offence.
12. Article 10 of the Statut General des Fonctionnaires puts all French civil servantsunder an obligation not to make unauthorised disclosures of official information.Under Article 11 such misconduct is punishable by disciplinary penalties withoutprejudice to penalties which may be imposed under the criminal law. A civil servantwho commits one of the offences against the Penal Code described above is thusliable to both criminal and disciplinary penalties; but beyond the fields of nationaldefence and professional secrecy the sanctions for unauthorised disclosures are of adisciplinary nature only.Sweden13. The law of Sweden contains detailed provisions governing (a) public access to official documents, (b) the secrecy of official documents, and (c) the freedom of thePress. The provisions relating to (a) and (c) are part of the Swedish constitution.The statutory provisions on these three subjects interlock in such a way that an understanding of one requires an understanding of all.14. Certain basic principles are laid down by the Freedom of the Press Act. Theseare that every citizen (including public officials and members of the Forces) has theright to express his thoughts and opinions in print; to publish official documents;and to make statements and communicate information on any subject whatever witha view to publication. Exceptions to these rights are to be made only for the pro-tection of individual rights and of public security. A separate Chapter of theFreedom of the Press Act then gives every citizen a right of access to official documents.Exceptions to this right are specified in a special statute, the Secrecy Act.15. A general exception to the right of public access is made for working papers andother similar documents prepared by an authority as part of the process of reaching a decision. Such a document becomes publicly available only if, once that decision has been taken, it is placed on permanent record. The exceptions in the Secrecy Actare not of this general character but relate to categories of subject matter.16. The Secrecy Act sets out in considerable detail the classes of document whichare to be kept secret and the period for which the secrecy is to apply. These classesinclude- (a) documents on certain defence matters, if the Government considers that publication would harm the defence or security of the realm, which areclosed for up to fifty years;(b) documents relating to Sweden&apos;s relations with foreign Powers, also closedf for fifty years, except where the Government permits earlier publication;(c) Cabinet records, closed for varying periods;(d) documents relating to the activities of the police, public prosecutors andthe Customs and Excise concerning crime, if publication would be detrimental to the prevention or detection of crime or to the safety of the realm or ofan individual, closed for up to seventy years;(e) certain Bank of Sweden documents including those relating to the currency;(/) many kinds of document containing personal information about individuals(censuses, registration of births, medical reports, social assistance, criminalrecords, etc.) which, in general, are closed unless the individual concerned;    consents to disclosure or the authority holding the document is satisfiedthat it will not be used to his detriment or to the detriment of a near relative;
(g) many kinds of document containing commercial and industrial information;and(A) a variety of other documents, including certain official inspection reports and scientific investigations, patent applications, and documents relating to labour relations, wage negotiations, pre-contract negotiations and parlia-mentary and court proceedings held in camera.In some cases the general description in the Secrecy Act is supplemented by ordinancessetting out the content of a class of documents in more detail. The Act and theordinances together represent a detailed body of law, which requires regularamendment.17. A Swedish public servant who discicses a document which is required to bekept secret is guilty of a breach of official duty and can be prosecuted. A fine is thenormal penalty, but imprisonment and removal from office can be imposed in aggra-vated circumstances. The disclosure of documents not covered by the Secrecy Act,with a view to publication, is a general constitutional right enjoyed by all citizens,including public servants. A public servant cannot be investigated, disciplined orprosecuted for exercising that right, and those responsible for publications are prohibited by law from revealing an author&apos;s name against his wishes, except in caseswhere obliged by law to do so. This prohibition extends to the sources of a news-paper&apos;s information. An oral disclosure of information which would be covered bythe Secrecy Act if in documentary form is also a criminal offence. If given with aview to publication, however, the disclosure is protected from investigation andprosecution if the obligation to keep silent is not contained in statute law and the disclosure does not concern the security of the realm.18. The editor of a newspaper is alone responsible for what appears in his paper.He commits an offence if he publishes a document which is meant to be kept secretunder the Secrecy Act, or publishes any information, however obtained, whichconstitutes an offence against the security of the realm under the ordinary law. Apartfrom these provisions, and provisions covering a few other matters such as defamationand incitement to crime, there is complete freedom of publication.19. The Ministry of Justice has general responsibility for supervising the observance of the Freedom of the Press Act. If the Head of the Ministry considers that proceed-ings should be instituted for an offence against the Act, he is required to notify the attorney General, who may institute such proceedings either on receipt of such anotification or on his own initiative. Only he can launch such a prosecution. the attorney General is a public official, not a Minister, and is not responsible to Parlia-ment. Prosecutions of editors under the Freedom of the Press Act are the onlycases in Sweden in which there is a jury, which is composed of specially selectedpeople. Prosecutions are few, and in recent years at least there have been none inrespect of the publication of secret official documents.United States of America20. Provisions of the United States Constitution and Criminal Code touching onthe Committee&apos;s field of interest covers the freedom of the press, access by the public to certain official information, and the unlawful communication of specified kinds ofinformation.21. The first Amendment to the United States Constitution, says &quot;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press&quot;.
22. The Public Information Act 1967 (Title 5, Section 552), commonly known asthe Freedom of Information Act, requires United States Government Agencies to publish their organisation, procedure and policies, and to make available to the publictheir decisions and other identifiable documents for inspection and copying.Section 552 (b) lists nine exceptions to this requirement, as follows: 1. Defence and foreign policy secrets specified by Executive Order;2. Internal personnel rules;3. Matters expressly excepted by statute;4. Privileged or confidential trade secrets and commercial information;5. Privileged intra-governmental documents and correspondence;6. Disclosures of personal and other files which would constitute an unwarrantedinvasion of privacy;7. Law enforcement investigations;8. Reports relating to the supervision of financial institutions;9. Geological etc. data concerning wells.23. The matters covered by the first of these exceptions are those which are classifiedunder an Executive Order of 8 March 1972 (No. 11652). This Order requires official information or material which requires protection against unauthorised disclosurein the interest of the national defence or the foreign relations of the United States(collectively termed &quot;national security&quot; in the Order) to be classified &quot;top secret&quot;,&quot;secret&quot; or &quot;confidential&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Order. TheOrder lays down the criteria for each level of security classification in terms of the kindof damage that might be expected to result from unauthorised disclosure, givingexamples of that kind of damage. It specifies which officials within which departments have power to classify material at each level. It contains provisions about down-grading and declassifying. And it provides that the implementation of the order shall be monitored by the National Security Council.24. The general effect is that, in the fields of defence and foreign relations, theUnited States Government decides, by virtue of classification, what specific informationmust be excepted from the right of public access. The interpretation of the otherexcepted categories is ultimately a matter for the courts. The Public InformationAct is drafted in such a way that it does not touch internal working documents, drawnup for the purposes of formulating policy and taking decisions.25. The United States Code contains a number of enactments designed to protectspecified kinds of information. The enactment of the most general scope is known asthe Espionage Act (Title 18, Chapter 37). The two main provisions of this Act forour purposes are Sections 793 and 798. Section 793 makes it an offence to com-municate to an unauthorised person information relating to national defence withreason to believe that it could be used to the injury of the United States or to theadvantage of any foreign nation. The section also makes it an offence to obtain orreceive specified written material or devices relating to national defence with intentor reason to believe that it is to be used to the injury of the United States or to theadvantage of any foreign nation. Gross negligence which results in the removal of documents relating to national defence from their proper place of custody, or in their being delivered to another person or lost, stolen, abstracted or destroyed, is also an offence. The Supreme Court has ruled that &quot;national defence&quot; is &quot;a generic concept of broad connotations, referring to military and naval establishments and the relatedactivities of national preparedness&quot;.  Under this section the Government must prove,
to the satisfaction of the jury, that the information in fact relates to &quot;the nationaldefence&quot;. The fact that it has been classified is not conclusive. The maximumsentence for these offences is ten years&apos; imprisonment (or death, under Section 794,if the information is communicated to a foreign Power).26. Section 798 of the Espionage Act makes it an offence knowingly and wilfully tocommunicate, furnish or make available to an unauthorised person, or to publish anyclassified information relating to codes or cyphers etc., or to devices used for crypto-graphic or communications intelligence purposes, or to communications intelligenceactivities or obtained through such activities. It is also an offence to use suchclassified information &quot;in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of theUnited States, or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of theUnited States&quot;.   The maximum penalty is again ten years&apos; imprisonment.27. The Espionage Act applies to all persons. Title 50 of the United States Code,which covers war and national defence, contains a provision applying only to UnitedStates Government employees. Section 783 of this title makes it an offence for sucha person to communicate, without authorisation, any classified information to an agent or representative of a foreign government or to an officer or member of anycommunist organisation. It is not an offence under this section, though it may be under Title 18, Section 793, to give such information to any other person, or to publishit. An agent or representative of a foreign Power, or an officer or member of a communist organisation, who receives classified information from a United StatesGovernment employee also commits an offence. In both cases guilty knowledge that the information is classified and that the recipient is a foreign government orcommunist organisation, or that the giver is a government official, as the case may be,is an ingredient of the offence, but the motive of the offender has no relevance. Allclassified information of all kinds is covered, and the defendant cannot challengethe propriety of the classification; the Government is required only to show that theofficial who classified it was authorised so to do and acted in good faith. The maximumpenalty under Section 783 is ten years&apos; imprisonment.28. It might be possible in certain cases not covered by the provisions summarised above to prosecute for stealing government property (Section 641) or for removingdocuments from a public building (Section 2071). Apart from that possibility,unauthorised disclosures by United States public servants which are not covered bythese provisions can be dealt with by disciplinary sanctions.
OTHER STATUTORY PROVISIONS PROTECTING THE CONFIDENCESOF THE CITIZEN1. A considerable number of statutes contain provisions which, independently of section 2, make it a criminal offence to disclose certain kinds of information withoutlawful authority. Theie is a list of such provisions at the end of this Appendix.(There may be some further provisions of this kind which were not brought to theCommittee&apos;s notice.)2. All but one of these provisions are related to statutory requirements for citizens or firms to surrender a degree of personal or business privacy, either by providingspecified information or by allowing the inspection of land or premises. The obliga-tion to comply with these statutory requirements is usually backed by criminal sanctions. In return, many such statutes give the citizen or firm an assurance thatthe information thus coming into the hands of the authorities will be specially safe-guarded, by providing criminal penalties for those who disclose it unlawfully. (ThePost Office Act 1969 is an exception in that it covers information not given underlegal compulsion.)3. In most cases this protection is given to all information obtained in consequenceof the statutory powers. In some cases, particularly where information is obtained through the exercise of powers to inspect premises, only manufacturing processesor trade secrets are protected in this way.4. Most of these statutory provisions apply to Crown servants, and Crown servantsonly, and to that extent they largely duplicate section 2. Some apply also, and someapply exclusively, to persons other than Crown servants. The other classes of personscovered vary from one statute to another. They include local government officersof various kinds, officers of other statutory bodies such as river authorities and gasboards, and even officers of the Law Society and the Pharmaceutical Society.5. The circumstances in which these provisions permit the communication of theinformation which they protect also vary from one statute to another. One group of statutes permit communications by an officer in the performance of his duty.A few provisions allow communication of the information with the authority of theMinister or in accordance with Ministerial directions. Most of the rest use a more complicated formula, which sets out in greater detail the circumstances in whichdisclosure is permitted, and which thus restricts the discretion of the authority concerned to disclose the information. For instance, some provisions allow disclosureto be made only in the form of statistics which reveal nothing about particularindividuals or undertakings. Some of these provisions, however, which containstrict limitations on disclosure, also allow information to be disclosed with the consentof the person to whom it relates.6. The maximum penalties for breaches of these provisions are in some cases thesame as that under section 2, in some cases less. The Atomic Energy Act 1946 isthe only one to provide a heavier penalty, five years&apos; imprisonment. The majorityprovide a maximum of two years&apos; imprisonment on conviction on indictment, thesame as section 2, and also allow summary trial with lower maximum penalties.Some provide for summary trial only, and some for fines only with no imprisonment.
7. In considering the relationship of these provisions to section 2, the main points to have in mind are:-(a) None of these provisions is a catch-all like section 2. They apply only to information of specified kinds, or obtained in specified ways.(b) With one exception, all these provisions are linked to statutory powers underwhich information is obtained by compulsion. Section 2 covers all informa-tion in the hands of Crown servants, however obtained.(c) These provisions form a miscellany, built up on an ad hoc basis over theyears. They do not provide comprehensive protection for all informationof particular kinds, or for all information obtained in particular ways, andthe degree of protection given likewise varies.(d) These provisions do not apply only to the central Government or to crown servants. They thus affect numbers of people who are not subject to section 2.8.

OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT DECLARATIONSThe practice of requiring Crown servants and others to sign Official Secrets Actdeclarations is explained in paragraphs 35-37. There are six forms of declarationwidely used by Government Departments, and a seventh form is used by the PostOffice; other variations may exist. Each of the first five forms listed below sets outin full, on the back, the texts of section 2 as amended, and of subsection (2) of section 1of the 1920 Act. The sixth sets out in full the text of sections 2 and 3 of the 1911 Act,as amended.   The forms are: 1. E.74 Signed by all civil servants on appointment and by certainothers (consultants, research workers, etc.) given access toofficiat information.2. E.74a Signed by visitors to Government Departments (e.g. under-graduates making pre-recruitment visits) who may be givenaccess to official information.3. E.76 Signed by all civil servants and Post Office employees on leaving the service and, in certain cases, on leaving one part of theservice for another; also signed by persons other than civilservants on ceasing to have access to secret information.4. E.76a Signed by visitors to Government Departments who have beengiven access to secret information.5. D.E.209 Signed by those employees of nationalised industries who have access to classified information.6. S Form 454 Signed by those employees of Government contractors whohave access to classified information. The same form is signedtwice, on commencement and on termination of employment.7. P.13W Signed by persons joining the Post Office; draws attention toother statutory provisions as well as the Official Secrets Acts.The terms of the declaration in each of the first five forms are very similar. the text of Form E.74 is given below, together with an indication of how the others vary.The texts of the declaration used for classified Government contracts and of the PostOffice declaration differ more extensively and are set out at the end of the Appendix.Form E.74OFFICIAL SECRETS ACTSDeclaration To be signed by members of Government Departments onappointment and, where desirable, by non-civil servants on firstbeing given access to Government information.My attention has been drawn to the provisions of the Officiai Secrets Acts setout on the back of this document and I am fully aware of the serious consequences which may follow any breach of those provisions./ understand XhaX the sections of the Official Secrets Acts set out on the backof this document cover material published in a speech, lecture, or radio ortelevision broadcast, or in the Press or in book form.

I also understand that I must surrender any documents, etc.,referred to in section 2 (1) of the Act if I am transferred from one post to another,save such as have been issued to me for my personal retention.Form E.74A has only minor differences to take account of the different class of person involved, and omits the final reference to the surrender of documents.Form E.76 is substantially the same, though with added emphasis on the continuingliability after cessation of appointment; it concludes with a declaration that the signatory has surrendered any document (whether classified or not) which he made or acquired during the tenure of his appointment, save those that he has writtenDepartmental authority to retain.Form E.76A follows very closely the terms of E.76, with minor consequentialchanges only.Form D.E.209 is similar to E.76; it specifies the employer in whose employment the information is acquired, and specifies the Department of Trade and Industry asthe Government Department to give sanction for the publication of material and togive authority for the retention of documents.S Form 454(Classified Government contracts)THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACTS 1911-1939DECLARATION1.

It is important for you to know and understand those provisions, not only for your own sake, but also in order that you should not, through anyfault or omission on your part, enable or tempt others to breakthem.It is illegal to disclose official information without authority.A person engaged in Post Office work must not disclose any information which he obtains as a result of that work, unlessDUTY OFTHEPOST OFFICENON-disclosure of official information he has written permission to do so.YOU SHOULD READ CAREFULLY THIS statement and THE ONE OVERLEAF AND THEN SIGN YOURNAME TO THE DECLARATION BELOW.Reverse of Form P.13WSAFETY OF        It is an offence to STEAL, SECRETE or DESTROY a letter,POSTAL parcel or any other postal packet in course of transmissionPACKETS by post, and heavy penalties, including terms of imprisonment,are provided for such offences.It is also an offence to OPEN or DELAY (without properauthority) a letter, parcel or any other postal packet in courseof transmission by post, and penalties of fine or imprisonmentare provided for such offences.CARELESSNESS, NEGLIGENCE or other misconduct whichendangers the safety of a mailbag or postal packet is likewise apunishable offence.

When aperson transfers from one post to another, he must surrenderall documents connected with the post he is leaving, except thoseissued to him for his personal retention. When he leaves thePost Office all official documents must be given up, with theexception of those which he has been authorised to retain.All the above conditions apply to all persons with access to any official information, not only while the access continues,but also after it ceases, e.g. by termination of employment.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE CONTROL OF PROSECUTIONS1. This Appendix is based on a paper provided by the Home Office, which is published in Volume 2. Some of the evidence discusses the Attorney Generafscontrol over Official Secrets Act prosecutions in isolation both from the rest of his functions and from the rest of the system of law enforcement. The purpose of this appendix is to give a broader picture of the system for instituting prosecutions inEngland and Wales, and of the functions of the Attorney General (and Director ofPublic Prosecutions) in controlling the institution of prosecutions under a variety of statues.   The Appendix does not cover the different system in Scotland.2. The general position is that any citizen may institute a prosecution. Exceptin cases of common assault, however, prosecutions by private individuals are rare.The great majority of prosecutions are brought by the police. An appreciable numberare brought by other authorities (e.g. by local authorities in relation to weights and measures or byelaw offences) and by private firms (e.g. for shoplifting). In cases ofimportance or difficulty the Director of Public Prosecutions may prosecute, or thepolice or another authority may consult him before deciding whether to do so.3. The Attorney General is regularly involved in decisions whether to instituteprosecutions because a number of statutes place upon him the responsibility for deciding whether a prosecution shall be brought, and because the Director of public prosecutions consults him about other cases. The Director exercises his functions under the general superintendence of the Attorney General, and the Attorney isanswerable in Parliament for the Director. In consequence, consultation betweenthem is close and regular, and the Director of Public Prosecutions consults the attorney general on cases of special importance or difficulty even where there is no legalrequirement for the Attorney to be involved.4. There is a considerable number of statutory provisions which contain restrictionson the bringing of prosecutions. These provisions cover a wide and miscellaneousvariety of offences, though between them they affect only a relatively small part ofthe criminal law as a whole. Some of these provisions place the responsibility for controlling prosecutions on the Attorney General, others place it on the Directorof Public Prosecutions. A third group of statutes provide that prosecutions may bebrought only by, or with the consent of, either the Director of Public Prosecutions(or in some cases the Attorney General) or some other specified authority, such as aGovernment Department or local authority which has other responsibilities underthe law in question. Before 1939 most of these special provisions placed the control in the hands of the Attorney General. Most of the post-war provisions place it inthe hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Home Office state in theirpaper that the recent tendency has been to give this responsibility to the attorney general only where there is some special reason for wishing to ensure that every case is considered by him personally before a prosecution is brought. Where the statutoryresponsibility is placed on the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney is nevertheless consulted in cases of importance or difficulty, as mentioned in paragraph 3.5. The Home Office state that there does not seem to have been a firmly establishedpolicy, closely adhered to over the years, governing decisions by Parliament whether to include a restriction on the bringing of prosecutions in a new statute, and whether to place the control with the Director or the Attorney. They say that the basicground for including such a restriction in a statute is that otherwise there would be a
risk of prosecutions being brought in inappropriate circumstances. They distinguishfive kinds of reason which may lead to the conclusion that such a risk exists. these reasons overlap, and more than one may be present in any particular case.6. The five reasons given by the Home Office are as follows: (a) to secure consistency of practice in bringing prosecutions, e.g. where it isnot possible to define the offence very precisely, so that the law goes wider than the mischief aimed at or is open to a variety of interpretations;(b) to prevent abuse, or the bringing of the law into disrepute, e.g. with the kindof offence which might otherwise result in vexatious private prosecutions orthe institution of proceedings in trivial cases;(c) to enable account to be taken of mitigating factors, which may vary sowidely from case to case that they are not susceptible of statutory definition;(d) to provide some central control over the use of the criminal law when ithas to intrude into areas which are particularly sensitive or controversial,such as race relations or censorship;(e) to ensure that decisions on prosecution take account of important considera-tions of public policy or of a political or international character, such asmay arise, for instance, in relation to official secrets or hijacking.7. The Home Office say that recent practice suggests that a contiol introduced on grounds (a), (b) or (c) would normally be thought appropriate to the Director ofPublic Prosecutions, a control on ground (e) would be thought appropriate to the attorney General, and a control on ground (d) might be given to either, depending on the circumstances. Where important political or international considerationsmay be involved, the Attorney General, who is directly answerable to Parliament forhis decisions and is in a position to consult Ministerial colleagues direct if need be,is regarded as the proper person to carry the responsibility. Similarly, on sensitivesubjects like race relations, Parliament may feel that the Attorney should be directlyanswerable for a personal decision.8. There are some two dozen statutes under which prosecutions may be institutedonly with the Attorney Generafs consent (apart from those under which he sharescontrol with some other authority).   Some of the main examples are as follows: Explosive Substances Act 1883: offences of causing explosions likely to endangerlife or property.Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1887 and Prevention of Corruption Act 1906:offences of bribery and corruption.Public Order Act 1936: offences of the unlawful wearing of uniforms and of organising quasi-military organisations.Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1955: offences of printing,publishing and selling &quot;horror comics&quot;.Housing Act 1957: offences committed by local authorities in relation to theovercrowding of houses.Race Relations Act 1965: offences of incitement to racial hatred.criminla justice Act 1967: offences of unlawfully publishing reports of committalproceedings in magistrates&apos; courts.Theatres Act 1968: offences of presenting obscene plays, or of presenting playswith intent to incite to racial hatred or to a breach of the peace.Hijacking Act 1971: offences of hijacking aircraft.
