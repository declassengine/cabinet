IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 80 COPY NO        6 b14 July 1972CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL health service IN wales memorandum by the Secretary of State for wales.        I propose to publish a White Paper on National Health Service(NHS) Reorganisation in Wales complementary to that proposed by theSecretary of State for Social Services in respect of England.    A draft is attached.    It has been cleared by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee.2.        NHS reorganisation in England and Wales will be dealt with under the same Bill and will be effective from the same date,1 April 1974.    The administrative pattern will be essentially thesame in Wales as in England after allowing for the smaller scale which makes it unnecessary to interpose a Regional Health Authority betweenthe eight Area Health Authorities (AHAs) and the Welsh Office.    Anall-Wales National Health Service agency (Welsh Health TechnicalServices Organisation) will carry out specialist executive and manage -ment functions including design and execution of major capital works butit will not be responsible for general oversight of AHAs&apos; planning and operations.    It will be appointed by the Secretary of State for wales and, like the AHAs, will be directly accountable to him.3.        In all this, the draft White Paper reaffirms the proposals of the consultative Document on NHS Reorganisation in Wales issued in June 1973-foUowing discussion in the Social Services Committee and the Cabinet(CM(71) 19th and 24th Conclusions).    The Welsh proposals reflect those for England as regards the scope of the reorganised NHS, the composition of AHAs, the payment of chairmen and the setting up of community Health Councils and professional advisory machinery.A proposal in the Consultative Document to set up a new advisory WelshHealth Council has been dropped in favour of continuing to rely as necessary on the existing Welsh Council.    There may be a need for review when the Commission on the Constitution reports.1
4. As noted last year, the proposals imply some increase in thenumber of Civil Servants but should make a better use of overallpublic manpower.    Additional short-term administrative costsarising out of the reorganisation have been provided for in Cmnd. 4829.5.        I seek the Cabinetls agreement to the publication of the white paper in early August.P TWelsh Office14 July 1972

DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE REORGANISATION IN WALESPART   I   THE   REORGANISED   SERVICE:SCOPE   AND   RELATIONS   WITH   LOCAL   GOVERNMENTIntroduction1      This White Paper describes the Government&apos;s proposals for reorganisingthe administration of the National Health Service in Wales.   The proposalstake into account comments received on the Green Paper issued by theprevious administration in March 1970 and on the Consultative Documentof June 1971.   Well over a hundred written comments were received on each occasion and over the past year discussions have been held with a numberof the principal interested bodies.   The Government have now reached firm decisions on the main administrative structure for a reorganised health service.   These decisions can be seen as a logical development from the ideas which were outlined in the proposals of the previous administration and which have since been tested and refined in the light of widespreaddiscussion.   Some important modifications to the original proposals,concerning the membership of the new health authorities and the means of ensuring that they are responsive to those they serve, are designed toincrease the efficiency of the health service in the best interests ofthe people.   Study of the detailed arrangements for managementorganisation within the new structure is proceeding.   They will be mainlya matter for subordinate legislation and administrative guidance whichwill follow the passage of the main legislation.2      That there is need for such a reorganisation is widely accepted.The present institutions have served well, but the   time has come whenthey should be welded together into a unified whole so that in the planning and allocation of resources and in the day to day responsibilityfor providing health care the service may respond in a balanced andcoherent way to the overall needs of those whom it serves.   Much has beendone already, by goodwill and co-operation between authorities and individuals, to overcome the administrative barriers between the threepresent arms of the service but further progress will best be secured by removing them altogether.1
3      In November 1970 the Government announced their intention tointroduce legislation to bring about unification of the service on1 April 197^, simultaneously with the reorganisation of local government.This legislation is now in preparation.   The Government&apos;s plans providefor the new health authorities to work closely with corresponding localauthorities in co-ordinating the development and operation of theirinter-related services.   At the central government level theSecretary of State for Wales already discharges his responsibilities for both groups of services through the unified organisation of the welsh Office.Services within the National Health Servicek      Reorganisation of the health service will bring together, undereight Area Health Authorities matching the boundaries of the proposed new counties, the family practitioner services now administered by theExecutive Councils, the hospital and specialist services nowadministered by the V/elsh Hospital Board and the Hospital management committees, the school health service and the personal health servicesnow administered by the local authorities.   These latter includeepidemiological work and general surveillance of community health;vaccination and immunisation;   medical, nursing and other arrangementsfor the prevention of illness and for care and after-care;   healthvisiting, home nursing and midwifery;   maternity and child health care;ambulance services;    family planning;   and the provision of health centres.   The new health authorities will also become responsible forthe registration of nursing homes.5      The Government are satisfied that the future of the school health service will best be safeguarded by bringing it within the national health Service:   there would be p. risk of problems arising fromprofessional isolation if it were separately administered from all otherpersonal health services.   Area Health Authorities will provide localeducation authorities with necessary medical, dental, nursing and alliedresources and advice to enable them to discharge their continuingresponsibilities for identifying and meeting the special educationalneeds which disability or handicap may bring as well as for school2
hygiene and health instruction.   There will be arrangements for joint planning and co-ordination (see paragraph 8) and there is no reason whythe teaching and health professions should not continue to workharmoniously together within the school regimen.   Area Health authorities will also work in close co-operation with the local education and social service departments of the new county councils in the provision of aco-ordinated child guidance service.Collaboration with Local government      A major reason for the decision that each Area Health authority should match a new county council was to facilitate close collaboration between them and between the Area Health Authority and the councils ofthe new districts which each county will comprise.   As foreshadowed inthe Consultative Document, a working party covering England and Wales andbroadly representative of local government, the NHS and central governmentis studying how best to promote such collaboration.7      The working party has already made a number of importantrecommendations and although consultations on them with the interestedlocal authority and health organisations have not yet been completed itis evident that there is a mutual will to ensure joint identification ofneeds of common concern and full co-operation in determining and pursuingthe best ways of meeting them.   Subject to these consultations it isproposed that health and local authorities in Wales, as in England,should be placed under a general obligation to collaborate and should begiven wide powers to provide each other generally with goods and services.It will be a part of the responsibility placed by the Secretary of state on Area Health Authorities to provide all necessary medical and allied services and advice to local authorities in the fields of education,personal social services, environmental health and other services, andto make available medical officers to carry out certain specific statutoryfunctions of local authorities.   Conversely AHAs will need help from localauthorities.   For example, whatever the outcome of the review of thefuture of hospital social work which is currently proceeding they will need the advice and help of staff of the social service department of thecounty councils.   Health and local authorities will also need to co-operate in the field of health education, for which both will have powers.3
8      The working party has recommended that statutory joint consultativecommittees should be set up in each area to advise the authorities onthe planning and operation of services of common concern.   One suchcommittee, containing county council and health authority representatives,might be concerned with school health and with co-ordination of health and personal social services;   another, including representatives ofthe Area Health Authority and of each district council, with co-co-ordination between the NHS and environmental health and housing.   The committees would be supported by groups of senior officers.   Local authorities would also be recommended to co-opt to their relevant committeesmembers or officers of the AHA;   AHAs themselves will always include members of the matching County Council (see paragraph I5).   To underlinethe importance of joint consultative committees it is proposed thatthere shall be statutory provision for them.9      The working party is continuing its study of the details of thearrangements and is to remain in being to advise on guidance to thenew authorities.PART   II   DIRECTLY   ACCOUNTABLE   AREA   HEALTH   AUTHORITIES:MEMBERSHIP, FUNCTIONS, ORGANISATION   AND   SUPPORTING   STRUCTURESFunctions of Area Health Authorities10    There must be a strategy for health for Great Britain as a whole and, consistently with this, a strategy for Wales for which theSecretary of State for Wales id.ll be responsible.   But this broadstrategic framework shov]d itself be built up from the advice of those with direct experience of health problems and responsibility for meetingthem.   Within it, an integrated health service can best be provided ifreal responsibility for planning and running it is carried out by a unified administration as close as possible to the people being se&quot; vsd.The Secretary of State win look directly to the eight Area health authorities to secure these aims.   They will have the key role*Assisted and complemented by professional advisory bodies they will,through the formulation of their own planning proposals and throughk
regular central consultations at both chairman and officer level,contribute fully to the development of the pattern of health services for Wales as a whole.   They will be direct agents of the Secretary ofState answerable to him for the efficient planning, organisation and administration of integrated health services within their areas andwill carry a prime responsibility for the quality of the health tareprovided for the people they respectively serve.   In some expert andtechnical fields it is clear that a degree of centralisation will makethe most effective use of available resources and for this a centralsupporting agency will be created;   and there must be overallco-ordination, leadership and ultimate control by the Secretary of Statewho is accountable, through Parliament, for the provision and efficientrunning of the health service in Wales.   While there must be flexibilityto respond over the years to experience of the most effective way to administer the services in the interests of the Principality, theGovernment will make sure that the authority and status of the AHAs ismaintained by giving them all the responsibility which they can reasonably exercise.   In this way they will best attract and retain menand women of vision and ability to lead them as members and as senior officers;   and by this means they will best serve their communities.Direct Delegation:   No Intermediate Tier11    Both the Consultative Document and the Green Paper of March 1970proposed that as - te number of Area Health Authorities in Wales wouldbe small enough to permit it, they should be directly responsible to theSecretary of State without the interposition of an intermediate all-Walesauthority.   There has been debate on this.   Some have argued that if anall-Wales authority were introduced v/hich was responsible for strategicplanning and co-ordination and for supervision &amp;r monitoring of AHAs itwould put the efficiency of the Area Health Authorities to the test andensure better planning and the adoption of better standards of service.Others are convinced that an intermediate tier would be to the detriment of the service.   They see such an institution as too remote from thepeople and areas to be served, as interposing an unnecessary tier betweenthe Secretary of State who has overall responsibility to Parliament and5
the people and the Area Health Authorities who have the responsibility of planning and running the service.   They also suggest that there would beproblems of blurred and overlapping responsibilities and that thereduction in status and responsibilities of Area Health Authorities would adversely affect their ability to attract and retain members and staffof high quality.12    The decision that Area Health Authorities shall be directlyaccountable to the Secretary of State for planning and running their services has been taken after careful consideration of these contrastingviews.   The Government readily acknowledge that the policies and standards of service in the National Health Service should be open to seriousexamination both from within the Service and from outside.   But this doesnot require the introduction of a special body between the Area health authorities and the Welsh Office.   It can be effected by giving strength to the Area Health Authorities and to the advisory machinery, and byconstructive examination by the Welsh Office on behalf of the Secretaryof State.   Moreover there is wide agreement that the interests of patients and communities will best be served by arrangements designed to enhance the quality and responsibility of local management where thevoice of the public will be directly heard through the Community HealthCouncils (see paragraphs 19-22).   It is with these considerations in mind that the Government have decided that it would be better not to create an intermediate tier but to put the AHAs in direct relationship to theSecretary of State.13     This decision in no way implies criticism of the Welsh Hospital Board.The Government pay tribute to the valuable service which the Board has given and the energy and dedication which its chairman, members and officers have throughout brought to their tasks. x But the circumstanceshave changed since the Welsh Hospital Board was set up as one of a numberof regional hospital boards accountable to a single health Minister for england and Wales.   The transfer of ministerial responsibility for theconduct of the health service in the Principality to the Secretary ofState for Wales gives effect to the view that ministerial concern withand accountability for the service in Wales should be closer and more6
direct than had been practicable under the former arrangements.   this principle would be difficult to reconcile with an administrative system in which the central responsibility for overall co-ordination of planning,for allocating resources and for monitoring the performance of operational authorities was delegated to an agent authority.   In thedifferent circumstances of England an intermediate tier is appropriate.In Wales reorganisation of the service should recognise the smaller scale and turn it to advantage.Membership of Area Health AuthoritiesIk    The health service is a complex enterprise.   Each Area health authority will employ a large staff and administer an annual budgetrunning into millions of pounds.   Good management is essential to makethe best use of these resources for the benefit of patients and thecommunity;   and this must be the dominant consideration in determining the composition of Area Health Authorities.   To work effectively theymust be compact and their membership must combine relevant experience,power of analysis, judgment and leadership and vigorous concern for making the service work well.   A proper balance of these personalqualities can best be ensured if most members are chosen pfter appropriateconsultations, rather than serving as representatives reflecting theviews of particular interests.15    The Area Health Authority will normally have about 15 members.Its chairman will be appointed by the Secretary of State.   Four members will be appointed by the matching County Council to help foster closelinks with their related services.   Two in South Glamorgan and one ineach other Area will be appointed by the Secretary of State on the nomination of the University of Wales to ensure representation of the welsh National School of Medicine,   The remaining members will be chosenand appointed by the Secretary of State after consultation with appropriate organisations, including those representing the main health professions;   where an Area has significant working links with anothermedical school this will also be reflected in the consultations.   In all areas some of these members will be chosen from the healing professionsand although the proportion will not be prescribed, and may vary with7
time and place, it is intended that there shall always be doctors and atleast one nurse or midwife in the membership of each Authority.   though they will be entitled to the usual allowances members will as now bevolunteers serving in an unpaid capacity, but because financial considerations might impede chairmen from meeting the heavy demands which will be made on their time, legislation will make it possible toremunerate them on a part-time basis;   the same financial provisions will apply to the chairmen and members of the Welsh Health Technical ServicesOrganisation and any other health authority which may be set up for particular functions (see paragraph ^0).Medical and Dental Teaching and Research16    The close partnership between the health service and the medical and dental schools of the University of Wales will continue and the importanceof the facilities provided in support of medical and dental teaching andof associated research will be recognised.   The extent of the specialisedservices provided by the University Hospital of Wales for patients fromall parts of the Principality v/ill be reflected in the allocation of resources to South Glamorgan Area Health Authority.   As already indicated(paragraph 15), the University will nominate two members to this Authority.In addition the Secretary of State will ensure that members with teachinghospital experience are among those members chosen and appointed by him.Total membership of the Authority will need to be greater than that ofother AHAs to reflect the special teaching functions.   The Welsh NationalSchool of Medicine is, of course, already represented on the recentlyformed Welsh Committee for post-graduate medical and dental education,which in the continued discharge of its functions will maintain close contact with the Welsh Office and with AHAs.   There will similarly belinks between Welsh Office, AHAs and professional bodies and committeesconcerned with nursing and other training.Professional Advisory Machinery17    The administrative structure of the health service exists toenable the healing professions to bring their skills to the people inthe most effective way.   It cannot work properly without the expert8
advice of the professions.   Although members of the healing professionswill be included in the membership of Area Health Authorities they willbe there in a personal capacity rather than as spokesmen of the collective views of the professions.   Each Area Health Authority will therefore require strong professional advisory machinery, v/hich the professions will be invited to set up and which will be statutorilyrecognised.   It will enable the professions to participate in the formulation and implementation of policy, offering a regular channelthrough which expert advice on matters of principal and of detail canbe proferred and sought.18     The detailed arrangements will be worked out with the individualprofessions and will vary from one to another.   They will include provision for successors to the present local medical, dental,pharmaceutical and optical committees, to carry out statutory functions in relation to the family practitioner services, including appointmentof members to the Family Practitioner Committee (see para 28).   It isvery desirable that they should also enable the advice of those working in general pragtice and those working in hospitals to be concerted.   Thearrangements should build on the best of existing experience - forexample on the means by which concensus medical views emerge within thehospital service - and so far as possible there should be a representativestructure at district level (see paragraphs 2k and 25) as well as atarea level.   Doctors, dentists, nurses and midwives, pharmacists andopticians are already considering these matters.Community Health Councils19     It is important that Area Health Authorities should act in fullunderstanding of the views and wishes of the people they serve and thatthere should be effective representational machinery to this end.   Theprevious administration proposed that this should be achieved by looking to members of the AHA to act in a representative capacity and through thecreation in some Areas of district committees combining AHA members andlocal people and playing some undefined part in managing the service.The Government believes that this would have led to confusion.   It is better to set up bodies which specifically represent local views and can bring these views to bear on management.9
20    Each AHA will therefore be required to set up one or moreCommunity Health Councils for this purpose,   where services are administered through health districts one must be set up for each suchdistrict, with discretion for more if local circumstances point to theneed.   Membership will normally be between 20 and 30, half being appointed by the related local government district councils, most ofthe remainder on the nomination of local voluntary bodies concernedwith the service and some after consultation with other interestedlocal organisations.   Councils will appoint their own chairmen.21    The Council will have powers to secure information, the right to visit hospitals and other institutions managed by the AHA, and readyaccess to the Authority and its senior officers in the district and area.Councils will be free to arrange their affairs so that particularmembers take a special interest in individual localities and hospitals.The AHA will consult the Council on its general development plans andparticularly on important proposals to vary the pattern of the service,including changes in use, or closure, of hospitals.   Apart from regularinformal meetings, the full AHA will formally meet representativesof all its Community Health Councils at least annually.   Each council will be expected to publish an annual report and the AHA to publish a record of its consideration of the issues raised in it.   The AHA willprovide accommodation and secretarial staff and will meet expenses ofthe Council and its members.22    These arrangements will give Community Health Councils every opportunity to represent effectively the interests of the local people.It is expected that they will adopt a positive role in reviewing the adequacy of local services and making recommendations for their improvement.Given a constructive and realistic approach they will exert stronginfluence on the AHA&apos;s policies and practices and will play an important part in helping to make a better service.10
The Organisation of Area Health Authorities23    The Consultative Document promised a study into the best managerialarrangements within Area Health Authorities.   It was started last yearby a study group working under the direction of a Steering Comiritteewhich includes members from the three present arms of the service andfrom the Welsh Office.   Tentative ideas have been formulated and embodied in a document distributed widely at the end of April among thoseworking in the health service in Wales.   These ideas are now being developed and modified as necessary in the light of a series of discussions throughout Wales designed to produce recommendations to theSecretary of State which take account of the circumstances of thevarious prospective health areas.   Recommendations are expected in thelate summer.   They will be mainly matters for administrative guidance and decision.   Before final decisions are taken on them there willbe formal consultations with representative bodies.2k    The closer to the patient that management of the integrated service can be brought the better the prospects of getting the right care at theright time and in the most effective way.   The Area Health Authority isthe smallest unit which can effectively carry responsibility for integratedplanning, in collaboration with corresponding local authorities;   andthere will need to be close contact and joint planning between neighbouringauthorities, since patients will often cross administrative boundariesfor particular forms of care.   Many day to day decisions on how care can best be provided and organised will be taken very much closer to individual patients - eg by general practitioners and by clinicians,nurses and administrators working in hospitals and in the community.But at this level there must inevitably be some specialisation offunction and, though there are already arrangements to help them fit their services together, more formal and comprehensive management co-ordinationmust be carried out on a rather larger scale in order to achieve fullintegration in the deployment and operation of services.   In some casesthis may need to be done on a full Area basis because of the physicalpattern in which one of the components - the hospital service - isalready set.   But in others the main health needs of the majority ofthe population are met within two or more localities smaller than the11
Area itself.   Where appropriate it is proposed that Area health authorities shall operate their services on the pattern of these health&quot;districts&quot;, which will be served by general practitioners, community health services and a district general hospital or one or more majoracute hospitals carrying out nearly equivalent functions;   thepreliminary work of the management study has already sufficientlydemonstrated the potential advantages.25    Health districts will not be a separate formal level of authoritybelow the Area Health Authority;   rather they will be decentralisedunits of its administration exercising, at officer level, substantialdelegated management responsibilities for the operation of the service.They cannot be wholly self-sufficient and will be actively controlled and co-ordinated by the AHA and its chief officers to secureconsistency of standards and effective and economical use of resources.26    The ideas now under examination by the Steering Committee contemplate that Area Health Authorities would manage their services through chief officers acting together as a co-ordinated team.   Where day to day administration of services was through two or more health districtsthere would be delegation to district teams.   The nucleus at each level would be a medical officer, a nursing officer, a finance officer andand administrator;   clinicians would also play a direct part in management, through the inclusion of members of the representativemedical committee on the district team.   Other heads of services would join team meetings when their services were involved and would havethe same access to the Authority on professional matters.   Subject toreserving to itself the key decisions on policies, plans and resourceallocation and to exercising overall control the Authority would aim atthe greatest possible delegation;   responsibilities and accountabilityat all levels would be closely defined.12
27    Area Health Authorities will appoint and employ all their ownstaff.   This will include consultants and other senior medical and dental staff for whom the appointment procedures will be on the linesof those now operated in the hospital service.   The clinical freedomof individual members of all the healing professions will of course be fully preserved.Family Practitioner Services28    General medical and dental practitioners, ophthalmic medical practitioners, opticians and pharmacists will continue to provide their services as independent contractors.   Each Area Health Authority willbe required by statute to set up a Family Practitioner Committee toenter into and administer contracts with individual practitioners inaccordance with nationally determined terms of service and unchangedstatutory disciplinary arrangements.   The Committee, which will appointits own chairman, will have 30 members, 11 appointed by the AHA(including at least one members of the AHA itself), h by the CountyCouncil and 15 by professional committees for the area.   Of theseprofessional members 8 will be doctors, 3 dentists, 2 pharmacists,1 an opthalmic optician and 1 a dispensing optician.29    On matters concerning the contracts of practitioners the Committeewill deal direct with the Welsh Office.   But for the full benefits of integration to be achieved, matters involving other parts of theservices must be the responsibility of the Area Health Authority.These will include, for example, arrangements to enable family doctorsto have access to hospital diagnostic facilities and to be associatedwith the provision of hospital services and preventive medicine;general arrangements for nursing and other skilled staff employed bythe AHA or by the local authority to work with family doctors;   and the planning of health centres and of other changes in the pattern of services.   The AHA will of course consult the Family PractitionerCommittee and the professional committees fully in these matters before making decisions.13
30    Staff serving the Family Practitioner Committee will be employedby the AHA, appointments of senior staff being made afterconsultation with the Committee,   Some staff may make this work theircareer;   but others will benefit from the opportunities for widerexperience and the flexibility will enhance the Committee&apos;s prospects of attracting the right people to its service.Ik
PART   III   CENTRAL   organisation the Secretary of State and the Welsh Office31    The Secretary of State, acting through the Welsh Office, will provideAHAs with central policy guidance, determine national priorities,co-ordinate area plans into a coherent overall plan and allocateresources between the different areas.   This will include provisionfor particular AHAs to administer the blood transfusion services andthe rarer specialities such as radiotherapy or cardiac and thoracicsurgery, which need to be planned on an all-Wales basis.   Complementsof scarce categories of staff will need to be controlled to ensure thatthey are suitably deployed.   The Secretary of State must also maintaingeneral financial and cost control and satisfy himself that the AHAs,as his agents, are providing acceptable standards of care in accordancewith agreed plans and in collaboration with local authorities and thatthey are managing the service efficiently and humanely.Participation in Central Decisions32    Reference has already been made to the importance which theSecretary of State attaches to securing that the health serviceparticipates effectively in the central processes of policy making and decision and to ensuring that his central control is so exercisedthat it does not undermine the authority and responsibility of AHAs.There will be a very close, continuing relationship between AHAs andthe Welsh Office with flexible arrangements for regular discussions at chairman and officer level;   expert panels will be brought together as necessary for consideration of particular problems.   AHAs collectivelywill be fully associated with formulation of the principles on whichresources will be allocated from year to year.   Within agreed policies and overall plans AHAs will have wide discretion to take account oflocal circumstances and needs.   Similarly in the development of a centralintelligence and management information system to assist AHAs indischarging their management responsibilities effectively and in15
evaluating alternative means of meeting needs, it is expected thatthey will both contribute initiatives to the centre and be positively-associated with decisions.33    It is intended that monitoring by AHAs of their own performance and overall monitoring by the Secretary of State shall progressivelybe based on the systematic collection and analysis of statistical andother management information to assess performance against agreed plans,themselves systematically conceived and expressed.   For this, improvedfinancial information systems are being developed and more effectiveyardsticks of need and performance will need to be worked out.   Theywill take time to perfect.   There will always be a close need for personal contacts and visits by AHAs within their areas and Departmentalofficers will similarly need to have personal knowledge of problems.Visiting and advice by central auditors and by the Hospital advisory service will also continue to play a valuable part.   But as moresystematic management information is developed such arrangements willincreasingly be seen in their true context of supporting the AHA in itsown management role.Jtk    Reorganisation will bring about changes in the role of the welsh Office which will have implications for its staffing and internalorganisation.   It must support the Secretary of State in his newaccountability for the administration of services transferred from localauthorities.   It will also be discharging major functions of co-ordination and resource allocation (but not largely executive functions - see paras39-^1) which, for hospital services, are currently delegated to the welsh Hospital Board.   The direct Welsh Office concern with the problemsof AHAs and the intimate links which it will maintain with them willrequire some increase in its staff resources.   At the same time it must ensure that its own approach to AHAs fully reflects the integrationwhich reorganisation of the service is designed to achieve. the prospective staffing and structure requirements of the Welsh Office arebeing examined so that the appropriate changes may be made.   In any16
necessary augmentation of its staff the Welsh Office will seek to drawto the fullest extent practicable on staff at present serving in the health Service.   These matters and terms of transfer will be discussed with the staff associations and with the Staff Commission (seeparagraph 49).35    The health service in Wales cannot effectively be planned and operated in isolation.   Neither patients nor the health professionswish to be confined by administrative boundaries;   and Wales can benefitgreatly from the additional strength, knowledge and experience which comes from participating in arrangements which cover England and Wales,or Great Britain, as a whole.   Broad health policy will therefore continueto be conceived, and pay and conditions of service for staff andpractitioners to be settled, on a national basis with Welsh participation;similarly there will be common policies in staff training and joint staff advisory machinery.   Financial, statistical and managementinformation and control systems will also be closely compatible andthere will be co-ordination of research of all kinds and sharing of itsresults;   supplies will be organised on a national basis where this isadvantageous.   In all such respects the Welsh Office will continue to operate in close consultation with the Department of Health and social security.Central Professional Advice36    Just as Area Health Authorities need the expert advice of the professions, so does the Secretary of State.   In the formulation ofnational policies he will, jointly with the Secretary of State for social Services, have the advice of the Central Health Services Counciland its expert Standing Advisory Committees whose constitution will be adjusted to meet the needs of the reorganised service.   In the applicationof national policies to the circumstances of Wales he and his officers will look for professional advice to committees representative of themain health professions in Wales.   The arrangements for this will alsobe worked out with the professions, who are already looking at the17
considerations.   For example, in the medical profession the all-Walesadvisory Committee will need to reflect a balance of the interests ofgeneral practice, school health and community work, and hospitalspecialities including the rarer ones;   it must also cover the interestin medical manpower and medical education and research.Advice from the Welsh Council37    The Consultative Document suggested that for strategic advice on general health matters in Wales the Secretary of State should look to anew Welsh Health Council reflecting a wide range of health interests inall parts of Wales.   This proposal met an indifferent response.   doubts were expressed whether the creation of such a body iras justified.   Theproposal has been reconsidered in the light of these comments and of thedevelopment of the proposals for the involvement of the health professionsand the Area Health Authorities in central processes.   The arrangements will be fully adequate to ensure that the Secretary of State receivesinformed advice reflecting these viewpoints;   there remains the questionof ensuring that health policies are considered against a wider background.The Welsh Council has represented that its own concern with general questions of economics, transport, planning and the environment - andparticularly its concern with social service matters - places it in abetter position to provide such a perspective than a body whose remitwas confined to the health service alone.38    The Government accept the force of these arguments.   Subject,therefore, to review in the event of any substantial change in thecharacter and role of the Welsh Council following consideration of therecommendations of the Commission on the Constitution the Secretary ofState will continue to seek strategic advice from&apos;the Welsh Council which already has a Health and Social Services Panel, rather than from aseparately constituted body.*18
Welsh Health Technical Services Organisation39    In all the main areas of planning and decision the Government aresatisfied of the advantages of very substantial delegation to Area health authorities.   But for a number of specialised and technical supportingtasks the balance of advantage will still lie in the increased efficiencywhich can be secured by a degree of centralisation.   These will includethe design and execution of major capital works;   the systematicevaluation of contracting arrangements for supplies, the negotiation of central contracts where the Secretary of State judges them appropriate and the provision of expert advice to the supplies officers whom AHAswill themselves employ; a computer-based central management informationservice and such other specialist management services as are judgedappropriate from time to time.hO    A Welsh Health Technical Services Organisation (WHTSO) will be created to carry out functions of this kind.   Its role will be complementary to that of AHAs and the Welsh Office.   For example its central computerservice will provide comparative statistical material to augment themanagement information which each AHA itself produces and will also beused by the Welsh Office in support of its central intelligence andmonitoring functions.   In its technical fields WHTSO will be responsiblefor guiding AHAs on behalf of the Secretary of State and for providinghim with expert assessments of current arrangements.   Study of the extentto which WHTSO should be.charged with particular functions on itsinception is still proceeding.   It may be advantageous to bring thework of the Welsh Joint Pricing Committee under the wing of WHTSO with arrangements to safeguard the interests of chemists and doctors;   thiswill be discussed with the bodies concerned.   Approval and pricing of dental estimates will continue to be carried out on an England and Walesbasis by the Dental Estimates Board.19
*f1    The function of WHTSO in relation to the design and executionof capital works will be of major importance.   The AHAs will develop their plans for capital programmes year by year for the approval of theSecretary of State.   But the detailed planning, design and execution ofany substantial capital work calls for expert teams of scarce specialistswho require a continuity and span of v/ork and experience which cannot beprovided on an area by area basis.   It is proposed that these skills shallbe concentrated in WHTSO.   It will be responsible directly to theSecretary of State for major works but responsibility for less complexworks of defined types, for which there is adequate central guidancematerial on design and cost, will as far as possible be delegated toAHAs who will make use of the expert staff of WHTSO as necessary.   the precise arrangements are still under study.   There will be provision forAHAs to make use of design capacity which local authorities may make available and for continuing use of private consultants consistently with efficient employment of the central team.k3    The Welsh Health Technical Services Organisation will be headed by asmall Board consisting of a chairman and some 5 to 7 members appointed bythe Secretary of State.   It is envisaged that the Board would be concerned primarily with the management of its own organisation and its internalefficiency and with ensuring that it keeps abreast of the latesttechnical developments and is able to meet demands.   The detailed workon individual projects would fall to its professional officers who shouldbe given the maximum freedom to work in direct relationship with officersof AHAs and the Welsh Office.   The staffing structure of the organisation is under study.Financial Administration /kj)    Finance for the reorganised service will come almost entirely from central government;   charges to patients for certain services willcontinue to meet a small part of the overall cost.   The relief to localauthorities of expenditure on transferred services will be taken into20
account in the calculation of grant to them.   The Secretary of state will allocate revenue and capital funds to Area Health Authorities,with provision for separate funding of payments to family practitioners.Provisional forward financial ceilings will be notified together withprovisional approvals for capital schemes so that AHAs may preparerolling plans on a realistic basis.   Allocations will take account ofspecial responsibilities and of services provided to patients fromother areas; generally, they will seek progressively to promote good andcomparable standards of care for all the people of the Principality.Finance will be provided directly to the Welsh Health Technical ServicesOrganisation for the capital schemes for whose execution it will beresponsible and also for the cost of common services, eg from the centralsupply unit and the computer unit, provided equally to all AHAs.   for particular calls on its services there will be provision for individualAHAs to bear a charge in appropriate cases.kk    Though the Secretary of State will wish to be satisfied, throughthe examination of plans and estimates, that the general balance of provision between particular patient and community groups and betweentherapeutic and preventive services fairly reflects the balance of needs and is consistent with approved strategic policies, the aim will be toleave AHAs as much discretion as possible in the distribution of their resources.   As previously indicated (paragraph 33) improved financialsystems are being developed to assist in budgeting, financial monitoringand overall management control.21
PART IV THE STAFF OF THE service the new opportunitiesk$    The health service works through its staff and to them must go themain credit for its very real achievements over the years since 19^8.   Theadministrative changes which this White Paper foreshadows are designed toprovide a more effective framework for the release of their skills andenergies.   There will be new opportunities to take a wider and morecoherent view of health care.   For example medical administrators, asspecialists in community medicine with a vital role in planning andmanaging the unified service, will be concerned not only with developingpreventive and domiciliary health services and with the provision of medical advice and help to local authorities, but also with the overallassessment of health needs and the most effective ways of meeting them,and with promoting functional integration within the service and closeplanning and working links with related services.   For them and fornursing and other administrators the changes will open new horizons.   for those in clinical work the removal of administrative barriers will meangreater ease in fitting together complementary services: for example more effective mechanisms will be possible to co-ordinate services forvulnerable groups like the mentally ill, the handicapped and the elderly,whether given at home or in hospital.Training^6    The new perspectives will call for retraining.   A series of specialcourses for senior staff has already begun and there will be localarrangements for helping other staff to understand the purpose of theforthcoming reorganisation and its meaning in their everyday work.   Withinthe unified service, management training at all levels will complementprofessional and occupational training as part of the very importantfunction of personnel management.   It is proposed, in consultation withthe interested bodies, to create a number of linked staff advisorycommittees to build on and extend to other groups of staff the work whichthe National Staff Committee has done for administrative and clerical staff and the National Nursing Staff Committee has done for nurses and22
midwives.   It is also proposed to establish an NHS Training Council towork with them.   All these bodies will cover both England and Wales.The Welsh Office, as part of its responsibility for promoting consistentpersonnel policies throughout V/ales, will co-ordinate the trainingactivities of Area Health Authorities and relate the work of the nationaladvisory machinery to the training programme in the Principality.Staff will be encouraged over the years to take advantage of thegreater flexibility which will be possible within Area Health Authoritiesso as to gain varied experience.   Arrangements for staff interchangebetv/een AHAs, the Welsh Health Technical Service Organisation and the welsh Office, as part of the career training process and to help to knitcloser links between them all, will be studied in consultation with staffinterests.   Such arrangements will be particularly desirable for theprovision of the medical and nursing advice which the WHTSO will requirein relation to its building and other functions.   Doctors and nursesemployed by the particular AHA which will have the responsibility of operating a new hospital or other building will be associated with WHTSOarchitects and other specialists in the team which designs it.   But while their experience as users of the facilities will be important they willnot necessarily have the wider comparative experience of design problems and developments which comes from regular involvement in a major building programme and which is also important in producing effective and economicalsolutions.   The central WHTSO organisation will therefore need to includedoctors and nurses with this experience and since a career in a primarilytechnical organisation may not seem attractive to members of theseprofessions it is proposed that the necessary advice shall be providedby officers of Welsh Office and of AHAs, probably on medium-term or part-time secondment. /The NHS Staff Commission for Walesk8    Reorganisation of the service will not affect the clinicalresponsibilities or working circumstances of doctors, nurses and membersof other healing professions who are engaged in the care of patients.Their contract for employment, or for services, will normally pass over23
to the new authority for the place where they work.   This too will be theonly immediate change for most other staff: they will carry on working at the same hospital, ambulance station, health centre etc on the same kind of duties as before.   But for some, particularly among those whoare engaged on administrative work, there will have to be changes induties and places of employment,,   There will be problems of redeploymentand of the selection of people for senior posts.   An NHS Staff commission for Wales has already been appointed - in the form of an AdvisoryCommittee pending the passing of the legislation - to advise onprocedures to ensure the utmost fairness and to safeguard fully theinterests of staff.PART V OTHER MATTERSVoluntary help for the Service^9    There has always been generous voluntary support of the service to supplement its staffing and financial resources.   Members of the health authorities are themselves unpaid volunteers and the service owes them avery great debt.   But, besides this, many voluntary organisations andgood-hearted individuals bring help, friendship, comforts and extraamenities to patients at home and in hospital, making life better forthem in more ways than can be mentioned here.   The Government sets thegreatest possible store by this help and will seek actively to encourageit.   Unification of the service and close co-operative working betweenArea Health Authorities and matching local authorities will make it easier for voluntary organisations to see how they can best develop their services to help families, individuals and groups over the whole range oftheir needs and membership of Community Health Councils will deepen theirunderstanding of the service as well as influencing the way it works.For their part Area Health Authorities will support the voluntary organisations in their efforts to co-ordinate and increase their activities.Gifts and endowments50    Voluntary organisations also help by local fund-raising efforts andthese too will be encouraged.   The new authorities, like the present24
hospital authorities, will also have power to accept gifts and bequests,which have been so valuable both in enabling extra amenities to beprovided and in supporting research into new forms of care.   Endowmentsnov; held and administered by hospital authorities will be transferred tothe new authorities, with arrangements to safeguard local and specialpurposes of bequests: for example a bequest to a Hospital ManagementCommittee for general use in its services will be used for the same group of hospitals as before and for health services associated with them and abequest relating to a particular hospital will be used only for thathospital.   An appropriate share of the Hospital Endowments Fund, to which many endowments given in England and Wales before the passing of theNational Health Service Act of 19^6 were transferred, will be availableto Area Health Authorities in Wales for hospital and associated purposes.Patients Complaints: the Health Service Commissioner51     Like existing authorities, Area Health Authorities will be expectedto maintain satisfactory arrangements for investigating complaints from individual patients.   Arrangements for complaints concerning hospitalswill be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of an independent committee currently sitting under the chairmanship of Mr Michael Davies QC.To enable complainants to seek independent help where they remaindissatisfied with the results of investigations by the AHA, thelegislation will (as already announced) provide for the appointment of aHealth Service Commissioner for Wales.   The Commissioner will not be concerned with complaints which relate only to the way clinical judgementhas been exercised, nor with complaints against family practitioners whereexisting Statutory investigation procedures will continue and he wouldnot normally pursue a complaint which could be taken to a tribunal or tothe courts.   Subject to this, any complaint by a patient of injustice orhardship through maladministration or through failure to providenecessary treatment or care may be taken to the Commissioner if recourse to the AHA does not resolve it.   Complainants will have direct access to this &quot;ombudsman&apos;1, or their case may be taken up by someone else ontheir behalf.25
PART VI CONCLUSION53    Administrative reorganisation is designed to benefit all who use theNational Health Service by enabling it to use those resources more effectively.   The Government believe that the changes outlined in this white Paper will secure this objective.   Through bringing all personal health services together under Area Health Authorities they will providethe framework in which fully integrated services can be developed in theright balance with each other; no one form of service will dominateanother and the Government hope that between now and April 197^ localauthorities will continue the present development of the health services for which they are now responsible in the assurance that their importancewill increase in the unified service.   The matching of AHAs with the newcounties and the forging of planning and working links between AHAs andlocal authorities will help to promote the complementary development of2652     In addition to preparatory training and the preparation of guidance on management organisation and processes in the new health authoritiesmuch preparatory work must be done before April 197^ to ensure a smoothchangeovero   The new authorities in &quot;shadow&quot; form, together with theirprospective chief officers, will be appointed as soon as possible afterthe necessary legislation has been passed and it will be for them toprepare definitive proposals on the development of their services, on the pattern of organisation each wishes to adopt and on its staffing and accommodation implications.   Time will be short and their task will be greatly eased if as much preliminary work as possible is done beforehandby existing authorities working in co-ordination, for example preparationof statements about existing staff and services and developments inprogress or currently planned; and about endowments, rights, property and liabilities (including local authority loan debt) which may need tobe included in arrangements for transfer to the new authorities.   Informaljoint liaison committees of existing authorities are being set up in thenew areas for these purposes.   Their work will be guided and co-ordinatedby a similar committee for the whole of Wales in which the Welsh Officeand the Welsh Hospital Board will join.
health and related social services.   The direct and close relationship between the Secretary of State and the 8 AHAs will allow the fullest possible delegation of responsibility to them for the planning and operation of their services.and ;riLll provide for their effectiveparticipation in central decision making; this, matched by clearaccountability for their stewardship, will fit them better to servetheir communities.   Particular supporting functions will be providedby the Welsh Health Technical Services Organisation.   The community health Councils will ensure that Area Health Authorities are responsive to the local needs and professional advisory machinery will bring them the strength of expert knowledge.   The Secretary of State, acting throughthe Welsh Office and with the advice of professional and expert committeesand of the Welsh Council, will guide and co-ordinate the work of the health authorities, leading them in the search for a better and more efficient service.5^    In these ways the reformed administrative structure will help theservice to respond to the challenges of the coming decades.27
