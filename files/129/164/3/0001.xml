IflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT65CP(72) 78 COPY NO13 July 1972CABINETRENT INCREASES UNDER THE HOUSING FINANCE bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for wales. On 29 June the Cabinet asked for the best assessment which couldbe provided of the impact of rent increases under the Housing Finance Bill(CM(72) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5).COUNCIL TENANTS2. Until fair rents have been determined for the generality of localauthorities, no detailed assessment is possible. In the next year or so the Bill affects council tenants in England and Wales broadly as follows.3,        There are somewhat less than five million council tenants inEngland and Wales.i. Rather over two million tenants had the rent of theirdwelling increased by an average of 50p in April 1972.    Theserents will not increase again until April 1973 when the average increase will be 50p per dwelling or less.    Of the two milliontenants involved in the April 1972 increases, over 400,000 were thought to be receiving supplementary benefit and were thus not personally affected, and a further 300, 000 or so are likely to havequalified for a rebate and will in many cases now be paying lessrent than before.ii. About 2f-3 million council tenants will have the rent of theirdwelling increased in October 1972.    Of these:a. About 750, 000 tenants receiving supplementary benefit will not be personally affected,b. About 500, 000 tenants are likely to qualify for arebate (which may be more or less than the increase inrent),
c. Up to 500, 000 tenants who do not qualify for a rebateare likely to have increases of 75p a week or less., either because their authority increased rents in the second halfof 1971-72 (as the Greater London Council did), or because etheir authority is likely to be allowed (by a direction under clause 62(4)) to make an average increase of less than  laweek so that some of its rents are not increased above the likely fair rent.d. Between one million and ljj million tenants are likelyto have a rent increase of  1 a week.    They are tenants with good incomes who have had no increase for at least 12 months and they will have no further rent increase until October 1973when the amount will average 50p a week or less.PRIVATE TENANTS4. On 1 January 1973 some 150, 000 private rents are due to beincreased as part of the first instalment of the first phase of the conversionof controlled tenancies into regulated tenancies.    After allowing for thoselandlords who will not take advantage of decontrol, and for those tenantswho will receive supplementary benefit or qualify for rent allowances, some60, 000-70,000 tenants are likely to have to meet from their own resourcesan average increase in rent of about 70p per week in the months following1 January 1973.    The maximum immediate increase on decontrol is one-third of the difference between the controlled rent and the registered fair rent.5.        On 1 January 1973 private tenants in regulated tenancies who do not receive supplementary benefit become eligible for help towards their rent(by means of a rent allowance).    In the months following 1 January 1973 upto 200, 000 such tenants are likely to receive a rent allowance.    Inaddition, controlled tenants whose rent is in excess of their meanswill become entitled to rent allowances under the Bill,P WP t department of the Environment13 July 1972
