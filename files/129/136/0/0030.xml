Along withthe White Paper by the Minister ox Housing and Local Government andthe Secretary of State for Wales (C(68) 66), it has been considered in the ministerial Committee on Housing.2.      The financial implications have been discussed with the treasury and agreement reached as to the likely cost.    i am considering withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer how the expenditure can be fitted intothe programme for 1970-71 (the first year affected) and subsequent years.3.     i seek the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to publication of the White Paper,subject to any drafting adjustments which are found to be necessary, forexample, on further detailed comparison of the English and Scottishdrafts,4.

TEE OLDER HOUSH5 111 SCOTLANDs    A PLAN OF ACTION,-----INTRODUCTIONI1.     This paper outlines the Government&apos;s proposals for legislation\ a older houses in Scotland.     The social and human consequences of theiriI $resent condition are distressingly apparent in many of our towns.     Some; ;f these houses must be &quot;cleared away and replaced;:    others must be,. proved to an acceptable standard.     To make this possible the lav/ mustj je changed.     But an Act of Parliament can be only a springboard for thei -/don which is required and will not be effective without new efforts by all1concerned - Government, local authorities, housing associations and private3j jsners.     The Government intend to provide wider powers and now financialincentives, so that local authorities and owners can play their part.2.     In considering their proposals the Government have receivedsubstantial help from the report, &quot;Scotland&apos;s Cider Houses&quot;v  ^, publishedblast year, of a sub-committee of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee,-under the chairmanship of Mr. J.3. Cpllingv/orth, formerly Ranter LooUrrer[in Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow and now Director of the centre for Urban and Regional Studies at the University of Birmingham.     Thesub-commitoe considered that the condition of almost 300,000 of the olderlouses was so bad that they ought to be replaced quickly - within ten yearsrif possible - and drew attention to the need for the rehabilitation andapprovement of at least 200,000 more.     This means that the number ofj older houses for which effective action needs to be taken or planned in the[near future is half a million, or 30 per cent of Scotland&apos;s total stock.3.     Since the report was published, fuller information has becomeIj available from the results of a survey, published as &quot;Scottish Housing in 1965&quot;about 350,000 houses, one-fifth of the Scottish total, do not have a fixedi5Ah or shower.     Nearly one-quarter lack a hot water supply to bath, wash hand&quot;-sin and sink.     Libre than 200,000 have no internal -water closet.     Even ofioso which are thought to have a useful life of more than 15 years, 9 per cent80 not have a fixed bath and 5 per cent have no internal water closet,(l) Her Majesty1s Stationery Office, 1967.(2) Government Social Survey on behalf of the Scottish DevelopmentDepartment 1967.
4,     Other evidence ahout the highly unsatisfactory state of the olderI ioUSe3 is provided by the recently-published book, &quot;A Profile of G-lasgowHousing 1965&apos;       and by the material now being derived from the i960 SampleI Census.     It is now clear that the lack of amenities is in many ways moreI striking in Glasgow houses than in the Scottish stock generally.     Many of the1 houses in the city are tenements, and no less than one-half of them have a floor15rea of less than 500 square feet.     The information flowing from the 1 966j Sample Census details the facilities available in the housing stock in eachI local authority area.5,     Merely to have so much information about our houses is in itself a step forward.     Constructive thinking has often been inhibited by the absence ofaccurate information;   much of the information we have had - based for instance on1 local authority returns of houses which were classified by them as unfit forymm habitation - is now seen to have been misleading.I     6.     As the Cullingworth sub-committee emphasised, however, statisticsicne cannot adequately describe the problem.     Many people are forced to live: in appalling conditions:    the neglect and dilapidation of the common closes andI staircases and the back courts have often overwhelmed the good intentions ofi individual householders.I7, The policy underlying the proposals now put forward is that more shouldh done year by year to replace those houses which have outlived their usefulnessand to rehabilitate and improve those which have a further useful life.8.     The Government consider that worthwhile results will be achieved only if the local housing authorities accept that they have an important role in theirjjiistricts, not only as the providers of houses for letting, but also as the: :;-ordinators of all efforts directed to securing satisfactory housing for theP*le community.     There will be a role for housing associations, and much will:pend on the co-operation of owners, factors and residents, but the local Wising authorities must take the lead in driving the policy forward in each-strict.     Legislation can give them better powers, better techniques andA -:Uer financial arrangements.     They alone can provide the drive without which(3) University of G-lasgow Social and Economic Studies:    OccasionalPaper No. 8, Oliver and Boyd 1968.s 2*
(j.     Since 1945, the local authorities have built some 450,000 houses and;8j together with nearly 200,000 built &quot;by other public bodies and the privatetor have gone far to reduce the absolute shortage of housing in Scotland,s major contribution in the post-war period does not lessen the need for,1 authority housing activity in the future, but it does mean that theare of that activity needs to be very different in future from what it was1*5 a few years ago.     In particular, further increases of the housing stock,iiie still necessary in some parts of Scotland, have become less important3n renewing the existing stocks either by replacement or rehabilitation,isis before building new houses, it is now more than ever necessary to give;.^fiil consideration to the needs which have still to be met;   and alliierests must be co-ordinated if the right decisions are to be taken abouttreatment of existing old houses. On these matters only the local authoritya give the lead and secure the co-operation which is essential.,TJjE SPECIAL PROBLEM OF TEI^BKTJg10,    Tenements are at the heart of the Scottish housing problem.     Their% stone blocks form a striking feature of the landscape in our larger towns,lost all of them were built in the half century which ended with the outbreak:fthe first world war.     The problems they pos?s- are of special importancenot only because there are so many of them - about 400,000 in all, orfeist 25 per cent of the total stock - but because the proportion of them islatest in towns where the housing problems are most severe.! 11.    Because of their bulk, the material of which they are constructed and&quot;i multiple ownership which is now widespread among them, they are extremelyifficult to clear and demolish.     Because they accommodate so many families in&apos;Sall compact area, redevelopment cannot achieve similar densities along-th modern living standard j .     The local authority must rehouse those whosnot be accommodated when the area is redeveloped;    moreover, they must bede to provide houses for all the affected families during the period of thedevelopment work.
9 Q f1   -j2.     The alternative, to improve the tenements, may he difficult andSflstly.     The small size of most of the houses, and the number of very small1 houses, makes it difficult to provide amenities, such as bathrooms, within-lie existing outer walls.     Extensions built by conventional means would be-rohlbitively expensive, and prefabricated techniques have not yet been sufficiently developed to hold much promise for the foreseeable future.     SoI it say be impossible to provide all modern amenities without displacing somehouseholds when the improvement is achieved;;   for example, by converting threehouses on one storey into two.     The structure of the tenements is old and oftenin disrepair, and the environment in which the blocks stand is oftenansatisfactory.     Because of the difficulties, little improvement work has been undertaken in recent years.i3.     It is, however, important that the improvement of tenements shouldnot be written off as being too difficult or too costly, especially as toreplace within a reasonable period all which are unsatisfactory is likely tobe impracticable.,     Some limitation of the range of the improvement work done^ould enable the cost to be kept down.     The improved houses would generally be smaller than houses now being built, but by providing good accomi&apos;noda.tionfcr smaller households they would meet the needs of a section of the communitywhose housing conditions have often been a particular problem.     Studies ofthe technique of limited improvement are in hand.14.     One of the difficulties In the past has been the high level ofincidental repair costs.     A survey carried out recently of a sample oftypical tenements in Rutheiglen indicated that the repair costs which needarise with limited improvement schemes was not so heavy as had sometimes beenimagined.     Repair costs arising from the type of improvement work now proposed should not be a formidable obstacle to progress,..&apos;i5.     While it is hoped to develop centrally some techniques which willbe of help to local authorities and private owners, it is clear that theauastion whether full or limited improvement of any particular Scottishtenements is justified on economic or other grounds, or is the only way of
1 securing tolerable housing conditions within a reasonable period, must he: neighed against the other choices.     There is no alternative to consideringI in each instance whether the best treatment is replacement or improvement,A^W^BASISj;0R LOCAL ACTION16.     Because of the need for thorough consideration of what is the best! treatment in each instance, the Government consider that the treatment of olderj houses must be planned for often quite large areas within each local authority&apos;sdistrict.    Where replacement is needed, a procedure for clearance is alreadyI  set out in the Housing (Scotland) Acts, but few local authorities use it;any appear to rehouse tenants from unsatisfactory houses when they qualify forI other reasons, and to classify the houses in question as unfit only after theyJ have become vacant, rather than to plan the clearance of areas of unfit housing and to rehouse the tenants as a necessary consequence.     In some instances thereason is that the local authority considers the statutory provisions to be unsatisfactory.     The Housing Acts also include a procedure, first introduced in 1964, for local authorities to define improvement areas within their districts and to have improvement wort carried out, if necessary compulsorily,within them;   but only three authorities have endeavoured to make any real useI   of the procedure and all have run into difficulty, mainly because of itsI   cumbersome and protracted nature,17.     The Government&apos;s aim is to remove obstacles to faster progress andI   accordingly it is proposed to simplify and to alter the procedures relating toclearance and to improvement so as to make them more suitable and effective, andalso to assimilate them to each other since, after an area   has been considered1   as a whole, it may well be decided that part of it should he dealt with byI   clearance and part by improvement, and the local authority should be able toI   proceed accordingly.18.     The beginning of the whole procedure must however be to identify areasj    which require treatment of one sort or the other.     The report &quot;Scotland&apos;sOlder Houses&quot; recommended that for purposes such as this there should be a statutory standard of &quot;tolerability&quot; which should depend largely on objective
-onsiderations, such as the provision within the house of a sink provided withsotH cold and hot water, and a W.C., but which would also include tests^quiring the exercise of some judgment, for example, whether the house is free from damp and has adequate ventilation and lighting.     The Government agree ;bhsrtjin Scottish conditions a statutory standard would tie a desirable starting point lorjhese procedures, and propose that the legislation should introduce suitable-revisions to define the statutory standard and to enable local authorities to initiate appropriate action in relation to houses which do not come up to thatstandard,FASTER ClElIal-TCB19.     The annual rate of slum clearance in Scotland in recent years has improved steadily as follows:-1962 12,0851963 12,0581964 14,3921965 15,5341966 16,6501967 19,087These figures are encouraging as far as they go, but fall far short of theaverage of 30,000 a year required to meet the recommendation in paragraph 2 above,,Determined efforts must be made to increase the rate of clearance, and localauthorities must use a greater proportion of their available houses (both those newly-built and those becoming available for re-letting) specifically forthe purpose of enabling unsatisfactory houses to be closed.20,     Following the proposal in paragraph 18, that future procedures shouldstem from the identification of areas requiring treatment in accordance withanew statutory standard of &quot;tolerability&quot;, the procedures for talcingunsatisfactory houses out of use will no longer be related to the &quot;unfitness&quot;criteria now set out in section 5 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966, whichiiave proved to be unsuited to Scottish conditionsa     When a house is not upto the &quot;tolerable&quot; standard, the local authority will not be obliged to take action to have the house closed or demolished,,     As already indicated, the localauthorities will be given powers to take various kinds of action in regard to houses falling below the statutory standard.     But the intention is that theauthorities should be placed under a general obligation to exercise the powers
2. 3 51,5 soon as practicable, and that the Secretary of State should be able toHAiuire local authorities to take specified types of action in areas definedIhim.21,     Another factor which has been delaying progress with clearance is thef jjBpensation which is payable when an unfit house is acquired by a local-rthority.     Many owners who object to clearance proposals do so because theyArc dissatisfied with the compensation they will get if their house is classified?s unfit.     The present basis of compensation is the site value or the marketH value of the unfit house, whichever is the less, subject to the proviso that anoaier-occupier cannot get less than the gross annual value of the house.     Thej-jinderlving principle, namely that an unfit house no longer has any value as a1 place to live in, has been followed for fifty years and there is no reason for&apos;J departing from it now.     But clearance is likely to affect an increasing number of owner-occupiers and it seems right that the proviso which at present recognises the special hardship which they suffer when their house is acquired should bej replaced by some rather less limited provision.     The Government accordinglyi propose to introduce new arrangements, which are set out in detail in the nextt paragraph.22,     (l) The owner-occupier of a house which is the subject of -(a) a closing order or a demolition order under Part II of theHousing (Scotland) Act i960 or a declaration of unfitnessorder under 8schedule 2 to the Land Compensation (Scotland)Act 1963 made, or(b) a compulsory purchase order under Part II of the Housing(Scotland) Act 1966, in respect of which the notice undersection 11 or the notice of determination to purchase undersection 20 is served, or(c) a clearance order or a clearance area compulsory purchaseorder under Part III of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966in pursuance of a clearance resolution passed -after the date of this White Paper will be entitled to a special payment, orsupplement,,     Where the house is acquired, the payment will be in addition tothe basift compensation;   where the house is not acquired, the payment will bethe only sum that passes.
(2) The payment, which will he equivalent to the amount &quot;by whichrjhe market value of the house exceeds the value derived from the present statutory formula, will he payable to the owners of houses which are owner-I occupied as defined in sub-paragraph (3) below.     Payment cannot be made untilj the necessary legislation is enacted, but the owners concerned will be able toj claim later (except insofar as they may already have received the equivalentsue - for instance, on a sale by agreement.)(3) An owner-occupied house means in the first pla.ce any housewhich has been occupied by its owner or a member of his family ever since thedate of this White Paper,     Where a house is acquired for occupation after thatdate it will have to be owner-occupied for two years before the new arrangement will apply to it.     Such a waiting period is necessary in order to prevent lastninute sales being arranged simply to qualify for the supplement.(4)  trWell-maintained&quot; payments will not be paid where a house qualififor the new supplement, but where it does not, the maximum of such payments will be increased from 3V5 to 7V5 times the rateable value of the house, andthe new figure will apply to tenante d as well as to owner-occupied houses.The payments will continue to be limited to the amount required to bring thevalue determined on the present statutory formula up to the market value of thehouse.     The apportionment of the payment between landlord and tenant willcontinue to be a matter for the local authority,MORE IKPRO vTMSNT23.     Not nearly enough improvement work has been done in Scotland.     the grants which private owners may be given are of two kinds, standard grants which are available as of right in support of the cost of providing certainhasic amenities and discretionary grants which cover a wider range of work.The numbers of grants in recent years were -Discretionary grants Standard grants        Total1962 2,390 1,566 3,9561963 2,486 1,421 3,9071964 2,515 1 ,408 3,9231965 2,366 1 ,391 3,7571966 2,624 1,464 4,0881967 2,390 1,213 3,603
The numbers of grants paid to local authorities in respect of improvements to houses which they own were -1962 4271963 2071964 8191965 2,5041966 3,48119357 3,679Uuch of this work Toy local authorities was of a limited kind, designed toprovide facilities, in particular electric power circuits, which were lackingin the older subsidised houses.     Large sectors of the older housing stock inScotland are entirely unaffected by present grant-aided improvement activity.24.     One reason for the limited use of improvements grants is that themaximum amounts which can be paid are too low.     The Government propose thatthe normal maximum level of discretionary grant should be raised from  500 to 1,200 and that it should in future he possible to include in grant-aidedimprovement work certain items which have in the past been ineligible.     GrantsTall continue to be restricted to half the actual cost.     It is proposed toincrease the ceiling for the standard improvement grant to  200 and to revise the costs of the individual items as follows:-Maximum GrantNow ProposedBasic AmenityBath 25 30Wa.shh.and ha sin 5 10Hot and oold water to bath 35 45Hot and cold water to washhand basin     15 20Hot and cold water to sink 25 30W.C. 40 50Pood store 10Sink - 15155 20025.     The problems posed by improvement differ from one area to another andit is right that the assistance which local authorities can give should be appropriate to the needs that arise.     Local authorities will therefore begiven discretion, subject to any directions which the Secretary of State may give, to waive some of the existing conditions for grant.     Among those to be
1 traived might he those relating to the estimated &quot;life&quot; of the houses to heI improved and the standard of improvement to he achieved, the requirement thatI 5U the missing &quot;basic amenities&quot; must be provided at once if a standard grant: is to he paid and the requirement that grant cannot be paid if the work hasbeen started before the owner applies.     On the other hind, authorities will beI given power to impose a time limit within which any approved work must he done,26,     If there is to be a major increase in improvement activity it will be: necessary to ensure that landlords have a reasonable incentive in the form ofan increased rent in return for the expenditure which they incur.     In thefirst place, the rent regulation provisions of the Rent Act 196*5 will he! extended to apply to houses which are improved with grant assistance, even ifj they were previously subject to controlled tenancies.     It will follow that1 the rent to be charged for these houses will be the &quot;fair rent&quot; for which theI machinery of the 1965 Act provides.     These provisions will replace the present provisions under which in certain cases (for instance, for conversions) thelocal authority which pays the grant fixes the maximum rent which may subsequently be charged,27.     In the case of grants to local authorities it is proposed that theI maximum eligible cost should he raised from  1 ,400 to  2,500.     This newfigure will also apply when housing associations, for whom there may bej increased scope in improvement work, make approved arrangements with a local  authority,HviPROvEIvIEMP AREAS28,     In order to make progress with new improvement policies it will hei.:  necessary to replace the rather cumbersome provisions of Part IT of the Housing\  (Scotland) Act 1966.     Under the revised powers referred to in paragraph 18,local authorities will be able to designate improvement areas.     The aimI   in these areas will be to help and persuade owners to improve their property and to help them also by improving the environment.     In the view of theGovernment the voluntary principle must be the guiding one in all this andthe powers of compulsory purchase, which local authorities will require to have,
should only he used as a last resort.     It will he essential for the localauthority to consider the wishes of the people in the area and to explainits plans fully to them.29.     The Government propose a new grant of 50$ on approved expenditure by local authorities on works and land acquisition for improving the environ-ment of an area, for example by providing children&apos;s play spaces or plantingtrees.     The grant-aided expenditure would be limited to  100 per house in thearea.OTHER MATTMSPatching30.     The Cullingworth sub-committee strongly recommended that in those areas with the wors-^ housing problems a major programme of &quot;patching&quot; should beput in hand at once.     What they had in mind was that some means must he found of improving without delay the worst conditions in vdiich people will be obligedto live for a number of years.     Very little patching has been done in Scotlandsince grant for it was introduced in 1954.     The reasons for this are not to befound in any dissatisfaction with the amount of the patching grant, but ratherin the fact that patching relates, by statutory definition, to houses whichare unfit, and accordingly that carrying out the patching work involves thelocal authorities in acquiring and managing slum property.     The government think it right that local authorities should undertake patching work on thosehouses which are suffering from substantial disrepair but must he kept in use.For this purpose it is proposed to continue to give grants related to the costof acquisition of such houses and of keeping them in use for a limited time.Repairs31.     Much of the older housing stock has suffered because necessaryrepair work has been neglected over a long period.     Local authorities have powers, scattered through a number of different statutes, which enable them toenforce, subject to appeal to the Sheriff, works of repair which they consider to be necessary.     These powers, however, do not come into play until thehouse has deteriorated so far as to he injurious or dangerous to health, unfitor dangerous.     If the general condition of the housing stock is not to be
subject to further serious deterioration, and if the cost of future policies for dealing with the older housing stock is to he kept within reasonable bounds,it will be necessary to strengthen the powers of local authorities so that theymay intervene effectively before deterioration goes too far.     The effects of thestorm of l4-th/15th  January 1 968 emphasise the need for such powers.     This canbe done, without detracting from the rights of owners of houses, by redefiningthe powers of the local authorities in such a way that they can act wheneverthere is substantial disrepair.     The forthcoming legislation will includepowers designed to have this effect.Control^ of Houses in Defined Areas32.     Local authorities often complain that, after they have rehoused a family from a house vdiich they propose to close, a second family moves inbefore the closing order becomes effective and the local authority then feel obliged to rehouse the second family also.     Part of the remedy for this difficulty no doubt lies in the allocation policies of local authorities;but in order to strengthen their powers in relation to houses in advance of statutory closure procedure it is intended to give them a measure of controlover the occupation or sale of houses in areas which have been defined for action.     Legislation might, for instance, provide that after a certain stagesuch houses could only be relet to tenants approved by the local authority orsold with the consent of the authority.SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS33.TheGovernment&apos;s main specific proposals are that -there should be emphasis on the need to plan the treatmentof whole areas of old houses, and a new standard oftolerability should be Introduced for the purpose of defining(h)the compensation payable to owner-occupiers whose houses are required to be cleared, and the well-maintainedpayments in respect of other houses, should be increased(paragraph 2 2);the maximum amounts of improvement grants should beincreased and some changes should be made in the rules governing payment (paragraphs 2h-27);
(&amp;) the rents of houses improved with grant should goover to the &quot;fair rent&quot; system (paragraph 26) ;(e) new statutory provisions affecting area improvement shouldbe introduced (paragraphs 28 and 29);(f) local authorities should be given extended pov/ers to compel owners to repair houses (paragraph 35).
l&apos;?Il  JlMer^The maximum extra costs to which the proposals in the white Paper will lead are estimated to be -(  million)1968-69        1969-70 :970-71 1971-72        1972-73Nil Nil 1.8 2.5 3-1The proposals will involve a gradual change in the use of manpoweramong local authorities.   There is likely to be little more trainedmanpower available;   indeed the availability of vfualified sanitaryinspectors, architects, surveyors and other professional officers willbe the main limitating factor in securi. g an expansion of the type ofucrk concerned.As regards the building industry, the fairly specialised labour force wl icv the new improvement effort will require may be drawn partly from those now involved in new house construction, but will come mainly from those now chiefly engaged in repair and maintenance work.   Therepresentatives of t&apos; e building industry will be consulted in due courseabout how any necessary adjustmev t cf the existing pattern can beachieved.
