0(6815^Uth March, I960COPY NO.CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES; FUTURE POLICY ON PR.ODUCTP/ITY.PRICES AND INCOMESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs my colleagues invited me (CC(68) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4) to circulate a further memorandum dealing particularly with the four issues which stood out in our discussion last week:(i) The problem of statutory notification of pay and price increases.(ii) Powers to delay increases and to prevent retrospection.(iii) Tying of powers to the use of the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI).(iv) Application of delaying powers to levels of pay instead of tosettlements.Notification2.      The Prices and Incomes Act, 1966 (in Part II - which can beactivated annually by Order in Council) gives us all the power we need to require notification of claims and settlements as a stautory obligation.    Even during the 1966 standstill, we did not use this powerand there are powerful reasons why we should try to avoid doing sountil it is absolutely essential;   even then we should need to use itselectively.    This power is drawn in terms which enable us to be highlyselective (e.g. to specified kinds of work, or specified undertakings,or specified employers or according to the size or location of undertakings).3.      If we used this power at the outset of the new phase of policy, orused it indiscriminately, we would undermine the large measure of voluntary co-operation which we still can reasonably expect to be forthcoming.    La any case, we would be snowed under with a mass of paper (including a great many cases where increases were within the ceiling) if we required statutory notification of national and plant bargains.4.     In my view, we do not need to have reported to us every plantbargain.    We need to be known to have the power to deal with any bargain-ing which breaches the policy, and to be able to deal with it when we hearabout it even if this is after the event.    With these powers, there will bea strong incentive for employers to inform us of all significant bargainswithout the need to invoke statutory powers of notification.
Power to Delay and Bar to RetrQ3pection5.      We need power to delay wage settlements for at least 12 monthsbecause we cannot afford the general level of new wage settlements beingabove the 3f per cent ceiling.    A 3f per cent ceiling for new pay settlements would be consistent with an annual increase of wages and salaries per head of about 4-5 per cent and this is all we can afford ifwe are to retain the full competitive advantage of devaluation.    This3j per cent is less than the level of settlements since the end of the severe restraint which has averaged over 6 per cent (or a.bout 5 per centin annual terms).6.      Under Part II powers alone, the maximum delay on a settlement is only four months and thus a 6 per cent settlement would effectivelybreach the ceiling requirements even if there is no retrospection.    If wedo no more than re-enact, from August, 1968, the present power to delayfor up to seven months, settlements of 6 per cent or more could stillbreach the ceiling because retrospection cannot be prevented under present powers.7.      A delay of 12 months is bound to have a considerable influence onemployers who might be tempted to concede retrospection if the back-dating was for a few months only.    It could also influence unions whoafter 12 months will tend to be concentrating their attention on getting a new pay claim through rather than on seeing how much retrospectionthey might get out of employers.8.      The question of the duration of our powers is very Importanthere - if we take powers for at any rate two years (renewable after thefirst year by affirmative resolution), and if we have power to delayincreases in the rate cf remuneration, employers and unions would haveto recognise that the Government could, continue to delay increases in pay above the ceiling of 3j per cent annually.9.      It would still be very desirable to have a bar to retrospection,notwithstanding the inevitable legal uncertainties about its ultimateenforcement, but provided we have power to delay increases for up to12 months, pov/er to bar retrospection is not crucial for the policy.10.      For any lesser power of delay than 12 months, however, a bar toretrospection is indispensable.Plant Bargaining11.       It has always been intended that the incomes policy should beapplied at plant level.    The current White Paper (Prices and incomes policy after 30th June, 1967j  Cmnd. 3235) states that the present &quot;nonorm increase&quot; and qualitative criteria are intended to be applied by allconcerned with the determination of employment incomes in the private and public sectors whether at industry, company or plant level and including arbitrators, independent review bodies and statutory wagefixing bodies.12.      The application of the ceiling at plant level therefore does not adda new dimension to incomes policy.    But it is intended to increase the impact of the policy at this level.    To exclude the plant from the scopeof the ceiling v/ould be to leave a gaping hole in the policy which would undermine its application at national level and damage its credibility.
13,   With a ceiling policy toughly applied, the temptation to exploitloopholes is bound to be great.   If the powers can be applied to both national and plant bargains, there should be no Inherent tendency for theproportion of plant bargaining to increase.   But if we apply the policytoughly at national level and exempt plant bargains altogether, the pressure for these to increase in importance and to breach the policy willhe enormous.Arolioation of the Po^^LJSSi^^^^f^P2SSF^Jk9 the NBPI14.   The volume of cases in which we would need to use our powers isunpredictable.   It will depend largely on the extent of public support and on the firmness we show in dealing swiftly with breaches early on0   Ifwe continue to tie our powers to reference of cases to the NBPI there is a risk that the Board would become overloaded and this could react also onits standing.   Nevertheless, I have reoonsidered this Issue because I seethe big advantage of our being able to show that increased powers will not he used arbitrarily by the Government.15,   There are three categories of cases involving the ceiling which wouldrequire reference to the Board -(i)   Settlements where it is claimed that the increase is not morethan 3^ per cent and where examination by the Board would helpin establishing the facts.   This independent check on the factswould be valuable presentationally and the Board should be ablequickly to build up a useful case law which would later reducethe need to continue references in this category.(ii)   Settlements where it is claimed with no real justification thatthey meet the ene criterion for exception to the ceiling -productivity.   In these cases, the Board would be able to rejectthem quickly and without need for more than the briefest of reports.(iii)   Settlements which seem genuinely to be productivity agreementsbut which need to be fully examined by the Board.16,   I have discussed with the Chairman of the Board the possibility of its being able to handle a much larger flow of references, particularly those in categories (i) and (ii) above.   The Board has a considerable flexibilitym operation, a substantial membership and a large and experienced staff(now some 200).     The Chairman believes that this would be feasible, giventhe necessary gradual build-up of his staff, and that the Board&apos;s reports&quot;n such cases could be streamlined and handled largely by staff withoutnecessarily requiring an increase in the Board&apos;s membership.   I am prepared,erefore? to agree to our continuing the present tying of powers to theuse of the NBPI.-3-SECRET
^oon^jrfjjelaying Increases in Pay where these would be in treji.oh._gftt^olicy17,    There are two ways in which powers to delay unwarranted increases0an be framed -(i)   By reference to the award or settlement which is the point of origin of the increase - the order then forbids implementationnf the settlement without the Minister&apos;s consent.(ii)   By reference to the rate of remuneration of the employees concerned in the settlement - the order then forbids an increasein the rate (for the same kind of work) without the Minister&apos;sconsento18,  Action by reference to the jjgjttljjj^rrt is the basis of the limited powers of Part II of the I966 Act and the Prices and Incomes Act 1967*Action by reference to the rate of remuneration - or level of pay - wasthe basis of Part IV of the 1966 Act which was temporary legislation.19.   There are practical and legal difficulties about course (i) above,because there has to be a basic description of the settlement and thisis by no means as simple as It sounds, as experience has shown in dealingwith cases since the lapse of Part IV.   A national agreement may be involved but there are also local agreements which effectively govern the implementation of the national agreement - as in the recent case of the municipal Busmen.   &quot;/There plant bargains are involved, the pay of theworkers concerned may well be influenced by more than one settlement.20,   There is also a real risk of evasion - at least of serious complicationsbecause the parties could easily make a slight variation in an agreement and this would then constitute a new settlement which would not be covered the existing order.   It would be possible to make a fresh order but thism turn could be evaded by the making of a further agreement.   In theprocess of &quot;chasing&quot; agreements and making a series of new orders, theexercise of powers could become discredited-in the eyes of many people.2&quot;i.   It is true that course (ii) above would smack of Part IV but thene&apos;&quot; P0Hcy is meant to be a more severe one than the current phase ofModeration&apos;&apos; for which the limited powers of the 1967 Act were appropriate.-he difficulty is basically one of presentation and this could be eased-f ne finally decided that the G-overnment&apos; s exercise of the powers shouldbe tied to reference to the NBPI because then any order forbidding anUl&quot;rease ^n &quot;kbe ^ate of remuneration would be coupled with a reference toG Boarti &quot; unlike the position under Part IV when we could make such anorder wHjwut reference to the KBPI.
22,   The adoption of course (ii) is not absolutely essential to the newolicy hut it must he recognised that the retention *f course (i) - action by reference to a settlement - would almost certainly lead to serious difficulty in applying the new policy firmly and decisively.23. l L(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)jjjmup on incomes:We hope to avoid statutory notification, but we already havethe power to impose it if needed and to do so as selectivelyas we choose.We must have a power to delay for 12 months.   New legislation is required if we are to have a power of delay exceeding4 months.We must have power to prevent retrospection if our delayingpower is less than 12 months - even with 12 months this is very desirable.The policy should apply to all new bargains which increase therate at which income is earned, whether at national, local orplant level.Despite some risk of overloading the Board if we were to tieour powers to reference to it, we should continue this tie if itwould gain greater support for the policy.Pricss Aspects2K.   There is not, of course, a strict parallelism between pay and prices,but what I have said above in the context of pay about the important issues of the tying of powers to reference to the NBPI and of statutory notificationshould apply also to our handling of powers over prices.   My colleagues with prices responsibilities will no doubt welcome my conclusion that weshould continue the tie of powers to the use of the NBPIo25.  I share the hope that the voluntary operation of early warning forpricss at the manufacturing end will continue to be effective.   We are seeking, as previously agreed, a modest but valuable extension of the voluntary arrangements.    Of bourse, if the voluntary arrangements werethreatened by lack of co-operation, we could use the power to requirestatutory notification - this has always been clearly understood in ourdealings vdth industry.   As in the ease of pay, I would hope that this wouldoe on a strictly selective basis.26. We have considered the taking of power to require reduction of prices,subject to recommendations by the NBPI, and I regard the inclusion of thisPwer so tied to reference to the Board as an essential part of the new policy.Vrtment of Economic Affairs, S.W.I.,Uth March 1968PS-5-SECRET
