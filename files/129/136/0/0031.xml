DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HEP, BBJTANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)REFORMS OF THE LAW AND PRACTICE ON CHILDREN and young PERSONS; DRAFT WHITE PAPERMemoranduxti by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Plorne Affairs Committee at their meeting today approved my proposals for the reform of the law and practice relating to children and young persona.    These proposals preserve the essential principles ofthe White Paper &quot;The Child, the Family and the Young Offender&quot;(Cmnd. 2742) published in August, 1965, and at the same time meet themost important of the criticisms which it evoked.    The main purpose willbe to enable juvenile offenders to be dealt with outside the courts so faras possible, and to integrate the approved schools within a comprehensive system of residential establishments for children in the care of localauthorities.2.      Although consideration of next Sessionhu legislative programme has not yet been completed, I very much hope that the Children bill will find a place in the main programme.    It would be regarded asmaking a significant advance in the Governments programme of sociallegislation.    I should like therefore to publish as soon as possible a white Paper setting out my proposals, in order to end the present uncertainty as to the Governments intentions, and as a firm basis for consultation on the details with interested organisations before the Billis drafted.    A draft of the White Paper is annexed;  my proposals are summarised in paragraphs 49-54.3.       I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the early publicationof the White Paper0C(68) 685th April, I960CABINETL, J, C.Home Office,5th April, 1963
DRAFT WHiTlS BAP&amp;RCHILDREN IN TROUBLE1 .    INTRODUCTORYI,  In August, 196.5s the Government published a dhite Paper,the Child, the Family arid the Young Offender&quot;, in order to invitejiscussion of possible measures to support the family, forestallaid reduce delinquency, and revise the law and. practice relating to young offenders in England and Wales.     The objectives and broadstrategy of these proposals were widely welcomed.     There was, howeverless agreement about machinery,- and. especially about the proposal toestablish family councils. &apos;I This Paper, which owes much to those who contributed to theaiscassion of the earlier proposals, sets out the reforms which theSovernment now proposes to introduce in the law for England and .7alesdelating to children and young persons.,), The paper does not propose changes affecting these who commitloffences after reaching the age of 17; or in the system of courts for dealing with offenders both over and under 17a     These arejitters which will require further consideration in the light of thedeport of the Committee on the Age of Majority and other enquiriesbhich are in progress.It, The Government attaches great importance to the further develop-sent of the services concerned with the prevention and treatment ofjuvenile delinquency and with other similar problems affectingshildren and their families, and. to the continued growth of co-;3peraticn between these services.     The reforms outlined in thisIfeper are complementary to the co-operative development of these services, and nothing in the Paper pre nudges the outcome of the]overnment&apos;s consideration of the Report of the Departmentaljtamittee on local authority personal social services.     The&quot;lovernmeut1 s aim has been to provide a setting for developments whichIran be given effect initially by the services as at present organised,;afl in die course by the services as they may be organised in thepture.5i Part II of this Paper discusses some general considerations whichjaderlie the Government * s specific proposals for additions to, orteges in, the present law.     Parts III-V describe these proposalsjhhroad terms and Appendices A to D set these out in more detail,fad will form the basis for early consultations with representativesftf those who will be responsible for operating the new system,II.    CSI^JidRALI?! Juvenile delinquency has no single cause, manifestation or cure.Iits origins are many, and. the range of behaviour which it covers is really wide.     At some points it merges almost imperceptibly withtehaviour which does not contravene the law.     A child. vs behaviour^influenced by genetic, emotional and intellectual factors, his-turity, and his family, school, neighbourhood and wider social^ting.     It is probably a minority of children who grow up&quot; -
t/ithout ever misbehaving in ways which, may be contrary to the law.frequently such behaviour is no more than an incident in the pattern of a child&apos;s normal developmentc     But sometimes it is a response to unsatisfactory family or social circumstances, a result of boredomin and out of school9 an indication of maladjustment or immaturity,or a symptom of a deviant, damaged or abnormal personality.     Earlyrecognition and full assessment are particularly important in thesesore serious cases.     Variety and flexibility in the measures that can be taken are equally important,  if society is to deal effectivelyand appropriately with these manifold aspects of delinquency.These measures include supervision and support of the child in thefamilys   the further development of the services working In thecommunity:   and a variety of facilities for short-term and long-termcare, treatment ana control, including some which are highly specialised,7,   The social consequences of juvenile delinquency range from minornuisance to considerable damage and suffering for the community.     -Animportant object of the criminal law is to protect society against such consequences:   but the community also recognises the importanceof caring for those who are too young to protect themselves,     over recent years these two quite distinct grounds for action by society in relation to young people have been moving steadily closer together.It has become increasingly clear that social control of harmfulbehaviour by the young, and social measures to help and protect theyoung, are not distinct and separate processes.     The aims of pro-tec ting society from juvenile delinquency, and of helping children in trouble to grow up into mature and law-abiding persons, are eomple-mentary and not contradictory,8.  The criminal law, in its application to juvenile offenders, has for many years recognised, the welfare of the individual as animportant criterion, and has made provision for special forms oftreatment.     There has been for sixty years a separate system ofjuvenile courts, with less formal procedures than those of the adultcourtsa     These courts are staffed by specially selected magistrateswho have given much devoted attention to the problems of young peoplecVoluntary organisations have played a large part in providing residenttial and other facilities for children..     The pre oat ion service has played a pioneering role, with the young as with adults, in developing the concepts of diagnosis and treatment, both in its statutoryfunction and in giving informal help and advice*     The approvedschools have done much to develop the concept of social educationbased on an understanding of individual needs and circumstances.The institution of juvenile liaison officer schemes In some areas isan example of the distinctive contribution which the police aresiahing in the juvenile field, as part of their primary duty of crimeprevention,     The children1 s departments of local authorities have&quot;fide great strides in the twenty years of their existence;    togetherwith the educational and health services they are now closelyinvolved in preventive work and in providing facilities for treatment.9.  The legislative proposals described in this Paper preserve foreach of the services concerned an important role in co-operation*ith the others,10. This legislation will establish a new legal basis for steadydevelopment over a period of time.     The changes will be introducedgradually over a period of years.     Sufficient trained staff andother resources are not available to permit all the changes to beintroduced at once, or at any one time.     It is important that theservices concerned should not be asked to carry out new tasks before2D
they have the resources to do so.     The preparation and subsequentimplementation of area development plans and schemes of intermediatetreatment (described in Part V) will in any event take timeeprovision will accordingly be made foi1 different days to &quot;beappointed for the commencement of different parts of the new system;these will not necessarily be the same in all parts of the country.The fixing of appointed days will he decided in consultation withthe local authorities and other services, in the light of theresources available.      In particular., it is likely that the newlegal procedures described In Part III will he brought into operation in several stages, possibly starting with children aged ten andeleven only.     Meanwhile, the new system of residential care &quot;willenable existing resources to be used more producoiveiy0111 o    CHANGES Ij^LEGA^jgROgljDUI^SAims11. The response to &quot;The Child, the Family and the Young Offender&quot;indicated wide support for the aim that, so far as possible, juvenileoffenders should he dealt with outside the courts with the agreementof their parents.     There were many comments, however, that this could most effectively be done on an informal basis &quot;by social workersrather than through family councils;    and that the basic choice overthe procedure to be adopted in each individual case should thereforelie between, on the one hand, court proceedings and, on the other,the provision of help and guidance on an entirely voluntary basis,,The weight of opinion was in favour of retaining the seventeenthbirthday as the upper ags limit for the juvenile system., particularly for care, protection or control proceedings.     There were alsoseveral suggestions that there should be different arrangements foryounger and older juvenile offenders.     The proposals in this Partgive effect to these views...12. These proposals also take account of the fact that the transition from the young child&apos;s dependence on his parents to the independence and responsibility cf the young adult is a gradual process.     for most, it reaches a critical phase when the child is thirteen orfourteen.     The new legal procedures described in this Part willprovide a graduated and flexible system v/hich reflects this process.The p?coeedure for children under 10 will remain as at present;there will be new provisions for those aged 10 and under 1h, whichwill be added to these relating to children under 10;   and new provisions also for those aged 1h and under 17 which will be addedto those relating to the younger age groups.     The procedure foroffenders aged ten and under fourteen will narrow down the e ire urn-stances in which court proceedings are now possible     It represents a half-way stage between care, protection or control proceedings and prosecution.     It is designed to encourage parents to fulfil the responsibilities which are properly theirs, and to ensure thatthe child&apos;s home background is considered before a decision istaken whether court proceedings should be instituted.     Proceedingswill remain possible where they are necessary for the protection of society or for the sake cf the child.     For offenders aged fourbeeusnd under seventeen, prosecution will he available in definedcircumstances, as well as the new procedure for offenders underfourteen.     The procedure for those aged fourteen and underseventeen will provide meichinery and criteria for deciding whether
the interests of society or of the young person require a prose-cut ion or whether these interests can &quot;best be served in other ways,juvenile&quot; courts and magistrates1j, These proposals mean the retention of the juvenile courts,provision will be made for the Lord Chancellor (in the Countypalatine of Lancaster the Chancellor of the Duchy) to appointjuvenile court panels in all parts of the country, as he alreadydoes in Inner London, when the necessary arrangements can be made.At present, juvenile court panels in other areas are appointed bythe justices.     This may involve invidious choices, and difficultiesof selection in those areas where the bench is large and its individ-no members are not closely acquainted with many of their colleagues.After the enactment of legislation it will be necessary to revise the statutory rules relating to proceedings in juvenile courts,in the light of the new legal procedures.     The opportunity will betaken to conduct a general review of the detailed procedure and practice of juvenile courts, in consultation with representativesof those involved in their day to day work, with the object ofmaking any changes that will assist in the achievement of the aimsset out in this Taper.     The conclusions of this review will be reflected in the revised rales, and will be circulated to courts for guidance so far as they relate to matters of practice.     further steps will also be taken to promote the amalgamation of juvenilecourt panels where this is desirable,The new legal procedure relating to offenders aged ten and underfourteen.1a, The commission of an offence by a child of this age will ceasetc be, by itself, a sufficient ground for bringing him before acourt.     Where proceedings are necessary,, these will be brought under the caie, protection or control procedure, which will bewidened as follows.     Under the present law, contained in section 2of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963? a child, is in need, of care, protection or control if it is established that:(a) (i)   he is not receiving such care, protection and guidance as a good parent may reasonably be expected,to give, and(ii)    any one of a number of conditions is satisfied.(e.g., he is falling into bad associations or is exposed to moral danger, or the lack of care, projection orguidance is likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or seriously to affect his health or proper development); OR(b) he is beyond the control of his parent or guardian.This definition will be amended by adding, to the conditionsmentioned.at (a)(ii), that the child has committed, an offence.This means that proceedings on account of an offence will bepossible only if the test at (a)(i) can also be satisfied or ifthe offence, either by itself or together with other factors,indicates that the child is beyond the control of his parents,15. Where a ground for proceedings is the alleged commission ofan offence, either the police or the local authority will be ableto bring the proceedings.     Except in cases of urgency, they will consult together before deciding whether to do so.     If the childdenies having committed the offence, it will be necessary to prove
CONFID^mALI this in the same way as at present,, It will normally he for thej police to bring forward the necessary evidenceB     If the court Isnot satisfied that the child committed the offence, that will beI the end cf the proceedings.     If the offence is admitted or proved,\ evidence will then be brought forward by tiie local authority or the police, in the same way as in existing care, protection orI control proceedings, that the child is not receiving such care,protection or guidance as a good parent may reasonably be expectedI to give, or is beyond control.     The courses open to the courtif it is also satisfied on the latter point will be the same as incare, protection or control proceedings brought on any other grounds,j and are set out in the summary in paragraph 5h&amp;Restrictions on the prosecution of offenders aged fourteen andunder seventeen116. Prosecution of an offender of this age (except on a charge of] nomicide) will be possible only on the authority of a summons orwarrant issued by a juvenile court magistrate.     The magistrateI will he empowered to grant an application for a summons orwarrant only if one or more prescribed criteria are satisfied.,1 Any person who proposes to make such an application will be required\ to inform the local authority in advance.     The procedure fordealing with tne application will be similar to existing procedure,I Before the magistrate takes his decision, however, he will hear theviews which the local children2 s department and the police have, formed after consulting each other about: the case.     The proposed criteria for prosecution are set out, and the procedure isI described in more detail, in Appendix A,     These criteria are: intended to cover all those situations in which prosecution maybe necessary, and court proceedings would normally be taken in] cases where one or more of the criteria were satisfied;   but there will be no legal obligation on the police to make an application; for process, or on the magistrate to grant it, in all such cases.17. Under this scheme, the normal course of events, where the policeI identify an offender aged fourteen and under seventeen, the offence\ is not denied, and something more than an oral warning on the spot\ seems to be required, will be as follows.     The police will consult! the children&apos;s department and     Available information about the youngj perscVs background will be considered, and further enquiries made if necessary.     In some cases it will be agreed that no questionof court proceedings need arise0     If informal action seems likely; to be helpful, this will then be taken.     In some cases the enquiriesI may show that care, protection or contrcl proceedings would beoore appropriate than a prosecution.     Such proceedings will then bef initiated.     The remaining cases will be put to a magistrate toI decide whether one of the statutory criteria for prosecution Isj satisfied and, If so, whether there should be a prosecution,,sir ope rat ion between services1o, One major effect of the proposals described in this Part willbe to encourage and strengthen consultation and co-operationBetween the juvenile court magistrates, the police, the children&apos;department and the probation service,,     The regular discussion of^dividual cases will be valuable in enabling magistrates, policea*fl social workers to appreciate different aspects of the problems
of delinquency,,      It will be suggested to local authorities,chief officers of police,  juvenile court panels and probationcommittees that they should arrange periodic meetings, at which each are represented, to review the operation of the new proceduresin their area and tc discuss how each can make the most effective contribution;    and. that others who are concerned, such as teachers,might also be invited to attend such meetings0     The changes will increase the scope for social casework by the local authority -undersection 1  of the Act of 1963c      Informal warnings, and formalcautions, of offenders by the police will continue0     It will alsobe possible tc continue and extend the work of police iuvenileliaison schemes in areas where it is agreed that policeparticipation in preventive work is valuable.-,     The courts willcontinue to provide the safeguard of judicial procedures incases where allegations are denied or coapulsion is exercised.Miner ^nd. consequential changesIS,   The mo1.e important minor and consequential changes are described in Appendix B,     These affect police powers, remands,and the definition of &quot;in need of care, protection or control&quot;0ji
IV CHANGES AFFECTTNG TREATMENTSims;20*   The aim of the changes described in this Part is to increasethe effectiveness of the measures available to deal withjuvenile delinquency.    Effectiveness means helping children whosebehaviour is unacceptable to grow up,  to develop personalrelationships end to accept their responsibilities towards theirfellows, so that they become mature members of society;    in somecases it also means firm control of anti-social behaviour.    Inorder to achieve this aim. It is necessary to develop further ourfacilities for observation and assessment, and to increase thevariety of facilities for continuing treatment, both residentialand non-residential.    Increased flegibility is needed so as tomake it easier to vary the treatment when changed circumstancesor fuller diagnosis suggest the need for a different approach.Organisational changes are also desirable so as to provide arotting for closer co-operation between the services concerned,21 *    Three main changes in the powers of the juvenile court willbe made for this purpose.    First,  the approved, school order willte abolished;    an order for the compulsory removal of a child from home will in ail cases take the form of committal to the care ofthe local authority.    Second, provision will be made for thedevelopment of new forms of treatment,  Intermediate betweensupervision in the home and committal to care.    Third,  allsupervision of children under fourteen will oe by the localauthority.    The first change was proposed In &quot;The Child,  the family and the Young Offender&quot;,  and was widely supported0    Thethird is a modification of a proposal in that hhite Paper,    Thesecond is new.    These three changes are described in more detail in paragraphs 2h-3h; paragraphs 22-23 set out the powers of thehigher courts which will remain.Powers of &quot;hhe higher courts to deal with serious, offpnees22c    The proposal in &quot;The Child,   hhe Family and the Young Offender&quot;that the right to claim trial by jury should be abolished for persons up to sixteen, except those charged with homicide, met withalmost unanimous agreement.    In view of the decision to retain anupper age of seventeen for the juvenile court,  this right will be abolished up to that age, hut with an additional exception.Section 53(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 gives the superior courts power to order a young person found guilty of a grave offence to be detained in a place directed by the Secretaryof State for a period specified by the court.    This power will beretained.    In practice it is exercised at present mainly inrelation to young persons aged sixteen who commit very seriousoffences,  often involving violence.    The effect will be that,where a young person is charged with an offence punishable in anadult by imprisonment for fourteen years ov more, and the juvenile court considers that the exercise of this power wouldhe warranted if he were found guilty, the court will commit him for trial by a higher court.    If he is found guilty,  the highercourt will have power to order his detention under section 53(2)of the 1933 Act,  in addition to all the powers available to ajuvenile court.c3.   At present young persons of fifteen and sixteen may be committed to quarter sessions, and sent to borstal by quarter sessions,  if no other method of dealing with them is appropriate.Power will be retained for the present to commit to borstalyoung people of this age for whom committal to,  or a continuation in, care would be unsuitable.    This power will be discontinued when new arrangements have been made for treating,7
where necessary under conditions of security,  children and youngpersons whose behaviour presents serious problems.Supervision2k&apos;    At present children and young persons who have committed an offence may be placed on probation and are supervised byprobation officers.    Those found in need of care, protection or control may be placed under the supervision of a probation officer,the lecal authority or any other person.    Under the new arrangements, the supervision of a child under fourteen foundto be in need of care, protection or control will be by the localauthority;    in cases where the probation service was already working with the child&apos;s family,  arrangements could be made forthe probation officer concerned to supervise the child.    for young persons aged fourteen and under seventeen, supervision,following both criminal proceedings and care, protection or control proceedings will be by the local authority or by aprobation officer (but not,  as at present, by any other person.) asdecided by the court.    This means that the association of the probation service with young persons aged fourteen and underseventeen will be preserved.    Supervision will be for a specified period of not more than three years.Intermediate forms of tieatment25o    Existing forms of treatment available to the juvenile courtsdistinguish sharply between those which involve complete removal from home and those which do not.    The juvenile courts have verydifficult decisions to make in judging whether circumstancesrequire the drastic step of taking a child away from his parentsand his home.    The view has often been expressed that some formor forms of intermediate treatment should be available to thecourts, allowing the child to remain in his own home but bringinghim also into contact with a different environmentB   The juniorattendance centres go some way towards meeting this need,  butthe time spent by an individual offender in an attendance centreis short (up to 2h hours at most,  spread over a number ofSaturdays),  and it has not been possible to provide centresoutside the more populous areas.    The junior detention centreinvolves removal from home which,  although relatively brief,  issudden and complete.   A new legal and administrative framework will-therefore be established for the development of a variety of formsof intermediate treatment for children and young persons placed under supervision by the juvenile courts.    One object is to make possible the use for thd s purpose of facilities not providedexpressly for those who have been before the courts.   These new methods of treatment will be linked to supervision, but a straightforward supervision order will remain possible.    The newframework is outlined in paragraphs 26-29.    Further details aregiven in. Appendix C.26.    Intermediate treatment will fall into two categories.    Thefirst will involve temporary residence, attendance orparticipation, for a perioc1 or periods totalling not more thanone month during each year of supervision.    The court v/ill fix the actual period, within this maximum.    The supervisor (i.e.,the local authority or probation officer) will decide on theparticular place to be attended or activity to be undertaken,selecting the most appropriate of the facilities available underthe local scheme mentioned in paragraph 28,.   These powers willbe capable of use in a wide variety of ways.    Possible instancesare attendance for a number of evenings, or week-end afternoons,or entire week-ends, at a place for training,  treatment orrecreation;    or taking part for a specified total of hours ordays in some organised work project,  or social service,  oradventure training.    There are many other possibilities.    The aim8
I will be to bring the young person into contact with a new1 environment, and to secure his participation in some constructiveI activity,1 27-    The second category will involve residence at a specifiedI place for a fixed period cf not more than three months, beginningwithin the first year of supervision,    Again the actual length ofthe period of residence will be set by the court, withir thestatutory maximum.    Its timing and nature will be decided by thesupervisor, who will be responsible for selecting the most appropriate of the facilities available under the local   scheme.This type of treatment will be available for use where the basicneed is for help and supervision in the home, but a short periodaway from home also seems desirable.    It will,  for example,enable a child or young person to be placed for a short time in ahome or hostel,  or with relatives who are willing to receive him,I while help is offered in remedying a difficult family situation.It will also be suitable for use in cases where the childhimself needs some form of short-tevm treatment in a residentialestablishment or the kind of residential experience now being;  provided by a number of local education authorities,28o    It will be the responsibility of the local authorities,:  acting through the Joint Planning Committee described in Part VI  of this Paper,  to prepare schemes setting out the range of inter-mediate treatments which they propose to make available, whether directly or by arrangement with voluntary bodies.    Representativesof the juvenile court justices and of the police and probationservices in each area will be associated with the planning committee in preparing these schemes.    The facilities includedin each scheme wall have to come within general categoriesauthorised by the Secretary of State,  or to be approvedexpressly by him;    the local authorities and other services willbe consulted about the types of facilities to be authorised.Except so far as facilities are provided, by local authoritiessolely or primarily for the purposes of a scheme, the extent towhich,  and the conditions on which, any facility is made availablefor this purpose will be a matter for agreement between the joint planning Committee and the authority, body or person responsiblefor that facility.    Each scheme will be notified to the Secretaryof State,  and by him to the courts in the area concerned.29c    Once a scheme has been so notified, the new powers relatingto intermediate forms of treatment will oecome available to thosecourts.   When adequate facilities fcr attendance or participationare provided under a scheme the existing powers of those courts tomake junior attendance centre orders will lapse.    Similarly, whenadequate facilities for short term residence are provided under ascheme,  existing powers to commit to a junior detention centrewill lapse.    These new forms of treatment will be built upgradually,  and the initial scheme will be amended and added to as this is done.    In the meantime,  the Government will continue tomaintain junior attendance centres and junior detention centres,and will be ready to discuss with local authorities ways in whichthese facilities might be incorporated within new schemes of supervision or residence,,    In particular, it is important thatthe valuable work of police officers in the junior attendancecentres should not be lost.Residential treatment30.    The abolition of the approved school order means thatchildren and young persons who would now be committed to approvedschools will come into the care of the local authority in whosearea they live.    The basic duty of local authorities towardschildren in their care will remain that of providing the care,9
protection, guidance or treatment which they consider appropriate in the interests of each child.    This duty will includerestoring the child to his home as soon as practicable and desirable, having regard to the need to protect society whilechildren and young persons whose behaviour is difficult to control are undergoing treatment.    The Secretary of State will have areserve rower to give directions to a local authority in any case where he is satisfied that a particular form of control isnecessary for the protection of society.31.   Local authorities will be responsible for developing a comprehensive system of residential care and treatment for thechildren received or committed into their care who are not boardedout with foster parents,    A considerable variety of provision will be needed within this system, which will be described forlegal purposes as the public system of community homes for children and young persons.    The needs of the great majority of childrenwill be met by homes which, as now,  will care for them as nearly as possible in the same v/ay as a good family, making use of theeducation, health,  and other services which are generallyavailable.    It will remain the aim to secure that as many aspossible of the children in residential care use these services.This will become easier as the movement towards closer co-ordination between these services gathers momentum.    Even in thelong term, however,  there will remain a substantial minority ofchildren whose needs cannot be met in this way.    There will thus be a con+inuing need for some establishments providing education and treatment on the premises.    In some cases this will be with the limited aim cf preparing for an early return to the use of thenormal services.    In others the first priority will be atherapeutic approach to social education.    Some of thesechildren, particularly those whose behaviour is most difficult,will also need control in secure conditions,   or very specialisedforms of treatment.32.   These proposals will not diminish the need for residentialfacilities.    In particular, the retention of the seventeenthbirthday as the upper age limit for the juvenile courts means thatall the existing approved schools,  including the senior schools,will probably be required for the accommodation of children and young persons in care.    The schools will retain an imporcantrole within the new system of community homes,  in continuing toprovide for the needs of both offenders and non-offenaers.33.   Centres for observation and assessment will form an essential part of the system.    They will provide facilities on both aresidential and a day-attendance basis for children remandedor subject to interim orders by the courts, and will advise onthe treatment of children in care, so that decisions can besoundly based on the best possible diagnosis of the child&apos;sneeds and circumstances.    Observation centres will not be distinguished in law, however, from other community homes.    Thepresent legal distinctions between remand homes, reception centres,children&apos;s homes and approved schools impose unnecessaryrestrictions on making the best use of these resources.3d.   A young person who is now committed to an approved school at the age of sixteen is liable to be detained up to his nineteenthbirthday.    Committal to the care of a local authority ends at theeighteenth birthday.    A period of little over one year may not besufficient for the treatment of a young person who is nearlyseventeen when committed to care.    Accordingly, where a young person has already reached the age of sixteen, committalto care will he until the nineteenth birthday.    Provision willalso he made for a young person to be retained in care up to10
this age, even if he came into care before reaching the age ofsixteen,  if he has been admitted to a special establishment forthe treatment in secure conditions of very disturbed and difficult young people.    The right to apply at any time for the revocation of an order committing to care will remain.11
V     COMMUNITY    MES^FOR^ CHILDRENAKD &quot;YOlim &quot;PERSOM55,  The public system of community homes for children in the care;f local authorities will be an integrated system;    &quot;communitysome&quot; will oe the common legal description for a wide range ofjstablishments meeting the needs which are now served by localauthority children&apos;s homes and hostels,  remand homes, reception and remand centres, local authority and voluntary approvedschools, and some voluntary children&apos;s homes which regularlyaccommodate children in care.      The Government attaches greatimportance to the further development of partnership between public and voluntary bodies in meeting these needs, and the public systemsill therefore include both local authority and voluntary homes.?he machinery for developing the public system of community homes,and the new forms of partnership which will enable localauthorities and voluntary bodies to work together in catering for children in care, are described in this Part and in Appendix D,Mies of local authoritiesfi,  The new system will have to striice a reasonable balanceietween two rets of considerations.     On the one hand, there isa need for close links between community homes and the communitiesiibey serve.  Many children   in residential care are still membersof families, with deep roots in a local environment to which theyill one day return.     Success in treatment therefore depends, inpart, on helping the family as well as the child:    it also depends1 the extent to which the staff of the home understand the child&apos;sfamily and social environment.     These requirements are difficult3 meet unless homes are provided on a genuinely local basis, withlose links between the staff of the home and the field staff of health  local authority.     On the other hand, many of the facilitiesquired are too specialised to be provided on a wholly localiasis, and some must be planned nationally.     Every authority willish to make the fullest possible provision to meet its own needs,tat should also be able to participate in the planning, provisionnd management of those facilities which must be shared witheighbouring authorities.13?. The powers and duties of children authorities will accordinglyte extended&apos;.     To enable each authority to fulfil its dutieswards the children in its care, set out in paragraph 30, itspities will also include:(a) the preparation, in co-operation with the other authorities in a joint planning area designated by theSecretary of State, of(i)    a comprehensive plan for the development of a full range of residential facilities for children and youngpersons in care, and of facilities for observation andassessment 1    and(ii)    a scheme specifying the facilities to be madeavailable for the intermediate forms of treatmentdescribed in Part IV;(b) the provision, or assistance with the provision, of thefacilities specified in the development plan and scheme of intermediate treatmente1 2
joint Planning Conunlttees:jgs   Joint Planning Committees will be established,  covering areas^proved by the Secretary of State after consultation with thelocal authoritieso     The aim will be to respect existing arrangements for co-operation between authorities and, wherever possible, to secure a sensible relationship between the areas of;he new doint Planning Committees and those of other relevantservices, particularly police, special education, hospitals andprobation.     The Committees will be appointed by the participatingchildren authorities.      The authorities&apos;  education and healthCommittees will also be represented, and the probation and other statutory services will be consulted as necessary.      Officials of central Government Departments concerned with child care,-education and health will assist the Committees in their work,particularly by identifying needs for which provision must be madeIon a national basis,39.   l&apos;he initial task of the Joint Planning Committees will be toprepare and. submit for the Secretary of State&apos;s approvalcomprehensive development plans for a system of community homespin their areas.     The plans will be based on an analysis of the[needs of children and young persons in care, distinguishing between those which require the provision of a variety ofjestablishments provided fcr that purpose, and those which can beI let by placing children in foster homes, normal boarding schools,Hoarding special schools or independent establishments.     TheI plans will also specify the proposed future functions of existinghomes and approved schools, both local authority and voluntary,jiiich will provide facilities within the public system.     Therepill be full consultation with those responsible for voluntaryestablishments, with a view to reaching an agreed definition ofthe future role of the home or school.     Finally, the plan willset out proposals for filling any gaps in the available facilities.jShen the plan has been approved, it will be for each local(authority, oody of managers or voluntary organisation to carry outJfcneir part of the plan,1(lO.   The second task of the Committees will be to prepare schemesof intermediate treatment (see paragraph 28),      It will also beI open to the members of any Joint Planning Committee, if they sowish, to make use of the Committee for the discussion or planning of other matters of mutual concern in the child care field, such asJ training or research.,     The Joint Planning Committees will have a continuing responsibility to review progress, to arrange for theI evaluation of experimental developments,  and to keep developmentIplans and schemes of intermediate treatment up tc date,Wl.   It will be open to Joint Planning Committees to propose a rolefor existing homes or approved schools outside the new system of community homes.     For example, most existing approved schoolsIwill probably continue to specialise in social education, bat aj few might become boarding special schools or even ordinary boardingschools operating under the Education Acts.     It will also be opento Committees tc specify needs which seem to require a nationalI approach.     While the Government hopes that each Joint Plannings Committee will be able to meet, within its own system, the great; Majority of needs, including secure accommodation for veryi disturbed children and young persons who do not require or are notI susceptible to hospital treatment, it may be thought that some of: the long-term provision for such children should be the subject of13
jtional planning.     This v/ill be a matter for discussion whenLint Planning Committees are established,,      The Secretary ofState will be given reserve powers to provide, maintain or assistjoimunity homes needed for highly specialised purposes.^ .Liantary&apos; establishments12,   The new categories of community home available within thepublic system are described in Appendix D.      The details will be:he subject of early discussions with representatives of the localkinorities and of voluntary homes and approved schools.     TheIsethod of deciding the role and status of voluntary establishmentsJjithin the public system will be as follows.IJ,   The Joint Planning Committees will discuss with the managers of voluntary approved schools the future role and status of eachistablishment within the new system.      It will also be open tolaCommittee to agree with the managers of a voluntarv homeregistered under section 29 of the Children Act 19h8 that the homejshould provide regular facilities within the public system.     Whenagreement has been reached on the future role of each establishment,and the area development plnp. has been approved by the Secretary ofState, formal steps will fvg :%&amp;ken to establish the new status ofthe voluntary home or schdoCU     Arrangements will be made tosafeguard the interests of tfi&amp; staff, and of the managers of voluntary establishments, an ring, the period of transition to theict system.1.   There may he some cases where the new functions of the home orschool are appropriate to the public educational system.      In suchleases the choices of status will be those available under the^/Education Acts, and the agreement both of the local educationauthority and of the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceall be needed before the change is made.      The managers orgovernors will, however, be asked to reserve, over a period of atleast seven years,  a substantial but diminishing number of the/places in the school for the use of children and young persons in.le care of local authorities who have been ascertained as in need of special education.      These transitional arrangements will be/needed to protect children authorities from the risk of a loss ofexisting facilities before they have had time to make other arrangements.15.   Voluntary organisations which wish to continue, or to establishhhildren&apos;s homes operating outside the public system will remainifree to dc so,  subject to the existing statutory provisions as to-&quot;egistration, inspection and otherwise-     These homes v/ill be knownjas registered voluntary homes.     Voluntary homes participating inthe public system will no longer need to be registered.     RegisteredI voluntary homes will remain free to accommodate children in localauthority care on terms agreed between the local authority concernedad the managers of the home.     Any standing arrangements for doing so may be specified in the plans of Joint Planning Committees.po.   The intention is to enable the voluntary approved schools to home within the public system on a basis acceptable to theirManagers and to the responsible local authorities;    the managers:- voluntary homes on whom authorities rely for the accommodation&apos; ^ children in their care will have a similar opportunity.

The functions of local authorities under these proposals willform part of their child care functions.     They will be financedthrough rate support grant in the same way as local authority childcare functions are financed at present, the expenditure being takeninto account in determining the amount of grant.     Local authorities will thus assume a share of financial responsibility for those formsof treatment which will eventually replace junior attendancecentres, junior detention centres and borstal for those underseventeen.     Detailed discussions will be held with the localauthority associations on the precise financial implications.VIII    SUMMARY   OF   MAIN   PROPOSALS^9.   There are many influences on the behaviour of children, andthat of the family is particularly Important.     Much misbehaviourby children is part of tho process of growing up, but some has moreieep-seated causes.     Action by society to deal with children in15
if cub 3. e should take account of each child1 s family and widersocial background, and should be designed where possible to supportjjie child in the family, encouraging and helping parents to fulfill their responsibilities and preserving the child&apos;s links with his:tcal community0     The measures available should be varied andhlexible, so that the action taken in each case can reflect theCircumstances which gave rise to it and can be altered as thecircumstances alter.     The use of formal procedures should be reserved for situations where this ie necessary in the interestsif the child or of society.     Firm and consistent discipline is,fjiov/ever, a normal and necessary part of a child&apos;s upbringing,ijiiildren may require control as well as belp, if they are to overcome their problems and to become mature citizens;    end societyay have to provide this control, for its own protection and forthe sake of the child, where the parents are unable to do so.fee proposals in this Paper, which are summarised in the following^paragraphs, are intended to promote these aims, providing a comprehensive yet flexible legal framework for the development of pork with children in trouble over the coming years.juvenile eniiiep j;purfcs50,   Juvenile courts will be retained and their existingjurisdiction and age limits will be preserved.     The Lord Chancellorsill make appointments to juvenile court panels elsewhere in thecountry, as he already does in Inner London,      The practice,procedure and areas of juvenile courts will be reviewed.Changes^ in Tegal^^ix^cedu^rj^s51.   (a)    Children aged ten and,under; fourteenThe prosecution of children of this age will cease, and action to deal with offenders and to help their parents willbe taken, where possible, on a voluntary basis.     If a childcommits an offence and his parenos are not providing adequatecare, protection and guidance, or the offence indicates thathe is beyond parental control, it will be possible to takehim before a juvenile court as in need of care, protection or control.(b)   Young persons aged^jfj?ur;fceen and:undereseventhen.To enable young persons to be dealt with so far aspossible on a voluntary basis without recourse to the courts,it will be provided that prosecution will be possible only if one or more prescribed criteria are satisfied, and only onthe authority of a magistrate.      The care, protection or control procedure, extended as mentioned at (a), will applyup to the seventeenth birthday.Changes in the powers of the jeourts52.    (a)    Probation orders will cease to be legally distinct fromsupervision orders.     Supervision of children under fourteenwill be by the local authority, and of young persons agedfourteen and under seventeen by the local authority or aprobation officer.(b)    Provision will be made for new forms of intermediatetreatment, for use in conjunction with supervision, to be developed by local authorities.     These will in due coursereplace junior attendance centres and junior detention centres,.16

The separate approved school order will cease to exist, and borstal for those under seventeen will in due course he replaced.ftildren in the care of local authorities53.    (a)    Local authorities will be responsible for developing a comprehensive system of community homes for children, whichwill be planned by joint committees of authorities, and inconsultation with voluntary bodies wishing to participateand with other statutory services concerned.     development plans drawn up by these committees will be subject to theapproval of the Secretary of State, who will have a reservepower to arrange for the provision of homes to meet anyrational needs which local authorities are unable to cater for.(b)    The statutory framework for the work of the joint planning Committees will provide for a partnership between public and voluntary effort.     In particular it will providea.range of possibilities within which the existing voluntaryapproved schools may be expected to find an appropriate placein the system of public provision.     It will aiso be made possible for voluntary children&apos;s homes to become more closely associated with this system if they and the relevant planning committee wishcj Summary of legal procedures......and^pp^prsj 5h0   When the changes in legal procedures described In Part III,I and the changes in the powers of the courts described in Part IV,I have all come into operation, the position will be as summarised1 in this chart.17

B.QStrictlpns- on jthe^Prosecution of Young-&apos;.Persons&apos;Aged Fourteen^and^..Under[&quot;Ssyenteen1 .    The following provisions will be enacted by statute :-(a) Where a young person is alleged to have committed an offence,  criminal proceedings may be taken onl,.&apos; onaccount of the seriousness of the offence or of  someother prescribed circumstance.(b) The sole procedure for instituting a prosecutionagainst a young person (except in the case of homicide)will be by applying for a summons or a ^arrant to amember of the juvenile court panel, sitting in private,who will be under a duty to consider - bother any of theprescribed circumstances is satisfied and5.  if not, torefuse the application.(c) It will be open to the magistrate to decline to issueprocess if, having regard to all tin- circumstances, he considers that., although one of the prescribedcircumstanc:. s is satisfied.,,  the case can appropriately be dealt with without recourse to prosecution.2.    Statutory Regulations will:-(1)    Prescribe the circumstances in vhich it will bepossible for criminal proceedings to be taken for an ,alleged offence, possibly on the following lines(a) the offence Is homicide or some other seriousoffence;(b) the offence is of a type causing much public concern;(c) the young person appears not to be in need ofsustained support or treatment, but the nature ofthe offence and his home circumstances suggestthat a court appearance and a simple deterrent(e.g. a fine) would be appropriate;(d) the known circumstances of the young person or his family indicate that action without thebacking of a court order would not be likelyto succeed;(e) the offence is a traffic offence carrying alikelihood  of disqualification from drivingor endorse nent of the licence that r ill remaineffective after he hoe reached 4he minimum age for holding a driving licence;(f) help or treatnent on a voluntary basis &quot;ould notbe feasible because the young person does notreside in England and wales or has no fixedab ode;- 1 -

Require the magistrate to take into account whetherthe local authority, or some other social agency, isalready engaged or proposes to engage in preventivework with the young person or his family   and toconsider the advice of   he agency concerned.(5)    Empoi er the magistrate (a) to require the attendance of local authority or police representative&apos;:, if eitheror both are not present;(b)    to adjourn the application, eith r for thispui-qpose or so that further inquiries can be madeby the local authority or a probation officer,  orby the police.(6)    Provide that a magistrate issuing a summons or warrantin respect of a young person shall not be a member ofthe court hearing the case.3.   The detailed, administration of this scheme will depend tosome extent on local arrangements, but will be broadly as described below.      (This scheme relates only to cases wherethe ground on which action is being considered is the commissionof an offence.     It will not affect existing arrangements for taking care, protection or control proceedings on other grounds,or for help to be given to children and families by children&apos;sdepartments and, other services.)(1)    (a)    The possibility of action on a voluntary basiswill be considered only where the initial investi-gafions by the police indicate that the offenceis not denied..     Where it becomes known at anystage that the child or his parents deny the offence he is alleged to have committed, it willbe for the police to decide in the ordinary wayvhether to apply for a summons or ,varrant if oneof the statutory criteria is satisfied,  or totake no action.(b) In ca^es ,here the po ice do not no&apos;? prosecute,but either take no action or isrue an informalwarning,  there &apos; ill be no change.(c) Where it seems clear that, according to theprescribed criteria, there is bound to be a prosecution (e.g., in a case of grave crime)the police will apply for a summons or warrant,first informing the children&apos;s department of thelocal authority;    in cases of homicide it willremain possible for the police to charge the alleged offender in the same way as at present,informing the children&apos;s department.^ h-   - 2 -
In cases not dealt with as in (-1)  the first step willbe consults.ti  n between the police and the children&apos;department.      This will include,  so far as they thinkit necessary,  assembling and considering the available information about the child and his background (e.g.,from his teachers), consulting any others known to be involved already with the child or his family (e.g.,the probation servi.ce), and a home visit if this seemsrequired before the children&apos;s department can decide whether voluntary action with the family would be worthattempt i hg,(a) If, after this consultation,  it is agreed thatvoluntary action without the support of a courtorder should be tried or continued, or that a formal caution would be appropriate, or that no action is necessary,  the case will be dealt withaccordingly and there will be no application forproce ss.(b) If the police and. the children&apos;s dep department agreethat it is a case for prosecution    or for care,protection or control   proceedings, process willbe applied for accordingly.(c) Cases not falling clearly under paragraphs 3(1 )(b) to 3(3)(b) will be referred to the magistratefor a decision, by the police applying for asummons.Where an application for process is made, the magistratewill consider it in accordance with the provisions setout in paragraphs 1  and. 2(h)  and. (5)  of this Appendix.He will take into account all the information given bythe police, the children&apos;s department and the probationofficer where he is concerned with the case and will be free to ask them questions and to discuss the circum-stances and possible courses of action with them before&apos;taki ng hi. s deci s ion.If voluntary action is tried but the young person or his parents do n-t in the event prove to be co-operative, no further action will be taken unlessfresh grounds for court proceedings arise.      If theyoung person offends again   paragraph 2(1 )(d) will then apniy,  and it will be possible to apoly for asummons or warrant if prosecution seems the appro -priate form of court proceedings.- 3 -CO^IFIINITIAL
APPENDIX BMinor and consequential changesiincillary procedure,     Power will still be required for the police to take immediatepreventive action where a child -under fourteen is found committingan offence,,      In relation to an offender aged, ten and underfourteen,  they will &quot;be given powers to take him to a place of safetyin all circumstances in which they would have power to arrest withoutwarrant an offender of fourteen or over.2,     The existing power of the police to take to a place of safety,without reference to a magistrate, a child or young person thought tobe in need of care, protection or control will he reformulated.    It-/ill be made clear that this power may properly be exercised insituations where the protection of the child or young person clearlyrequires his immediate removal from the place where he is found,although the police are not in a position to establish straightawaywhether it will be necessary to bring him before a court.3.     where a young person aged fourteen and under seventeen isarrested for an offence but not released, on bail,  the case will bereferred to a magistrate within 72 hours.    The magistrate will&apos;havepower to remand on bail, or to the care of the local authority,pending a decision whether court proceedings should be taken.k.    Adjustments will be made in the powers of the courts to remandchildren and young persons in custody, and to make interim orders.The existing law specifies in detail the precise circumstances, inwhich children, and young persons of particular ages may be committed to particular types of institution.    These provisions will bereplaced by a prevision that all remands (otherwise than on bail) of young persons aged fourteen and under seventeen shall be to the care of the local authority, and all interim orders for children underseventeen shall commit to the temporary care of the local authority.The developments outlined in Part V will, in time, make it possible to accommodate all these children and young persons (apart from thoseaccommodated in hospitals)  in establishments provided or managed bylocal authorities.    In the meantime, the Government will continue toprovide remand, centres or other establishments for those youngpersons aged fourteen and -under seventeen whose behaviour is such that they cannot be contained satisfactorily in local authorityestabl i shrnent s.Amended -definItion of &quot;in need of care, protection or control&quot;5.    As explained in paragraph 1h of this paper, one of the testsin section 2 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 is that the child is not receiving such care, protection and guidance as a goodparent may reasonably be expected, to give.    This test will be clarified so as to make it clear that the court may properly considernot only the care, protection and guidance given direct by the child&apos;s parents, but also whether the parents are securing for himany care, protection or guidance which they are not themselves ableto give but which a good parent might reasonably be expected tosecure for his child.    This amendment will apply to all childrenup to the age of seventeen.
APPENDIX CIntermediate forms of Treatment1,     The form of the proposals described in paragraphs 25-29 andthis Appendix reflects several important general considerations whichwere discussed in the Report &quot;Non-Residential Treatment of OffendersUnder Twenty-One&quot; made in 19b2 by the Advisory Council on theTreatment of Offenders,    One such consideration is that, where possible, a child or young person under supervision should be treatedas a member of his local community and in association with others of his own age,  and treatment of this nature should not be restricted to groups of delinquents alone.    It is important therefore to make the best co-operative use of all available local resources and services, both statutory and voluntary, in providing suitablefacilities for this purpose.    These will vary from one area toanother, and the basic responsibility for their provision should belocal rather than central.   A second consideration is that any formof intermediate treatment is likely to be less beneficial if forced,upon an unwilling recipient.   Voluntary bodies may prefer not tooffer facilities to those who make use of them only under compulsionand who might disturb other users.    But, while willing acceptanceof a child or young person of an intermediate form of treatment will always be desirable, this may not always manifest itself immediately.Much of the potential benefit of the new scheme would be lost if its use were confined to cases where it was freely accepted right fromthe start.    Thirdly, the need for continuing diagnosis andflexibility of response, described earlier in.this paper, applies inall situations where a child or young person is receiving continuingtreatment.    This means t...at there must be some scope for thesupervisor to decide, within limits fixed by the law or by thecourt,  the precise nature and timing of intermediate treatment.2.     A. court which,  in addition to placing a child or young person under supervision, makes use of the new powers described inparagraphs 25-29 will normally have received reports on him andhis background- which indicate that one of the available forms of intermediate treatment is likely to be beneficial.    He may already have expressed his willingness to co-operate, and there may belittle difficulty in selecting the most appropriate form of treat-ment.    In other cases he may be unwilling or uncertain in greater or less degree, or the selection of the appropriate treatment may require a more extensive investigation of the circumstances them had. been possible before the court&apos;s decision.    This closerfamiliarity with the child or young person and his background may even indicate on occasion that none of the available forms of intermediate treatment would be appropriate.    In such a case thesupervisor would be free to continue the supervision alone without additional treatment.    Unless this is so, the supervisor will, aspart of his general duty to help the child or young person and his family, try to secure their acceptance of the treatment which heselects.    There is likely to remain a minority of cases where thesupervisor is unable to do so.    The chances of a successful outcomefollowing the use of compulsion may then be small.    Equally therewill be cases where the child or young person and his parentsco-operate for a time and then cease to do so.    In such situationsit will be for the supervisor to decide, according to his assessment1.
of the situation at the time and of the likely outcome of the courses of action open to him, whether to make use of the powerof compulsion available to him under the order of the court,with the sanction of bringing the child or young person again before the court if he refuses to comply.2.
APPENDIX the public system of community homes for children and young pe persons  -I.     There will be three categories of community homer-local authority homesassisted voluntary homesControlled voluntary homesThe sole purpose of these legal descriptions will be to distinguishthe various categories of homes, which will be subject to differentstatutory provisions.     The actual title of each individual homewill be for the local authority er managers to decide.Local authority homes2,     Homes provided and maintained by local authorities,including existing local authority approved schools, will be known as local authority homes.     It will be for localauthorities to make arrangements for their management,3.     It will also be made possible for a voluntary approved school9or a voluntary children&apos;s home registered under section 29of the Children ^ct 1948, to become a local authority homeIt will then be transferred, as a going concern, to the localauthority specified for the purpose in an area development plan.Voluntary homesk*     Tnese will be community homes provided, maintained and managed by a partnership between public and voluntary effort.Their functions and status will be those specified in an approved area development plan.     In the case of what are newvoluntary approved schools, it will be for the joint planning committee for the area in which the school is situated to initiate discussions with the school authorities about its future functions and status.     In view of the uneven geographical distribution of approved schools, however, a school might eventually be included in the development plan of a neighbouringarea.     In the case of voluntary children&apos;s homes it will beypen to the managers to make proposals to a joint planning committee, or for the committee to approach the managers, ifthey wish the home to be considered for inclusion within thepublic system.     Neither will be under any obligation to makeor accept such proposals.     The role which each existingvoluntary establishment plays under a development plan will depend upon the joint planning committee&apos;s agreement to thisrole, and the Secretary of State&apos; s approval of the plan,,
5,     Every assisted or controlled voluntary home will be conducted in accordance with its trust., supplemented byrules of management to be made by the Secretary of State,,He will also make an instrument of management constitutingthe home&apos;s managing bodyy for the purposes of the publicsystem of community homes, after consultation with the trusteestr other representatives of the original foundation crwoluntary body concerned and with the local authority erauthorities who are to be its major users.     The premises orotner assets will be vested in trustees or other representatives of the original foundation9 to whom controland use will revert if at any time it ceases to form part ofthe public system.     If the property is then sold, or is used for any purpose other than one approved by the Secretaryof   State, the trustees will be required to pay the Exchequera sum equivalent to any value then attaching to the propertyas a result of the expenditure of public funds.50     Responsibility far arranging for the assessment of theneeds of children and young persons, and for decidingallocations to particular homes, transfers to other homes orforms of treatment and discharges from residential care will rest with the local authority having the child in its care0Where the home offers a variety of treatments it will alsobe the responsibility of the authority having the child In itscare to decide, after considering the advice of the managers,the general character of the child&apos;s care, control or treatment,,Other decisions about the treatment of a child while residing in a voluntary home will be taken by the managers or directingstaff, within the framework of the general statutory rules and the rules fif management for each home,.assistance ^t^ed^ stajbus7.     The provision, enlargement and maintenance of an assistedvoluntary home will be the responsibility of the managers, whowill charge fees for the use of facilities they provide for children in the care of local authorities.     It will be eligible for Exchequer grant at the rate of 100$ of the approved cost of any building work, cr other provision on capital account, needed to fit it for the purpose defined for it in the development plan.     The rate at which building work or other capital expenditure can be approved will depend onthe country&apos;s economic circumstances,.80     The instrument of management will provide for two-thirds ofthe managers to be appointed by the trustees or other representative5f the original foundation.     The particular responsibility efthese foundation managers will be to ensure that the home isconducted in accordance with its trust deed or similar document.The remaining one-third of the managers (the representativemanagers) will normally be appointed by the local authority or authorities which are its major users.
