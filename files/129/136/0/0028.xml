SOCIAL SERVICES;  SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT:WAITING DAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Social Security and theChief Secretary, treasury on 5th March the Cabinet (CC(68) 17th Conclusions, Minute 2)agreed that there should be a compensating saving in social securityexpenditure to support a further 3s. increase in family allowances, in fulfilment of the commitment to protect the most vulnerable and in accord-ance with the need to avoid concessions for lower paid workers whichmight put aspects of incomes policy at risk.    The Minister of social security proposed abolition of any payment for the first three waitingdays of a period of sicknesa or unemployment as the least harmful saving,but pointed out that that would be unpopular with the trades unions.    Herproposal was agreed.2.      The proposal to withdraw payment for waiting days must be seen in the context of the longer-term earnings-related scheme.    It has been proposed - and the question is in fact being discussed today by the Sub-Committee on Earnings-Related Pensions of the Ministerial Committeeon Social Services -  h^t we should seek the agreement c  the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades (J^ion Congress (TUC)to employers1 cover for periods of sickness of up to four weeks (althoughit may prove necessary to compromise at some shorter period) withas. appropriate reduction in. the national insurance contribution.    Withthis in mind, the withdrawal of state payment fsr the first three days of sickness (and unemployment, which is a separate problem in the earnings-related scheme) could be seen as a first step.    Moreoverdiscussions are already taking place between the Minister of Labour, the cbi and TUC on employers&apos; cover for the first six days of suspensionfrom employment, and a commitment to legislate on this question hasbeen made.    There is thus a consistent logic of approach to both these aspects of cover for employed workers.    The Lord President will beable to report orally on the result of the Sub-Committee^ discussion ofthe proposals.    The details involved in transfer of responsibility for theearly weeks of sickness from the state to employers are complicated and will give rise to difficult and prolonged consultation with the CBI andTUC.-1-CONF1DENTSALl0C(jMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST YTS GOVERNMENT)65CJ68) 65 COPY NO.__1st April, 1968CABINET
3,      I should perhaps explain in a little more detail what the proposed change in the waiting days provision amounts to.    No payment is madefor the first three days of a short period off work due to illness, injury or unemployment;  but if such a period lasts for 12 working days or more(and for this purpose periods occurring within 13 weeks of each other arelinked) payment is then made retrospectively for the three waiting days.These retrospective payments are of less importance than they used to bebecause of improvements in occupational sick pay schemes, in theprovision made for the unemployed in the Contracts of Employment andRedundancy Payments Acts and in supplementary benefits.    Indeed, sincethe payment for waiting days for sick and injured peopoe is often offsetagainst such payments by employers under sick pay schemes and alwaysagainst any supplementary benefit paid, I estimate that nowadays only some 2 0 per cent to 25 per cent of sick people benefit from it.    This20 per cent to 25 per cent will be made up of people with incomesabove the supplementary benefit level but they will not generally be covered by an employer^ scheme.4.      However it is now found that there is strong opposition in theParliamentary Labour Party to the proposed change in the waiting daysprovisions.     Outside Parliament, the reaction of the TUG has beensurprisingly mild, Press reaction has been, restrained and the general public in so far as this can be measured by letters have scarcely reactedat all.    There is nevertheless some indication of hostile rank-and-filetrade union reaction.    The Second Pleading of the Bill is on Tuesday,2nd April and it is necessary to decide before Tuesday afternoon whatapproach should now be taken to the clause changing the waiting dayprovision.5.      There are three possible courses of action.    The advantages and disadvantages of each are set out below.A. Persisting with the Clause6.      This will provoke a difficult Parliamentary situation.     On committee stage, the Opposition will clearly join with some Government Backbenchersin opposing the Clause.    On the other hand, without the Clause, therecan be no immediate saving in social security expenditure since any alternative saving is even more likely to provoke difficulties;  and theGovernment will be accused of vacillation and surrender to pressure.7.      It is, however, the case that the proposed saving is on theexpenditure of the National Insurance Fund, which counts for public expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) purposes, but which does notappear in any Vote.    It might be that the saving could for the time beingbe forgone if there were prospects in the reasonable future of a more radical change which would reduce National Insurance Fund expendituremore drastically.B. Withdrawing the Clause and replacing it byan enabling Clause providing for compulsoryemployers1 cover for up to four weeks8.      Presentionally, this would be an attempt to make it clear beyond doubt that the Government were committed to an alternative method of reducing Fund expenditure and that the changes in the waiting daysprovision had indeed been seen in the context of more fa?-reachingproposals.    Parliamentary criticism would no doubt be confined to the-2-
r\ -? -r260Opposition, provided that the TUC reaction was favourable.    An enablingclause would permit discussions with the CBI and TUC about the detail(of which there would be an immense amount) before laying Regulations.It could not be expected that Regulations could be laid before January/February, 1969.9,      The disadvantage of this course is that, given the timinginvolved, the CBI and TUC cannot possibly be consulted - or eveninformed - before some indication Is given in the House.    Both will certainly react violently against such non-consultation on a matter which would normally be one for the most thorough discussion before any announcement of policy.    This could well prejudice the chances of achieving a satisfactory outcome (i.e. a reasonable period of employers1cover).C.    Withdrawing the Clause and making an explanatorystatement to the effect that the Government isinviting the CBI and TUC forthwith to discuss theproposal for employers1 cover10.     This would have much the same effect in Parliament as Course B,except that the Opposition would have no focus for dissent in the JLobbies.Much the same timetable would be involved, but a separate Bill would be needed; unless there would be any possibility of dealing both with thesuspended days1 cover and sickness cover in the same Bill.11.      The essential difference between this Course and Course B is thatCEI (and possibly TUC) opposition would be minimised rather thanmaximised.    The chances of securing whatever we decide to be the bestperiod and conditions of employers1 cover would therefore also bemaximised.12.      Since it is difficult co judge the impact of this course of action without an indication of just what could be said in the House, the Ministerof Social Security has prepared a draft statement giving a broad outline of what might be said.    This Is appended at Annex.    It will be seen thatit is really not possible to avoid an admission that there has been a changeof mind in response to back-bench opinion.    But this is of course alsotrue of Course B.Effect on expenditure from the National Insurance Fund13.      If either Course B or C Is adopted, the saving of  15 millionexpenditure from the Fund achieved by the Bill in 1968-69 would bereplaced by a future reduction (probably beginning in the financial year1969-70) of between  30 million and some  100 million annually,depending upon the period of employers1 cover (from one to four weeks).As pointed out earlier, this reduction in Fund expenditure would have tobe reflected in a reduction of national insurance contributions.-3-
CONFIDENTIAL9tonMANPOWER IMPLICATIONS OF POLICY PROPOSALSNote by the Prime minister it is a long-standing practice. that proposals put before theCabinet or a Cabinet Committee which would involve expenditureor affect general financial policy should first be discussed with theTreasury, and that the results of those discussions, together with thebest possible estimate of the cost to the Exchequer, should be indicated in the memorandum put before the Cabinet or Committee.(See paragraph 3 of Questions of Procedure for Ministers annexed to C (P) (66) 5.) But the cost of a proposed new policy in terms of resources in particular manpower is no less significant than itscost in terms of money. It was the practice of the last LabourAdministration to require policy proposals submitted to the cabinet or a Cabinet Committee to be accompanied by an estimate of the manpower requirements as well as the cost to the Exchequer. Thisis a sound practice, which I consider we should revive. I should therefore be glad if all Ministers in charge of Departments would ensure that any proposals put to the Cabinet or a Cabinet Committeewhich would make demands on manpower include, in addition toan estimate of cost, the best available estimate of the manpower thatwould be required to give effect to those proposals, whether withinthe public service or outside, and any difficulties foreseen in recruitingthe necessary manpower.   I appreciate that it is often difficult toCONFIDENTIALC (P) (67) 2 Copy No.    6 914 th February, 1967CABINET: PROCEDURE

14. We ask our colleagues to decide which of the courses outlined above will best meet the present situation.j.h.j.d.Ministry of Social Security, W. C. 2.1st April, 1968-4-
Draft Statement on Second Reading of the Farnily allowances and National Insurance (No. 2) Biil^Clause 2 concerns the withdrawal of provision for waiting days.Beyond this Is, hov/ever, another and altogether bigger Issue which theGovernment has been studying concerning the divs.fd.on of responsibility between employers and the state in the field of provision for illness andwhich it Is appropriate that I should now mention.    It is clear that at themoment there is a good deal of wasteful OV61* 13.13 - between occupationalsick pay and national insurance sickness and injury benefits.    Over theyears occupational schemes have been steadily growing and the majorityof workers are now covered to some extent by sick pay schemes but not all of them.    This is one of the problems with which we have been concerned.    We think that it would be sensible to ensure that all employers made provision for their employees when they are ill, duringthe early weeks of incapacity, and we have begun to consider whether itwould be right to lay a statutory responsibility on employers to make suitable sick pay arrangements for their employees for the early weeks of sickness.     My rt. hon. Friend the Minister of Labour is alreadydiscussing with the CBI and TUG the arrangements for employers&apos; cover of the first she days of suspension.    I myself have now therefore openeddiscussions with the CBI and TUC on this question and would hope thatany changes decided upon as a result might be brought into operation beforetoo long.    The appropriate provision for waiting days will of course be one of the matters to be discussed.My colleagues and I have been reviewing, against this background,the change proposed in this Clause and have reached the conclusion that inall the circumstances we should not proceed with this particular measureat this time.    I shall therefore be proposing at the Committee stage of theBill that this Clause should be withdrawn,     I know that some of my rc. lion,and hon. Friends will welcome this.-5-
