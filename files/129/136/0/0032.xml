At the European space conference held in Rome in July, 1967Ministers agreed to the creation of an advisory committee to &quot;elaborateproposals for a joint space policy and programmes in the framework ofsuch a policy&quot;.    The committee, chaired by M. Causse of France, hasnow produced its report and it is planned to take decisions on it at a ministerial European space conference in Bonn in July.    This meetingwill be preceded by a meeting of Alternates on 23rd April, and dr. Stoltenberg, the German Minister of Science, who will be chairmanof the Bonn conference, has invited his colleagues from the mostimportant countries including the United Kingdom to a Ministerialpre-conference meeting in Bonn on 29th April.2.       The problem for the United Kingdom is that the Causse report sets out for decision at the Bonn Conference a continuing and expandingprogramme of European space projects which is Inconsistent with UnitedKingdom policy.    The programme includes a European Conference onSatellite Telecommunications (GETS) experimental project for satellitedevelopment; further development of the European Launcher development organisation (ELDO) launcher;  and increased European Space R.esearchOrganisation (ESRO) scientific space activities.    A Ministerial decision has already been taken, but not announced, that the United Kingdom is notto undertake further financial commitments to ELDO beyond the presentceiling;  and the Secretary of State for Education and Science, advised byhis Science -Research Council, has recommended that support for ESROshould be kept to a minimum.    On GETS, Ministers decided last yearthat we should not take part in the programme as it stood at that time.Since then the project has changed from a communications to a televisionrelay satellite but it would still be based on the ELDO launcher.3,       The Ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe have considered how and when these decisions on European space activities,which it is not suggested should be reopened, should be conveyed to our european partners so as to minimise the damage to our relations with europe, and to convince them if possible that these decisions are consistent with our declared support for European technologicalcollaboration.-1-C(68) 69 COPY NO.     ^ j9th April, I96GCABINETEUROPEAN SPACE policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
4,       It might be easier to convince the Europeans that our spacedecisions were consistent with our declared policy if these decisions could be presented at a general technological conference instead of theBonn conference which is concerned only with space activities.    We could then more readily explain - as the Prime Minister did in his Guildhallspeech last November - that in our view the purpose of Europeantechnological collaboration is to create European-scale industriescapable of competing on equal terms with American industry, and not to foster costly, prestigious projects for their own sake.    The ministerial committee have therefore considered whether we should seek to avoiddisclosing our decisions first at a space conference by requesting the prior convention of a European technological conference on the lines whichthe Belgian Government has recently proposed.    The Committee have concluded however that such a request would not be to our advantage.    Itwould simply confirm the existing suspicions of European governments that we did not intend to support the Causse reports recommendations,and would involve the risk that a general technological conference wouldbe called before we were fully prepared for it.    Accordingly theCommittee have concluded that v/e would be better advised to make our decisions known at the earliest opportunity - and before the meeting ofAlternates on 23rd April - both to Dr. Stoltenberg and to the EuropeanForeign Ministers concerned.    If we delayed telling the Europeans ofour decisions beyond the Ministerial meeting on 29th April, v/hich hasbeen called to take stock of Government positions, and until the Bonnspace conference itself we should be charged - reasonably enough - withwrecking the conference.5,       If we announce our decisions now - and I think we must - I must emphasise the importance of demonstrating in more practical terms tothe Europeans what we are prepared to offer them by way of technologicalcollaboration.    The Cabinet has already considered (CC(68) 15th Conclusions,Minute 2) and endorsed proposals (C(68) 40 and 41) for the development ofsuch collaboration, particularly through the 3stablishment of a european Technological Centre and the encouragement of British industry generally to develop links with other European industries v/hich v/ill leadtowards the creation of European-scale companies.    We must be readynow not merely to explain in general terms the way in which we thinkEuropean collaboration can be developed.    We should also give european practical programme of action looking in particular to the establishmentof the European Technological Centre before the end of this year.6.       I invite my colleagues to endorse the decision of the ministerial committee on the Approach to Europe that we should communicate ourspace decisions to our European partners forthwith.    I hope they will alsoagree that we must have as soon as possible a practical programme of technological collaboration to offer them.    I have arranged meanwhile forthe preparation, in consultation with the Ministers primarily concerned,of messages to Dr. Stoltenberg and to Foreign Ministers explaining our decisions in the context of our general aims for European technologicalcollaboration.     The Lord President has undertaken to co-ordinatearrangements for the domestic presentation of our space decisions and policy at the same time as these are made known abroad.M.
