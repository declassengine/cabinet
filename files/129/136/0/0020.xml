C(68) 57 f COH&apos; NO,   fiflCABINETBRITISH STANDARD TIMEM!EBi? 5B^B 5. J^Y^^ JL^E^J^S cretary of StateWhen the Cabinet considered last June   (CC(67) 40th Conclusions,Minute 1) the proposal to introduce British Standard Time, they concluded that it would be preferable to introduce it as a permanent measure, andnot experimentally,,     They should therefore be aware that the HomeAffairs Committee recently considered and accepted a proposal by theSecretary cf State for Scotland that the Bill should be amended in committee so that the Act would lapse after three years unless madepermanent by affirmative resolution.2.     The Cabinet intended that the introduction of British StandardTime should be a permanent measure.    It was thought that the public would expect the Government to take an early decision on whether weshould or should not fall in line with Central European Time; that if thechange were made experimental the public would have no incentive tomake the necessary adjustments; and that it would be unwise to commit the Government to further legislation at a later date, though it would bepossible to amend the Act if British Standard Time proved unpopular orinconvenient.    In winding up the Second Reading debate on the Bill, theJoint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office s accordinglyrejected suggestions that the change should be experimental and saidthat if in two years disadvantages prevailed the Government would have totake note of that (Official Report; 23rd January, 1968, Col. 364),3.     The Secretary of State for Scotland suggested to the Home AffairsCommittee that the opposition encountered by the Bill on Second Reading,the absence of positive support and the public reaction in Scotland both tothe Bill and to the actual introduction of Standard Time on 18th February,would justify the amendment which he proposed.    Criticism is based onthe fact that in the latitude of Glasgow it will not be light until after9. 00 a, m. for almost three months of the year.    Children will go to schoolm the dark and outdoor workers will be delayed in starting work; and attention has been drawn to the risk of an increase in industrialabsenteeism and road accidents and to the unpopularity of the wartimeexperience of summertime extending throughout the year.-I-
4,     The Home Secretary suggested that as an alternative toamending the Bill he should give an explicit undertaking to amend theAct, if necessary, in the light of experience.    This would avoid exposingthe Government to charges of vacillation soon after the change of policy on the third London airport.    By a narrow majority, however, the HomeAffairs Committee preferred the proposal to amend the BiLL    they thought that it would be unfortunate to give ground for the suggestionthat the Government were readier to yield to pressure from the opponents of the Stanited proposal than to a large body of opinion inScotland and the North of England.    The proposal to amend the bill would have the additional advantage of allowing a period in which to assess the effect of the change on tho demand for electricity generating capacity,and it was noted that the need for further legislation would be avoided.5,     The Bill has been passed by the House of Lords and should reachStanding Committee in the Commons in April or May.    I invite theCabinet to decide whether, in view of the arguments presented sincethe question was last discussed, the Bill should be amended in Committeeto allow it to lapse after three years unless made permanent by affirmative resolution.     My own view is that this amendment should bemade.M.S.70, Whitehall, S. W. 1.Hth March. 1968-2-
