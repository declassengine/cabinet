C(68)7^ COPY NO.30jth-A^DrJlL JJJ68.CABINETPRIQI^AI/IDJilCSHIJ^UILDII^G^Np^I think that my colleagues should be aware of the way in whichpay negotiations in the vital areas of shipbuilding and engineering aredeveloping.2.      The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions(CSEU) presented last year to the Engineering Employers Federation(EEF) a national claim, to be implemented after the expiry of theirthree-year agreement on 1st January, 1968, for a substantial increasein basic rates, a red\\ction of hours, extra holidays and other items.This occurred whilst the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) were carrying out a review of the three-year agreement: theNB PI recommended, in their Report No. 49 of December, 1967, thatwhen the agreement came to be re-negotiated there should be no general increase in pay for manual workers, but that there should bean increase in minimum earnings levels on 1st July, 1968 and that, forthe rest, the national agreement should be confined to establishingguide-lines for domestic productivity based on the criteria of theNBPPs Report No. 36 on productivity agreements.3.      There have since been three meetings between the EEF andthe CSEU, on 27th March, 10th April and 18th April.    At each meetingthe EEF stood firm on an offer that included no general increase, anincrease in minimum earnings levels that was larger than that proposedby the NBPI but spread over three years, and an improvement in theindustryTs guaranteed week provisions.    In return the EEF soughtdetailed written undertakings on measures to secure the more efficient use of manpower (including the use of modern techniques forevaluating methods of production), on guide-lines for pay-cum -productivity negotiations at plant level, and on training.4.      In reply, the CSEU have demanded a general wage increase,much higher minimum earnings levels than those proposed by the EEF,an improvement in holidays, and a move towards equal pay, as a pre-requisite for any negotiations on improvements in productivity.     Theyare also threatening industrial action if their demands are not met.Their next move is to be considered at a meeting of Confederationexecutives on &quot;Wednesday, 1st May.-1-CONFIDENTiALUS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5.      The negotiations between the CSEU and the Shipbuilding andRepairers1 National Association (SRNA) have been proceeding more quickly than those in engineering, although they are very closely related -broadly speaking what happens in one is likely to follow in the other.It should be noted, incidentally, that whereas  the CSEU is led byMr. Hugh Scanlon in the engineering negotiations, Mr. Dan McGarveyleads on shipbuilding.6.      The two sides have met twice and at the second meeting, on24th April, the SRNA went further in their offer than the EEF in thatthey offered improvements in minimum earnings levels comparable to those of the EEF, a modest improvement in holidays and a smallgeneral increase in May, 1969 and May, 1970 in return for detailedundertakings on the use of labour, training and the payment of increases at local level only in return for direct and measurableimprovements in productivity.    The CSEU are now considering this offer and will meet the SRNA again on 2nd May.Draughtsmen7.     The Draughtsmen.^ and Allied Technicians&apos; Association (DATA)submitted a national claim for very substantial increases in salaries,with a corresponding revision of the national scales, in June, 1966.This was taken no further because of the wages standstill, but the EEFmade a smaller counter offer in July, 1967.     The offer was rejected byDATA who then terminated their national agreement with the EEF from 1st September, 1967.     Meanwhile DATA have pursued their originalclaim locally, and most firms are thought to have responded by payingat least the EEF counter offer; two firms who met DATAJs claims infull were referred to the NBPI under direction.    I understand that theBoard&apos;s report will be published on 16th May.8.      Negotiations between the EEF and DATA reopened on 11th april and the former have made an offer which, while still falling short ofDATA&apos;s original claim, will be very difficult to reconcile with theWhite Paper on Productivity, Prices and Incomes Policy in 1968 and1969 (Cmnd. 3590); DATA have accepted the offer subject to the deletion of two of the productivity conditions (the use of work study andconsultants) that the EEF are seeking as a quid pro quo.     The EEF havenot yet commented on DATA&apos;s reply.?B^^jhV^Jv2iL9.      These three sets of related negotiations have now reached adelicate stage.    The EEF are almost certainly asking too much fromthe CSEU by way of productivity provisions for the money they areoffering;  on the other hand, the provisions themselves are essential if the industry is to make progress with rational productivity bargainingat plant level.    I do not think - given the NBPPs Report No. 49 and the criteria of the White Paper - we could ccuntenance a general pay-2-
increase in engineering this year;   but 1 would be prepared to consider in engineering a package deal of the kind proposed by the SRNA formanual workers in shipbuilding and shiprepairing.    As far as thedraughstmen are concerned, I find it .very difficult to see how theEEF&apos;s offer could be justified agains the White Paper and, although Iintend to have discussions with the parties, a further reference ofdraughtsmen to the NBPI must be regarded as likely.10.     I am seeing the EEF and the CSEU separately on Wednesday,1st May and I will be able, therefore, to bring my colleaguescompletely up to date at our meeting on the following day.B. A.
