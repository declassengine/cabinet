DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)0(68*1,61 COPY NO.^9ttyAa^ch2JL968CABINETMjpmorjajidumJ^th^J^cjretarv o^Stat^forJ^conornic AffairsThe Committee on Industrial Policy have agreed that thePostmaster General should announce that the Post Office would closedown the inland telegram service on 31st March, 1973 (or earlier ifpossible) and replace it by an emergency service and - subject to public demand - a Postagram service for special greetings.    I havebeen invited to report to the. Cabinet the background to this decision.2.     The inland telegram service has for many years operated at a loss; over the next five years it is expected to be about  3 million ayear0    An annual total of 65 million messages immediately after the1939-45 war has now fallen to 9 minion, and the rate of decline isabout 5 per cent a year,    In spite of staff economies and variation of charges there is no prospect of making the service profitable.3.     The types of message sent can be divided as followsGreetings and congratulations 33 per centOther social messages 23 per centBusiness (e. g. the fish industry,bookmakers1, clients) 22 per centMiscellaneous (including money ordermessages, requests to telephone and press telegrams) 21 per centLife and death messages (urgentrequests to see a dying person) 1 per cent the ernergency service,4.     Against this background the Postmaster General proposedthat the present service should be abolished and replaced by anemergency service.    This service would cover not only imminentdeath but also dangerous illness, emergency admissions to hospital,and circumstances involving national or local emergencies? a more detailed definition of the service, together with the kinds of situationcovered, is set out in the Annex,    The charge for this service wouldbe fixed initially at the present standard charge of 5s. for twelve words which will, of course, involve a substantial loss on each message,-1-
5.     In proposing this service the Postmaster General, at theinstigation of the Committee on Industrial Policy, has gone aconsiderable way beyond his original concept of a service confined to messages concerning imminent death.    Some members of theCommittee had suggested that there should be a residual service which could be used for any urgent message;   in particular, theyhad in mind the needs of those peoples mainly concentrated in working class areas, who did not have easy access to a telephone.    However,in further discussion it was accepted that the Postmaster General hadin his revised proposals gone as far as was possible in extending theservice; any further broadening would have seriously underminedthe objective of cutting losses and it would be impossible to givesufficiently precise instructions for Post Office staff to operate sucha service efficiently and without across^-the-counter disputes of whatwas an urgent message.     The Committee was further influenced bythe fact that nearly all business users could be expected to use the telephone or telex service by 1973 and that a large proportion ofprivate telegrams were not of an urgent nature.    The letter service can deal with most moderately urgent situations; and the position will be further eased if the Post Office are successful in their effort to encourage shopkeepers to have telephones for public use and if,as is expected, 45 per cent of homes have telephones by 1973.Further to this, the Postmaster General has undertaken to consult with interested bodies, such as the National Council of Social Service,the Post Office Users Council and Government Departments on thefinal details of his proposed emergency service,?^iS.ess Users^6.     He will also consult with those business users who still make substantial use of the telegram service with a view to arranging forthem new or extended telex and telephone facilities.J?.2.S a g^rarr^Se ryice^7,     Subject to evidence of sufficient public demand he will replace the present greetings telegram service by a Postagram service inwhich greetings cards would be delivered through the ordinary postoTuning8.     The Postmaster General proposed that the service should notbe closed until March, 1973 - though it might be earlier if possible -so that he would have full time to consult users and in particular tomake arrangements for redundant staff.    In view of this long period the Committee considered whether the announcement of their decision might be postponed.    However, they accepted that thePostmaster General should start his consultations as soon as possible and that once this had happened his intentions would inevitably becomegenerally known.-2-
P0 S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W. 1.19th March, 1968-3-90     Given the heavy financial loss of the service, the alternativefacilities available and the scope of the emergency service now-proposed the Committee agreed that the Postmaster General shouldmake an early announcement of the termination of the servicec    they recognised, however, that this decision might well be criticised,particularly in remote and rural areas, and they accordingly invited the Postmaster General to inform his colleagues of the terms and timing of his announctfKctoSito10.     I invite my colleagues to endorse the decision of theCommittee on Industrial Policy.
