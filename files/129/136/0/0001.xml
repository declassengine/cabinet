HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)fJvKC(68) 38 COPY NO,        V ?i20th February, 1968CABINETSOCIAL SERVICES;  PRESCRIPTION CHARGES - EXEMPTIONSMemorandum by the First Secretary of state the Social Services Committee have reviewed the progress madeby the Health Ministers towards arrangements for exempting from theprescription charge the old, the young, expectant and nursing mothers,and the chronic sick.    This memorandum outlines the possible nature and timing of such arrangements,2.      Common to all four exemption categories is the problem of identification - who is to translate the decision that the category is to be exempted, into exemption from the charge of a particular individual fora particular prescription, and how?    With the chronic sick there is the prior problem of definition - what are the criteria for inclusion in this category ?30      Discussions with representatives of the doctors have shown great reluctance on their part to agree that doctors should identify the old andthe young by signing a special prescription form.    They fear argumentswith patients about their ages and the effect of this both on workload andon the doctor-patient relationship.    They have proposed insteadidentification by the chemist and have suggested that this could be donewitrout danger of fraud by the use of cards, similar to credit cards,embossed with the patientTs name and address.    Those entitled toexemption could obtain such cards from Executive Councils on makingapplication on a form, obtainable at, say, Post Offices0    Those under 16and over 65 could submit their medical cards with the applicationsexpectant and nursing mothers and chronic sick, once defined (see below)scould send in a suitable form signed by the doctor0    The details fromthese cards would be stamped on prescriptions by special imprintingmachines supplied to chemists, and each &quot;free&quot; prescription would thus be related to the exempt patient concerned.4.      A rough estimate of the initial extra cost of such a card scheme(if most of the work of producing cards and machines v/ere done under contract) is towards  1 million and the cards and machines would takea considerable time to produce - perhaps 8-12 months.    About 700-800extra Executive Council staff would be temporarily required to prepare the information for the cards,,    Annual continuing costs in staff and money would be small.    If the doctors were given an assurance th?.t-1-
such a scheme would be introduced within a reasonable time they couldthemselves probably be persuaded to identify those exempted by signingspecial prescriptions for this initial period,,    Preliminary soundings ofthe chemists indicate that they will bitterly oppose the suggested cardscheme.5.      The Social Services Committee concluded that the aim should beto introduce a. card scheme as soon as possible.6.      Definition of the chronic sick has also been discussed with the doctors.    This cannot be done simply by the use of a list of diseasessince this could not be comprehensive;  and a list of drugs v/ill not dobecause many drugs are used for both acute and chronic disease,,    Itis possible, however, that the doctors will accept the task of identifyingthe chronic sick narrowly defined, e,g. those bedfast or housebound,those suffering from diseases on a very limited list., and perhaps thoselikely to require continuous medication for life or for the foreseeable future.    It would be necessary to combine such an arrangement with a means of limiting the liability to pay of patients not within this definition,.The latter might, for example, be able to purchase exemption cards fora specified sum - i. e. a sort of season ticket arrangement,    A cardcosting  1 for three months or  3 for a year has been suggested,,    Thepayments, like the prescription charges, would be eligible for refundon grounds of financial hardship.    The possibility would be consideredof giving a card to those likely to be below the supplementary benefitlevel for a long period.7. Legislation would be needed to enable charges to be levied for exemption cards; opportunity for this is available, e.g, in the health services and Public Health Bill now in Parliament.8.       The Social Services Committee concluded that purchase of exemption cards on this basis, coupled with a narrow definition of the chronic sick proper, offered the best solution to the problem of the chronic sick.9.      The position car be summed up as follows.    If the chemistscan be persuaded to operate a card scheme (and this may v/^11 be possible,if at all, only by offering additional remuneration), if a satisfactorydefinition of the chronic sick can be agreed on the above lines and if theGeneral Medical Services Committee (the doctors negotiating body)accept their representatives1 recommendation that they should identifyexempted patients by signing special prescriptions ad interim, we might hope to have an interim scheme working as early as the beginning ofJune and would be in a position to announce this, and the broad natureof the longer term card scheme. by Budget?Day,   Tbe Committee were of Slhefirm and unanimous view that, on this basiss prescription charges should not be reintroduced until the interim exemption scheme is ready for operation.10,       I invite the Cabinet to endorse the Committee*s conclusions.MeS.70, Whitehall, 5.W.I.20th February, 1968-2-
