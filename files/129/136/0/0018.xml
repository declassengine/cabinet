AMERICAN BALANCE OF PAYMENTS MEASURESACCELERATION OF KENNEDY ROUND TARIFF REDUCTIONSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the United States Administration seem likely not to pursue the ideas which they mentioned to us when mr, Katzenbach visited London at the beginning of Januaryfor introducing some form of export rebate.     It now seems probable that they will decide   to impose an importsurcharge of probably 5 per cent to support their balanceof payments.     Since this would contravene the G.A.T.T., itseems to be their intention to ask for a waiver which, ifgranted, would no doubt specify closely the duration of the surchange and the conditions on which it could be imposed.The United States Administration are expected to reach adecision within the next week or two but the exact timingremains uncertain.2.     During the consultations with the European countrieswhich the Americans have been having in recent weeks, theyhave hinted that a possible alternative to a surcharge wouldbe the unilateral implementation immediately and in full bythe E.E.C. of the Kennedy Round tariff reductions which are due to take place over the next five years.     The Germanstook up this hint and have been pressing this solution ontheir colleagues in the E.E.C.      It met with resistance fromthe Commission and the French but the Germans, with somebacking from the Netherlands and Italy, persisted and it hasnow been agreed that, the Commission should make an urgentstudy of the possibility.     It is not clear how far theGerman proposal is conditional on the United States droppingits proposals for an import surcharge, but the United states would certainly be expected to honour its own Kennedy Roundtariff reductions according to the timetable originally agreed and to legislate to abolish the American Selling Price system for chemicals.3.    Meanwhile, the Scandinavian countries (whose tariffs ofcourse are low) are we believe letting it be known in washington that they would be willing to implement theirKennedy Round concessions immediately provided that we and the--lx would do the same.     They have suggested that we should1
make a similar approach to the Americans pointing out thatthis would, increase the pressure on the French to allow the six to participate.4,     There are strong arguments  or holding that it would be worth our while to join in a general acceleration of the kennedy Round tariff reductions if by doing so we couldprevent the Americans from talcing restrictive measures against our trade, particularly if it would help the passage of theA.S.Po legislation despite the unfavourable mood in Congress.If the Americans impose a surcharge and seek a waiver fromthe G.A.T.T. , which would require a certificate from theI.M.F. that their balance of payments difficulties justifiedrestrictive action, the French would be presented withextensive opportunities for making mischief.     There would bea real risk that some countries might seek to take reprisals,and a chain reaction which would seriously upset theexpansion of world trade and prejudice the growth of our exports might easily develop.     Action which will avoidthese consequences and alleviate American difficulties by increasing rather than restricting world trade would be greatly preferable in our own interests;    the early reductionof tariff barriers in Europe would be of particular benefitto our exports.5.     At present we propose to make 40 per cent of the ultimateKennedy Round cuts on the 1st July this year and the remainderby three equal 20 per cent cuts on the 1st January, 1970, 71and 72.     If we decide to accelerate, the mechanics would need further study;    it would be impracticable to make the fullcut on the 1st July this year, but we should be able to makeit on the 1st January, 1969 provided that the decision were taken by the end of August.     Although this would mean that imports from next year on would be higher than they would otherwise have been, we should still have the protectiveeffect of devaluation.     Moreover, so far as our exports areconcerned we should get the full benefits of the Kennedy Roundmuch earlier than we had expected in our main markets otherthan the U.S.A. and we should avoid the loss of exports whichwould result from the imposition of a surcharge in the U.S.A.,not to mention possible wider repercussions.6.    We should have to face criticism from a number ofBritish industries which would be deprived of a part of their protection sooner than they had bargained for, and would expect to lose more than they would gain:    these might include scientific instruments, electronics and optical goods.Others would gain more than they would lose;    but those whofear they will be hurt are always more vociferous than thosewho benefit.7.     There would also be criticism on the ground that withour own balance of payments difficulties we were in no positionto help the U.S.A.;    and it is true that in canvassing theseideas, the Americans seem to have had in mind acceleration of reductions primarily by the surplus countries.     Of course itwould suit us best if action by the E.E.C. alone would suffice to stop the Americans from putting on a surcharge but itwould be unrealistic to expect this.     It would certainlymake it easier for the Germans to bring the French into lineif we were prepared to act too;    and the basis for our action would be that, so    far from exacerbating our own balance ofpayments difficulties, it would be likely to have lessdamaging consequences for ourselves than the probablealternative.*    The Annex to this paper contains such estimates as canoe made quickly of the probable effect on our balance of2
payments of accelerating the Kennedy Round reductionsand of the imposition by the Americans of a 5 per centsurcharge on imports,     These suggest that either would havea significant adverse effect, the main difference being inthe timing of its incidence.     A surcharge if imposed in thenext month or so would have its sharpest effect this yearand next;    the main impact of the accelerated Kennedy Roundcuts (on the assumptions made) would not come until 1970.9.     I therefore recommend to my colleagues that I shoLildbe authorised to inform the United States Government thatwe are willing to implement our Kennedy Round tariff cutsin full by the 1st January, 1969 or whatever subsequent datemay be agreed provided that:(i)    at least the EoE.C. and E.F.T.A. and, if possible,japan also accelerate to the same extent;(ii)    the American Government do not introduce an import surcharge, export rebate or other measures restrictive of trade;    and(iii)    the American Government undertake to proceedwith their Kennedy Round cuts in accordance withthe agreed timetable and to do their best to getthe A*S.P. legislation through Congress thisyear.      If they were to fail in this it would beopen to us to reconsider our willingness to go ahead.C.A.R.C.BOARD OF TRADE, S.W.17th March 1968.3
ANNEXESTIMATES OF THE EFFECT ON UNITED KINGDOM BALANCEOF PAYMENTS OF ACCELERATING KENNEDY ROUND tariff reductions COMPARED WITH A SURCHARGE ON imports into THE UNITED STATES1.     If the United Kingdom, E.E.C., E.F.T.A. countries and japan, but not the United States , accelerated their Kennedy-Round tariff reductions so that they were completed by 1st January 1969 (instead of 1st January 1972, as under present agreements), there would probably be a net loss toour balance of payments, compared with what it would other-wise have been.     This would result from:(i)    an increase in our imports and(ii)    a reduction in our exports to E.F.T.A.beca,use of the loss of preference there,offset to some extent by(iii)    increased exports to E.EoC. countries.The effect would begin to be felt in 1969, would probablyreach its peak in 1970, and between 1970 and 1972 the losscould be expected to taper off so that by 1973 (the UnitedStates having made its final Kennedy Round reduction on the1st January 1972), the position might be roughly restored,apart from the once for all loss that had- occurred.2.     The direct adverse effect on our balance of payments of a 5 per cent surcharge by the United States on imports(except those already free of duty - the most likely basis for the United States to choose) would be felt more sharplyand earlier than the effect of accelerating the kennedy round cuts.     If the surcharge were imposed more or lessimmediately, its full effect would certainly be makingitself felt by the end of this year.     Next year, too, theeffect would probably be greater than would the effect of an acceleration of the Kennedy Round cuts.3.     In addition to these direct effects the United Statessurcharge might touch off restrictive or retaliatorymeasures elsewhere and might affect confidence.4.    The following table contains the best estimates we can make of the likely effects (ignoring the indirect effects)of accelerating the Kennedy Round cuts and of a 5 per centsurcharge on imports into the United States on theassumption that the latter would last for two years only.The figures depend on a number of assumptions and indicateorders of magnitude only:    they show the adverse change tobe expected in our balance of visible trade compared with what it would otherwise have been.5 per cent surcharge onKennedy Round reductions United States imports ofcompleted on dutiable goodsApril 1968 to March 19701st January 19691968196919701971nil20 - 3030 - 6020 - 30 m20 - 4040 - 8010 - 20nil70 -12070 -140
25.     it will be seen from the table that the likely effecton our balance of payments of an import surcharge by theUnited States over the years might not be much more adversethan an acceleration of the Kennedy Round cuts but that amuch higher proportion of the total adverse effect would fall this year and next.     Moreover, the adverse effect of asurcharge in this period is more likely to be under-stated(because of the risk of repercussions) than in the case ofacceleration of the Kennedy Round cuts.
