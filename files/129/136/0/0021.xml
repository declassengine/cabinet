r&quot;716/C(68)J8 COPY NO,        0 J -13th March, 1968CABINETDURATION OF POWERS OVER. PRICES AND INCOMESMemorandum by the Secretary of Sfcate for Economic affairs on 12th March, (CC(68) 19th Conclusions, Minute 2). my colleaguesinvited me to circulate a memorandum for Cabinet on 14tb Marchexamining the alternatives open to us about the duration of statutory powers.    I have sent advance copies of this memorandum to the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Lord President and the Attorney-General but time has been too short for us to meet and accordingly it does not committhese colleagues.The Alternatives2,      The three main alternatives as discussed so far ares(i) To take powers for 18 months with provision for Parliamentto determine their continuance for a further period by meansof the Expiring Laws Continuance procedure,(ii) To take powers for two or three years subject to annualrenewal by affirmative resolution procedure.(iii) To take powers without time limit subject to annual renewalby affirmative resolution procedure.-  ^J^d^Parliarnentary Aspects3.      In legal terms, no particular difficulties appear to arise over anyof these courses.    In Parliamentary terms, however, there aresignificant differences between course (i) and the other two courses.The Expiring Laws Continuance Bill Is subject to debate in all its stagesand amendments are in order in so far as they concern excepting frcmcontinuance particular provisions of the Act proposed to be continued.a rom the point of view of presentation, this can be presented as a more severe form of Parliamentary scrutiny than the affirmative resuluticnprocedure of debate of an order extending an Act for a further period which precludes, of course, the tabling of amendments to omit particularprovisions of the Act being extended.1-
4^      As far as Parliamentary opinion is concerned, It is perhapsdoubtful whether the choice of course (I) rather than course (iii)(&quot;annual renewal&quot;) would decisively Influence this although our own supporters might feel that the Government would be more reluctant touse the Expiring Laws Continuance procedure after 18 months to extend the new prices and incomes legislation than to do so by affirmative resolution procedure after 12 months,Sniployers and Unions50      The Trades Union Congress (TUC) have been opposed to allstatutory powers although in praxtice they have not pressed seriouslyfor the revocation of Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966.    Butthis does not mean that the TUC and individual unions would be indifferent to the form and duration of the new powers to be sought by the Government.In particular, most unions would see a decision by the Government not toset a definite term to new powers as a very grave development Indeed,6,      The Unions may know in their bones that the Government simplymust take wider powers now in the serious economic situation afterdevaluation even if this means - as a ceiling policy must mean - thatcollective bargaining is no longer genuinely free to take its full course.It is one thing for them to tolerate extensive new powers which are taken for a definite period only, but It is a very different matter for them toaccept that thereafter it is still open to the Government within the limited safeguards of Expiring Laws Continuance;, or ordinaryaffirmative resulution procedure, to continue these powers.7.      Put bluntly, there will for some time to come be a fear amongtrade unionists that another party might come into office and find readyto hand powers over pay passed by the Labour Government which can be readily continued under either course (I) or (ill).    Although the ToryParty has taken up the posture of opposing all sfcatucory powers over pay and prices, trade unionists cannot be confident that the Tories would letthese powers lapse on finding them so conveniently to hand.8.      The position of employers^ including the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI), Is different only to the extent that they are now in favourof the Government having powers for 18 months or even two years, butthe CBI have made it clear to me that their members attach greatimportance to a definite term being set to the life of new powers overpay and prices.    (The CBI Council last month accepted new powers onthe basis that these would be &quot;subject to the application of a firm time limit&quot;).9.      If we give the impression that we intend to retain these newpowers on a permanent basis there Is a real danger of employers and unions finding some common ground for opposition to the Government,something which v/e have been able to avoid for a long time pasto    It isdifficult to gauge how public opinion generally might react to powers which do not have a firm time limit, but united opposition frommanagement and unions might lessen the amount of general support.
12.      It would be easier, I believe, to justify omission of a bar toretrospection in the new legislation if v/e take pov/ers for at leeist18 months,.    The risk of employers and unions acting together overretrospective payments is obviously less the longer the powers areto remain In forceB13.      Of coarse, the vital need is to get through the first year from themiddle of 1968 when our new power to delay increases for up to 12 months will become available,,    The more successful v/e are in securing the restraint called for under the new policy on pay and prices, the less likelyit is that employers will be prepared to agree to retrospective paymentsafter as long a period of deferment as a year.P.S,epartrnent of Economic Affairs, S. W.l.13th March. 1968-3-10,      We are agreed that to take powers for one year only would be seen as a dangerously weak line, particularly as our economic strategy,including prices and incomes policy, now looks ahead beyond mid&quot;1969.If we took powers for two years onlys J. see the difficulty of having to face in 1970 another decision about bringing in fresh legislation,,    Thereis an obvious advantage in being able to link extension of pov/ers annuallythrough the Expiring Laws Continuance procedure because pov/ers taken for 18 months initially could be continued for a further year InDecember, 1969,U.       Of the courses before us I would prefer to adopt course (i) withthe expectation (but without the commitment) that we should renew itin December, 1969, with or without the limited amendment which wouldbe permissible under the Expiring Laws Continuance procedure.    Lookingfurther ahead5 for my part, I would favour the retention of statutory powers (greater than in Part II o  the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966 but less than we are at present envisaging) as a part of the longer term development of prices and incomes policy    But it would be wiser forus not to commit ourselves finally over the duration of the new powers,or over our longer term attitude to fully permanent pov/ers, until we havehad the further discussions with the TUG and CBL    Meantime, we couldannounce next week that we had decided to seek new powers for at least the 18 months up to the end of 1969 (or for at least two years)3      Thiswould not preclude our deciding on extension by the Expiring laws continuance procedure under course (i) or on annual renewal undercourse (iii) before publication of the Bill.Bar to Retronpectlon
