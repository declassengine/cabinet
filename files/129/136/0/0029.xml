The Chancellor of the Exchequer has now accepted our proposalsfor the figures on old and new housing which should go into the public expenditure Survey, though without commitment, of course, on theprogramme to be finally settled.    The White Paper will not prejudicethat settlement..        .......... ...       .    . ....... .     ... ... . .   .3.       The Lord President has said that there is no need to bring thedraft before the Home Publicity Committee before it comes to theCabinet.4. Subject to these points we were invited by the Housing Committeeto bring the draft to the Cabinet as soon as possible.5.      A summary of the propsals will be found immediately before the statistical appendix to the White Paper.    There are two points towhich we should draw attention.6.      Paragraphs 30 to 37 contain proposals for increases in rentswhere tenanted property is improved and put into good repair.    for houses subject to rent control, we propose that the fair rent provisionsof the P.enc Act, 1965, should apply once houses have been improvedwith out without grant) and repaired.    A large proportion of houseslacking amenities or needing extensive repair are tenanted.    Y7ifchoutthe incentive of a higher return, we cannot hope to get landlords to putthese houses into good condition.    We propose that the resultant rent increases should be phased over a period of years so that tenants willnot be faced with steep increases.7.      Paragraphs 44 to 51 include proposals for improving thecompensation provisions for unfit houses subject to slum clearance.The principal proposal is that most owner-occupiers should, in effect,be paid market value when their houses are bought for clearance.There is a growing sense of injustice among owner-occupiers about the-1-
present code, v/hich limits compensation to site value, with, somesupplements.    Many of them bought their houses when it was impossibleto get anything better.    Many local authorities consider the present codeunfair to owner-occupiers and this makes them reluctant to tackle slumareas with a high proportion of owner-occupier houses.8.       We do not propose to extend this concession to landlords.Landlords are not, like owner-occupiers, losing their homes;  and the gap between site and market values is generally far less for tenantedthan for owner-occupied houses.    But those who have maintained theirproperties will benefit from our proposals in paragraph 51.    We thinkit important to publish these proposals as part of our general plan fordealing with older houses.    That makes it necessary to date theentitlement to the new compensation from the White Paper;   this willavoid causing hardship to people whose homes are bought for clearancebetween now and the enactment of the legislation and discouraging localauthorities from pressing on with slum clearance in the meantime.9,      K the draft White Paper is approved, it will be published on or about 23rd April.A.G.C.H.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.

NSW   HOMES   FROM   OLD   HOUSESI.     IntroductionSince the war the first aims of housing policy have been tonrovide enough houses to overcome the shortage, to keep up withthe growing number of households and, since 1955?  to replace theforSt of the older houses.     At the same time house owners andlocal authorities have been encouraged by subsidies and other means to carry out improvements.     But for the most part improvement hasbeen left to individual initiative, and the results have been patchy.How, as the result of the very large increase in house-building inthe last few years, it is possible to plan for a shift in the emphasis of the housing effort, so that a greater share of theresources should go to the improvement of older houses.     The needfor large new housebuilding programmes will remain for many years ahead.     But the balance of need between new housebuilding and improvement is now changing, so there must be a correspondingchange in the emphasis of the local authority housing programmes.2.   How can this be brought about?     Some new facts have come to light, some old facts have been better understood, some powers and grants which were adequate when they were introduced are no longeradequate.     Local authorities&apos; powers to bring about the improvementof single houses and of whole areas of houses are cumbersome andinflexible;   some aspects of the present control of rents arestanding in the way of improvement of older houses.     All this mustbe adjusted if the change described above is to be achieved.3-   This White Paper sets out, these matters in more detail, andsays what changes in policy and law in England and Wales theGovernment propose.II.     Knowledger   Until 1967 the Government had to rely upon local authorities&apos;G&quot;n estimates of the number of slums in their areas.     Some of these estimates were rather rough, and different authorities naturallyaPplied different standards.     Early in 1967 the Government itselfCanded out a samPle survey of the condition of houses in England811 Wales.     The survey showed that there were more unfit houses/ and . r ma p. west, aa k H arara ra   A  h &apos;
laud more sub-standard houses than had heen known before, and they ysvereso much concentrated as had &quot;been believed before, but more w-earec1)spread out,    We now know that there are probably i.QK  &apos;million unfit(1)filings, of v/hich 1 .1 v 1 million are likely to have to be dealtlith in clearance areas.     The remaining 700,000 will have to bedealt with individually.     Although nearly all of these need(2)repairs costing  125 or more,       some of them will be worth(1 )saving and improving.      Of the 13.9       million or so dwellings(2)ihich are not unfit,  some 3*7       million need repairs costing  125(1)or more and some 2a3       million lack one or more of the following -an indoor lavatory, a fixed bath, a wash basin, and a hot and cold(3)later system.     Altogether, about k*5       million dwellings whichare not unfit require either  125 or more spent on repairs, or lackone or more basic amenities,  or both.     More details of the surveyresults are published in the Appendix, many of them for the first time.),    In order to keep this knowledge up to date and to providelocal authorities with a starting point for the exercise of the improved powers and the deployment of the increased grants outlinedbelow, the Government propose to lay upon them the duty, whensurveying the condition of housing in their areas, of consideringnot only the need to provide new houses, but also what needs to betone about those which are unsatisfactory.111&apos;     The General policy-   The results of the survey demonstrate the need for a new dealfor our older housing areas.     Bad housing, disrepair, lack ofoasic necessities like hot water and baths, are not limited to anyone part of the country, or to the big cities and towns, or tonouses of particular tenure.     True, conditions are worse in the/ North(1) Appendix Table 1 .&apos;2) Appendix Table 12.Appendix Table 1k.
ONFIDE242th than elsewhere:    and worse in privately let houses than in:Jner-occupied houses or local authority houses.      But in all parts^ the country and in all kinds of accommodation there are far tooany poople living in had conditions,  and without the comfort and convenience they ought to have in their homes.     The policy behindae legislative changes now put forward is simply that much moreshould now he done year by year to improve and repair houses that can be improved and to get rid of the unfit ones.v   The Government look to local housing authorities to be thewin instruments of this policy in their areas.     There will be a useful role for housing associations, which have already done very good work in some areas.     Much too will depend on the co-operationof owners and residents.     But the local authorities must take the lead and drive the policy forward in each town and district.     TheyBill need better pov/ers, better techniques and better financial arrangements.     But above all, each authority will need to make up its mind to secure results:    the Government hope that theproposed legislation will be taken as the   occasion for this neweffort to begin, and not merely as a series of technical changes.8.    The differences between local authorities&apos; areas are verygreat:   this means that the powers and methods used must be flexible.It also means that local authority programmes will have to reflecttheir different needs, within the balance of the total national programme of expenditure on new and older houses.5*   Academic studies have shown ways of relating the cost of immediate replacement to the cost of improvement with deferredreplacement according to the &quot;life&quot; of improved property, the prevailing interest rates, and other factors.     Practical studiesflave shown the comparative costs of redeveloping and improvingmusing areas, and have brought out the difficulty of comparingenefits as rigorously as costs.     Studies on these lines need toce pursued further to inform the thinking of both Government andlocal authorities.     But no further study is needed to prove that111 lions of families in this country are going to be living in^satisfactory houses for at least another twenty years unless new- orts are made.     And it is already clear that the present grant^AklC8P%EkiTl AH / limits
action&quot;This advised on a general approach to slums andEprovement.     The Ministry of Housing and Local Government published&apos;^2SS^t^hJil^I. in September, 1 966.     This is a study of therisibilities of area improvement in a part of Rochdale,  and since-hon a pilot scheme of improvement conducted jointly by theiinistry and the Rochdale County Borough Council has been goingforward in Deeplish.       The Government have also benefited fromPulham and Halliwell Reports on the possibilities for privateenterprise in the comprehensive redevelopment of old residentialareas in Pulham and Bolton published by the Taylor&apos; Wcodrow GroupsM Hallmark Securities Limited respectively.IV.      Improvement and RepairPowers and procedureI.  The Government want local authorities to direct their mainefforts in future to the improvement of whole areas, not justindividual houses - though grants for improving individual housesMl be continued and will be used in area improvement.     The powers in Part II of the Housing Act-1 96I4., do not really enable an authority to improve an area as a whole;    and they have been foundcumbersome in practice.      The Government propose therefore to repealem and to put in their place a procedure and powers on theAllowing lines,,1?       T!ii  Local authorities should have power to declare general improvement Areas.      The aim in these areas would be to help andPersuade owners to improve their houses, and to help them also byproving the environment.     Authorities would be able to buy land, Jd buildings and carry out work for this purpose.      They would/ alsocuss k  fi enr-a n    A   is fElits do not reflect the maximum which it may be worth while tor.d on improvement.      In many other cases, improvement at muchess than maximum cost will make a great difference to the comfortr.i convenience of the people living in the house.i, In reviewing the policy and legislation over the last threeears the Government have received the report of a sub-committee the Central Housing Advisory Committee, under the chairmanshipfMrs. Evelyn Denington, called 11 Cagr^oldeig homes - a call for
in have power to &quot;buy houses for improvement and conversion and to... any bouses which were unfit and which stood in the way of theMovement of the whole area.;  The success of area improvement will depend on local-gorities securing the co-operation of householders in improving8iP houses with grants.    In the Government&apos;s view the voluntaryrlnciple must be the guilding one, and although powers of-pulsory purchase would be available for improvement they shouldused only in the last resort.      It is essential that the wishes-d needs of people in the area should be fully considered,  andIt the authority&apos;s plans for the area should bo fully explained,sor this reason, and to avoid delay,  it is not proposed that thedeclaration of the area and the plans for it should be formallysubmitted to the Minister or Secretary of State for inquiry and approval.     What is needed at this stage is informality of approach and good public relations and consultation;    there must beflexibility in the authority&apos;s plans.     The time for appeal andinquiry would be later when an individual&apos;s interests were affected.And the better the explanation and consultation the less often willthis have to happen.Ijjj  Local authorities should be able to help owners in many waysadit is proposed to extend their powers of doing so.     Forinstance, the Government propose to enable them to act as agents for the owner in any matter relating to improvement,  since manywhers may not know how to sot about it,o.  In suitable cases where an owner needs a loan as well as agrant, but could not afford to repay the principal for a period,during his occupancy, the Government propose that the localauthority should be able to charge interest only,  the principalCying secured on the property and recovered later on.     Authoritiesuan S0IIietimes help greatly by providing temporary rehousing duringMovement, but this does not need any new powers.S i onmerrt&apos;0&apos;  Whole areas and streets cannot be brought up to proper^ndards unless something can be done for the environment,  as/ opposed
/ 19.    The,c0secl to the interiors, of the houses.     At present such powers.; exist are not easy to apply, and no grant is payable for the:,rrovement of anything except the houses themselves  and for theirinversion into flats.      This creates difficulty for the localrfuhority in providing children&apos;s play spaces,  or parking spaces,-r planting trees, or regulating tho traffic for the good of the-aople who live there.      These purposes would be included in thejoncept of &quot;improving the area&quot;, and the Government propose to-reude a coherent set of powers for them, including powers toacquire land and buildings.      The Government also propose an exchequer grant of 5Cfi on approved expenditure on works and thepurchase of land for improving the environment of an area, the;:ant-aided expenditure to be limited to  100 per house in the area.foairs\],  The 1967 sample survey showed that there are nearly hi millionsellings in the country (not including those likely to be in slumdearance areas) which need  125 or more spent on repair.      TheGovernment propose that the powers of authorities to secure the repair of houses should be exerciseable not only as at present wherethe house has become unfit, but wherever there is serious disrepair,and that the work reguired should be what is reasonable havingI regard to the age,  character and location of the house.     Thisper should be of use not only in getting houses repaired but in&amp;surtng that an area which has been brought up to a good state ofimprovement is not allowed to fall into decay again afterwards,^sijig^and, planningi8,  The selection of improvement areas and the action taken inj-em can be important elements in the total planning of the town.*nere should therefore be close consultation with the localwanning authority (in many cases it will be the same authority)0- hat housing and planning policies can be integrated in a total* j-cy of urban renewal.     But in using these powers local housing-uhorities will take as their starting point the housing conditionsgr- *ich people are living.
included in the Town and Country Planning Bill now beforeiPliament, will often be relevant.     It will be for the localaiming authority to consider in consultation with the housingthorlty     which, improvement areas should be identified as action8as;   the size and importance of the area, and the amount of changejoposed will be relevant factors,[rants?I, With these new or extended powers and more informal and flexiblerocodures must go increases in the grant limits if house   and areagprdvements are to run at a higher level.I, Since 19h-9 local authorities have been able to pay grants tod: . &apos; :;f ;Bdiise owners willing to improve their houses to certain standards,aid &quot;Since 1959 they have been bound to pay grants to house ownersfto claimed them in installing the &quot;basic amenities&quot; in their houses.m first type is called a discretionary grant, the second type a standard grant.     Grants are 50% of the cost of the work, of whichthe local authority recovers three-quarters from the Exchequer.For improving council houses, local authorities get three-eighthsitheir costs back from the Exchequer.     At present, normal limits for discretionary grants are  kOO,  and for standard grants  155.122.  The numbers of discretionary and standard grants approved inEngland and Wales in the last few years are as follows:-Discretionary       Standard Total1960 d8,013 82,819 130,8321961 h7,9h5 79,831 127,7761962 41,768 68,738 110,5061963 h2,70l 77,278 119,979196d h5,050 76,635 121,6851965 do,100 82,893 122,9931966 39,960 67,760 107,7201967 k6,6o6 66,536 113,1h2-/ft of grants were made to owner-occupiers, 29% to local authorities^ 22% to other owners.

Grant i: Limi t s25. The discretionary grant, with its greater flexibility and itskb ceiling, will obviously be the preferred instrument for use inGeneral Improvement Areas, but there will still be many householdersoutside these areas,  and perhaps also within them, who wish,  andhave the right, to improve their houses by simply installing the!tasic amenities&quot;.     Since the present maximum of  155 was established for the standard grant (1959), costs in the buildingIndustry have risen.      The Government now take the view that in theage of the refrigerator a ventilated food store is no longer a&quot;basic amenity&quot; which should be insisted upon;    a sink,  on the other&apos;&apos;au, is.     The Government propose therefore that the ceiling fortoe standard improvement grant should be raised to  200, and thatfee individual grant limits should be varied as follows:Maximum Grant
of conditionsIn order to meet the great variety of needs with the help thatjiost useful in each case, the Government think that local[jithorities should have power to waive some of tho existing condi-tjons for grant, in particular cases subject to general directionsriven by the Minister or Secretary of State.     These include theconditions relating to the &quot;life&quot; of houses to be improved;    thestandard of improvement to be attained;    the requirement that allthe missing &quot;basic amenities&quot; must be provided at once if a standard grant is to be paid;    and the requirement that grantcannot be paid if the work has been begun before the owner&apos;application for grants has been approved.Time LimitI],   On the other hand authorities should have power to impose atime-limit within which any work approved for grant must be done.Inquisition for Conversion or Improvement3. Housing Associations, whose role in improvements the government hope to see expand, at present enjoy one advantage over localauthorities in this field;    under the Housing Subsidies Act 1967-hey can obtain Exchequer assistance towards the cost of buyinghouses for conversion or improvement as well as for doing the work,fteGovernment propose to make grants for acquisition to localauthorities also, and at the same time to increase the cost on whichgrant is payable (covering both acquisition and work.) from thePresent maximum of  2,000 per flat obtained to  2,500.     This will*PPly both to authorities and to associations.     Taking account ofwe more limited life of older houses,  even when they have been improved, these new limits should encourage local authorities toundertake this work whenever it is economic to do so, and willprovide them with Government assistance broadly equivalent inPresent value terms to the subsidy which they receive towards&quot;Hiding new houses.3&apos; All these provisions together are intended to give local^hor-ities, working with housing associations and with householders,50PPor&quot;tunity to bring basically sound old houses up to modern/ standards
tandards, and to make many run-down neighbourhoods into pleasantcomfortable places to live in.Landlords improving their houses reasonably expect to receivepe increase in rent.     Under present law where the improvement 1sd&amp;d Toy grant,  the permissible rent increase is limited by the5rd conditions.     Now that there is a well-established systemdetermining fair rents for regulated tenancies it seems rightuse this machinery for determining new rents of these tenanciesoil owing grant-aided improvement.!, Controlled tenancies raise wider questions.      The rentsiargeable, even with tho increases permitted after improvement,Id not normally provide a sufficient return to landlords to oncouragthem to improve their houses.      Indeed,  landlords whose rents arestill controlled may have little Incentive,  or may even be unable,i :  &apos; ......to maintain their houses as they should.     Tho Government have in[the past been unwilling to pass controlled property Into rentgulation under the Rent Act 1965 until more experience has beenained of rent regulation.      They are still unwilling to allow thisjto happen except where some countervailing advantage could beSecured for the tenant.     But the achievement and maintenance ofI proper standard of equipment and repair would be such anpantage, and the Government accordingly propose the followingpariges in rent law.
CONFIDENTSAL321   Fij^st? where a house let on a regulated, tenancy is improved,with a grants,  the rent should he determined under Part II of theBent Act, 1965 and not as at present by conditions attached tothe grant.33.   Second, where a house let on a controlled tenancy is improvedv;ith a grant,  the tenancy should become a regulated one and the rent should be determined as above.%-   Thir^d, where a house let on a controlled tenancy is certified by the local authority as-being in the required state,  asindicated in paragraph 35,  the tenancy should become a regulatedone and the rent should be determined as    above, even though nogrant has been given.35,   In all these cases the house would normally need to have atleast the basic amenities - an indoor lavatory, a fixed bath, asash basin, a hot and cold water system and a sink - and to be in good repair.36.   Where a regulated rent has been increased,  or a controlledtenancy has passed into regulation, following improvement carriedout: with grant, it would clearly be wrong for the full fair rentto he   payable right away.    The increase in rent will therefore be phased over a period.    There would also be phasing in those casesof the third type mentioned above where there might otherwise be a sharp increase in rent as a result of the move to regulation.37.   Landlords will be able to apply to the rent officer forcertificates as to the fair rent which would be obtainable, oncetne local authority had approved the work, although, of course,we new rent would not become payable until the work had beencompleted.    The question of right of appeal where a certificate isrefused is being further considered.&quot;&quot;Grant in these paragraphs means discretionary grant orstandard grant.
)8,  At present,  local authorities have certain powers to step in and regulate the conditions of houses in multiple occupation.    Butthey have to wait until the multiple occupation is establishedbefore they can do anything.    This means that in practice they are confined to alleviating the abuses which may arise in these circum-stances, and. cannot prevent them arising.    The Government now propose to make available powers to regulate the conditions inimich multiple occupation may be established,   or to prevent it.faese powers would be given to local authorities who needed to use them in the interests of people living in areas of housing stress.The powers could be applied, by order of the Minister or Secretaryof State on a local authority&apos;s application,  to such areas intheir district as they consider necessary.    Unless the contrary were approved for a particular area,  they would only apply where it was proposed that a house should be occupied by more than,  say, twofamilies or by more than four individual lodgers.    Where the powerswre applied, registration with a local authority would be a pre-requisite of new multiple occupation, and registration could be refused by the authority if:(i)   the house was unsuitable and incapable of being madesuitable;(ii)   the person having control of the house,  or the personintended to be the person managing the house, was not afit and proper person.S.   The authority would be able to make registration conditionalmi the carrying out of works and on the level of occupancy.    Right0i appeal to the county court would be given against refusal to register or against the conditions attached to registration.&apos; *   But authorities should be able, when they use their controlPowers, to give help as well, so that a house may be at least-arUy improved even though it is still in multiple occupation.
njie Government propose therefore that authorities should he able torive a grant for the &quot;basic amenities&quot; even though they may not befor the &quot;exclusive use&quot; of any one family in the house.if,  Certain minor aspects of local authority control overexisting multiple occupation are under review and proposals will06 included in the legislation.V.      Slums1(2;  The criteria by which a house is judged to be fit or unfitire set out in section k of the Housing Act, 1957.    The Governmentrelieve that these criteria are in the main still the right ones,cut, as was pointed out in the Denington Report,  an importantcontributing factor making for an unfit house may be that it has?, very had internal layout:    for example, a WdC.  openingiirectly from the living room or kitchen and narrow, steep orrinding staircases.    The Government propose therefore to add theinternal arrangement of a house to the list of criteria,djgnjglearance and Compensationlf3.   The number of slums dealt with in England and Wales in recentyears has been as follows:-Year Total1960 56,5611961 61,9691962 62,h311963 6.,hh5I96h 61,2151965 60,6661966 66,7821967 71,769mis is by no means an unsatisfactory record, but it is no longersood enough.    As more and more new houses are built (and record-figures are now being achieved) more unfit old houses ought to bedeared.   And the number to be cleared has been underestimated inl&quot;e past.    The Government intend to continue to give first priority in the allocation of the housing programmes to are&amp;s withl5?ge numbers of slums.
rpgnsa ti onThe obstacles to faster slum clearance must therefore heartified and removed.    There is no doubt that,  as the Deningtoniort noticed,  the objections local authorities meet with to-eir clearance proposals are not really so much directed to thetandards applied as to the terms of compensation.    The basis ofMipensation is that if a house is unfit for human habitation itmot be assumed to have any value.    The compensation is therefore;r&quot;site value&quot; alone:    that is,  the owner is paid no more for is land than he would be if there were no   house on it at all.-ef the years certain exceptions to this principle have grown up.aer-occupiers now never receive less for an unfit house than the^oss value for rating purposes.    If a house has been welliatained in spite of its unfitness, a &quot;well-maintained&quot; payment3 made.    For owner-occupied houses this is four times the rateabledue;   for others it is twice.    If an owner-occupier bought arase, which is now unfit, between 1939 and 1955 (when very few-ums were being cleared) and has had it for less than fifteen-jars, he gets the full market value of the house.%  A growing proportion (now about 20% nationally and muchiigher in some areas) of owners of houses in clearance areas areWier-occupiers;    and they have a special grievance.    Often they!ought their house when it was not possible to get anything better,d they have put their savings into it.    In any case, it is their&quot;*e which is being demolished, and the average differencetween site value and full market value is significantly greaterv owner-occupied than for tenanted houses.

But they propose that (a) additional payments should be made to owner-occupiers of unfit houses dealt with under slum clearance powers,subject to the conditions indicated below;    in the case of unfithouses acquired for clearance, this will have the effect of bringing the total payments    up to full market value, (To) unfittenanted houses should qualify for larger payments if they havebeen well-maintained.    It is proposed that these changes should refer back to the date of this   White Paper, and they are thereforeset out in detail in the following paragraphs.hi.   Owner-occupiers of houses which are unfit for human habitationana are purchased compulsorily, or are subjected to one of the procedures set out in paragraph k( i ) of the Second Schedule to theSousing Act, 1957 (demolition, closing or clearance orders) or are subjected to an unfitness order under paragraph 1(2)  of thesecond Schedule to the Land Compensation Act,  19,61, are In certain-ircumstances entitled to an additional payment, or supplement,rais supplement reflects the amount, if any, by which market value254s?
exceeds site value, but is payable only where a house wascvner-occupied on 1 3th December,   !955j and at the time of the compulsory purchase or--other order is still owned by the sameoerson, or a member of his family, who has not had 15 years&apos;enjoyment of the property.h8.   The Government propose that this supplement should now become payable to all owners of houses which are owner-occupied in accordance with the terms of paragraph US below,in cases where the appropriate action is taken at any time after the date of this White Paper.    The &apos; appropriate action&apos;here means the commencement of the &apos; relevant proceedings&apos;leading to the purchase or vacation of the house,  as defined in paragraph k(6) of the Second Schedule to the Housing Act,1957.   Ror unfitness orders the &quot;appropriate action&quot; would bethe making of the order.0-3.   An owner-occupied house means in the first place anyhouse which has been occupied by its owner or a member of his family continuously since the date of this White Paper.Where it is acquired for occupation after that date, thehouse must have been owner-occupied for 2 years before the&quot;appropriate action&quot;  as defined in paragraph U3.    (This is toavoid last minute sales which might be arranged simply to qualify for the supplement).50.   The Government propose that a person whose house isacquired or vacated before these provisions become law, but asa nes it of &quot;appropriate action&quot; taken after the date of thisIhite Paper, should be able to claim later an additional/payment
EApayment to which he might become entitled by the legislationinsofar as he has not already received it (for instance, on asale by agreement).H,   &quot;Well-maintained&quot; payments will not be paid where a housequalifies for the new supplement.    But the Government proposethat the &quot;well-maintained&quot; payment for tenanted houses shouldbe increased from twice,  to four times,  the rateable valueof the house.    The same rate will apply to owner-occupiedhouses not qualifying for the supplement under paragraph h-8above.    These &quot;well-maintained&quot; payments will continue to belimited to the amount, if any, required to bring the sitevalue up to the full market value of the house.    The apportion-meht of these payments between landlord, and tenant will continueto he a matter for the local authority.52.   It is the main purpose of this White Paper to explain the proposals for legislation.    The Minister and the Secretaryof State will in due course publish a manual of advice for local authorities on how to handle the new General ImprovementArea as an instrument of housing policy.    But certain generalremarks may still be in place.53.   No local authority can do everything on its own, but theGovernment envisage that the improvement of the older housingareas in our towns and cities should be carried out under the leadership of local authorities^, and following general strategieswhich each local authority will decide for its own area.5m-.   Within that general strategy there will be a great part toce played by housing associations,  and at every stage the voluntary co-operation of householders will prove, as it hasalready proved under the existing system, to be the firstcondition of progress.    Local authorities must be tireless in^Plaining their proposals, and in gaining the confidence and approval of those whom they will affect.    Areas will be able toVI.    Conclusions/be
be designated without reference to Whitehall, and withoutappeal or hearing.    The time for appeal or hearing will balfour, and only if, it becomes necessary to propose the compulsory purchase of any house or land, and at that stage the customarystatutory safeguards of the appeal system will come into play,gut the better the local explanation and co-operation is,  theless frequently will compulsory purchase be necessary.55.   The keynote of the proposals is that the local authoritiesshould positively concern themselves with the condition of the unsatisfactory private houses in their towns.    The legislative and other changes now proposed, while reserving compulsory acquisition as an ultimate sanction, will greatly strengthenand widen the authorities&apos; powers to improve the living conditions of their people.56.   The proposals of this paper place great emphasis onflexibility:    flexibility in conditions, in grant maxima,  in ministerial control.   And this is right, since local circumstances will vary very widely.    Some authorities will need to continue to devote most of their energies to clearanceareas.    Others, where there are not so many slums, or not sucha shortage of housing,  or a higher proportion of sound oldhouses, will wish to put much greater emphasis on general improvement Areas.57.   These proposals will bring both problems and opportunities to the building industry, not excluding the smaller builders.The relations between the local authority and the localbuilders, and a good organisation to make the most productiveuse of their services and of local authorities&apos;  direct labourdepartments in this work, will greatly affect the success ofimprovement in any area.    The Government are further studyingthis aspect of the subject and will consult the industry about
58.   And finally, the Government hope that the publication ofthis White Paper,  and the passage of the legislation it proposes, will be the occasion for a great new drive, groupingI all the existing powers   and using to the full the new powersaid the higher grants proposed, for the improvement of thosemillions of older houses, and those hundreds of thousands of older streets which,  though they are neglected at the moment,can be made into decent, pleasant and comfortable places to live in.

APPENDIXMTIOKAL SIMPLE SURVEY OF THE CONDITION OF HOUSES1,    This survey of the condition of the housing stock was carried out hy aphysical inspection of a representative sample of dwellings by experienced publichealth inspectors working to a common brief.2. The sample was designed to give a broad national picture. It was not large enough to give a local or regional picture. It is possible, however, to providea picture for three broad divisions of the country - the Forthf Wales, midlands and the South-West^   the South-East.3.    The survey was directed to establish facts abouts-(i)   fitness and unfitness (according to the criteria of unfitness inSection 4 of the Housing Act,  1957)s(ii)    the provision of basic amenities5   viz. internal W.C.$   fixedbaths   hot and cold water system 5   wash basin.   Information wasnot sought about ventilated food stores 5(iii)    state of repairs    estimates were made of the amounts requiredto he spent to put dwellings into a satisfactory state of repair( excluding internal decoration) where this came to  125 op more.The survey provided for a sub-division of most of these items by reference toage, type of area (conurbations, other urban areas and rural districts), andtenure.4. The results are in Tables 1 to 14, viz. s-Tables 1 - 4s Fitness and UnfitnessTables 5 - 8s   Lack of amenitiesTables 9 -13s   Disrepair (as measured by estimatedcost of repairs needed)Table 14: Disrepair of fit/unfit dwellings having/nothaTing all basic amenities.

ANNEXFINANCIAL., AND MANPOWER implications^IO,NS1.     The Draft White Paper deals with a shift of emphasis from new housebuilding to improvement of our housing stock.Accordingly,  the aim has been to achieve so far as is possible a neutral net effect in terms of both cost and manpower.2,     On cost,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer has accepted forthe purposes of compiling the figures for the Public expenditure survey proposals which I have made for investment in both new and old houses.      On this basis there would be only a very smallrise in the total housing investment expenditure between 1968-and 1972-3, and,  indeed,  that there would be a slight fall ineach of the intervening years.     Within this total there would&quot;be no extra cost in respect of slum clearance or improvementbefore 1970-1, when it might amount to  8.3m. growing to 37.2m. in 1972-3*3.     On manpower,  a gradual re-allocation of resources withinthe building industry can be expected;   but this would bemarginal and should cause no undue strain.     Departmentsconcerned are considering how the transition could be mostsmoothly carried, through and,  as the Draft White Paper states(paragraph 57), the industry will be consulted.     Within thepublic service, the significant impact will be upon localauthorities.     However, many of the proposals will lead to amore efficient use of manpower already engaged upon problems of older houses.     There will be far less involvement withbureaucratic detail.     But, above all, priorities will bedetermined locally in the light of all the factors:    the confidential advice from associations of local authoritiesindicates that councils should be able to cope without addingsignificantly to their complements.      There will however be anincreased call on the services of public health inspectors;recruitment prospects have been more encouraging recently.     the extra number required will depend on the rate of build-up of thenew work and is difficult to quantify until the new methods haveoeen given an extended trial.     Over the next few years theincrease will be marginal.
