IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(68) 4527th February, 1968COPY NO,cabinet future PRODUCTIVITY, PRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs have considered over recent weeks the various courses open tous, in consultation with a number of my colleagues most closely concerned.    The proposals which follow have been formulated in thelight of these consultations.2.      The proposals which follow relate to wages and salaries and to prices, charges and rents, and are intended to constitute a tougherprices and incomes policy.    But the details of the policy - and itsprospects of success - will be influenced by the Budget both as it couldaffect the treatment of unearned incomes, particularly dividends, and thecourse of the cost of living;  and by the outcome of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) Conference of Executives, and our further consultations with the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).3.      Prices and incomes policy was not evolved as an instrument of short-term management of the economy.    We had a year of stand still and severe restraint in 1966-67 because we were then forced to put thegreatest stress on prices and incomes policy over the short term.This was a considerable success because there was a remarkably goodresponse by management, unions and the public generally and becauseof the economic climate at the time.4.      The economic context within which incomes policy will be operating during the next two years will not be as favourable tosevere restraint.    The pressure of demand will be increasing and unemployment falling.    Company profits and liquidity are expected toincrease substantially thereby increasing the willingness of employers to pay higher wages.    The cost of living is expected to rise during1968 by over 5 per cent, including the devaluation effect of 3 per cent.5*      The TUC are trying to develop an effective voluntary policy, butthey have little or no influence over the two largest unions - the transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) and the Amalgamated engineering and Foundry Workers Union (AEFWU) which are strongly opposed toincomes policy.    The CBI have told us that inflationary pay increasescannot be avoided unless there is some strengthening of theGovernments statutory delaying powers.-1-
6      Incomes policy in its present form carries too groat a risk of arise in wages and salaries which would erode the competitive advantagewc have gained from devaluation.   We have therefore cone to the view thata tougher prices and incomes policy based on extended statutory powersis essential over the next two years.   Without fim guidance andresolute action from the Government, the tendency will be for the averageoutcome of settlements to rise to unacceptable levels.An Incomes Ceiling7.    The main feature of a tougher incomes policy should be a ceilingfor income increases which would apply to all the main elements in remuneration, including fringe benefits, whether negotiated at national or local level, but excluding increases resulting from overtime, piece-work, etc. directly related to the amount of work done.   Increases upto the ceiling figure would not be allowed automatically;   they would continue to have to be justified against the existing criteria.8. Any figure for the ceiling less than 3g- per oent would be completelyunacceptable to the TUC, and could not be enforced with firmness. On theother hand, it would be imprudent on economic grounds, to go for a higher figure, (although we may have to take account of the effects of anyBudget proposals on the cost of living). Moreover, there is already come degree of commitment to the figure of 3-g- per cent.9.     If a ceiling of J)\ per cent meant that no group of employees could get an increase in excess of that figure regardless of the length oftime since they had a previous increase, this would bear hardly on thepublic serviees, where pay is in many cases determined at intervals oftwo years or more and on the basis of comparison with wage and salarymovements in the private sector over the period since the last review.On the other hand, to allow such increases to be paid in full would meanrises in pay so substantial that the general acceptance of incomes policy would be jeopardised.   The best course would be to apply the ceiling figure at an annual rate since the date of the last increase,but to insist that if such increases were large, they should be staged.Exceptions to the Ceiling10.   To permit anything more than the most limited exceptions to the ceiling would undermine this tough policy.   It is, nevertheless, important that there should be an exception to the ceiling for genuine productivity agreements which conform to the guidelines laid down by the national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).   The exception should, however, make possible increases in the case of major agreements involving theintroduction of a completely new pay and grading structure in a whole industry with productivity benefits.-2-
11,   Low paid workers could benefit up to the ceiling, and unions couldnegotiate above-ceiling increases for low-paid workers within a settle-nent which over all did not exceed the ceiling.   However, subject onlyto the point in paragraph 12 below, there should not be an exceptionabove the ceiling for low-paid workers.   Increases which were supposed to be confined to then would spread to other workers because of the pressure to maintain differentials.   Furthermore, there would be pressure,particularly from the public services, to allow exceptions above the ceiling for fair comparisons if there were an exception for low-paid workers as well as for productivity.   There would thus be a greater risk that the ceiling would in fact become a norm.12.   This means that we shall need to give extra protection to the most vulnerable groups, especially the poorer families.   Without this, wecould neither justify nor sustain a tough incomes policy at a time ofsharply rising prices.   The First Secretary has been considering ways ofdealing with this problem and will be circulating a paper on it.Notification and Vetting13.   It would not be too difficult to identify national agreements inexcess of the ceiling figure, although no doubt there would be cases inwhich the Government and the parties disagreed on the results of applyingthis figure to a particular pay structure.   But to be successful thepolicy would have to take effect at the level of the individual firm.14.   This will require effective notification at the plant level.   We are committed both on pay and prices to use our existing powers for statutorynotification only if the voluntary system works unsatisfactorily.   We mayhave to consider the use, though on a selective basis, of these powers.Before doing so, however, we should want to consider-carefully the implications for the tuc&apos;s own pay vetting arrangements.Administration15.   A more stringent policy backed by stiffer delaying powers, whetheror not by compulsory early warning, would increase substantially thenumber of cases submitted to the Ministry of Labour for examination.   Ifcompulsory early earning were introduced even on a selective basis thenumber of notifications of intention to increase pay would rise verysteeply.   In addition the exercise of statutory delaying powers would increase considerably the volume of work.   All cases are being argued withgrowing keenness by employers and unions, and each one would require-3-SECRET
thorough treatment if the policy is to succeed.   At the most optimisticestimate of voluntary compliance the present staff of forty middle and senior rank officers engaged in this work would be inadequate.   A policy with selective compulsory early warning might well require up to200 staff.16,   As an illustration of the work on the prices side, in the case ofthe Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood nineteen staff areemployed whole-time on examining notifications, and a further thirteenwhole-time on other aspects of food prices policy;   and at least thirtyarc employed part-time on these matters.17.   Since the Ministry already examines notifications most rigorously,and statutory delaying powers have never needed to be used, a more stringent policy on the present basis, backed by stiffer delaying powers,would not of itself demand more staff, as long as the goodwill of theindustry were retained.   Compulsory early warning on the&apos; present selectivebasis should not in theory require more staff since it is not thoughtthat there is any failure to give early warning voluntarily.   But sinceat present firms work to the spirit of the policy, and on a compulsorybasis must be expected to stand on their legal rights, in practice some increase in staff would be required to block loopholes.18.   If notifications were required for minor lines and from smallermanufacturers, many times the present staff would be required.19.   These staffing requirements, though disagreeable in the context ofcivil service numbers, must be seen in relation to the central purpose and importance of prices and incomes policy.Policy for Prices and Charges20.   The essential features of prices policy should continue to be -(i)   encouraging industry and commerce to increase efficiency,avoid cost increases, and wherever possible to stabiliseor reduce prices;(ii)   rigorous examination of proposals for price increases forproducts and services of economic significance, including those of importance and sensitivity in the cost of living,including examination by the NBPI and use of powers where necessary;(Hi) accepting that, in the post-devaluation situation, we mustnot seek to prevent the genuine (and tested) consequences of higher import costs from working through so as to helpin the shift of resources to exports;
(iv)   demonstrating that we are keeping a closer watch on pricetrends at the retail end and trying to prevent unjustifiableincreases in retail prices from offsetting restraintachieved at the manufacturing end, including furtherconsideration of the possibility of arrangements for spotchecks on the movement of prices of particular products;(v)   retention of the existing criteria for price increases and price reductions;(vi)   continuation and extension of the voluntary early warningarrangements for prices (as previously agreed);(vii) statutory notification of price increases to be determined in the light of the use of statutory notification on the pay side.21, There are serious practical difficulties about effective surveillanceof the enormous and varied field of retail prices and even to establishra somewhat closer watch than we have at present, with arrangements for&quot;spot checks&quot; on a selective basis, would add considerably to administra-*tive problems and staff requirements.   We must be careful not to arouseundue public expectations which could not be satisfied in the face ofthe inevitable large rise in retail prices after   devaluation, but wecannot ignore the presentational factors involved here.STATUTORY POWERS - INCOMES AND PRICES22.   It is virtually impossible to frame legislation in such a way thatit will always prove &quot;cast iron&quot; in its application across the whole field of prices and incomes, particularly on the pay side with its diversity ofarrangements between employers and unions.   The tougher the powers, themore likely it is that their uso will be challenged in the Courts.23.   The possibility of evasion of powers by employees must be recognised,given the wide scope for causing disruption of production, short of openstrike action, to persuade employers to implement pay increases contraryto the policy (e.g. by go-slows, working to rule, working &quot;withoutenthusiasm&quot;).24.   But the risk of evasion exists in almost any policy which requiressanctions and provided that the extent of evasion was not largo this need not undermine general support for the policy - as the Standstillexperience showed,,-5-
25.   The following powers appear essential -(i)   It must be possible to direct that a settlement is not to be implemented without the Government1s consent,(ii)   If, however, a settlement has been implemented before suchaction is taken, it must be possible to direct that payments under it are to be suspended for up to twelve months.26.   Reliance on the deferment powers as they are in the 196-7 Act has thedrawback that action has to be related to the settlement   and difficulties arise over the precise identification of the agreement which gives riseto an increase.   Moreover, there is scope for dotermined employers and unions, where they are in collusion, to circumvent this form of power.The alternative is to take power to defer increases by directing in an individual case that an employer should not increase the pay of hisemployees without the Ministers consent.27.   This was the basis of the temporary powers under Part IV of the 1966Act and thus it will strike many people as a drastic form of power overpay.   Y/hen the Government decided last year against continuing this formof power the policy was one of &quot;Moderation&quot; whereas now we have to call for very considerable restraint.   We consider it necessary, therefore, to seek this form of power.Power to prevent retrospective payment of increases which have been deferred under the policy28.   We have to consider also talcing power to bar retrospective payments in order to prevent the imposition of a deferment on a bad settlement fromachieving nothing more than a back-dating of the pay held up,29.   One nust expect great difficulty in enforcing a bar to retrospectivepayments by demonstrating (and satisfying the Courts) that an increase in pay made by an employer after the deferment period had expired had been designed to cover up a retrospective payment.   It would not be sufficientto put the employer only under a statutory obligation never to make suchretrospective payments;   it would be necessary also to make unions and employees liable to the sanctions of section 16(4-) of the 1966 Act if they took action to persuade him to do so.   But it would be equally difficultto demonstrate that employees bringing pressure on an employer were out to get a retrospective increase and not simply to get a new and substantial increase in pay.-6-SECRET
30e   The issue of a bar to retrospection was discussed with the CBI andTUC in 1967 when the CBI pressed strongly for it as part of a wider range of powers.     The TUC, notwithstanding the evident frailty of such a power, were bitterly opposed to it.      The same attitude seems likelyto be taken today by the CBI and TUG,31,   Despite the doubts about enforcement, such a bar would give someencouragement to those employers who did not themselves wish to aoceptthe idea of retrospective payments.     It would also strike many people as another strengthening of the policy.     On these grounds the legislation should include a bar to retrospection0Position of Statutory Wage Regulation Bodies32,   It would be necessary to take power to defer implementation of the awards of these bodies (Wages Councils and Agricultural Wages Boards)where these were in conflict with the requirements of the policy.    We had such powers in Part IV of the 1966 Act, including power to delay theoperation of the orders which the Agricultural Wages Boards themselvesmake to give effeot to their awards.Powers over Prices33 a   There must be power to defer proposed increajes in prices and torequire reversion of price increases held to be contrary to the policy -for up to twelve months as in the case of incomes,34,   The important extension of the present powers on prices is to take power to reduce existing prices where these are found to be inconsistent with the policy,35*   The question of retrospection does not arise directly over price as it does over pay because, with perhaps a very few exceptions, a suppliercannot hope to obtain from his customers the increase which he wasoompelled to defer in respect of purchases made during the period of deferment.SgE^ig-S for Offences36,   Subject to the views of the Law Officers, there seems to be no need to re-examine the question of penalties for offences over prices or incomes.Presentationally, the penalties issue on the incomes side has been eased bythe Criminal Justice Act.     The possibility of trade unionists and other employees going to prison for offences under the Prices and InconBS Acthas been substantially diminished but not removed altogether.-7-
Duration of Powers37.   The object must be to ensure that the new powers would be availablefor the next two years at least.    The best nourse would be to take powers for one year with provision in the Bill for extension annually, subject toaffimative resolution.38.  Although the TUC will be bitterly opposed to new statutory powers overpay, they are likely to concentrate their sharpest fire on our takingpower for more than one year ahead.     The TUC fear that powers which arerenewable without fresh legislation might fall into the hands of anotherGovernment..    The CBI are now strongly in favour of extended powers but their recent statement has emphasised that new powers should not beextendable beyond one year without fresh legislation.39.  We must expect, therefore, the strongest opposition from the tuc and CBI to legislation which goes beyond one year.mLimitations on the Government&apos;s Exercise of Statutory Powers40.   Under the present legislation our powers to defer pay and price increases can be exercised only in the context of making references tothe NBPI, unlike the situation under Part XV&quot; of the 1966 Act when wewere free to impose a standstill without a reference to the Board.41 .   For the present phase of &quot;moderation&quot; this limitation has not hadserious drawbacks, but we are envisaging now a much tougher policy witha ceiling put on all settlements.    A ceiling is bound to be ohallengedand, with the attempt to exercise more control over plant agreements, thechallenges are likely to be numerous.     Unless we are free to exercise the powers at our own hand, all such challenges would have to be dealtwith by individual references to the NBPI and this would involve seriou3practical difficulties both for the Government and the Board, howevercursory the latter&apos;s examination of the cases referred to it and evenif the size of the Board and its staff were enlarged.42,   We recognise that an unfettered discretion over the use of powers would strike many as too arbitrary a course even at a time when the policyis being more rigorously applied.     In 1967, when a similar power was, aspart of a tougher policy, under discussion with the CBI, they pressed strongly for some &quot;independent tribunal&quot; (not the NBPI) to scrutinisethe Governments use of powers.     It may be that the CBI will not todayattach as much importance to this &quot;safeguard&quot; in view of their anxietythat the Government should be armed with extended powers over pay.
-9.43 a   I have considered whether some form of advisory panel could be devised to hear appeals against our use of these powers.    But it wouldbe very difficult to justify setting up another body for this purposewhen the NBPI already exists and is the independent statutory bodyconcerned with the application of prices and incomes policy to partioularcases.    Moreover, any new body would be just as likely to be swampedwith cases for examination as the NBPI itself.44,   I have considered also the possibility of at least having some independent scrutiny of those cases which involve dispute between theGovernment and employers and unions about settlements which the government consider in exoess of the ceiling.     In principle, such cases wouldinvolve no more than ascertainment of the &quot;facts&quot; but, in practice, therewould be great difficulty in avoiding argument about the nature of thesettlement and certainly the parties would try to argue out the merits of the settlements.45.   I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that the choice before uslies between continuing to make the exercise of powers subject to reference to the Board or to be free to use them at the governments own hand.     In view of the practical difficulty of continuing the tie to reference to the NBPI during a period when the policy will be a tougherone, I think we should take the latter of these two courses.46,   There is, however, the special case of the exercise of the power toreduce existing prices.     The position is different on the pay side where we would be taking power only to prevent unjustified increases on existinglevels of pay.     When we contemplated in 19^7 taking this power to reduceexisting prices, it was felt that it should be exerciseable only on thebasis of a specific recommendation to the Government by the NBPI and Iconsider that the view taken last year should be maintained.Rents47.   If the prices and incomes policy is to secure general acceptance,rents must not, in my view, be left outside its scope.     The phasing of increases in the regulated rents of private houses is in principlestraightforward.     There are, however, difficult problems in interveningin rent-fixing by local authorities, particularly if powers are suoh as tonake it necessary for them to raise rates to keep dovm rents.    This is apolitically contentious issue.    We must also avoid action which mightdiscourage local authorities from carrying out their new house building programmes especially in areas of greatest need.
i&quot;7 .i48.   The annex prepared by the Housing Ministers suggests that considera-tion would best be directed to the phasing of rent increases in both thepublic and private sectors.     There are, however, important points ofprinciple to be decided on the degree of intervention in the localauthority field, as indicated in the annex.    Y/hen decisions have beentaken on these (and after discussions with the local authority associations), the Housing Ministers will submit detailed proposals.Consultations with the GBI and TUG49.   We arc committed to further consultations with the CBI and TUCabout future prices and incomes policy.     Although we would need tomaintain the essentials of the tougher policy as proposed in thismemorandum, we may have to reconsider some aspects in the light of these consultations.     If my colleagues broadly endorse the proposals in thismemorandum we should need to begin these consultations as soon aspossible.Timing of Introduction of New Policy50.  Y/he never the new policy is announced, it should take effect forthwith,backed by the existing statutory powers, until new ones are available.Unless this was done there would be a rush to make settlements before thenew policy took effect.     If possible, the new policy should be announced at the tine of the Budget.51.   Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations(a) A tougher prices and incomes policy based on extended statutory powers is essential over the next two years. Its details and prospects of success will be influenced by the effects of the Budget on unearned incomes and the cost of living.(b) The basis of this tougher policy should be a ceiling for income increases which should apply to all the main elements in remuneration (but excluding increases in earnings directly related to the amount of work done).(c) The ceiling should be 3i&quot; per cent at an annual rate since thelast increase;   any larger increases must be staged,(d) All increases up to the ceiling should be justified againstthe existing criteria.(e) There should be an exception to the coiling for genuineproductivity agreements.(f) There should be no other exception, but further action should betaken to help the vulnerable groups.-10-
Statutory Powers(g) Our powers in the prices and incomes field should be continued and extended so that the Governrient would be able:-(i)   in cases when increases are contrary to the policy to direct that an employer should not increase the pay of his employees without the Minister&apos;s oonsent,or that he should stop paying an increase he hasstarted to pay;(ii)   similarly defer the implementation of the awards of statutory wage-fixing bodies;(iii)   bar retrospective payments after the end of a periodof deferment;(iv)   defer proposed price increases and require reversionof increases contrary to the policy;(v)   require price reductions if the NBPI so&quot;recommend;(vi)   the maximum period of delay under (i), (ii), (iv) and(v) should be twelve months.(h) Powers should be renewable annually by affirmative resolution.(i) With the exception of (v) above, the exercise of the powers should not be tied to references to the NBPI,,(j)   It is essential chat rents should not be outside the scopeof prices and incomes policy and legislation.52.   If these recommendations are endorsed by my colleagues, we should now begin the necessary consultations with CBI and TUG,     If at allpossible, the new policy should be announced at the time of the Budget.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1.26th February 1968-11-
ANNEXRENTSThe White Papers on prices and incomes policy have recognisedthat the criteria for increases in prices and incomes are not aptin the case of rents.    Since nearly all private rents are subjectto statutory limitation, and local authority rents are relatedonly to costs incurred and any deficit has to be met from the rates.Suspension of council rent increases would also mean that increased costs would fall wholly on the ratepayers and that larger rent increases would be required when the period of suspension ended.(i)   Local authority rents2.    The circumstances of local housing accounts vary widely.    Itwould be impossible to lay down general criteria for rent increases which were not arbitrary in their operation.    Intervention wouldnot normally be warranted unless the authority were increasing rentsby a substantially greater amount than was required to meet increased expenditure in any one year or to offset reduced receipts arisingfrom the introduction or extension of a rent rebate scheme designedto give more help to the poorer tenants.3.    If it is thought desirable that Housing Ministers should be ableto control rent increases, the following powers might be taken:-(1)   to require authorities to give early warning of any rent increase and to supply any additional information.(2)   to direct authorities in particular cases to phase rent increases so as to limit the size of increases in any oneyear;(3)   to di rect in a particular case the date from which theincrease shall take effect.h&apos;    An essential point of principle to be decided is whetherMinisters&apos; intervention should extend to requiring an authority to incur a deficit on the housing revenue account or a greater deficitthan they had intended to incur - i.e. to contribute more from therates towards housing costs than they had intended.    If there isnot tnis power, then the Minister would be able to direct only thatpent increases should be limited to what is required to balance the1 1.SECRET
account, subject to whatever rate fund contribution the authority isprepared to make.    If intervention virere thus limited, it is unlikely that any reduction could he secured, for example,  in theG.L.C. rent increases.    On the other hand intervention which had theeffect of increasing the call on rates would involve a majordeparture from the principle of an authority&apos;s independence in determining the rate it will levy.5.    Direct intervention by Ministers in the fixing of localauthority rents will of course involve the Government in the rent increases which are made - some of which will necessarily hesubstantial - and also in any increase in rates due to thereduction in rent increases resulting from directions to &quot;localauthorities.6, We must also avoid action which might discourage localauthorities from carrying out their new building programmesespecially in areas of greatest need.7.    There will need to he prior discussion with the local authority associations on any proposals for intervention (assuming that thereare to be discussions with the T.U.C. and C.B.I.).(11)   Private.....Rents8.    Rents in the private sector are with unimportant exceptionssubject either to rent control or rent regulation.    In the formercase rents are in effect frozen.    Pair rents (which excludescarcity value) may be determined for regulated tenancies by rentofficers or rent assessment committees.    These can sometimes resultin sharp increases.    If it is desired to limit the amount of anincrease payable at any one time, Housing Ministers might heempowered to prescribe a system of phasing in appropriate casesover a period of not more than three years (the period after whichfair rents may be reviewed).2.
1&apos; &quot; secret 75&apos;. (-iii)8taff implications9,    Control of local authority rent increases will requireMpitional staff to operate.    There are some 1,600 local housing authorities in Great Britain, at least a third of whom are likelyI; to increase their rents in any one year.   All increases notifiedwill require examination and about 20% may warrant some form of intervention.    It will involve extensive correspondence bothwhere Ministers decide to intervene and where they decide not todo so.   The bulk of the cases will be in England, and thefollowing additional staff will be needed in the Ministry of housing to deal with 500 cases referred and. 100 cases requiringintervention in a year - 1 Assistant Secretary, 2 S.E.0&apos;s, V H.E.0&apos;sZf.E.0&apos;s, U C.0&apos;s and typing staff.3.
