I invite my colleagues to approve the White Paper for publication early next week.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W. 1.27th March, 1968
DRAFT. WHITE PAPERPROpUCTIVITY., PRICES AND INCOMES POLICYIN 1,9.68 AND 19.69INTRODUCTION     TOE POLICY AND STATUTORY POWERSi,   We now have a real basis for putting our balance of paymentsinto substantial surplus and paying off our debts abroad, and anopportunity for the economy to sustain a faster rate of growth anda higher level of employment than was possible before devaluation.i,   But paying our way abroad means consuming less of what weproduce ourselves, and we shall be able to take these opportunitiesonly if there is a major shift of resources from domestic consump-tion to exports and import saving, and if the competitive advantagegained by devaluation is not eroded by an inflation of costs.   Theaction taken in the Budget is intended to achieve the first ofthese tasks and this will mean a temporary fall in personal consumption.   The prices and incomes policy is vitally important in maintaining the competitive edge of devaluation.3,   Over the next two years it is of paramount importance for thenational economic strategy after devaluation to raise productivity and efficiency and to obtain substantial restraint from all sections of the community in order to keep incomes more in line-dth the expected growth of national output and prevent them risingiith the cost of living.^   The Government&apos;s firm intention is to continue the development or the policy for productivity, prices and incomes to the fullest xtent practicable on a voluntary basis, in consultation with the-^federation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress.3-   The economy cannot yet afford any automatic increase in personal incomes and all increases or other significant improve--ents must continue to be justified against the criteria andc^.Siderations which are set out below.1.
2The new feature of the policy will &quot;be a ceiling of 3ir pernt on wage and salary and dividend increases .    But the Government:to encourage genuine productivity agreements which can make a valuable contribution to raising productivity and stabilising orreducing prices, and the policy provides for an exception to the ceiling for such agreements.7,   There will be unavoidable increases in prices because of devaluation and the Budget, but it is essential that there shouldbe continuing efforts to contain cost increases by improvements inefficiency and greater productivity, to avoid unjustifiable price increases and to reduce prices where practicable.8,   There must be protection for the poorest section of thecommunity and there must be restraint, not only on employmentincomes, but also on incomes from property.h   The Government believe it is necessary in the circumstancesnow facing the country and in the light of experience since 1966to have available statutory powers.    The powers at present avail-able to the Government derive from Part II of the Prices and incomes Act, 1966, as extended by the Prices and Incomes Act, 1967,and are exercisable in the context of references to the national board for Prices and Incomes.    These powers enable the Governmentto require statutory notification of proposed increases in prices and pay and to defer increases for a maximum of seven months.10.  The relevant section of the 1967 Act will expire on 11thAugust 1968 and Part II of the 1966 Act will lapse at the sametime unless renewed by Order in Council.    The Government haveiscided to introduce legislation to replace the powers under thespiring sections of the 1967 Act so as tor-(i) lengthen the maximum delaying power on price and pay increases to 12 months in the context of reference totho N.B.P.I.;(ii) require reductions in existing prices where this is recommended by the N.B.P.I.J
(iii) moderate and phase housing rent increases;(iv) require notification of dividend increases and toprevent excessive distributions.*e powers will be sought for at least eighteen months with;royisicn for renewal should this prove necessary.!1, All these powers will be held in reserve and will be used:rly to the extent necessary where the voluntary arrangements are-being properly observed.   The notification arrangements for:rice,      pay and dividend increases will be on a voluntary basis;provide that they operate satisfactorily..2, Full support of this policy for productivity, prices andTiComes will enable us to seize the opportunities in the new situation after devaluation and so ensure the basis for a lastingaprovement in living standards for the whole community.
PRICES AKD CMHG-dS13,   xhe continuing objectives of the -policy for domestic-bribes are to encourage industry an., commerce to containcoat increases by improvements in efficiency and greater productivity^ to avoid unjustifiable price increases andto stabilise or reduce prices where practicable.    Greaternice competitiveness will enhance the advantage for home produced over imported goods.    Increased coats will need to be avoided if the opportunities lor development ofour export trade which devaluation has provided are to be fully exploited.Price, Jncr.eaa.es34.   It is inescapable alter devaluation that price increases will occur where costs of manufacturing anddistribution have been unavoidably increased as the resultof higher coots of imported foodstuffs, materials and.components.    Similarly there will be some increases inprices as a result of direct .: ction by the Government,such as increased taxation.     But it is essential that increases in manufacturers&apos;  and distributors&apos;   prices dueto hi her impo, t costs and. Government action should dono more than cover the overall inc. eases in costs thathas been sustained. &amp;Aeria: -for - Price &quot;Increases15.  livery effort should be made to absorb increases incoots b;; means of increased efficiency, and price increases should take place only where [strictly]justified bp- one or more or the following criteria:-(i)   If output per employee cannot be increasedsufficiently to allow wages and salaries toincrease at a rate consistent with the criteriaII-1

The reference to the criteria of incomes policy in thefirst ox the above criteria must now, of course, be takento include the application or the ceiling and the incomes policy considerations set out in the incomes section below.1.   increased prices, particularly of foodstuffs, due to changes in suppl / for seasonal or other reasons areunavoidable, but where prices rise for these reasons thevshould fall again when supplies are -plentiful.l&apos;j.   ,:he need in the present economic circumstances toincrer.se price competitiveness makes even more necessaryexports by all concerned, in determining prices to reduce priceswherever possible.

These reguire price reductions:(i)    if output per employee is increasing faster than the rate of increase in wages and salarieswhich is consistent with the criteria forincomes, and. there are no offsetting and un-avoidable increases in non-labour costs per unit of output;(ii)   if the costs of materials, fuel or servicesper unit of output are falling and there areno offsetting and unavoidable increases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;(iii)     if capital costs per unit of output are fallingand. there are no offsetting and unavoidableincreases in non-capital costs per unit of output;(iv)     if profits are based on excessive market power. rices.. Supervision20.   It is the Government&apos;s intention that the policy on prices should, although strengthened by extendedreserve powers, continue as far as possible to operate on a voluntary basis.   The number of individual prices in the economy makes detailed supervision of all pricesimpracticable.   However, the Government intend that theearly warning arrangements for notification of proposed increases in prices should continue, and, where necessary,be extended in co-operation with industry and commerce.These arrangements enable the Government to maintain awatch on the trend of prices over a wide range of goods of economic significance, including those of importance inthe cost of living.
r.Report ho. 55 on Distributors1 hargins in Relation torecommended Prices (Cmnd. 35uS)II-5concluded In a recent report   on prices recommended bymanufacturers for- the resale of their goods, that ingeneral in such circumstances a reduction in distributors&apos;percentage margins should be made where the manufacturer&apos; s:rice has to be increased because of devaluation.    TheGovernment consider that in principle there should, benet automatic maintenance of distributors&apos; percentagemargins when their prices are increased to take accountox&quot; hi,her costs.AB^licatj^orLof /che Policy26.   The criteria end. considerations set out above are intended to be applied by all concerned - manufacturers,wholesalers and retailers - in the determination of prices for the sale of goods, and charges for the performance of services, on the home market in both the private andpublic sectors.    This includes all concerned in the negotiation of prices under individual contract.2?.   The Government will not hesitate to use theirstrengthened delaying pov/ers to prevent unjustifiableincreases in prices and will continue -to refer tothe National Board, for Prices and Incomes any Questionrelating to prices where independent examination isdesirable.
III....   INCOMESgm^employment Incomes13,   For the reasons set out in Part I above substantial restraintis required over the next two years, and the Government propose totake power to delay increases in. pay for up to 12 months in the context of reference to the N.B.P.I.     All increases in pay, orother significant improvements, will need to be justified againstthe criteria and considerations of the policy.      In addition, theGovernment have decided that for all wage and salary settlementsreached on or after 20th March 1 968 which satisfy these criteriamid considerations there will be a ceiling of 3i per cent.The Ceiling1k,   The ceiling will be applied as an annual rate;    thus if in aparticular case the criteria permit an increase, and. morethan a year has elapsed since the pay of the particular groupwas last adjusted, the coiling on any such increase will be correspondingly higher than 3? per cent, though large increases will still need to be staged,15.   Wage and salary earnings are largely determined, by referenceto rates or scales of pay which may apply to the time worked, orto units of work or output, or to a combination of both.     The3i per cent ceiling is intended to be applied to increases inthese rates or scales and other elements referred to inparagraph 1 6, having regard to the effect on earnings.     But itis not intended to apply to increases in earnings which are due tc necessary    increases in hours worked or in the amountof work done,16.   This means that the ceiling should cover increases in basicP&quot;v rates and allowances (including basic pay scales or ranges) ,rates for overtime, night or shift working, etc.      Improvementsln fringe benefits, normal or standard hours or holidayIII - 1
entitlement must also bo taken into account for the purpose ofreplying the ceiling.qt  There will, of course, be increases in earnings underpayment by results systems resulting directly from increased output.     Changes in payment by results systems, including changesin piecework rates, bonus rates or standard times should not,however, result in higher earnings unless they can be justified on grounds of increased effort or other direct contribution towards increasing productivity from the employees concerned.It is expected that the forthcoming report of the N.B.P.I. on payment by results will offer guidance on the application of incomes policy to these systems of payment,18.   Changes in rates or scales may be settled at national,local, firm or plant level, but where groups benefit fromincreases or improvements settled at more than one level, theapplication of the ceiling requires that tho overall increase should not exceed the 3i? per cent ceiling.      In consideringincreases settled, at national level account must be taken of probable increases at local, company and plant level;    conversely,increases in rates settled at the plant level should be taken together with relevant increases settled at other levels.19.  Where a settlement covers the pay of one or more groups ofworkers, or a wage or salary structure is considered as a whole,the ceiling applies to the settlement as a whole, thus permittingflexibility of adjustment of rotes within the group or structure.^kSLig..for Incpnx-s Policy20.   Over the next two years the criteria contained in Cmnd.3235sl11 continue to apply.      These provide for increases in thefollowing circumstances: -(i)   where the employees concerned, for example by acceptingmore exacting work or a major change in workingpractices, make a direct contribution towards increasingIII - 2
productivity in the particular firm or industry,    Evenin such cases some of the benefit should accrue to thecommunity as a whole in the form of lower prices;(ii)    where it is essential in the national interest tosecure a change in the distribution of manpower (or toprevent a change which would otherwise take place)  anda pay increase would bo both necessary and effective for this purpose&apos;;(iii)    where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levels arc too low to maintain a reasonable standard, of living;(iv)    where there is widespread recognition that the pay ofa certain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to bo improved.21,   These criteria will need to be applied firmly and should be read in conjunction with the considerations which are set out below, and whore appropriate with the reports of the N.B.P.I.22,   It is of continuing importance to encourage increased productivity and efficiency, and so help stabilise or reduceprices, and priority will continue to be given to increases whichsre justified against the productivity criterion.   Reorganisationsof wage and salary structures which can be justified, on grounds of economic efficiency and increased productivity may be justifiedunder this criterion.      There may be productivity agreements ors?-jor reorganisations of wage and salary structures which, asexceptions, justify above-coiling increases (see paragraph 29).23.   It will be necessary to ensure that increases under the lowcriterion are confined to low paid workers.     Low paid workers&apos;71H be able to benefit up to the coiling if their claims satisfyHis criterion.     Under any settlement which, as a whole, isIII - 3

In addition the purpose of the new arrangements.r-,r family allowances is to ensure that help is given specifically to low   paid workers with two or more children.jlj, The criterion justifying increases on grounds of comparabilityneeds to be applied selectively;, and must not be used to spreadnpv increases into areas of employment where; the originaljustification does not apply.ires1; &apos;   :&apos; &apos;&quot; &quot;v /-&apos; : : &apos;   &apos; ; ,     &apos; .    &apos;1 :25, The criterion justifying pay increases on manpower groundsis retained;, but &quot;there is a growing acceptance on both sides ofindustry that the most effective way of remedying a labour shortage is to use existing manpower more efficiently,26, The ceiling and the criteria described above do not apply id-;-.! i&apos;to existing arrangements for increasing pay with ago, as withapprentices or juveniles, or by means of regular incrementssrithin a fixed range or scale, or progressions based on addedexperience, increased responsibility or special effort, orincreases resulting from promotion to work at a higher level,aether with the same or a different employer.      It would be contrary to the policy for posts to be regraded without properjustification as a means of raising pay.Soft-of Livinft27. Pay increases based on a rise in the cost of living are not justified under the criteria, and should not be conceded.     Notonly would this be self-defeating since it would result in further^creases in costs and prices, but it could set off a wage price- .diral that would damage our competitive position.      Cost of4ving sliding scales are of diminishing importance in industry,U!d pay increases resulting from such existing arrangements shouldOP HV &apos; &apos; d&apos;p o,xen fully into account in applying the ceiling to the pay oft::o group covered.Ill - k
-.81itInterva 1j3 e t wcpq j3?g   The period, which should elapse between the operative dates of successive settlements should be at least twelve months.Tc^tipus to the, CgoiJLping;There will be exceptions to the ceiling for genuineoroductivity agreements which raise productivity sufficiently tojustify a pay increase above 3i per cent and which are found to conform to the guidelines laid down by the N.B.P.I, in theirReport No.36 on &quot;Productivity Agreements&quot; .    (These guidelinesm reproduced in Appendix II.)    Major reorganisations of wageI aid salary structures which can be justified on grounds ofeconomic efficiency and increased productivity may also qualify for exceptional treatment.Staging30,  It was stated in paragraph 2k of Cmnd. 3235 that in somecases it is appropriate for substantial improvements in pay or conditions to be achieved by stages, even though justified underthe criteria.     The application of the ceiling should considerablyreduce the number of cases where large increases are justified,but they may still occur where a much longer interval than twelvesouths has elapsed since the previous increase or improvement,-die need to consider staging in such cases will be particularly important now that the majority of workers will be able to receiveonly limited increases.^U^i-Qfl. of the,JPgolicy31-.  The ceiling and criteria for incomes policy and the considerations set out above are intended to be applied by allI concerned with the determination of employment incomes in theprivate and public sectors, whether at national, local, company* Plcnt level and including arbitrators, independent reviewv-odies and statutory wage fixing bodies.
-9   it will continue to be the aim of the Government ininsult tit ion with the Confederation of British Industries and thewies Union Congress, and with the assistance of the parties,md of the 2T.B.P.I.  in appropriate cases, to secure the effective5J1d consistent application of the policy both in the private andtaolic sectors,ilotificat ion of. C^laijms^and, , Pjp Pj3QA9.d.3.c.tt.1 ejaents53, Under the existing early warning arrangements described, inOld,2808 the Government receive information on a voluntary basis-bout claims and proposals to increase pay fromthe C.B.I. and the T.U.C., from organisations whichare not members of either of these bodies, andiirectly from firms and employers&apos;  organisations in the case of&quot;local and company negotiations.      There are similar arrangementsfor the public sector.% It is intended that these arrangements will continue, andconsequently information about claims and proposed settlements,siiether at national, local, company or plant level, willcontinue to bo required.     While all settlements are subject tothe requirements of the policy, the information to bo submittedunder the early warning arrangements relates to claims and proposed settlements which might be significant (e.g. because ofthe nature of the claim, or the possible repercussions on the pay&quot;f other groups)  and, in any case, to all those involving morethan 100 workers.n.  The information about claims should specify the nature and.ut.is of the claim, the proposed elate of implementation, theyoaber and category or workers covered, and the date and terms&quot;l *-ae previous settlement covering this group of workers.      The&quot;Otification should also include an assessment of the justification-&apos; &quot;the proposed improvement against the criteria and consicler--Ji0ns set out in paragraphs 20-30.   The . information about proposed:-tleaonts should give details of the way in which the ceiling hasC6en calculated and applied.Ill - 6
III-other Forms......of,I^Jttvlojgjaent.-Ijicpmi erQ   Many individual salaries and. other forms of remuneration,including that of company directors and executives, are fixedoutside the usual process of collective bargaining.      Theprinciples of incomes policy should however be applied equallytc them as to other forms of income.      The Companies Act of 1967has provisions concerning the disclosure of the remuneration of directors and executives.51,  The incomes and scales of charges and fees of self-employed,persons, including all forms of professional fees, are expectedto conform with the policy.     The Government have referred to theI.B.P.I. the remuneration of solicitors, and architects costs andfees.    The Board&apos;s report on solicitors&apos; remuneration was published in February,  and its recommendations are beingconsidered by the Government.Icn-Efflploxm^cnt^ Ippomos52.  The Government are committed to use their fiscal powers or-other appropriate means to correct any excessive growth in aggregate profits, whether distributed or not, as compared withthe growth of total wages and salaries, after allowing for short-terra fluctuations.      If Parliament agrees, the rate of Corporationi&apos;f.x will be increased by 2-g- per cent to Lj-2-g- per cent,  and aspecial charge, which is expected to yield a revenue of  100 million,Bill; &quot;be made on the investment income of an individual for 1967-8&quot;here this exceeds  3,000.53,  The Government will also refer for examination by the N.B.P.I.prices cases where the growth of profits or dividends is based onexcessive market power.%, As already announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sudget Statement the Government propose to take statutory powers-dating to notification of dividend increases and prevention of excessive distributions.      All companies are asked not to increase
-g 245&quot;68ividends without good reason and to limit any essential increase.n OTocise terms, total ordinary dividends in respect of a companyecount year should he limited to:-(i)   not more than 3f per cent above the amount of ordinarydividends declared in respect of the preceding accountyear;or (ii) no&quot;k Qore than the amount in respect of the accountyear before that;or(lii) where dividends in each of the last two account years were abnormally low, and subject to examination and approval by the Treasury, not more than the amount inrespect of an earlier account year.35,  This requirement affects all companies incorporated in theUnited Kingdom with the exception of unit trusts, investmenttrusts, those close companies which increase.se distributions toneet the requirements of the Finance Act 1965, and companies whollyowned by other companies where ordinary dividend payments areexclusively inter-company transactions.      It affects alldistributions in respect of paid-up ordinary share capital whichare recommended after 19th March 1968.55.  The call for dividend restraint is addressed to all other companies, and in order to achieve its objectives the Governmentddl institute early warning arrangements in the maincompany sector comparable to the arrangements made in the field of prices and pay.     All quoted companies are therefore asked to notify the Treasury whenever an intended distribution would^clve any increase at all above total declarations in respectJ the preceding company accounts year and such companies should-L&apos; take  . irrevocable action upon such intentions without thetreasury&apos;s consent.
IV-1IV.      RENTS AND RATESBents of Houses57,  House rents are a large item in the family budgets ofworkers, and sharp changes in rent levels are, therefore, ofsignificance for incomes policy.55,  Many private rents are still rigidly controlled under the rent Act, 1957o      For those subject to rent regulation underthe Rent Act, 1965? fair rents are determined by Rent officers or Rent Assessment Committees.     In certain cases, these can giverise to sharp increases, and it is therefore proposed that in thepresent situation the Housing Ministers should be empowered tomake Regulations for phasing increases above a stipulated minimumamount over a period not exceeding three years.59.  Most local authorities have followed Government advice and kept increases in the rents of their houses to no more than has been needed to meet increases in costs.     Many have adopted orimproved rent rebate schemes.      Some, however, have raised rentsmore sharply, for example on a scale designed to secure sufficientrevenue now to cover cost increases over several years ahead.In present circumstances this is not compatible with prices and incomes policy.oO.   The Government have decided therefore to take powers torequire early warning of rent increases and to enable them to direct local authorities to moderate or phase rent increases which they regard as too high in present circumstances.
CONFIDENTIAL , -...221IV-2g-j..   Rates as a form of taxation arc outside the scope of prices and incomes policy;    they are necessary to help pay for the range of services provided &quot;by local authorities.      Better services are bound to cost fibre money, but the Government have taken steps toreduce the impact of rates on householders by providing special grants which reduce the amount in the   they have to pay by 5d.in the   this year and 10d. in the   in 1968/69.     As a result ofthis and of the savings made by local authorities most house-holders have during the present year paid little, if any, more in rates than they did the year before.     There is every reason tobelieve that this will also be the case in 1968/69, though largerincreases may be unavoidable in some areas.      In addition theincome limits for rate rebates are being raised from next october and this should help many householders with small incomes,particularly those with large families.62.   In Scotland rates are fixed much later in the year and itis not yet possible to say what their level will be in 1968-69.however, special grants will reduce the amount householdershave to pay by l/8d. in the   compared with 10d. in 1967-68;and the higher income limits for rate rebates will also applyfrom next October.
