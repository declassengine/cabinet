C[68l60COPY NO.6 515rti March, 1966CABINETPRODUCTIVITY, PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY;&quot; PROVISIONAL DRAFT OF A WHITE paper note by fche Secretary of State for Economic affairs my colleagues invited me to circulate for our meeting on18th March a draft White Paper, recognising that this would have to bea provisional draft prepared in advance of final decisions about the future policy, of the Budget Statement and of consultations with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC),2.      The attached provisional draft has been prepared by my officials.It has not been discussed interdepartmentally and is circulated at thisstage for information only.3. Certain important parts of the White Paper including theintroduction will be drafted in the light of the Budget Statement.4.      In my view consultations with the CBI and TUC on the contents ofthe White Paper will be very necessary but cannot take place until afterthe Budget Statement.    It is too much to expect that these bodies willin any sense endorse the White Paper but we must avoid producingresentment through an absence of consultation, particularly from the tuc.    The need for such consultation will influence the timing but wemust strive to achieve publication of the White Paper not later thanThursday, 28th March.5.      I will consult my colleagues again about a revised draft of theWhite Paper as soon as possible after I have held talks with the CBI andTUC next week,,    Meanwhile, interdepartmental discussion of the draftcan go forward at official level.PDepartment of Economic AffairsS, W. 1.15th March, 1968
II.    PRICES AND charges the continuing objectives of the prices policy are toencourage industry and commerce to avoid cost increases,  toincrease efficiency, and, wherever possible,  to stabilise orreduce prices.      Greater price competitiveness will enhancethe advantage for home produced, over imported goods and the opportunities for development of our export trade whichdevaluation has provided.     The national interest requires that there should be a continuing effort to contain cost increases by improvements in efficiency and greater productivity,avoid unjustifiable price increases and reduce prices where practicable.Price Increases2.    It is inescapable after devaluation that price increases will occur where costs of manufacturing and distribution have been directly increased as the result of higher costs of imported materials and of components.     But it is essential that increasesmmanufacturers&apos;  and distributors&apos; prices due to higher importcosts should do no more than cover the increase in costs overallthat has been sustained, and the Government will continue toexamine proposed increases with this in mind.A recent report by the National Board for Prices and Incomes138 demonstrated, in the particular case of prices recommended byRec--t-W&quot;* -5- 0n Di?trihutors&apos; Margins in Relation toecommended Prices (Command 35U6)1COMFSDENTSALDRAFT SECTIONS OF A WHITE PAPERONPgODUC^IVITX^MI .    INTRODUCTION[To &quot;be drafted after the Budget.]
nanufafturers for the resale of their goods, that a reduction&apos;in distributors&apos; percentage margins should be made where the manufacturers price has to be increased because of devaluation.The Government consider that in principle there should be noautomatic maintenance of distributors&apos; margins when distributors&apos;prices are increased to take account of higher costs due todevaluation.Ii,   Increased prices, particularly of foodstuffs, due to changes in supply for seasonal or other reasons are alsounavoidable, but where prices rise for these reasons theynormally fall again when supplies are plentiful.[Price increases as a result of Government action,]5,   In all other cases, price increases should take place only where strictly justified by one or more of the criteria set out below.    This applies to all prices for the sale of goods -manufacturing, wholesale and retail - and for all charges forthe performance of services on the home market by both the public and private sector.^ella, for Price Increases6.   The criteria, drawn up in consultation with both sides ofindustry, which are set out in   Command 3235   will continueto apply;These criteria allow price increases in the following circumstances(i)   if output per employee cannot be increased sufficiently to allow wages and salaries to increase at a rateconsistent with the criteria for incomes without some increase in prices, and no offsetting reductions can bemade in non-labour costs per unit of output or in thereturn sought on investment;if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costssuch as materials, fuel, services or marketing costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in2
labour or capital costs per unit of output or in thereturn sought on investment;[xi)     if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in non-capital costs per unit of output or in the returnsought on investment;(iv)     if, after every effort has been made to reduce costs,the enterprise is unable to secure the capital requiredto meet home and overseas demand.7,   The need in the present economic circumstances to increaseprice competitiveness makes even more necessary efforts by allconcerned in determining prices to reduce prices wherever possible.In particular, prices in the manufacturing sector will need to fallin order to offset price increases in other sectors where it issore difficult tc absorb increases in costs by increasing productivity.Criteria for PriceJ^jiuctions8,   The criteria for price reductions specified in Command 3235will continue to apply.     These require price reductions:(i) if output per employee is increasing faster than the rateof increase in wages and salaries which, is consistent with the criteria for incomes, and there are no off-setting and unavoidable increases in non-labour costs per unit of output;(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of output are falling and there are no offsetting andunavoidable increases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;(iii) if capital costs per unit of output are falling and. thereare no offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-capital costs per unit of output;
...(iv)   if profits are based on excessive market power.rices^Sujie:rvisiono    As in the case of incomes it is the Government&apos; sJ *intention that the policy on prices in this new phase shouldcontinue as far as possible to operate on a voluntary basis.The number of individual prices in the economy makes detailedsupervision of all prices impracticable.     However the government intend that the early warning arrangements for notification of proposed increases in prices should continue and, where necessary,be extended in cooperation with industry and commerce.      these arrangements enable the Government to maintain a watch on the trend of prices over a wide range of goods of economicsignificance, including those of importance in the cost of living.10.  The voluntary early warning system is described in theWhite Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy:      An &quot;Early Warning&quot;System (Command 2808).     The goods and services to which these arrangements currently apply are listed in Annex     , and as announced in Parliament recently the Government are in consultationwith industry on the addition of further goods to this list.11.  The consistency of proposals for increases notified underthese arrangements with the policy set out in this White Paper?ill he rigorously scrutinised, and appropriate cases will bereferred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes for examination.15.  There are also arrangements to keep watch over the trend of^nufacturers&apos; prices of certain goods (excluding food) where-vance notice of individual price increases is not practicable,&apos;8. oecause of fluctuations in raw material prices (Annex ) .:r&apos;c&quot;?s Possible these will be extended.    The arrangements-,-for -keeping-instant watch on the prices of a number of basic foodstuffs&quot;Ul continue (Annex ).
j*   These arrangements for the supervision of prices are,-xcept in the case of certain foodstuffs,  concerned with thecrices of manufacturing industry.     The Government intend alsoto keep generally under review the trend of retail pricesbecause of the importance of avoiding unjustifiable increases in retail prices which would offset restraint exercised at the manufacturing end.     Where appropriate, the GovernmentDepartments concerned will follow up with retailers the movementof prices of particular products.Application of the Policyill..  The criteria and considerations set out above are intendedto be applied by all concerned, including wholesalers and retailers,in the determination of prices arid charges on the home market in both the private and public sectors.15.  The Government intend to make full use of their power torefer to the National Board for Prices and Incomes any questionrelating to prices where independent examination is desirable.Such references will,  in accordance with the Government decisionannounced by the Prime Minister in September, 1967, include any proposals for major increases in the public sector.5
III. TYSNT3 AND RATESRentsif,  House rents tire a large item in the family budgets of workers,and sharp changes in rent levels are, therefore, of significancefor incomes policy,17,  Since the measures of July,  1966, most local authoritieshave followed Government advice and kept increases in the rentsof their houses to no more than has been needed to meet increases in costs.     Many have adopted or improved rent rebate schemes.Some, however, have raised rents more sharply, for example on a scale designed to secure sufficient revenue now to cover cost&apos;increases ever several years ahead.      vfhatevcr justificationthere may have been for such action in other times,  it would notin present circumstances he compatible with prices and incomes policy.18.  The Government have decided therefore to take powers torequire early warning of rent increases and to enable them to direct local authorities to moderate rent increases which they regard as unduly high in present circumstances.19.  Many private rents are still rigidly controlled under theKent Act, 1957.     For those subject to rent regulation under theSent Act, 1965, fair rents are determined by Rent Officers orSent Assessment Committees.      These give rise to sharp increases in certain cases, and it is therefore proposed that in the presentsituation power should be taken for the Housing Ministers to make regulations for a scheme of phasing, over a period not exceeding three years, of increases above a stipulated minimum amount.^.   In view of the effect on costs of increases in rents for&quot;Usmoss premises and. land, those concerned shou-ld take into6
CONFIDENTIAL &apos; * &apos; , Q1 O Ioccount the need for restraint in any negotiation of rents totake effect over [this period].Rates21.  Rates as a form of taxation are outside the scope of prices and incomes policy.     Rates this year are &quot;being made against the background of the Governments request to local authorities thatthe rate of growth of local government expenditure will have tooo kept substantially below the 6 per cent to 7 per cent perannum of the recent past, which will mean little room for theinprovement of services and, in some cases, a temporary lapse in standards.     Similar restraints will apply in Scotland (whererates are fixed, later in the year).&amp;i   On this basis the rise in rates in England and. Wales can beexpected to be about the same as last year and substantially below the average of previous years.      The rate for householderswill be 10d less than the general rate as a result of increases in Exchequer grant.      Siftce rate poundages are higher in scotland the reduction in the rate for householders will be l/8d in1968/69.7
23-   OverIV   INCCUESthe next [two years] it is of paramount importance for thetional economic strategy after devaluation to obtain a large measuref restraint on income increases.     The objectives are:(x)   first, to keep intact the competitive advantage of devaiu-ation by avoiding increases in money costs;(ii)   second., to limit consumption by avoiding any increase in incomes to compensate for the increased.cost of livingresulting from devaluation and from direct Government action,ih, The economy cannot yet afford any general increase in personaliicomes and all increases or other significant improvements mustlontinue to be justified against the criteria and considerationsfhich are set out below.     The Government are anxious to give every^encouragement to genuine productivity agreements which can make araluable contribution to raising productivity in the interests ofsports and import saving and the policy is intended to take this&quot;ital need fully into account.25i Without firm guidance about the tolerable level of settlements,the tendency during a period, of rising economic activity and substan-tial increase in the level of prices is for the average outcome ofrage and salary settlements to rise beyond a level that the countryraii afford.     In order to provide a clear lead the Government havedecided to set a &quot;ceiling&quot; on all wage and salary increases which can36 Justified against the criteria.     Prom now on until the [end of-5^9] the ceiling will apply at the level of 3^ per cent on wage anda*Ary increases, calculated as an annual rate since the date of theincrease,,Wage and salary earnings are commonly determined by reference to&quot;0 or scales of pay which may apply to the time worked or to units&quot;0ric ov output or to a combination of both.      The       per centlnS is intended to be applied to increases in these rates or8
or scales, but not to increases in earnings which are legitimately-ue to increases in hours worked and/or the amount of work done.97,  This means that the ceiling should cover increases in basictes and allowances,  including basic pay scales or ranges;    ratesfor overtime, night or shift working;    payment by results rates(including piece-rates, bonus and merit rates) and lieu rates;    andskill and responsibility allowances, etc. Improvements in fringebenefits, normal or standard, hours of holiday entitlement must alsobe taken into account for the purpose of applying the ceiling.28,  Changes in rates or scales may be settled at national, local,firm or plant level but where groups benefit from increases orimprovements settled at more than one level, the application of the ceiling requires that the overall increase should not exceed the3! per cent coiling.      In some industries with national rates itwill therefore bo inappropriate to negotiate general pay increases.29.   Where groups of workers are considered together,  or a wage orsalary structure is considered as a whole,  the ceiling can be taken as applying to the overall increase in rates,  thus permittingflexibility of adjustment of rates within the group or structure.29a. Changes in payments by results rates (including pieceworkrates:; bonus rates or standard times) should not result in highearnings unless they can be justified on grounds of increasedeffort   or efficiency   and should be contained within the ceiling.     Where such changes take place consequential
10184increases for other groups whose pay is directly linked will &quot;be permissible [provided these groups also increase effort orefficiency].T)r)t   It is not intended that the 3i per cent ceiling should apply to:(i)   Increases in pay genuinely resulting directly from increased output, e.g. piece-work earnings, commis-sions on saless necessary increases in overtimeworked, etc.;(ii)   Normal arrangements for increasing pay with age, aswith apprentices or juveniles, or by means of regularincrements within a fixed range or scale;(iii)   Individual increases in pay genuinely resulting from increased responsibility or special merit or promotion to work at a higher level, whether with the same or adifferent employer.It would be contrary to the policy for posts tobe regraded without proper justification as a means of raising pay above the ceiling.Griterla for Incomes Policy31.  Over the period ending [ ] the broad criteriacontained in Command 3235 which were agreed with Management andilnipns will continue to apply. These provide for increases inthe following circumstances:-(i)   where the employees concerned, for example by accepting more exacting work or a major change in working practices, make a direct contribution towardsincreasing productivity in the particular firm or industry.     Even in such cases some of the benefit should accrue to the community as a whole in theform of lower prices;
11(ii)    where it is essential in the national interest tosecure a change in the distribution of manpower(or to prevent a change which would otherwise takeplace)  and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for this purpose;(iii)   where there is general recognition that existingwage and salary levels are too low to maintain areasonable standard of living;(iv)   where there is widespread recognition that the pay of a certain group of workers has fallen seriouslyout of line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.These criteria will need to be applied firmly and should be readin conjunction with the considerations which are set out below,and where appropriate with the reports of the N.B.P.I.32,   The criteria relating to productivity bargaining and improvement in the pay of low-paid workers are often used tojustify pay increases and both the C.B.I, and T.U.C. accept thatpriority should continue to be given to increases justified underthem.    Low paid workers will be able to benefit up to the ceiling if their claims satisfy the appropriate criterion, andthere can be above-ceiling increases for them within a settlement which over all does not exceed the ceiling.     The action takenby the Government to raise family allowances   will also helplower paid workers with two or more children,33,   The criterion   justifying  increases on grounds of compara-WHty is also frecpuently invoked, but it needs to be appliedselectively and must not be &apos;used to spread pay increases intoareas of employment where the original justification does nota-DPly.    The criterion  justifying  pay increases on manpower$rounds is the least used of all the criteria, and there is a
growing acceptance on both sides of industry that the most effective way of remedying a labour shortage is to use existingmanpower more efficiently.CoglJfJiiliM3lj,  Pay increases based on a rise in the cost of living arenot justified under the criteria, and should not be conceded.Not only would this be self-defeating since it would result in further increases in costs and prices, but it could set off a wage price spiral that would damage our competitive position.The T.U.C. have accepted that increases in prices resulting fremdevaluation should not constitute in themselves justification for increases in wages.    LSimilar considerations should applyto price increases resulting from Government action which are intended to facilitate the switch of resources from consumptionto exports, import-saving and investment. ]35.   Cost of living sliding scales are of diminishing import-ance in industry and rarely, if ever, compensate fully for costof living increases.     But during a period when&apos; price increases are inevitable it may be thought that they confer an advantage over those workers who do not have them or are in the process ofdiscontinuing them.     Pay increases resulting from such existing arrangements should be taken fully into account in applying the ceiling to the pay of the group covered.36.  Twelve months should continue to be regarded as the minimum period which should elapse between the operative dates of successive improvements.     Both the C.B.I. and T.U.C. have accepted that claims for improvements in wages and salaries due^ take effect within 12 months of the previous settlement shouldoS regarded as incompatible v/ith incomes policy.12
r^ptdor. to the Ceiling -- - -371  At a time when a rapid increase in productivity is essential in the interests of exports and import saving an exception tothe ceiling can justifiably be made for genuine productivity agreements which raise productivity sufficiently to justify apay increase above 3? per cent after conforming to the guidelineslaid down by the N.B.P.I.  in their Report No.36 on &quot;ProductivityAggreements&quot; ,      Major reorganisations of wage and salary structurewhich can be justified on grounds of economic efficiency and increased productivity may also qualify for exceptional treatment,but all such cases would be referred to the N.B.P.I. for examination.Staging38,   It was stated in paragraph 2h of Command 3235 that in somecases it is appropriate for substantial improvements in pay or conditions to be achieved by stages, even though justified underthe criteria.      The application of the ceiling should considerablyreduce the number of cases where large increases are justified,&quot;out they may still occur where a much longer interval than twelvemonths has elapsed since the previous increase or improvement, orthere is an exception to the ceiling.     The need to considerstaging in such cases will h.e particularly important in aperiod when the great majority of workers will be able to receiveonly limited increases,Mi^^atipn of Claims and,PrjappjsLed..SeJtJUjm^ts39.   Under the existing early warning arrangements the Governmentreceive information about claims and proposals to increase payfrom the C.B.I. and the T.U.C., from organisations which are not members of either of these bodies and directly from firms and^plovers&apos; organisations in the case of local and companynegotiations.     It is intended, that these arrangements and the13
similar arrangements in the public sector will continue on a voluntary basis.[i0   information about claims and proposed settlements willcontinue to be required at both national and local level andfrom companies employing [ ] employees or more.1^1,   The Government already have powers under Part II of thePrices and Incomes Act, 1 966, to require statutory notification,out they do not intend to use them unless the voluntary system is not working satisfactorily.A;pj^.Acati-0-^Ii2,   The ceiling and criteria for incomes policy and the considerations set out above are intended to be applied by allconcerned with the determination of employment incomes in theprivate and public sectors, whether at national, local, company or plant level and including arbitrators, independent reviewbodies and statutory wage fixing bodies.43.   It v/ill continue to be the aim of the Government inconsultation with the C.B.I. and the T.U.C., and with theassistance of the parties and of the N.B.P.I.  in appropriate cases, to secure the effective and consistent application of thepolicy both in the private and public sectors.
15V. Tj^TIORAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMESThere continues to be widespread, recognition of the valueof the work of the National Board for Prices and Incomes and ofits role as an independent statutory body in furthering the objectives of the productivity, prices and incomes policy.!l5,   The Board has been strengthened to enable it to deal withan increased, volume of work covering the expected increase in post-devaluation prices and incomes references and it will befarther strengthened, if this should prove necessary.i[6.   In consultation with the C.B.I. and T.U.C. and other interested bodies the Government will continue to refer to theBoard appropriate cases relating to the application of the productivity, prices and incomes policy and matters of longertern importance to the policy.VI.
