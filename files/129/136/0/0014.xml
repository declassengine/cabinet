11A AHISDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)Cj68iil4th March, 1968COPY NO.CABINETASSISTANCE FOR THE LOWER-PAID; FAMILY ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the MiMnter of Social SecurityAt the present stage in discussion of incomes policy I must bring to the attention of my colleagues an important point bearing both on the criteria to be adopted  or lower-paid workers and on family allowances.2.      It is clear from C(38) 45 and C(68) 50 that the Secretary of Statefor Economic Affairs believes that to allow wage increases for the lower-paid substantial enough to protect them against the rise in the cost ofliving would inevitably be reflected in a dangerous weakening of the wholeof our incomes policy.    If the ceiling for wage settlements is held atper cent then a good many low wage earners are unlikely to get morethan that.    Even if they get more, as a result cf a preferential wage increase in a settlement which remains globally within the ceiling, imagine that their increase may not be much more than 5 per cent.    I gather that devaluation is now thought likely to have a rather largerimpact on consumer prices than was previously estimated and that pricesmay rise by 7f per cent between November, 1967 and A^pril, 1969.3.      The fall in the standard of living for the lower-paid workersduring the next year will therefore be 4 per cent for some, and between.j and 4 per cent for others.    This will without question produce even greater hardship for those families already living below the minimumlevel set by supplementary benefit standards, and will bring many morefamilies below that level when, in recognition of the Impact of price risesupon the old and the sick., we increase supplementary benefit in theautumn.    The supplementary benefit level is itself, by definition, an arbitrary one.    There are in addition many families with incomes aboveit but well below average earnings for whom the gap between wage increases and price increases v/ill be most serious.4.     Nor are price increases the only case factor involved for thesefamilies.    Other measures will bear more hardly on them than on those with average or above-average incomes; higher health and insurance contributions, any increases there may be in indirect taxation, and,except for the group of poorest families, prescription charges and higher prices for school meals.    All these will enlarge the gapPerceptibly,
5.      The First SecretaryTs paper (C(68) 50) makes it clear that afterthorough examination it is found that the only practicable method of reducing the hardship gap is to make the proposed increase in familyallowances0    I recognise that this is a proposal which some of mycolleagues do not like at all, because there is widespread criticism of universal family allowances.    But whether this is a majority view in thecountry is questionable.    There are 8 million parents in familiesreceiving family allowances,    Would a substantial majority of these reallythink that a further increase in family allowances was a bad way of spending public money, especially in a period when prices are risingso much faster and further than usual?6.      My own experience at a number of public and party meetings duringthe last six weeks is that the knowledge of our intentions about &quot;give-and-take&quot; satisfies the critics.    I believe it will not be difficult to explain thata further autumn increase will be only temporarily non-selective.    the strongest public and party feeling now centres around misuse and abusein the supplementary benefit and unemployment benefit field, about whichI hope to take effective steps soon.7.      In any case, it is entirely relevant to point out that we have repeatedly insisted as a matter of principle that we are determined todo what is right without regard to popularity;  and we have firmly actedor. this principle in several fields already,    If I am wrong, and mycolleagues are right,, about the present feeling about&apos;family allowances,what logical grounds are there for reversing our approach on thisparticular question?8,     It is clear to me that there are three possible approaches to the hardship gaps-(a) to write into incomes policy more generous criteria for thelower-paid, and accept the risk of weakening the policyj(b) to increase family allowances as proposed in the JTirst Secretary^paper;(c) to do neither, and thus do nothing at all to reduce the gap betweenwage and cost-of-living increases for the lower-paid,I believe the only real choice lies between (a) and (b), either of whichwould be effective.    To choose to do nothing would mean that as aconscious act of policy we permitted an increase in poverty and realhardship in our society.Ministry of Social Security, W. C. 2,2nd March, 1968-2-
