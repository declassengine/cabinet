C(68) 41 COPY NO.     g g23rd February, 1968CABINETEUROPEAN TECHNOLOGICAL- INSTITUTEMemorandum by the Minister uf TechnologyIntroductionIn his speech at the Guildhall on 13th November, the PrimeMinister put forward in furtherance of the objective of creating a european Technological Community a number of proposals? includingthe readiness of United Kingdom Government to join with otherGovernments in establishing a European Institute of Technology.    Thisproposal had been developed in discussion between the Prime Ministerand the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).2,       The proposal was elaborated by officials,, and Sir SollyZuckerman held informal consultations with a number of industrialists.This provided a useful basis for the discussions which, in accordancewith the conclusion of the Cabinet on 25th January. 1968(CC(68) 10th Conclusions, Minute 2), I have held with the representativesof the CBI and the Trades Union Congress (TUC),3.       The CBI have been discussing the idea of an Institute with theircounterparts in Europe and have generally met with a favourable response, although the French have shown no enthusiasm for the idea.Subject to the expected confirmation of the agreement of the Europeanfederations, including the French, the CBFs intention would be toarrange for the setting up of a Working Party under the auspices of theBusiness and Industrial Advisory Committee (BIAC) of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).    The working party, which weald have a British chairman, would be instructed t oconsider the scope and functions of a European TechnologicalInstitute and to make a report.    The broad pattern emerging from the cbi discussions accords very closely with the idea which we have developed on the form and function of the Institute.4.      The TUC have not yet given any detailed consideration to theproposal and have not discussed it with their correspondingorganisations in Europe.    They recognise that it could be of great significance for them and they v/ould want to be kept closely informed and probably be associated with the organisation.    I am committed toputting in a paper about the Institute for the meeting of the national economic Development Council (NEDC) on 6th March and this may bring forward the more considered views of the TUC;  I am arranging to seethe General Secretary before that meeting so that I can give him an account of the broader context within which the proposal should beconsidered.-1-2dDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY JS GOVERNMENT)
5,       It is against this background that I put forward in the following paragraphs an outline of the proposal as I now see it and a programmeof action to secure support for it.The Function of the Institute6,      An Institute,, drawing on experts from Government and from industry would be able to study the likely development of future demand,keep under review the whole scope of European industry, makeforecasts of its future development and point to promising possibilitiesand emerging proLlemc    It might be able to analyse the problems and prospects of achieving co-ordinated European purchasing policies inparticular sectors.    The Institute could undertake detailed surveys of markets and industries, analysing particular sectors, evaluating theirpotentialities, comparing their performance with competing efforts andassessing their adequacy to meet Europe^ needs in the world context.The Institute could also undertake studies of the social and economic consequences of the industrial changes foreseen and make proposalsfor ameliorating the social consequences which would arise from the accelerated rate of technological change.    To carry through such a programme will require the concerted efforts of the Government andindustry.    In the early stages the Institute would not be an executiveagency but would put forward its reports, proposals and projects forconsideration and action b/ Governments and by indxistries,7.       There is considerable scope for the rationalisation of theindustrial structure of Europe with major regroupings of manufacturingenterprises, integration of research and development effort in majorsectors, and arrangements for encouraging the mobility of scientific and engineering manpower.    In addition the European capability totransfer technological skills needs to be strengthened.    The structuralproblem is now seen by us to be of great importance but other nowunforeseen problems and obstacles to the development of a european economic Union will come to light and the Institute should be able tocontribute to their consideration.The Constitution of the Institute8.      Such an Institute could only come into being as a result of an initiative by governments and with the financial support of governments,buL the objective should be to establish the Insticute as an independentsource of advice.    The Institute can be envisaged as directed by a high level management boardP supported by a council or assembly representingboth European governments and industrial interests,    executive responsibilities would be vested in a director-general.    There would bean appropriate administrative and technical staff drawn fromgovernments and from industry and from research establishments.This would be supplemented by an ability to draw upon experts inparticular fields employed on short term contracts to carry outparticular studies.    It is uncertain whether the Trades Unions would participate directly in the Institute, but they might join in some aspectsof the work and v/should be concerned with the implications for employees of proposals or projects designed to bring about structural and othermaior technological changes in industries.-2-
9.       In the initial stages, the Institute would wholly depend on financial support from governments and reliance could not be placed onsubstantial contributions from industry.    In time financial support from industrial organisations might be forthcoming.    It could bep toe, thatthe Institute would undertake surveys at the request of particular industries, making an appropriate charge for them, and the conferences and seminars organised by the Institute might in some cases becomes e lf-f inane ing,Location of the Institute10.     Adequate facilities in the way of buildings and equipment would be required for the Institute.    These might be provided in thefirst instance by the Government in whose country the Institute waslocated.    The CBI have confirmed their stiongly held view, which Ishare, that the Institute should, if at all possible, be located in London.We should try to secure this.    We are not, however, called upon tomake a decision at this stage and we shall have to review this issue when we have the views of other Governments and know what they would beprepa.red to contribute.The Name11.       While the name &quot;European Technological Institute&quot; has alreadygained some currency, I am advised that the term &quot;Institute&quot; has given rise to some confusion and that translated into French and German ithas strong academic overtones.    Moreover, there are other proposalsbeing canvassed for a &quot;European Institute&quot; concerned with education and training.    I therefore recommend that we should seek to gainacceptance of the title &quot;European Centre for Technology&quot; while making clear that ve are still concerned with the same project.Promoting the Proposal12.      The concept of a European Technological Institute or Centre hasalready aroused, considerable interest on the part of european governments and industrial organisations.    It could form a usefulpositive contribution to giving substance to the Benelux proposals andit would be of continuing value even if our membership of the Communitywere long deferred.    I therefore recommend that we should approachindividual Governments, notably those v/ho accept the Benelux proposals.E we can gather enough support, this could be an important initiativeby the Benelux group.    It would not be necessary to be restrictive asto membership and it is to be hoped that both the e.c. and EFTA countries would be ready to give their support to the Centre.    When we were assured that it enjoyed sufficient support from European Governmentswe could call a conference of representatives of governments and ofboth sides cf industry formally to launch the proposal.    There would necessarily be a considerable lapse of time between launching theproposal and its realisation.13,      In all this activity I should wish to keep in close touch withthe CBI and the TUG.    The CBI do not want to take full responsibilityfor the project, and therefore we shall have to maintain the initiative.I recommend that we should invite the CBI to continue their discussions with the European industrial associations but that theyshould do so under the umbrella of the Benelux proposals and not in&quot;3-
the OECD context provided by BIAC.    I would propose to follow thesame course in my discussions with other Governments.    It Isimportant, however, that this proposal should not be too closely linked with and made conditional on any specific political initiative.    Proposalfor technological collaboration including the project for the Centre^must be judged on the basis of where the national economic interestlies and they should not be considered mainly as instruments to furtherpolitical objectives.14,      I invite my colleagues to endorse the following conclusions.(a) We should take a lead in urging the establishment of anInstitute or Centre on the lines outlined, in the context of the benelux proposals (paragraphs 6-9 above),(b) The location of the Institute will be for decision later so as toLake account of the views of other Governments, but weshould even now do what we can to get thern to favour locationin London (paragraph 10).(c) There would be advantage in securing acceptance of the title&quot;European Centre for Technology&quot; racher than &quot;Institute&quot;(paragraph II).(d) The CBI should be encouraged to go forward with theirexploratory talks with their opposite numbers in Europeabut should do so within the framework of the benelux proposals and not in OECD (paragraph 13).(e) The TUG should be prompted to give serious consideration tothe proposal (paragraph 4)c(f) I shall continue my exchanges of views with European ministers on an Informal basis, rather than in OECD, keeping in.close touch with the progress of the CBI discussions (paragraph 13).A.W.B.Ministry of Technology.
