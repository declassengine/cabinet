document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 5028th February, 19^8COPY NO.79CABINETINCOMES POLICY: ASSISTANCE TO LOW PAID workers memorandum by Q^FJ!iE^^^ISi^y-S?L3lB^S.As requested, i have discussed with the Ministers particularly concerned and subsequently in the Social Services Committee thepossibilities open to us to assist by social means low paid workerswith family responsibilities in the context both of incomes policyand of our pledge to protect the most vulnerable from hardshipresulting from devaluation.    My colleagues and I have examinedwhat might be done this way by an increase in family allowances(FAM) or by a housing allowance.Housing allowance2.     The possibility of a housing allowance as an alternative to anincrease in FAM was considered by the Cabinet last summer(CC(&amp;7) 49th Conclusions) and it was then concluded this was a complexmatter requiring further study as part of a more general review of theproblem of rent and rates.    Such a study has been put in hand by theMinister of Housing and Local Government as part of a longer termreview of housing subsidies and housing finance generally,, in which heis exploring the possibility of combining a system of personal housingallowances to both Council and private tenants with a recasted systemof subsidies for local authority housing.    A wholesale revision of thesubsidy and rent fixing arrangements must however involve very carefulpreparation and negotiation and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment could not be ready with the necessary legislation before1969-70 at the very earliest.3.     We considered whether it would be possible as an interim measure to require the introduction of rent rebate schemes by all localauthorities on a uniform pattern following the model suggested to localauthorities by the Minister last summer and to secure that such schemesapplied also to private tenants (as Birmingham have already proposed).But any compulsory scheme would not be easy to impose itpjon localauthorities in the time available, more particularly in the light of the restraint on manpower and expenditure recently enjoined upon them, andthe variety of local circumstances and rents would make uniformitydifficult to secure.   Moreover it seems probable that such a scheme,even with the help of more Exchequer finance, would lead to more general rent increases for local authority tenants, with consequentcriticism from those not qualifying for a rebate, and to pressures totransfer private property from control to regulation with a view to-1-
increasing rents there too.     It would thus prove self-defeating forincomes policy purposes, while serving further to complicate the longertern review of housing subsidies now being taken.     Most of the largehousing authorities already have rent rebate schemes:   since thelinisterh? circular, rent rebate schemes are spreading, and more than62 per cent of the authorities notifying rent increases in England haveor are instituting rent rebate schemes.     It might not be easy, therefore,to claim that we were providing additional assistance through such means for the low wage earner generally.4.    For these reasons we concluded that local authority rent rebatesvrould not offer a practicable way of providing further assistance insupport of incomes policy this year for the low wage earner with family responsibilities.     It would not be impossible for a separate scheme of allowances centrally administered by the Ministry of Social Security tobe introduced in the autumn of 1968, provided that it was administered by means of postal claims sent to a central office (i.e. with onlyrairimal reference to local offices), although there would be difficulties.But such a scheme would require additional staff at the Ministry of social Security;   it might affect the further development of localauthority rent rebate schemes and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment1 s wider review of housing finance:   and in any case we thoughtthat a means-tested benefit for the low wage earners would not provide an acceptable reinforcement to an incomes policy in Trade Union eyes.     Thesame difficulty would not however arise with an increase in MM on a&quot;Give and Take&quot; basis.ganily AllowancesWe therefore considered the possibility of a 5/- increase inEAH on a &quot;Give and Take&quot; basis in July or October of this year.     Wewere however advised that this would involve most serious difficulties for the Inland Revenue.     Since FAM represents a source of income notderivable from the employer, any increase in FAM involves re-codingfor pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) purposes:   so too does the process of &quot;Take&quot;through adjustment of child allowances.     The necessary re-coding for-2-
the April increase in FAM has &quot;been completed hut that consequent uponthe introduction of &quot;Give and Take&quot; in relation to that increase, mustbe done after the Budget.     To superimpose upon this the re-codingnecessary for a further increase in FAM on the same &quot;Give and Take&quot;footing (if this were to be announced at Budget tine) would complicateand delay this process.     Alternatively to announce at a lator datean increase in FAM to be made in the autumn would involve a separatere-coding, both for the increase itself and for any tax adjustments,if account were to be taken of it in the current tax year;   thiswould also involve breaking the continuity of the cumulative PAYEsystem, with the very serious inconvenience which this would involvefor both the employers and the employees affected as well as the inland Revenue.     &apos;,7e were advised that the Inland Revenue might beable to cope with an increase in FAM alone in October, probably bydeferring collection of the tax until next year, but that for thereasons given a further &quot;Give and Take&quot; operation in the current taxyear would be more than the tax machinery could stand.     Staffingconsiderations would make a July date impossible.6.    It seemed essential for both purposes which we had in mind that an increase in FAM should be payable this year:   and an autumndate would have the real advantage that a FAM increase would coincide with the increase in supplementary benefits which we have already announced and which would be available to the elderly poor.     Wetherefore concluded that a 5/- increase in FAM this year would haveto be made across the board.     we recognised that this would be liableto be criticised as inconsistent with the introduction of the selective&quot;Give and Take&quot; system for the increases in FAM to be made this April;but we could make clear our intention to Include this further increasein FAM in the larger &quot;Give and Take&quot; operation which is in mind for1969-70 and this operation could perhaps take into account the factthat the increased FAM had been payable across the board in the latter half of 1968-69.-3-
74    The cost in this financial year of a 5/- increase in FAM effective from October next would be some  32 million net of social securityoffsets and of tax at present rates ( 1+5 million gross).   This sum hasto be set against the much larger figures which are at stake for the economy as a whole in the incomes policy context.   Towards it the Ministerof Social Security would be able to make available savings from twosources.   Firstly the introduction of three absolute waiting days beforethe payment of sickness or unemployment benefit would save about  15 million in the first full year and more later.   At present three waiting daysmust be served before short-term benefits become payable, but if absence from work lasts more than a fortnight payment is made in respect of these three days.   The proposal is that benefit should/now   be payable for these three days.    Such a measure would not be welcome to trade union opinionbut there is a good case for encouraging the employer to accept responsi-bility for the first few days of sickness (many already do so) and poorfamilies are unlikely to be affected in practice anyway,    since they arelikely already to have to depend on supplementary benefit from the startwhen out of work.   Secondly savings of the order of  h- million in a full year would result from the adoption of the majority report of the national insurance Advisory Committee recommending restrictions on the payment ofunemployment benefit to occupational pensioners.   Lord Collison hasdissented from this recommendation on the grounds that this would be tantamount to introducing a means-test in the national insurance system,but there are other rules in unemployment benefit which take account of income from a gainful occupation and the Social Services Committee haveagreed in principal that the Committee&apos;s recommendation ought to beaccepted.   The Minister of Social Security vrould hope to bring bothchanges (the first of wrhich would require legislation) into operation as soon as possible, with a view perhaps to achieving  10-12 million of saving in the current financial year.   A larger continuing saving would follow in subsequent years.8,    The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has reserved the Chancellor&apos;position regarding the amount and timing of any increase in FAM but wewere all agreed that the method advocated above presents less difficultythan the other courses of action which we have discussed to help the low paid worker with family responsibilities.   My colleagues and I, with theChief Secretary&apos;s reservation mentioned above, accordingly recommend thatan increase of 5/- should be made in FAM from next October, that thisshould be taken into account in the further extension of &quot;Give and Take&quot;planned for 1969 and that towards the cost of this increase the savings whwhich the Minister of Social Security has in mind should be put into effect as soon as possible./0, Whitehall, S.W.1.27th February 1968.
