* 7 &quot;1CM5913tlLMj  ^--i2M.COPY NO,11CABINET^gg; OFJLSCE SERVICES AM? charges the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) have now submitted their report on the proposal referred to them las* Octoberfor increases in Post Office charges,2, My colleagues will, I feel sure, share my sa.ti.sfaction that theBoard, while finding ground for certain criticisms of the Post Office,were able to conclude tbats-&quot;In spite of its defects we have been favourably impressed with its   efficiency and with its high regard for the publicinterest. &quot;I have no doubt that this tribute to the efficiency of Post Officemanagement will be of material help in presenting to the public theneed for price increases.I am not yet in a position to bring before my colleagues a fulland final view on the board&apos;s recommendations since I am pledgod toallow time for the Post Office Useis1 Council, the Post OfficeEconomic Development Committee and the Staff Sides of the PostOffice Departmental Whitiey Councils to present their comments on thereport.     If my colleagues agree, it would, however, be possible toreach conclusions at this stage as to the total sums of additional revenue that I should seek to raise, reserving for later consideration the detailed tariff proposals.    In the context of the Budget, it would bedesirable for me to be able to indicate the Governments intentions in broad terms as soon as the report is published next Monday (18th March).4.     There is, I think, only one particular feature of the Board&apos;srecommendations that I need mention.     They couple their tariffrecommendation for the new two-tier letter service with an implement a-tion date of 1st April, 1969,     This is unacceptable.     I have already announced that the new service will start in the autumn of this year and plans to this effect axe well advanced.     The Board recognised that an earlier implementation date might be desirable on operational grounds and recommended that, in that case, there should be a compensatorydeferment in the implementation of certain other tariff  changes.     Jpropose to follow this latter recommendation and to introduce the two-tier service at the tariff recommended by the Board in the autumn ofthis year.
5.     On this basis the BoardJs recommendations would produceadditional revenue in a full year of   21 million for Posts and 40 million for Telecommunications.    The effect of the cha/nges inpostal tariffs which it is now proposed to defer for the time being(paragraph 4 above) would be to add a further  5. 5 million to postalincome.    I will inform the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the likelyeffect of the changes on Post Office borrowing needs in 1968-69,-.6.     The yield from the Board&apos;s recommendations may be comparedwith the estimates of Post Office needs -  30 million for posts and 35-40 million for telecommunications - which I gave last July in bringing before my colleagues the proposal for an NBPI reference.Those estimates have since been modified by the effects of devaluationand other changes.     Nevertheless, I am satisfied that additional incomeon the scale of the Board!s recommendations will be needed to enable thePost Office to meet its financial targets over the next three years,,7, I invite my colleagues to agree that following the publication ofthe NBPI report on Monday, I should announce that in accordance withthe Boardss estimates of Post Office needs I intend to make changes in tariffs designed to raise additional revenue of some  67 million (posts- 27 million; telecommunications  40 million) ki a full year and that Ishall announce shortly the proposed changes and their da.tefi of intro-duction.E. W.S.General Post Office, E. Ct 1.13th March, 1968
