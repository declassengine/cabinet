119ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees 1968I.   introduction. The Government have made clear the continuing importance which they attach to the import saving role of agriculture under the selective expansion programme. The programme provided that the Annual Review machinery should be used not only for surveying progress made towards the expansionobjectives but also for assessing the physical and financial resources required.In announcing the programme, however, the Government made it clear that at each Annual Review the cost in resources and to the Exchequer would have tobe carefully weighed together with the other relevant factors. This factor is ofparticular importance in the present economic situation.2. At the 1967 Annual Review, although progress on a number of commodities-ties, particularly cereals, had been satisfactory in relation to the objectives of theprogramme, this was not so on the livestock side. Overall net output and net income were showing no improvement and the rate of increase in productivitywas not being maintained. The Government therefore feit justified in making an exceptional award to give the industry the additional capital resources itneeded to move forward again. Not only was there full recoupment of coststogether with an additional  10 million, but the industry was left the benefitof the whole of its increasing productivity. The Government made clear that,had it not been for the exceptional circumstances, they would have expected partof the cost increase to be met out of increasing productivity, in line with the assurance on productivity given at the 1966 Annual Review.3. The effects of the 1967 award are now becoming evident. Net income has risen once again after the interruption in 1965/66. Net output has also risenand there have been encouraging developments on individual commodities.The dairy herd, after remaining unchanged for two years, has been increasing;the pig herd, by contrast with 1966/67, is now expanding strongly; and there hasbeen a considerable recovery in the acreage of autumn-sown wheat.4. There has also been a recovery in the rate at which productivity is increasing,a factor to which the Government attach great importance as a basic element ofthe selective expansion programme. As foreshadowed in the 1967 annual review White Paper (Cmnd. 3229), exploratory discussions are taking place between the Government and the Farmers&apos; Unions to consider whether, withinthe ambit of present support for agriculture, there are means of further en-ecouraging productivity.
5. The progress of the industry in 1967/68 has been achieved in face of consid-erable difficulties. Since October, it has endured the worst epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease this century. This has not only meant direct and tragic loss tomany farmers, particularly in dairying, but has also disturbed normal marketing arrangements. Measures outside the scope of the Annual Review are now beingtaken by the Government to help farmers whose livestock has had to beslaughtered.6. In addition, although production has resumed its earlier upward trend,costs have been increasing sharply. Some of these higher costs are directly due todevaluation; yet, unlike other industries, agriculture is not able to increase itsprices to take account of cost increases, even if justified by the criteria under theprices policy. Nor is agriculture able to benefit directly from higher prices forits products following devaluation.7. The cost increases falling on the industry are estimated for a full year at 68J million on Review commodities, not that by any means all this sum hashad to be borne in the current year. With such cost increases, the minimumstatutory award permitted as a result of this year&apos;s Annual Review would amount to about  27 million.8. An increase in costs of this size means that less resources are available inthe industry for further investment in increased production and improved produc-tivity, and the Government accept that the industry must have the necessaryresources to this end. Nevertheless, the present economic situation requirestight control on public expenditure; and agriculture, like other industries, mustabsorb a reasonable part of its rising costs in accordance with the prices and incomes policy.9. In the light of these various considerations the Government have decidedto make an award of  52-1- million. This will mean that the agricultural industry will this year be expected to bear about one-quarter of the total cost increases. It will also mean that, after cost increases have been met, about halfof the value of the industry&apos;s rising productivity assessed at  30 million a yeartaking one year with another will be available as a contribution to new invest-ment. In addition, the Government recognise that the standard quantityarrangements are seen as having a restrictive effect, particularly on commoditieswhere the scope for early expansion is greatest, and have decided on this occasionthat a significant further relaxation of the arrangements is desirable. They have therefore raised the top of the middle band of the flexible guarantee for pigssufficiently to cover all forecasts of production thought likely during the coming year. The standard quantity for barley has been raised very considerably andthe standard quantity for wheat has been, abolished. Moreover, in order thatthe award may have the maximum immediate impact, it has been concentrated on the guaranteed prices themselves, with less emphasis on production grants.10. The Government believe that this award, following that at the 1967Annual Review, will enable the industry to sustain the encouraging forward
120momentum that is now under way.   They consider the award to be fullyconsistent with the needs of the economy as a whole.II.   Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production11. As a result of the recovery in agricultural production in the current farmyear, the volume of net output is expected to be about 6 per cent higher thanin the two preceding years. The index of net output for 1967/68 is forecast at144, compared with 136 in 1965/66 and 1966/67 (average of 1954/55 to 1956/57= 100. Appendix I, Table K). The revised index figure for 1966/67 is one pointhigher than the forecast index figure given in the 1967 Annual Review white paper.12. During 1967/68 the dairy herd has expanded and milk yields have been good; the beef herd has also increased, although less than in the preceding year.The increases would have been greater but for the foot-and-mouth epidemic.Pig production has fallen slightly, but the breeding herd is now expandingstrongly. The sheep breeding flock has fallen, but by less than in the previous year. Poultry meat production continues to rise, while egg production has risen by more than is required to meet the increase in demand. On the croppingside, total cereals production has continued to rise. There has been a fall inthe barley acreage more than offset by increases in the wheat and oats acreagesand by the effects of good yields. The potato acreage has risen.Income13. Actual farming net income in the farm year June 1967-May 1968 is forecast to be  510 million, an increase of  181 million over the figure of 4912 million now estimated for 1966/67. This in turn was an increase of  28million over the figure for 1965/66. Adjusted to normal weather conditions,the forecast for 1967/68 becomes  497-1 million, or  131- million more than theadjusted figure for 1966/67. As the number of full-time farm businesses continuesto decline, the average net income per farm will have improved by more than issuggested by the figures of net income for the whole of agriculture.14. The latest figures available on incomes for different types of farmingare based upon a sample of some 3,600 actual farm accounts for the year endedabout mid-February 1967. They therefore reflect most of the additional feedcosts arising from the late spring of 1966 and little of the benefit of betterconditions early in 1967. These figures show that in England and Wales netincomes on dairy, livestock and mixed farms fell in 1966/67, but on croppingfarms and horticultural holdings net incomes improved. Experience was similar in Scotland and also in Northern Ireland where average farm incomes declinedrelative to those in England and Wales because of heavier dependence on live-stock and the higher costs of certain inputs, particularly feedingstuffs in NorthernIreland. In all countries incomes fell on livestock farms, particularly on hillsheep farms, in part because of depressed store prices in the autumn of
1966. There was however an improvement in net incomes on arable farms andon those substantially dependent upon pigs and poultry.15. Specimen figures illustrating the changes in net income between 1965/66and 1966/67 are given in Appendix IV page 37. A detailed analysis of theinformation for England and Wales is presented in this year&apos;s annual report onthe Farm Management Survey* which is published simultaneously with this white Paper. Similar information for Scotland and Northern Ireland will bepublished in the spring.16. The farm accounts for 1967/68 are expected to reflect higher prices and livestock output following the 1967 Annual Review. An improvement isexpected in net incomes on the cattle and sheep farms and, perhaps to a lesser extent, on dairy farms also. Net incomes on arable farms are expected to benefit from a good cereal harvest although farms with a substantial acreage of potatoes will do less well than in 1967 when market prices were high. some improvement in net incomes from pigs is expected but producers of eggs and table poultry will probably have done less well.Costs and Efficiency17. There has been a large increase in the prices of goods and services usedin agricultural production, partly as a result of devaluation. It is calculated thatat current levels of use, price changes would add in a full year a net total of 68-1 million for the United Kingdom as a whole to the cost of producingReview commodities, excluding some  13 million additional feedingstuffs costs for pig and egg production which will result in axitomatic adjustments to the guaranteed prices in accordance with the feed formulae. The main increases are for labour, feedingstuffs, fertilisers and machinery (Appendix III, page 36).These increases in costs have been taken into account along with the annualgain in productivity, which is assessed, taking one year with another, at  30 million for Review commodities.18. The net outflow of regular workers is expected to be about 15,000 in1967/68, which is considerably less than in the two preceding years. Theincrease in labour productivity, which averaged about 6 per cent a year between1960 and 1964, subsequently declined; but the average gain in the last two years has, as a result of the improvement in net output, recovered to nearly 6 per cent a year.Cost of Agricultural Support19. Exchequer cost in 1967/68 is expected to be about  270 million, some 40 million higher than expenditure in 1966/67 and just about the same as theoriginal estimate. Within the total of the cost for 1967/68, as compared withthe estimates, there is a lower payment for barley which is partly offset by higherpayments on fat cattle and wool. The estimate figure for 1968/69 (which doesnot take into account the determinations made at this Review) shows an increase* &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1966&quot;, H.M.S.O., 14s. Od.8
121to  286 million to allow for expected larger payments on pigs, wheat, eggs,potatoes and the calf subsidy, which are only partly offset by reduced estimates for cattle and sheep.20. Table A, Appendix V, page 38 showing the estimated cost of exchequer support to agriculture has been revised so as to show more clearly the expenditurecovered by the Annual Review and the other items that go to make up the totalcost of Exchequer support to agriculture. As well as some regrouping of itemsalready included, the Table now includes certain small items previously covered in footnotes, such as grants for agricultural marketing development, agriculturalco-operation and agricultural credit, as well as certain grants to Scottish crofters.III.   Commodities and Production GrantsBeef and Milk21. The selective expansion programme emphasised the need for greaterproduction of beef and veal. It recognised that an expansion of beef production would require an increase in the dairy herd, and that the additional milk pro-duction resulting from this would meet the growth in consumption of liquid milk and cream and a substantial part of the additional demand for milk products.22. The Government have given certain assurances to producers of beef and milk. An assurance was given at the 1966 Review, and reaffirmed at the1967 Review, that provided there was no significant change in circumstances the Government would not within the period of the selective expansion pro-gramme reduce the guaranteed price for beef cattle or the rate of the beef cowsubsidy as determined at that Review. A further assurance given at the 1966Review was that in determining the guaranteed price for milk during the period covered by the selective expansion programme the Government would take account of any dilution of the pool price to producers arising from increasedmilk production due to the expansion of the dairy herd to meet the need forincreased beef production. The increase in the average size of the dairy herdbetween 1964 and 1967 has resulted in a dilution of the pool price of 0-35d.per gallon equivalent in terms of the guaranteed price to 0-4d. per gallon.Of the dilution in the pool price, however, 0- 13d. occurred between 1964 and1965 before the assurance was given and was an element in the milk deter-mination at the 1966 Review. The Government have given full weight, along with other factors, to the dilution factor in determining the milk guarantee atthis Review.23. The beef and milk herds have been hit severely by the foot-and-mouthepidemic which began in October 1967, and over 200,000 animals have beenslaughtered. (Compensation for the slaughter of diseased animals under the diseases of Animals Act 1950 is not classified as Exchequer support to agri-culture and is therefore not included in Table A, Appendix V. Payments to farmers arising out of the foot-and-mouth epidemic are currently estimated at 27 million.) Nevertheless, between June 1964 and June 1967 the beef breeding
herd expanded by about 160,000 or 16 per cent, and the dairy herd by 70,000or 2\ per cent. The rate of expansion of the beef herd has been slowing downbut the rate of expansion of the dairy herd has increased, and much of the total increase in the dairy herd has taken place in the past year. The total breedingherd is expected to increase further between June 1967 and June 1968, even allowing for the loss of over 100,000 breeding cows in the foot-and-mouth epide-mic. Favourable weather has boosted milk yields and total sales off farms in1967/68 are expected to be about 83 million gallons higher than in 1966/67.24. Home-fed supplies of beef and veal, in 1967/68 are estimated to be about per cent higher than in 1966/67. The increase would have been greater but forthe foot-and-mouth epidemic. Imports are forecast to be about one-third lower than last year&apos;s (Appendix I, Table D and Figure II, pages 22 and 23) owing tosmaller supplies of frozen beef from Australia and New Zealand and the tem-porary suspension of imports from certain countries.25. The Government wish to ensure that the industry has the resourcesnecessary to continue the expansion of home beef production from both thepure beef and dairy herds. Costs of production have risen substantially, and inthe case of pure beef production there is less scope for a rapid increase in efficiencythan with most other sectors of agriculture. In order to give direct help torearers the hill cow subsidy will be raised by  2 to  16 5s. a head, and the beefcow subsidy will be raised by  1 10s. to  9 a head. The Government have also decided to increase the guaranteed price for fat cattle by 11s. Od. per cwt., to atotal of 200s. 0d., to help all farmers who take animals for fattening from either the beef or the dairy herd. The scale of abatements and supplements under the graduated deficiency payments scheme for cattle will be adjusted in the light ofexpected market conditions.26. As regards the dairy herd, where the pace of technical change accompaniedby the trend towards larger herds involves a high level of new capital expendi-ture, the Government consider that an increase in the guaranteed price isnecessary if the expansion now evident is to be sustained. After taking intoaccount also the dilution effect of the beef programme (see paragraph 22)they have decided to make an increase in the guaranteed price of l-2d. per gallon. An increase is made automatically in the standard quantity in respectof any increase in liquid consumption. The amount this year is 4-9 million gallons equivalent to an increase of 0-05d. per gallon in the guaranteed price.The total increase being made in the value of the milk guarantee is therefore -25d. per gallon.27. The arrangements for assisting the Milk Boards&apos; schemes for improvingcompositional quality will continue unchanged in 1968/69.28. Details of changes in the guarantee arrangements are given in AppendixVI, Part II, pages 45 and 46.
Sheep and Wool29. The aim announced under the selective expansion programme was thatsheep production should meet part of the gradual rise in demand which wasthen foreseen. It is now thought that future demand for mutton and lambmay be weaker in relation to other meats than was first envisaged.30. The breeding flock has been falling since 1964/65 and at December 1966was 3 per cent smaller than a year before. The fall continued in 1967, but at as lower rate. Flocks in the hills and uplands are expanding, and this is nowoffsetting to a greater extent the decline in lowland flocks.31. At the 1967 Review, the Government recognised that the expansionenvisaged by the selective expansion programme in cereals and in the dairy herd would leave less scope for sheep production in the lowlands, and that alarger proportion of our fat sheep would need to come from farms in and around the hills, with a more intensive use of grassland in those areas. bearing that mind the need for this development, the Government gave special encourage-ment to hill sheep farming at the 1967 Review by increasing the rate and extend-ing the scope of the hill sheep subsidy. Payments on the extended basis of the hill sheep subsidy are now being made for the first time, and time must elapse before they show their full effect on the size of the hill flock.32. In the meantime, home production must be expected to follow flocknumbers downward. Home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb in 1967/68 areexpected to be about 6 per cent lower than in 1966/67, although approximatelyat the level of the two years before that. Imports are expected to be about 3 per cent lower than in 1966/67. Total supplies in 1967/68 may therefore beabout 41 per cent below the previous year.33. The Government wish to ensure that adequate flocks are maintained, andin view of the rise in costs consider that some increase in returns to sheepfarmers is justifiable. They do not think that any further change is needed atthis stage in the hill sheep subsidy which has been so recently increased and extended, but they have decided to increase the guaranteed price for fat sheep by2id. per lb. This will be of direct benefit to fatteners in all areas. It will alsobenefit farmers rearing store sheep on the hills by maintaining an adequate outlet for those animals which they could not reasonably hope to fatten themselves.34. Market prices for wool fell in 1967 and consequently there will be anincrease in the payment due from the Exchequer to the Wool Board. However,in view of the fact that the discussions on the criteria for determining the woolguarantee, announced in paragraph 30 of the 1967 Annual Review White Paper,have not yet been concluded, the Government have decided to leave the guaran-teed price for wool unchanged.Pigs35. The selective expansion programme recognised that pigmeat can make asubstantial contribution to our increasing requirements consistently with our commitments to our overseas suppliers.   It envisaged that home production
would meet the whole of the growth in demand for pork as well as the UnitedKingdom allocation of bacon under the bacon market sharing understanding.36. Pig production fell steeply from about 13-8 million pigs certified forguarantee in the fatstock year April 1965-March 1966, to about 12-2 million in 1966/67; and certifications may be marginally lower in 1967/68 at about12-1 million. Measures were taken at the 1967 Review to reverse the declinein the breeding herd, and they have been effective in getting recovery under way.At December 1967 the breeding herd was nearly 7 per cent higher than a yearearlier, including an increase of nearly 12 per cent in gilts in pig.37. The Government wish to see the recovery continue so that the objectives of the selective expansion programme are achieved. The Government are anxious to give the committed pig producer the confidence to continue to expandwhile, at the same time, doing nothing to encourage those producers who mightbe tempted to come into pigs temporarily for a quick profit. From thisstandpoint the Government believe that the most important thing over thecoming year is to provide an assurance of stability, so that pig producers neednot fear that in planning for expansion they may be inducing a drop in the effective price through the operation of the flexible guarantee. At present,forecast certifications are in the 12-5 to 12-8 million band, immediately belowthe middle band, and it is expected that forecast certifications will bring thefigure into the present middle band during the summer, which would cause an automatic reduction of 9d. in the effective price. To avoid this, the government propose to drop the bottom of the middle band immediately by 300,000 pigswhile at the same time preventing a consequential drop in the effective price by raising the basic guaranteed price. In addition, the Government propose toraise the top of the middle band by 300,000 pigs, so as to make clear that they wish expansion to continue, and also to ensure so far as possible that forecastcertifications do not rise above the top of the middle band during the coming year.38. The Government recognise that costs for the pig producer, as for others,have increased, but the bulk of those costs are feedingstuffs for which he isautomatically recouped under the feed formula. In the light of this and of themiddle band arrangements described above, the Government propose toincrease the guaranteed price by Is. Od. per score which should increaseprofitability over the coming year. In view of the width of the new middle bandthe Government would also propose at the next Annual Review to raise thelower limit of the middle band so that the future interests of pig producers andherd expansion are protected.39. In the light of the discussions referred to in paragraph 36 of the 1967Annual Review White Paper, stabilisation arrangements designed to bringgreater long-term stability to bacon curing were introduced at the beginningof April 1967.Eggs40. The selective expansion programme pointed out that the United kingdom is virtually self-sufficient in eggs and that the objective should be to continueto meet demand, which is increasing only slowly.
41. Production in 1967/68 is expected to exceed the record level of 1964/65and the British Egg Marketing Board&apos;s average selling price is likely to be only2s. 9d. per dozen compared with 2s. lid. in 1966/67 and 3s. Ifd. in 1965/66.The laying flock is expected to be slightly smaller in 1968/69 but nevertheless asa result of a further rise in yields production should be about the same as in1967/68. Because of the reduction in the Board&apos;s average selling price, the costto the Exchequer will be higher in 1967/68 than in 1966/67, and there will be afurther increase in 1968/69 due to the automatic recoupment of increased costs of feedingstuffs through the operation of the feed formula.42. Since increases in feed costs are automatically recouped through theoperation of the feed formula and since the underlying trend towards greater pro-duction continues, the Government must take into account the need for greaterstability in the market and the increasing cost to the Exchequer. The guaranteed price is being reduced by jd. per dozen. The reductions due to be made underthe guarantee arrangements introduced in 1963 in the Exchequer share of anydeficiency between the market and indicator prices were suspended in 1966/67and 1967/68. They will be resumed in 1968/69 when the Exchequer share ofany deficiency between the market and indicator prices will be reduced from40 per cent to 30 per cent.. The effect on producers&apos; returns in 1968/69 will be equivalent to a further reduction in the guaranteed price of between Jd. and Jd.per dozen.43. In agreement with representatives of the industry, the Government an-nounced in July 1967 the setting up of a Reorganisation Commission underthe Agricultural Marketing Act 1958, &quot;to consider the present arrangementsfor the marketing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products, includingthe working of the British Egg Marketing Scheme 1956, and any other mattersrelevant thereto, and to make recommendations for the future.&quot; The Commis-sion&apos;s report is expected to be completed during the spring.44. The guaranteed price for duck eggs is being reduced by 1 - 14d. per dozen inaccordance with the policy announced in paragraph 39 of the 1967 annual review White Paper that the guaranteed price for duck eggs should now bebrought towards a level at which guarantee payments are not normally necessary.Cereals45. The selective expansion programme recognised that the expansion of livestock production would increase considerably the demand for cereal feedand that, consistently with our international obligations, a substantial part ofthis additional requirement should be produced in this country.46. In 1967 the expansion of the cereals acreage continued but at a slower rate. The total increase was 85,000 acres. There was a fall of about 100,000acres in the barley acreage, but the wheat acreage increased by about 70,000while oats and mixed corn increased by about 120,000 acres. Yields were good and total production in 1967/68 is estimated at 14i million tons, some \\million
tons higher than in 1966/67, and a record. Imports are estimated at about million tons. It is expected that the total cereals acreage will increase in 1968.47. The Government believe that further expansion of production, particularly of wheat, is necessary to meet the growth in demand. The Minister of Agricul-ture, Fisheries and Food announced in December that the guaranteed price ofwheat would be increased at this Annual Review, that the differential betweenwheat and barley would be increased in favour of wheat, and that the standard quantity arrangements would be reviewed. As a result of the review of thestandard quantity arrangements and to increase the differential in favour ofwheat, the Government have decided to abolish the standard quantity for wheat and to increase the guaranteed price of wheat by Is. 6d. per cwt.48. In line with the policy of encouraging the expansion of the acreage underwheat, rather than barley, the standard quantity arrangements for barley arebeing retained but the standard quantity for 1968/69 will be increased by 750,000tons. The guaranteed prices of both barley and oats are being increased by5d. per cwt. The differential between the guaranteed prices of wheat and barleywill thereby be raised from Is. 2d. to 2s. 3d. per cwt.49. In the interest of orderly marketing, and as a safeguard for the exchequer in the event of a relatively weak price, the target indicator prices for both wheat and barley are being retained; and in consideration of the abolition of the stand-ard quantity for wheat and the increase in the standard quantity of barley, thearrangements under which, in certain circumstances, the deficiency payment on wheat or barley would be increased if the average market price exceeds the target indicator price will be ended. The crop adjustment formula described inparagraph 19 of the 1964 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 2315) under which,in certain circumstances, adjustments may be made in the standard quantitiesas between wheat and barley will also be abolished.50. The level of the minimum import prices, to which the target indicatorprices for wheat and barley are related, is at present under consideration, andthe target indicator prices for the 1968 crops will be determined, after consulta-tion with the Fanners&apos; Unions, at a later stage in the light of the decisions to betaken on the future level of the minimum import prices. Other details of the revised guarantee arrangements are in Appendix VI, Part II, page 47.Potatoes51. The objective for main crop potatoes under the selective expansion programme is that, except in years of unusually low yields, home production should be able fully to meet home demand.52. Following high market prices throughout the 1966/67 season the totalarea planted to potatoes rose from 669,000 acres in 1966 to 708,000 acres in
1967. The yield from the 1967 crop appears likely to be much the same as the1965 record of 10-1 tons per acre, resulting in a crop surplus.53. As proposed in paragraph 49 of the 1967 Annual Review white paper the Government have studied with the Farmers&apos; Unions and the potato Marketing Board recent trends in yields and the implications for the acreage needed to fulfil the objective defined in paragraph 51 above. The broadconclusion, which is borne out by experience with the 1967 crop, is that the yield of over 10 tons per acre in 1965, which seemed unusually high at the time, islikely to be at least a &quot;normal&quot; yield for the next few years and that, given satis-factory weather conditions, yields of 101- tons and even 11 tons per acre may be experienced. In this event, a steady decline in the national acreage would be consistent with the production objective of self-sufficiency. These trends willbe kept under review.54. The acreage fell sharply between 1964 and 1966, following two years inwhich returns to growers were at or about the level of the guaranteed price.The marginal shortage which resulted in 1966/67 led to high prices and was followed by a recovery in acreage to the present level which, if yields of 10tons per acre or more continue, is rather more than adequate. But costs have risen; and if the 1968 crop were to give rise to a surplus and low prices, there might be an unduly heavy fall in acreage resulting in a shortage in 1969. So theGovernment have decided that some increase in the guaranteed price for the1968 crop is needed.55. If, however, there were a surplus from the 1968 crop, coming on top of thesurplus from the 1967 crop, it would be difficult for the Potato Marketing board to meet its share of the cost of the buying operations needed to keep market prices in the 1968/69 crop year up to the level of the guarantee. It is preferable to try to do this rather than allow prices to fall and make a deficiency payment.Discussions on possible new long-term arrangements for potato marketing withrepresentatives of the Potato Marketing Board and the National Farmers&apos;Unions have recently begun. Meanwhile, it is important to ensure that theBoard will be able to play its part if support buying should be necessary in thecoming season.56. Accordingly the award for potatoes in this review is in two parts. In thefirst place, the guaranteed price for the 1968 crop will be increased by 7s. 6d.per ton. But if that crop gives rise to a surplus, and support buying is necessaryin Great Britain, the Government will also, in addition to meeting its own shareof the cost, meet the Board&apos;s share up to a limit of  1 million. There will be an equivalent adjustment in the market support arrangements for Northern Ireland.Taken together these special arrangements are broadly equivalent to anadditional 4s. 6d. per ton on the guaranteed price.Sugar Beet57. The objective under the selective expansion programme is that home production of sugar should meet a part of increasing demand without raising
international problems or the need to increase factory capacity. Althoughthe total contract acreage is still being fully taken up, some factories have difficulty in obtaining locally their requirements of sugar beet. There havebeen considerable increases in costs. The Government have therefore decidedto increase the guaranteed price by 3s. 6d. per ton. The contract acreage willremain unchanged.Production Grants58. Field Beans. In the 1967 Annual Review White Paper the government announced their intention to introduce a grant of  5 per acre for field beansfor a period of three years beginning in 1968/69. Legislative authority is being sought in the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill now before parliament and it is intended to submit a statutory scheme to Parliament for approval indue course. There has been a significant recovery in the acreage of field beansin recent years, and with the additional incentive of an acreage grant it is hopedthat there will be a substantial further development in the growing of field beansas a break crop for cereals. Field beans are a valuable source of protein for animal feeding and the manufacturers of compound feedingstuffs have welcomed the encouragement being given to the growing of the crop.59. Fertiliser and Lime Subsidies. The estimated cost of the fertilisersubsidy in 1967/68 is about  32 million, an increase of about  2 million over1966/67. It has been the policy of the Government to reduce the rates of subsidy in order to contain the subsidy cost. The effect of increases in fertiliser prices in 1967/68 is to increase farmers&apos; costs by nearly  15 million in a full year.Although account has been taken of this in determining the increases inguaranteed prices mentioned in previous paragraphs, and although fertiliserusage has continued to increase, the Government have decided to make no reduction in the rates of subsidy at this Review. There will be no change inthe level of the lime subsidy.60. Market Development Scheme. Subject to Parliamentary approval thisscheme will be extended for another three years from 1st April 1968 to assistmarketing developments other than those of a co-operative nature, which havebeen taken over by the Central Council for Agricultural and HorticulturalCo-operation. The grant ceiling will be raised by  i million to  2 million.61. Small Farm (Business Management) Scheme. This scheme was introduced in 1965 as an extension of the Small Farmer Schemes of 1959 and 1962, and isdue to expire on 31st August 1968. Applications have been falling but applica-tions have still been coming forward in the second half of 1967 at the rateof about 1,250 a year. The scheme continues to provide a useful means of assisting those with small farm businesses to raise management standards. It isproposed to extend the scheme for a further year to 31st August 1969. It will be looked at again at the 1969 Review.
12562. Field Drainage and Farm Water Supply Grants. Standard costs for farmwater supplies in Great Britain and for ditching in England and Wales will beintroduced in March 1968. At the same time England and Wales will adoptminimum cost limits of  50 for tile drainage,  25 for other forms of drainageand ditching,  25 for water supply and  50 for any combination of these. InScotland the Agricultural Drainage Scheme was extended in February 1968 tocover &quot; once for all &quot; cleansing of field drains and ditches. Standard costs for new tile, plastic pipe and hill drainage and minimum cost limits of  50 for alldrainage were introduced at the same time.

133Note (Hi). The &quot; Departmental &quot; and &quot; raised sample &quot; estimates of aggregatefarming net income in Table A are arrived at after making provision for depreciation.Net income is defined as the reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, and for the use of the occupier&apos;s investment.Note (iv). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &apos;.&apos; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses. Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.The revised series for the &quot; raised sample &quot; calculation is based on a new raisingmethod and is provisional.Note (v). The &quot;Departmental&quot; estimates for aggregate net income include asprofit in recent years about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treatedas profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (vi). From the &quot; Departmental&quot; figures for aggregate net income certainsums should have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops,etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Note (i). &quot; Relevant production grants &quot;. Expenditure on these grants is taken into account in calculating thetotal value of the guarantees at the Annual Review. The item &quot; Other &quot; under this heading includes grants inrespect of grassland renovation, rabbit clearance societies, producers in the Scottish Islands and, for the first time,agricultural marketing development, agricultural co-operation (excluding fixed equipment), and agricultural credit.Certain cropping grants and headage payments for Scottish crofters are now also included for the first time.Note (ii). &quot; Other grants and subsidies &quot;. Expenditure on these grants is not taken into account in calculating the total value of the guarantees. The item &quot; Other &quot; under this heading includes grants in respect of livestockimprovement, and bracken eradication, and now also fixed equipment for agricultural co-operatives. Scottishcrofting improvements are also included for the first time.Note (iii). General explanation of figures. The figures in I, II, III and IV for years up to and including 1966/67represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1967/68 are the latest estimates(Hansard 31st January 1968, written answers, columns 340-342) of cash expenditure in the United Kingdom (civil estimates Class V, Votes 3, 4, 5, 6) to which have been added parts of Votes 2 and 7. The figures for 1968/69 arethose in the corresponding Civil Estimates for that year. They do not take account of the effect of the determinationsin this White Paper.Note (iv). Explanation of particular figures.(a) Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated andpartly to the crops or clips of the preceding year or years.(b) Figures for milk exclude expenditure on school and welfare milk. Following the 1962 Annual Review the retail price of milk was arranged so that neither a deficiency nor a surplus will arise for the Exchequer, takingone year with another, from the implementation of the price guarantee.(c) Expenditure on tuberculosis eradication relates to bonus payments under the Attested Herds Scheme only andexcludes compensation payments for slaughtered reactors.(d) Part of the payment of hill sheep subsidy due in 1967/68 was brought forward to 1966/67 prior to the introduc-tion of a change in the payment arrangements in 1967/6S.(e) The investment incentive grants to agriculture were payable for the first time in 1967/68. They replacedinvestment allowances and, unlike them, take the form of direct Exchequer payments instead of taxconcessions.(f) The basis of the calculation of administrative expenses was changed in 1961/62 so that the figures of earlier years are not comparable with later figures.Note (v). Estimated effect of determinations on Estimates 1968J69. On the basis of the original assumptions asto output and market prices, the estimated effect of the determinations set out in this White Paper is a net increaseof  31 million in the total estimated cost ( 286 million) of agricultural support by the Exchequer in 1968/69. Thisnet increase is the result broadly of increases of  3 million on wheat,  6 million on barley,  A million on oats,  121million on cattle,  4 million on sheep,  3 million on pigs,  \ million on potatoes and  2 million on production grants and a decrease of  ^ million on eggs.The net effect of the determinations on the Estimates differs from the effect on the value of the guarantees for several reasons; the more important are that the price guarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involveExchequer payments and that the payment periods for some items do not correspond with the financial year.Note (vi). The Table excludes grants specifically for horticulture. The estimated cost of these, together withhorticultural co-operation and credit, is  4-7 million in 1967/68 and  5-3 million in 1968/69.

Forcattle and sheep these are on a pre-determined seasonal scale and payments are subject toabatements and supplements under the graduated deficiency payments scheme described inPart II. These arrangements should normally mean that the guaranteed price for the year is paid exactly; but circumstances can arise where marketings and prices vary from those forecast in such a way that the producers&apos; average return exceeds the guaranteed price for the year.Because of the weekly basis of payment this can happen for cattle, sheep or pigs if market prices go higher than the standard prices in some weeks and in others guarantee payments are made. For pigs, the method of calculating the guarantee involves an element of estimationand can result in the producers&apos; average return differing slightly from the guaranteed price.(6) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee and feed formulaarrangements as set out in Part II.(c) The guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggs are subject to the indicator price and feedformula arrangements as set out in Part II.(rf)The guaranteed price for milk includes 0-25d. per gallon special assistance forcompositional quality. The guaranteed price is subject to the standard quantity arrangements.(e) The guaranteed price for barley is subject to the standard quantity/target indicator price arrangements. The guaranteed price for wheat is subject to the operation of the target indicatorprice.(/) In order to promote orderly marketing throughout the season, the guaranteed price for wheat is subject to the operation of a seasonal scale and the guaranteed price for barley to arrangements whereby premiums are paid for barley delivered, after sale, in the later monthsof the cereal year and deductions made for barley delivered in the early months of the year.Part II.   Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shown in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and livestock products in 1968/69 and for crops of the 1968 harvest will be on a similar basis tothose for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Milk2. The provisional standard quantity for each area in 1968/69 has been calculated as follows: 		Million gallons		Provisional	Adjustments	Provisional	Standard	for Changes	Standard	Quantity	in Liquid	Ouantity	1967/68	Sales	1968/69England and Wales	1,855-2	+ 5-1	1,860-3Main Scottish Area	190-7	-0-7	190 0Aberdeen and District ...	20-6	+ 0-1	20-north of Scotland	10-5	-i-0-1	10-6Northern Ireland	104-5	+0-3	104-8	2,181-5	4-4-9	2,186-4

Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 1st April 1968, thescale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expectedmarket situation for the year. If the average market price for a week is below thestandard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range 28s. Od. to34s. Od. per live cwt., a guarantee payment of the amount of this deficiency will bepaid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the week exceeds 34s. Od. per cwt.,or is less than 28s. Od. per cwt., the guarantee payment will be subject to abatement orsupplement in accordance with scales determined at the Review, which are being published separately.Fat Sheep5. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 1st April 1968,the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. If the average market price for a week is belowthe standard, price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range 3-fd. to5;[d. per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight, a guarantee payment of the amount ofthis deficiency will be paid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the weekexceeds 5:];d. per lb., or is less than 3;rd. per lb., the guarantee payment will be subjectto abatement or supplement in accordance with scales determined at the Review, whichare being published separately.Fat Pigs6. Flexible Guarantee Scale.

Feedingstuffs Formula. In 1968/69 the guaranteed price will continue to be subjectto adjustment in respect of changes in the cost of a compound feed ration and the changes will continue to be expressed in terms of an index. The weightings used inthe calculation have been brought up to date; and the revised price (34s. lid. per cwt.)to which the new guaranteed price is related is deemed to be equivalent to 1,000 points on the index. For every movement of 10 points from 1,000 points, the guaranteed price will be adjusted by 3d. per score.8. In 1968/69 the indicator prices provided for by Article 4 of the Eggs (guaranteed prices) Order 1963 (1963 No. 569) as amended by the Eggs (Guaranteed Prices)(Amendment) Order 1964 (1964 No. 462) will be 3s.

1402s. 2d. per dozen for duck eggs. If, during 1968/69, the British Egg Marketing Board&apos;saverage selling price for hen or duck eggs is below the appropriate indicator price,the proportion of the difference to be met by the Exchequer will be reduced from 40per cent to 30 per cent in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Ordersreferred to above as subsequently amended by the Eggs (Guaranteed Prices) (Amend-ment) Order 1966 (1966 No. 479).9. Feedingstuffs Formula. In 1968/69 the guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggswill continue to be subject to adjustment in respect of changes in the cost of acompound feed ration and the changes will continue to be expressed in terms of an index. The weightings used in the calculation have been brought up to date; and the revised price (35s. 3d. per cwt.) to which the new guaranteed prices are related is deemed to be equivalent to 1,000 points on the index. For every movement of 21points from 1,000 points on the index each guaranteed price will be adjusted by jd.pei&apos; dozen.Cereals10. Standard Quantities. As stated in paragraph 47 of this White Paper, thestandard quantity for wheat is being abolished as from the beginning of the 1968/69cereal year. The standard quantity for barley for the 1968/69 harvest will be8,600 thousand tons. This represents an increase of 750 thousand tons over thestandard quantity for the 1967 harvest determined, after the 1967 Annual Review.(Because the wheat acreage was abnormally low in 1967 the operation of the cropadjustment formula will result in some increase in the barley standard quantity as determined after the 1967 Annual Review and a corresponding reduction in the wheatstandard quantity for 1967. The precise adjustments to be made will be determinedafter the end of the 1967/68 cereal year.)11. Method of Calculation of Deficiency Payment. In order to relate production to the standard quantity the production of barley in any year will be calculated bymultiplying the acreage in that year by a 3-year average of yields (weighted by acreagein those years) including the definitive yield estimate for the year in question. this method of calculation, which differs from the method previously used by thesubstitution of the definitive yield estimate for the November estimate, will apply asfrom the beginning of the 1967/68 cereal year. It will therefore apply to the calculation of wheat production in that year for the purpose of any additions orreductions in the unit rate of deficiency payment that may be required under thestandard quantity arrangements. With the abolition of the standard quantity for wheat the unit rate of deficiency payment on wheat in 1968/69 and subsequent years will be the difference, which will not be subject to adjustment, between the guaranteed price and either the average market price or the target indicator price, whichever isthe higher.12. Method of Payment. The conversion of the deficiency payments on barley and oats to an acreage basis in 1967/68 and subsequent years will be made by the useof a weighted 3-year average yield, including the definitive yield estimate for the year in question, in the same way as in relating production to the standard quantity of barley.13. Target Indicator Prices. As stated in paragraph 50 of this White Paper, the target indicator prices for wheat and barley of the 1968 crop will be determined afterconsultation with the Farmers&apos; Unions at a later stage in the light of decisions to betaken on the future level of the minimum import prices.14. Escalator Arrangement. The escalator arrangement will operate within a range of production of 8-15 to 8-60 million tons for barley.Sugar Beet15. For the 1968 crop the maximum acreage to which the guarantee will applywill be 427,400 acres in England and Wales and 15,600 acres in Scotland. Themaximum acreage for the 1969 crop will be the same as in 1968.47Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery office at H.M.S.O. Press, Harrow(100765)   Dd. 124927   K126  3/68
