BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJ.ESTYJS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 39 COPY NO,21st February, 1968CABINETASIAN IMMIGRATION FROM EAST africa memorandum by the Secretary of Stare for the Home department at their meeting on 15th February (CC(68) 3.3th Conclusions,Minute 4), the Cabinet invited me to arrange for officials to report on(i) what reduction in Commonwealth immigration was likely to result from the restrictive measures which the Cabinet had approved?(ii) the appropriate allocation of vouchers to citizens of theUnited Kingdom a,nd Colonies,, not belonging to the UnitedKingdom, on the assumption that they were not accorded theright of unrestricted entry to this country?(iii) the extent to which the present allocation of vouchers to commonwealth countries might be reduced to allow for this;and(iv)  the criteria to be adopted for the allocation of vouchers to non-belong ers.I have received a report from officials on these matters, which I dealwith successively in the following paragraphs.Effect on Commonwealth Immigration of Restrictive Measures2.      Clandestine Entry,    There have been no more than three or fourproven instances in 1967 and one so far in 1968.    The Press has probablyexaggerated the extent of the problem, but it is not possible to be certain.    Nevertheless the reduction in the numbers entering as a resultof legislation is likely to be small and the main effect will bepresentational.3.       Dependent Children.    The number of dependent children enteringfrom the New Commonwealth was 24, 000 in 1965, 26, 000 in 1966 and35^000 in 1967.    The amendment of the law agreed by the Cabinet would remove the statutory right of children under 16 to enter to join a singleparent resident here, unless the parent was the sole survivor.    about one-third - perhaps 5, 000 a year - of the Pakistani children currently-1-
entering are known to be entering at about school-leaving age and are believed to be coming to join a single parent,,    The result of legislationmay be partly that the numbers of older children coming will be reduced and partly that mothers will come as well.    The net effect on totalCommonwealth immigration is therefore difficult to estimate - but therewill be a reduction.4.       Dependent Fathers.    It is proposed by administrative measuresto raise from 60 to 65 the minimum age for the entry of dependentfathers,,    The numbers entering were ls 400 in 1965, 1,300 in 1966 and2,100 in 1967.    The effect of raising the age to 65 cannot be accuratelyassesseda but it should result in some reduction in numbers3 or at thevery least in containing the increase.5.      Summary,    These measures are of real presentationalimportance, in that they will manifest the Governments intention tomake the existing control effective?  in particular they should end thepresent widespread impression that clandestine immigration is takingplace on a substantial scale0    In this way they should help to damp down the present public and Parliamentary concern.    It is not possible tosay with certainty what effect they will have on the number of commonwealth immigrants arriving here.    It may be that their totaleffect will be to br5.ng about a fairly substantial reduction?  but at themost it is unlikely to exceed 5, 000 and it may well be less.Appropriate allocation of vouchers for citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies who do not belong to the United Kingdom6.       The proposed allocation should be for non-belonging citizens ofthe United Kingdom and Colonies wherever they may be, although nodoubt nearly all the vouchers will initially be iaken up by immigrants from East Africa,    The number of vouchers has to be settled in thelight of the current level of immigration from the Commonwealth underthe control, as well as of the arrivals from East Africa,    The intakeunder the control increased sharply in 1967, as did arrivals from EastAfrica.    In the light of this, I would think it reasonable to fix an allocation of vouchers for the non-belongers which, while being generousin proportion to population, might hold the numbers of arrivals from east Africa down to something like two-thirds of the annual rate of6? 000/7, 000 in 1965 and 1966.    Given that something like threedependants will accompany, or later join,, each voucher holder, an issue of lfr000 vouchers would enable about 4t 000 people a year tocome here from East Africa,    I suggest that we fix the specialallocation at 1, 000.7o      My colleagues will appreciate that, even if we remove thepresent unrestricted right of entry and announce a special allocation ofemployment vouchers of 1, 000, there can be no certainty that theannual number of Asian entrants from East Africa will not exceed4,000.    These measures would, however, result in some earlyreduction in the present high rate of entry (probably some 5, 000 in thefirst two months of this year) and should stabilise the level of entry inthe longer term.2
The extent to which; the Special.Allocation for Non-foelongers might befound from the Present Allocation of Vouchers to Commonwealthcountries8.     The Cabinet considered it important that the additionalallocation of vouchers for the non-belongers should be found in partby the other member countries of the Commonwealth; that is, that the1, 000 allocation I have proposed should not be wholly in addition to thecurrent total of 8,500 vouchers.    It might perhaps be reasonable forus to increase the total to 9? 000e which would call for a reduction of5 00 vouchers for the remainder of the Commonwealth.     Officialshave pointed out that to find the whole of the reduction from the as .anCommonwealth countries would be discriminatory, and I think that itwould be preferable, if a reduction were made, to make it across the beard, in relation to the average number of vouches received by each country over the past two years, not necessarily excluding the dependent territories and Malta.     This may beat more hardly on some countries and territories than on others.9.     My own view is that a reduction of, say, 5 00 in the total of8,500 vouchers available for issue, especially since less than 5,000of them are currently being taken up, would make no effectivedifference to the overall level of immigration and would not justifycomplicating the administration of the voucher scheme or antagonisingother Commonwealth countries,,    I myself would be content to see thespecial allocation of I, 000 made wholly additional to the present totalof 8,500.What Criteria should be adopted for the Allocation of Vouchers to non -be longe r s10.     The Official Committee on Commonwealth Immigrationrecommend, and I agree, that allocation would best be on the originalbasis of the voucher scheme; that iu, priority &quot;ouchers for those whoqualify in Category A (i. e0 by having jobs open here) or in Category B(i. e. as having special qualifications) and the balance distributed asunder the old Category C (i. e. regardless of qualifications or jobsavailable here, and  tiled on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis).General Considerations11.     A number of other questions were raised in the previous cabinet discussion which I wish also to deal with in this memorandum.12.     First, the latest advice from Kenya is that the Kenya government will not re-admit the holders of United Kingdom passportswhom we refuse to admit.    This, it seems to me, is primarily amatter f or diplomatic action.    If this fails a we should inform, the airlines that, from a given date, it is only holders of United Kingdompassports who have employment -vouchers, or entry certificates (the equivalent of a visa for Commonwealth citizens) granted by our HighCommissions, whom they can rely on being admitted to this country.
13.     There is a more difficult problem with people who come herenot direct from East Africa but from the Continent and whom we wishto refuse entry.     If the continental countries should refuse to re-admitthem it would be difficult to insist, since we cannot expect thosecountries to distinguish between some holders of United Kingdompasppotfts and others.    Nor could we return the people in questiondirect to East Africa if those governments would not re-admit them.This problem is unlikely to confront us in the early days of theextension of the control, and may never become significant.    If itshould, we would have to look to diplomatic action to secure the return of these people to their East African homes.14,     A question has been raised about the attitude of India and pakistan towards the re-settlement of people from East Airica,    Myunderstanding is that India and Pakistan would raise no objections toentry, but axe not prepared to say anything which would make it easier for the East African Governments to adopt discriminatoryattitudes.15.     President Kenyatta has suggested that the way to cut down theinflow would be for us to make a statement saying that we shall nevertake away the right of entry from United Kingdom passport holdersnI do not myself think that such a statement would necessarily reducethe inflow since this is in large measure due to the vigorous policy ofAiricanisation on which the Kenya Government have cmbarked0     Theyhave made it clear that they will not moderate their policy.    Further,we must bear in mind that the problem is potentially much wider thanEast Africa.    There are another 1^ million people not subject to ourimmigration control.    At some future time we may be faced with aninflux from Aden or Malaysia.    Again the same arguments would bebrought forward, and again the same tensions and prejudices stimulated.We shall remain subject to this risk unless we amend the law so thatthe public in this country are confident that immigration is effectively-controlled.    Only in such an atmosphere can good race relations befostered.Conclusions16,    We face problems either way.    If we decide to legislate, thedifficulties I have outlined will arise.    But a decision not to legislatewould equally raise serious problems - we should have to consider asa matter of urgency the strain put on our social services and whatextra expenditure would be necessary to provide housing and to enablethe schools and the health facilities, in particular, to cope.    We shouldalso have to consider whether it was practicable to try and persuadenewcomers to avoid settling in the areas of great concentration wherethe social services are already over strained,17.    My considered conclusion - and I do not suggest that the decision is an easy one - is that, on a balance of advantage a.nd disadvantage, weshould now extend our immigration control to include these people,presenting it in the form that their right of entry must be exercised ona moderate scale and in turn,&apos;    -4-
18.     I recommend(a) the immediate introduction of legislation extending ourimmigration control so as to include citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies who have no substantial connectionwith this country I(b) that there should be a special annual allocation of 1, 000vouchers for these non-belongers, administered on thelines indicated in this paper;(c) that the overall total of vouchers should be increased from,500 to 9,500.J.
