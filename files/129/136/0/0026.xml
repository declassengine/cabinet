0(68^632 6tlLMa-15il4-i-9-^-8CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROSPECTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerBackgroundIt is now some two months since we finished the January reviewof public expenditure.     The new financial year is just about to beginand my colleagues should know how the public expenditure prospectnow appears.2.     Our management of public expenditure must certainly be oneof our major pre-occupations over the next three years.    This is partlya question of sticking to figures which we have announced; but moreimportant is the effect on the rest of the economy, and in particular on exports, personal consumption and industrial investment, if weexceed those limits.3.     We published in January our expenditure plans for the next twoyears (Cmnd. 3515);  and we have now, for the first time, alsopublished the economic forecasts upon which the 1968-69 Budget has been based.    The latter make public the way in which the public sector&apos;demands compete with other demands for available resources.Figures4.     There is an important difference between the figures in the january White Paper (Cmnd. 3515) and those in the Financial statement which accompanied the Budget.    The latter shows the provisional out-turn for 1967-68 at current prices and the estimate for 1968-69 on theprice basis of the following Public Expenditure Survey.    The increaseimplied by these figures is 7 per cent.    Although this figure does not provide a measure of the increase between the two years in terms of resources, it cannot be ignored completely because of its relevanceto the financing problem and because it sets us a presentationl problem,which may grow worse as any addition to costs, such as pay increases,emerges during the year.     The White Paper, on the other hand comparesthe estimate for 1967-68 with that for 1968-69 on a constant price basis.This shows an increase in real terms of 4-f per cent and it is to this figure that we are publicly committed.-1-COPY NO.
5,     By Budget Day Government decisions had added some  5 0 million to the expenditure foreseen in January for 1968-69.    Fortunately the economies securedfromexamining the Estimates and for other changes have meant that we have been able to absorb this  50 million, and atBudget Day the estimated increase for the year was still only4, 6 per cent.6.     But we already face some  80 million additional expenditure forcancellation charges and other items which we know to be comingalong.    Every   15 million adds 0. 1 per cent to the 4. 6 per cent.In other words, what is already in prospect would take us over  per cent next year.    It follows that there is a continuing need for savings where we can find them and for avoiding further new commit-ments,7.     Over two-thirds of total public expenditure is embodied incontrolled programmes (defence, social security, education,, health and welfare, housing, rates and the Home Departments).     I certainlydo not want at this stage to reopen the decisions reached on them lastJanuary, though it is clear that any proposals involving increases inthese programmes could only be met by reductions elsewhere withinthem.    Problems are, however, more likely to arise in the remainingsector where legitimate claims on public funds may well arise either because of emergencies (such as the Torrey Canyon or foot and mouth disease compensation) or because of open-ended commitments, suchas investment giants, agriculture and seme technological projects.8.     In view of this I am asking my officials to examine the wholefield for possible savings, and I ask my colleagues to help byinstructing their officials to co-operate in this.    The aim should be two-fold; first, to see if, without major changes of policy, further economies can still be found.    Second, by way of contingency planning,to have ready more substantial proposals for meeting the situation with which we should be faced if, by end-June, the prospects are thatthe announced 4f- per cent will be exceeded.1969-709.     The prospect for 1969-70 is no easier.    We have at this moment barely   100 million (L e. f per cent) in hand for allcontingencies and all new developments which may arise over thenext two years.    At next Juners Public Expenditure review we shall certainly have to look at the year 1969-70 with this problem very muchin mind.    In the meanwhile, we must seek to avoid accepting commit-ments which would reduce the very small room for manoeuvre leftavailable,L970-n and afte rwards10.    At this stage it would be unwise for us to assume that from1-970-71 onwards the present heavy constraints on public expenditure will be radically eased.     The strain caused by the large switch intoexports should be over, but there are some uncomfortable elements inthe situation which must not be forgotten.    First, in the next decadeour working labour force is not expected to increase, so the growth1968-69
-3-of our national product will depend on the rise of average productivity.We hop this will increase rather faster than the 3 per cent per annumof the past but in all prudence we must not plan our public expenditure programmes now on the basis that this will be so.    Secondly, we haveto allow for the inevitable rise in costs of our present programmes and commitments.    All the evidence is that a higher proportion of thepopulation will expect to use educational services, health servicesand services for the elderly.     Also, the fact that the public sectorsupplies mainly services means that it is very hard for productivity in the public sector to keep pace with productivity as a whole.    Thismeans that the share of the national product required to maintain an existing Government activity is always rising.11.     So our present programmes and commitments are likely to absorb the great bulk of resources that we can count on reasonablyfor the public sector in 1970-71 and after.    We must, of course,plan ahead, and I welcome the kind of planning which the social services Committee is putting in hand as a sensible way of framingprogrammes with the right priorities within practicable totals.    Butwe should not mortgage too much of the future by piecemeal decisionsnow.    The key lies in timing.    We must refrain from committing ourselves to large totals of public expenditure in 1970-71 and later years until we can judge more clearly our success in bringing aboutthe shift of resources to exports and to import saving and also seemore clearly what our average growth of GNP in the early 197 0s islikely to be.    At the 1968 June Review we shall have to take some firm decisions on 1970-71, which is the &quot;focus&quot; year of the 1968 survey, butwe shall need to keep the total commitments for this year to a prudentlevel.    We y.lso need to be extremely cautious over accepting new commitments which may start small in or before 197 0-71 but have largeimplications for later years.    There are some branches of expenditurewhere, in order to maintain a given level of activity, &quot;new commit&quot;ments&quot; necessarily follow one another: but in most branches (e. g.education, social services) new commitments are an addition to an existing level of activity.    I conclude that for the period 1970-71 andafter we should not take firm decisions on the timing of the introductionof such new schemes until we have had the Public Expenditure survey of 1969.Conclusion^12.      In short, I propose that we should proceed as follows:(i) for 1968-69, officials should be asked to act as in paragraph 8;(ii) if by the June review we find that the 4-f per cent figure for1968-69 is likely to be exceeded, we should consider what action to take on the proposals emerging from (i)j(iii) for 1969-70, as we have now only  100 million for contingenciesof all kinds, we should do our utmost to avoid any further commitments until next June1 s review shows us whethermore room for manoeuvre can be found!
(iv) when planning for expenditures in 197 0-71 and later years, weshould avoid, in those fields in which it is possible to do so,commitments on the timing of new expenditures until wehave had next year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey, i. e. endJune, 1969.Ro J.Treasury Chambers, S.
