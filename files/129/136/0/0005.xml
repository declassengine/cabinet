PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 4223rd February, 1968COPY NO.CABINETFOREIGN policy note by the Secretary of State  or Foreign Affair;My colleagues will remember that the original intention was thatthe review of foreign policy should really be a paper about Europe,     Themore I have thought about it, however, the more I have found it desirableto set our policy towards Europe into the framework of world events andof our interests world-wide,,    Accordingly, the attached paper begins,after a brief statement of the decisions which have led to our Europe-based policy, by looking to the world at large (Part One).     Then it comesback to Europe (Part Two), and deals with the options open to us there,,G0 B,Foreign Office, S. W.1,23rd February, 1968
PAJRT^one  have been conducting a review of foreign policy,    I lay theresults before my colleagues as a. basis for policy and for the further detailed studies which will be needed.Z.     We start from a world in which the main currents of worldevents have assumed new dimensions from those that dominated theimmediate post-war period,    The United States is and will remain the strongest power but a certain balance based on the nuclear equilibriumhas been established between the United States and the USSR and will be helped if they can reach an agreement on anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs),The Soviet Union believes that in the long run the balance will be over-thrown to her advantage and this will remain the goal towards which she will work.    Destabilising situations can still occur.    We and ourWestern allies must be on the alert to prevent them.    Both East and west must act responsibly.    In the immediate future East-Westdifferences will remain at the centre of events.    In the longer run,the major problems are more likely to be in the area of North-Southdifferences.    The developing countries including those of the new commonwealth will undergo a prolonged period of social and economicstrain.3.     The problems of advanced societies are no less critical.    TheWestern world is in a state of some instability, partly because the pressures of East-West differences have been relaxed, thus givingscope to Gaullism, and partly because of the social and industrialtensions produced by insistent demands for a rising standard of living and by the onset of major technological innovations.    A number of western Governments face peculiarly difficult problems of national unity, e. g. Canada and Belgium.     There lurk below the surface even greater dangers of internal divisions in Italy and possibly even inGermany and France.     These problems in the We stern world makeit difficult to achieve and maintain a common and stable foreign policy at the very time when this is so urgently needed to deal with the North-South problems and the continued East-West tensions.    We ourselveshave contributed to changes both in the developed and the developingworlds t not least by our major decision of July? 1967,, to withdrawmilitarily from East of Suez.    There are risks in this, but given our economic situation and the changing pattern of world events, to whichI have referred, it is right that we should re-think our foreign policy^4.      The decisions we announced on 1.6th January have gone far toshape the options open to this country^    We have decided that our defence effort must be overwhelmingly in and for Europe^    The run-down of our military position East of Suez a.nd our concentration on thedefence of Europe in partnership with the United States parallel, in thedefence field, the decisions we had already taken in the economic andpolitical fields when we decided to try to negotiate our entry into theEuropean Communities.     These are fundamental decisions which didand do accord with British interests.    We cannot abandon them withoutdamaging our interests and incurring the charge of indecisiveness.It remains the case that any alternative to our Europeam-based policy isa second best.    The main point to consider,, therefores is how tocircumvent or overcome the storms and perils which beset this course.-1-
5.      Before doing sol think it right to draw attention to the im plica -tions of our decision to disengage militarily from East of Suez (exceptfor our remaining dependencies)6    In recent years the safety of manyof our material interests East of Suez, e. g, in the Persian Gulf, hasnot depended primarily upon our military presence,    Nvertheless,the withdrawal of our forces is bound in the short term to increase the risks to our own interests^ if only because it may unleash localanimosities, e. g. between Singapore and Malaysia, or tempt largerpowers to absorb their neighbours, e. g, the conflicting ambitions ofIraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia,    Iraq has not given up her ambitions totake Kuwaitj Iran has a long-standing claim to Bahrain; Saudi Arabiaclaims most of Abu Dhabi and part of Muscat and Oman,    In addition,there are another half dozen or so lesser territorial disputes in theGulf, some of which have an important bearing on oil rights.    If the shah fails to satisfy his highly nationalistic critics at home that he hasprotected what they regard as Iran&apos;s just rights, his personal position will be at risk and so too will Iranrs western orientation.    Although theRussians have not yet extended their influence into the Gulf, they are increasing their efforts in the Middle East generally, and it remainstheir objective to replace Western influence by their own and to gainindirect control of the Middle Eastern oil supply to the West.    In thisobject they can hope to find willing Arab partners, Egypt for example,6,     In the worst case, as much as  1,000 million of British invest -ment in the Gulf could be up for grabs.    No less than 40 per cent ofGulf oil is in British ownership and makes a significant contributionto oar foreign exchange earnings,     There is the possibility that the verylarge sterling balances held by some of the Gulf states will fall intounfriendly hands.    But the more likely risks lie not in the seizure ofour assets (though we cannot dismiss this possibility): they ariserather from the political instability which may follow our departure.If the conflicting territorial claims in the Gulf were to lead to localwars, or even only to terrorism and sabotage, it would become difficultto maintain the free flow of oil.    At present 40 per cent of Britainrsoil supplies (and over 50 per cent of Western Europess) come from theGulf.   Once we have withdrawn militarily, we shall not be able to bringmuch, if any, power to bear to prevent or limit the consequences oflocal instability.7.     What is true in the Gulf is true generally outside the atlantic area.    In the 1970s we shall still have a general capability for use if required and of course must be able to carry out our responsibilitiestowards otir dependent territories.    Nevertheless we shall not be ableto make any significant military contribution to maintain the balance of power beyond the Atlantic area.    If, as is only too likely, conflictsbreak out in these vast territories inhabited by most of the world&apos;spopulation our trade and investments will be at risk.    We have recentlyseen how local instabilities and animosities have affected our oilinterests in Nigeria and our copper supplies from Zambia,    We shallnot physically be able to prevent major conflicts from arising, nor shallwe be able to do anything of much account to prevent such turb^lancefrom sucking in our countries and conceivably leading to a Great Powerconfrontation.-2-CONFIDENTJAL
8.     In short, as far as the developing world is concerned, we shall find ourselves in much the same position as other European countries,for example France or Italy.    The United States alone of the western powers will have an effective intervention capability.    If in acting tofurther her own self-interest she prejudices &quot;Western European intereststhere is nothing we can do about it.    It will not be surprising, as theyshoulder more of the burden elsewhere, if the United States decide to let the brunt of it in Europe fall upon the Europeans,    Our movereinforces the tendency for the two Super Powers to increase the distance between themselves and the middling countries and in so doingto fall into the habit of arranging matters between themselves, perhaps to the exclusion of others.9,     I accept that given our present situation our policy should beEuropean-based despite the risks to which I have drawn attention above.But while I must stress that in the worldwide context there are certainsorts of influence which we can no longer carry out, I believe that amilitary presence is not the only way to exercise influence,    There isstill a good deal we can do in the parts of the world from which we arewithdrawing militarily.    If wa cannot totally replace the degree ofprotection for our interests which we lose when we withdraw our military presence we can at least mitigate the consequences by main-taining a British presence through non-military means.     These do not imply large expenditures.    In particular, the Commonwealth associationstill gives us considerable influence.    A non-military presence shoxildin my view contain such elements as trade, technical assistance and theprojection of Britain, for example by the teaching of English and the promotion of various links, especially in the Commonwealths, betweenprofessional and student groups in this country and abroad.-3-
3 2.PAJIT^WOWe were right, both on 16th January and before, to make europe the centre of our policy,,    There are, however, a variety of ways of conducting a policy centred on Europe,    In the remainder of the paper i consider the main alternatives.    Before doing so we need to be clear what our broad objectives are.    We have now determined to put theeconomic strength of Britain on a secure basis.     This is vital to an effective foreign policy and therefore for our national security.    It isalso indispensible to the welfare of our people and to the social pro-grammes of our Party,      These are our main objectives.    In addition,so far as we can we should aim to make the United Nations more effective, to ameliorate conditions in the developing world and to forestall international disputes, especially those which may provedamaging to us.    It is fallacious to think that we can turn ourselvesinto a country like Sweden,    They have a tiny population, a very largecountry and a very small number of highly specialised industries.Britain, with a population of 55 million, anxious for a higher standardof living and highly dependent upon our ability to sell advanced technology,to trade worldwide and to maintain the free flew of raw materials, mustnot become relegated to an isolated position in which our voice countsfor little.    If we are to have some significant degree of control over thecircumstances in which we live we need to be able to operate on a widerregional power basis than this country alone affords,    Only western europe can provide such a basis,2,     Broadly speaking there are three options open to us within thisEurope-based policy;-(a) We can operate essentially as a &quot;loner&quot; avoiding allentanglements so far as we can and making the bestbargains we can with the Super Powers and with european countries as may seem most expedient onan ad hoc basis,.(b) We can aim to produce a Third Force Europe, balancingbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, sidingsometimes with one and sometimes with the other,,(c) We can aim to produce a Western Europe which is strongerand more cohesive than at present and which, generallyspeaking, expects to act in harmony with the United States.There are a variety of other courses but I have not considered chem indetail, because they are either variants of the three main possibilitiesor impracticable in present circumstances.
Cou sej[a)3.      I recognise that circumstances may eventually leave us littleoption but to follow course (a).    But I dismiss it as an aim of our policy since it would be inconsistent with at least two of the objectivesset out above.    It would put our national security at risk because it would tend to break up the international framework which has preserved theworld from a major war since 1945.    If we opted out it would on the onehand increase the growing American tendency only to help those whohelp themselves and the United States while on the other it would encourage the Soviet Union to persist in her policy of getting the americans out of Europe, of fragmenting Western Europe, and of encouraging neutralism with a view to changing the balance of powerfundamentally,    Europe has shown that sne can survive one Gaullistcountry but two would break apart both Europe and the Western Alliance..Moreover, our bargaining power would be small and declining.    In such circumstances we could by no means depend upon retaining ourpermanent seat on the Security Council.     The loss of this would entail the loss of our privileged position in certain other international organisations.    Nor is there any reason to suppose that the &quot;loner&quot;situation would favour us financially or economically.    Sterling wouldbe more vulnerable and we should not have the benefits of large scalemodern technological integration and colfe-boration.Course (b)4.     There are attractions in a Third Force Europe but on examina-tion they prove superficial.     The prospects are particularly unattractivefor a British Labour Government.     In such a Europe our social demo-cratic philosophy would be seriously challenged by Communism,particularly in France and Italy.    It would be a costly and leagfchybusiness to provide Europe with a genuinely independent positionincluding its own nuclear defence.    If despite the effort Europe failedto emerge as a Third Force we should be notably worse off than we arenow.    The attempt to form a Third Force Europe involves breakingexisting links and closing options which could not easily be recovered,E, on the other hand, Third Force Europe reaily succeeded there wouldbe a considerable risk that Germany would be the dominant power in it.All our existing arrangements and Western European Union in particularare designed to tie Germany closely into the West in an innocuous way and to keep the Germans from too close a connection with nuclear weapons.    Such arrangements would be scrapped in the context of a third Force Europe.     What the consequences would be for relationswith Eastern Europe and the Scviet Union may be guessed at.   Equallythe consequences for the United States attitude towards Europe would be serious.     Nothing would be more likely to encourage Goldwaterism andeven isolationism.5.     Furthermore, while it might be the object of a Third ForceEurope to balance between the United States and the USSR there wouldin fact be a serious possibility that the two of them would prefer eachother&apos;s company, possibly at the expense of Western Europe,    In any event, it would give the Soviet Union the opportunity of playing offEurope against America and vice versa.    This is a situation whichwould greatly favour them and would not favour us.    In addition to this-2-
political-security drav/back there is a further drawback on theeconomic side0    Despite the current difficulties of the dollar theUnited States economy is forging strongly ahead and widening the gap between American and European standards.     Vt&apos;e shall have to make agreat effort in Europe to close this gap and it seems most unlikely thatit will be possible to do so at a time when course (b) would inevitably involve us in greatly increased defence expenditure and in a considerablecooling of relations with the United States,Course (c)6,     Course (c) involves building up Western Europe as a fullpartner with the United States in promoting common Westernobjectives.    The chief of these are rising standards of living,financial stability, expanding commercial opportunities, increasinglyclose relations with Eastern Europe and the promotion of detente withthe Soviet Union.    Both our security and. our economic objectiveswill be much more easily obtained if we proceed in harmony withrather than antagonism to the United States.    But at the same time wehave to recognise that while Western Europe remains fragmentedthere will be little incentive for the United States to pay great heed to european attitudes and interests.    What is perhaps even moreimportant is that in commercial competition with the United Statesindustry and technology v/ill achieve a position of dominance in europe as well as in the Western hemisphere.,    While we certainly drawbenefits from American investment of various kinds in Europe, it isnot in our interests that critical portions of our economy should become staeliites of American business.     To organise an industry and technology which can compete with the United States the countries of western Europe need to embark on large-scale programmes to rationalise and improve their technology, prodtiction markets andfinancial arrangement.    Clearly the European Communities from thebasis for such an effort.    If we can join them while *e still have asubstantial lead in various aspects of modern life and industry weshould be able to play a major part in shaping the future of Europe andof European relations with the United States.    But we have to acknowledge that time is not on our side.    Our position in the worldleague is steadily slipping.    The e.c. is enormously much more powerful than we are and even the individual countries of the Stee, g: Germany and France, are in some respects stronger than we are.In some aspects of the race Japan has already passed us.    We must therefore bend every effort to join the European Communities at theearliest possible moment.    This will be hard to do but I conclude that course (c) so much more nearly lends itself tc our objectives thanthe alternatives that it is clearly the course we should follow,7.     If this is agreed we need to consider in the light of thesituation taken as a whole what practical steps we can take to givereality to course (c)^    Against the background of the Prime Ministersvisits to Moscow and Washington of our recent exchanges with theEFTA and e.c. countries and in particular of the results of dr. Kiesinger3s talks with General de Gaulle, the following are themain considerations on which we need to form a view,.-3-
NATO8.      Our national security depends upon maintaining a close link withthe United States and the credibility of the American guarantee of western Europe.     The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is theway in which the United States commitment to Western Europe is mademanifest.    Despite gloomy prognostications a.nd the withdrawal of theFrench, NATO is in fact in a reasonably healthy state at the present.We should do what we can to preserve and strengthen it but what is evenmore important in present circumstances is that we should do nothing to weaken it.    A further withdrawal of British forces from the Continentmight very well trigger off a chain reaction which led the Americans,Canadians, Belgians and Danes, to say nothing of the rest, into similarreductions.    This would have the undesirable consequences of leavingGermany as the majoi military power in Western Europe.    Jfc might very well also mean the effective unravelling of NATO and hence of our security.Negotiations with the Six,, Five and Ten9.     We have to r^cognina that General de Gaulle is determined to keepus out of the European Communities.    So long as he      effectively in control of France ho will be able to do so.    But we have many friends in Europe including many in France who will try to help us.     Thereforeour business must be to maintain our aim and keep our nerve.    Moreover,it is only by exerting pressure that we shall get some tolerable arrange-ments short of entry in the European Economic Community (e.c.).    If wewere to settle for some half-way house this would mean that all pressurewas removed from $he French and there would be a serious risk that weshould never get any further.    There is no reason why we should not discuss any ideas which the French, the Germans or others may have,provided they do not distract attention from our major object of entry into the Communities, together with those of our European Free trade area (EFTA) partners who wish to join us.    But it is up to them to putforward concrete ideas.    Anything put forward will clearly be subjectto hard bargainings to French attempts to reduce its substantive content and very possibly at the end of the day to a French veto.    Accordingly, itwould be unwise to restrict ourselves to talks in which the French caneffectively exercise a veto.    There is no reason why there should not bevarious sets of talks proceeding simultaneously.     The Benelux proposals,or something like them, have three great advantages.    In the first placethey will help to prevent the e.c. from developing hi ways which wouldmake it harder for uu to join eventually and in the meantime from under-taking actions which might be damaging to our interests, e. g, in the monetary field.    Secondly, if they give rise to some important degree ofco-operation between us and as many other Western European countries as are willing on some major substantive question they will considerablyreduce our isolation and improve our bargaining position.     Thirdly, themore progress we make on Benelux-type proposals the more the Frenchwill be under pressure.    Eventually they may come to think that the damage to them of keeping us out is greater than the risks involved inletting us in.    Therefore, there is advantage to us in collaborating as closely as we can on any issue wh.efchex* in the political, defence,economic or technological fields with as many Western european countries as are prepared to associate themselves with us for thispurpose,-4-
East-West Questions10,       To a large extent the French and ourselves are in competition for germany,    The Germans are tugged in many directions.     They know theirown security depends upon the United States and they must be careful notto unravel NATO as General de Gaulle would like or to take part tooobviously in his schemes to reduce United States influence, e, g, hiscampaign against the dollar.    On the otner hand, their great achievementsince the war has been Franco-German reconciliation and the establish-ment of the Common Market-,,     They v/ill do all they can to avoid puttingthese gains at risk0    The other main strand in German policy is theirdeeply-felt need to change th.3 situation in East Germany,    Fortunatelyin the last two years or so the German.&quot; have swung round to the sort ofpolicy on East Germany and Eastern Europe generally which we have longadvocated and which wo can wholly support.    We must try to make themost of this with the Germans,    Moreover a policy of small steps towardsEastern Europe, leading eventually in the direction of some sort of con-federal arrangements with the two pares of Germany, together with appropriate restrictions on the troops and weapons to be deployed by either side in Central Europe is very much in our interests.    Apartfrom the financial aspects it certainly offers the best prospect of an eventual stable arrangement in Central Europe which both the russians and the Europeans can accept.Attitudes to the Developing World11.       If Europe either fragments or becomes a Third Forces systematic-ally taking a different point of view from the United States, there may be serious consequences ir. the developing world0    In the first place, the americans will probably not be prepared indefinitely to bear the whole burden of defending Western interests everywhere.     They may decide to opt out of certain situations, e, g. in Africa or the Persian Gulf,which could lead to local turbulence with highly damaging consequences to our material interests.    Furthermore if Western Europe and theUnited States do not act in harmony there is little prospect that the developed wcrld v/ill produce an effort that is anything Jike commensurate with the scale of problems in the under-developed world, bearing in mind that the population of the world will double by the end of the century.    Ifthe developing world is to be helped, with all that this implies for stability and expanding trade, it is essential that Western Europe and the UnitedStates should act in harmony.Conclusions12,       I draw the following conclusions to which I invite the agreementof my colleagues(a) Within the framework of the European-orientated policy whichwe have already adopted, we should aim at Course (c), namely a western europe which is stronger and more cohesive than at present and which,generally speaking, expects to act in harmony with the United Spates,,(b) la pursuing this course we should do nothing to weaken NATO orthe American commitment to Europe and on the contrary should strengthenNATO where we can,
(c) We should keep up our pressure to join the e.c. together with thoseof our friends who want to.     To this end v/e should agree to. discuss any-concrete ideas put forward by the Germans or the French or indeed others,so long as the clear objective is our entry into the Communities.    But atthe same time it will be of the utmost importance to give substance toBenelux-type proposals in partnership with as many Western european countries as are prepared to associate themselves with us for this purpose,(d) We should aim to get the maximum co-operation from Germany.In line with this v/e should, together with the Germans, pursue an East-West policy of small steps aiming at detente, some form of confederation of Germany and some parallel measures to reduce and control troops and weapons stationed in Central Europe.(e) We must expect that our ability to influence events outside the atlantic area will be considerably less than it used to be.    But thewithdrawal of our military presence from East of Suez does not andshould not mean a loss of interest in the world at large.    We shallstill maintain a general capability and must be able to carry out our responsibilities towards cur dependent territories.     We can build toour profit on our Commonwealth links, on support for the United Nations,on our world-wide commercial connections both visible and invisible, onthe importance of our language and on our skills in technical assistance.(f) By the dec isions we have already taken we have made major changes in British policy.    We now need to be on the alert to capitaliseon these changes.    We risk being left financially, commercially and politically on the margin of world events.    The decisions we now takewill lessen or increase this risk.    They will be critical to the future ofthis country.-6-
