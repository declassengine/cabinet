his document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)6mJ3C(68) 4626th February, 1968COPY NO.CABINETPRICESMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI arn in broad agreement with the proposition in the paper on prices and incomes policy (C(68) 45) circulated by the Secretary of Statefor Economic Affairs that if we take fresh powers on the Incomes side,some reasonably parallel action on the prices side will be needed forpresentational reasons.2.      But action to scrutinise and, where necessary, restrain price changes involves complications even greater than on incomes.    Theeffect of devaluation on costs means that almost all price claims are justified in part;  sorting out with reasonable accuracy how much of a proposed increase is and how much is not within the criteria is skilled and time-consuming work.    When the Earling Warning arrangements were introduced it was calculated by my officials that in the Board ofTrade field alone there might in normal conditions be between 5,000and 10,000 price changes a year.    This is a field where we could easily use up a great deal of staff and time (of both businessmen and officials) to little useful purpose.    So I think we need to look carefullyat the cost of effectiveness of new measures.3,      I arn concerned in all this that what we say about a tougherpolicy will be reasonably related to ivhat we can perform (and v/ant to perform) in practice.    If on the incomes side, for example, we saythat settlements within the 3j per cent ceiling are to be tested againstthe criteria, we need means to make this stick.   Do we intend, for example,that there should be some well-publicised rejections of settlementsat Zj per cent or 3 per cent?4,      Similarly on the prices side I do not want to promise more than we can perform.    Given the extensions to the early warningarrangements, which we have agreed to try to arrange, I would saythat we are already reasonably equipped to identify, and where necessary refer to the NBPI, unjustified price increases of economic importance.    In practice prices have throughout been held more effectively than incomes and we have very little evidence of abuse orlack of co-operation by private manufacturing industry.    We do not want to lose goodwill by appearing suspicious and elaborating ourcontrols unduly; nor, I think, do we want to lead the public to think that more can be done than is in fact practicable.    It would not be difficult in this way to attract a lot of odium for the price increases thatdevaluation will make inevitable.
5.      Above all, it seems to me, we ought to consider the staffingimplications of these proposals, particularly in relation to our recent decision to impose a ceiling on Civil Service staffing.    I must make itclear that the recently agreed extension of the existing voluntary arrangements will involve extra staff in my Department and acorresponding increase in the staff ceiling for the Department.    Fullimplementation of all the measures proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Economic Affairs would mean still further additions.    Apart fromthe difficulties created by increasing complements in this way, thereis the point that it seems unlikely that we shall be able quickly toprovide staff of the necessary calibre.    If we cannot, the measures will not be properly administered.    I suggest, moreover, that the concept of a Prices Inspectorate - which would presumably representyet another additional staffing burden - requires a good deal moreanalysis, since there is a real risk of duplication here.    Until more work has been done on this, I suggest that no reference should be madeto it in any general statement.6.      In the light of these general points I make some specificsuggestions.(i) Statutory notification of price increases.   I am quite contentthat this power should continue to be held in reserve, as it isat present, for use in case of abuse or non-co-operation.    Ishould hope, however, that the parallelism between the incomes and prices sides would not be carried so far that if it had to beapplied selectively on the incomes side, we should be pressed to find cases to which to apply it on the prices side, whetherthis was justified or not,(ii) Secondly any general application of the power for statutorynotification of prices would, I am sure, lose us the goodwillon which the present voluntary arrangements (and their proposed extension) depend.    Moreover it would involve us in a flood of paper to little useful purpose and require staff far in excessof (he numbers now used on this work.(iii) Statutory powers to reduce prices and defer price increases for up to twelve months.I am very doubtful about the first proposal which has noparallel on the incomes side.    I should be content with a power to enforce a recommendation of the NBPI that a priceshould be reduced.    But if it is suggested that departments should have power to enforce price reductions without reference and without appeal, I do not think the officials inthe industry departments have the knowledge or resources toenable us to make decisions of this kind and defend them.Even power to delay price increases for as long as a year -which could have very serious consequences for the firms concerned - should not in my view be exercised solely on theresponsibility of Departments.    I would expect CBI andindustry generally to take this view strongly.
(iv) Prices InspectorateAs mentioned above, I am sure we should not refer publicly toany proposal for a prices inspectorate, particularly inconnection with the vast field of retailing, without a muchclearer idea of what would be involved by way of staff,powers and procedure.conclusion,      I do not think the points I have made need stand in the way of an effective policy.    This is certainly not my intention.    But I feel wemust make our statements consistent with what it is administrativelypracticable to carry out.    In particular I do not think we should makewidespread use of statutory notification on the prices side or take powers to reduce prices or defer increases for a year without referenceto any outside body, unless and until we have had from officials a proper assessment of the administrative and staffimg implications ofthese steps and have ourselves determined that the price in extra staff is one we should pay.C. A. R, C.Board of Trade, S.W.I.26th February, 1968
