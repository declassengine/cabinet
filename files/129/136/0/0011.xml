OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 4827th February, 1968COPY NO.5CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEW FOR 1968Memorandum by the First Secretary of state the Cabinet agreed at their meeting on 1st February that theMinister of Agriculture should aim to secure the agreement of theFarmers1 Unions to a total award in the region of  50 million? that hecould however, if he thought it necessary and with my consent, go .beyond that figure;  but that the total award should in no circumstancesexceed  52jr million.    The Cabinet also invited the Minister to refer to the Committee on Agricultural Policy, in the light of the likelydetermination of the guaranteed prices of the commodities in question,his proposals for an assurance to the farmers that the guaranteed priceof beef, as determined at this Review, would not be reduced at thenext two Reviews; and that the standard quantity for wheat, whichgoverns the volume of production in respect of which the guaranteed price is paid, should be abolished: the Cabinet authorised theCommittee to settle these issues.2.      The Committee considered the position reached in thenegotiations at their meeting on 26th February.    The Minister ofAgriculture reported that his negotiations had been difficult.    He hadv/ith my consent discussed on an exploratory basis the possibility of reaching an agreed settlement between  50 million and  52-1 million.   while he hoped that the final award would fall within these limits, the chances of securing the farmers1 agreement on this basis were in his viewdoubtful.3.      The Minister informed the Committee that he should be ableto reach agreement on an increase in the guaranteed price for wheatof Is, 6d per cwt, which was the negotiating limit approved by theCabinet, provided that this was accompanied by abolition of thestandard quantity;  this would also improve the chances of an agreed settlement overall.    The Committee agreed on balance that thestandard quantity should be abolished and. authorised the Minister tomake use of this concession in his further negotiations.4.      The Minister reported that as a result of the negotiations he was now committed to an increase in the guaranteed price of beef of12s, 6d per cwt, which was the negotiating limit approved by the Cabinet.He argued that an assurance should now be given that this price wouldnot be reduced at the next two Reviews, in the interests both of ensuring-1-

On balance, however, the committee considered that to give a long term assurance based on a guaranteed price of 12s. 6d might well involve a heavy cost to the Exchequer infuture years, and that it would be wrong to enter into such a commitment in advance of the further review of the resource and Exchequer costs ofthe objectives of the present expansion programme which ministers had recently commissioned.5.      The Minister of Agriculture will be reporting orally the latestposition on the negotiations generally.
