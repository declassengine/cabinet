146^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C1681546th March,1960COPY NO065CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES; ENFORCEMENT OF POWERSMemorandurr. by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs my colleagues invited me to consider further^ in consultationwith the Lav/ Officers, the problems of enforcement of statutory powers(CC(68) 16th Meeting, Minute 3),    This memorandum sets out theposition in the light of my discussion with the Attorney-General,,2.      There is no question of imposing a policy in the face of widespreadopposition involving very large numbers of employers and unions.    Theassumption is that the Government can look for a considerable degree of voluntary co-operation and wide public support for the policy.    To seek to impose a policy in the absence of such support by v/ide use of statutory powers and sanctions would demand virtually the end of collective bargaining and the setting up of a large apparatus of price control.3.      But where opposition comes from a relatively few employers and unions, even if these are large ones, challenges to the policy cannot bemet quickly and effectively without our having some suitable statutory powers,    K even a few groups are seen to be getting away with it againstthe requirements of the policy, the effect on employers and unionsgenerally - and on public opinion - would be very serious indeed and could quickly undermine voluntary co-operation.4,      This means that the role of statutory powers is still of greatimportance even though in this sense it is a limited one.    It means alsothat the attitude to the policy of the general public is a very significantfactor.    There is no reason today to suppose that the public would behostile to the Government seeking fresh and stronger reserve powers?indeed, given fche renewed sense of urgency about our economic situation,notwithstanding devaluation, the public might well feel that we were notfacing fche facts if we decided not to seek such powers.    The strong support of public opinion was a powerful influence at the time of fche 1966Standstill and fche decision to take the wide powers under Part IV.In some cases, the use of powers will be sufficient in itself tosecure the acquiescence of those concerned because they will be reluctant to face prosecution for offences against fche Governments statutory ordersor directions.    There is also fche tendency of the average citisen to rallyto the support of the law.    But in other cases one must expect that the challenge will not be ended by the use of powers and that those concerned,Particularly employees, will take some form of action to try to get theirown way.-I-
1476       The Prices and Incomes Act, 1966 was drawn in such a way as toavoid, as far as possible, creating offences for which trade unions or trade unionists would be liable to conviction and penalties.    The onus forcomplying wi!&apos;h an order or direction deferring or suspending increases in pay falls wholly on the employer,    But it was essential to go on in the1966 Act to provide a sanction against trade unions or employees who might take action &quot;with a view to compel, induce or influence anyemployer&quot; fco implement an award or settlement forbidden under the Act.70      This special provision was not devised simply to give protection to the employer who was placed under a statutory obligation not to pay more to his employees but also to give trade unions a most necessarysafeguard against &quot;any criminal or tortious liability for conspiracy orany other liability in tort&quot; - that is action for criminal conspiracy or for civil damages.    Efaving provided the sanction under section 16(4) of the1966 Act, it was then possible to provide this safeguard in section 16(5).8.      The possibility remains that employees could be prosecuted and,on convictions fined.    The Act does not provide for imprisonment as analternative to a fine but a person who refused to pay a fine could becomeliable to imprisonment for non-payment of the fine.    The position in 1966was such that a person determined against paying a fine would have endedup in prison quite quickly.9.      However, the Criminal Jusfcic0 Act, 1967 has changed the pictureconsiderably because its provisions relating to non-payment of fines for offences for which mere is no alternative penalty of imprisonment(including those under the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966) greatly reducethe likelihood of even a very determined union official or unofficialstriker being imprisoned.10.      It is no longer open to the court to&apos;.order imprisonmentimmediately for non-payment of fines and an offender must have had time to pay, enquiry must be made into his means, and other forms of enforcement have been found to be inappropriate or unsuccessful0    these other forms of enforcement are;  civil proceedings may be brought in theHigh Court and County Court against income, assets, etc., andmagistrates1 courts may enforce fines by attachment of earnings orders.These provisions should reduce greatly the likelihood of non-payment offines leading to imprisonment unless the offender were deliberate3.y cutto get imprisoned and even then he would have to arrange his personalaffairs in such a way that it proved impossible to collect the fines by civil remedies.11.      But it is just possible that the personal affairs of some personswho had been out on strike (especially unofficial strike) for a time mightbe such as to escape the possibility of a civil remedy - attachment of earnings orders could be applied only when they had returned to work.12.     It is important to ?^eep in mind that the first essential step is tohave power to stop payment being made or else the employers in manycases v/ill feel too exposed to co-operate in the policy.    The nextessential step is to afford employers some measure of protection againststrike action, and in many cases unions will be reluctant to face thecharge of a strike &quot;against the Government&quot;.
13       As the Attorney-General has pointed out, however;, the intrusionof the criminal law into this field is always likely to be difficult, as it involves an interference with contractual rights and contractualagreements between employer and employees, for instance where the employer might be a local authority or the settlement one authorised bya statutory Wages Council.    It is for the Attorney-General alone (inEngland and Wales), in his quasi judicial capacity to decide whethercriminal proceedings should be started.     Before taking such proceedingshe will normally wish to consult Ministers about the possible effects ofa prosecution,    But, although his decision will, be b^sed on considerationof the public interest as a whole, if there is clear evidence of an offence under section 16? it may be his duty to commence proceedings;, eventhough that may be contrary to the wishes of Ministers,    Experienceduring the period of standstill and severe restraint has shown thedelicacy of the position as between Ministers and the Attorney-Genera]as a Law Officer014.     However, in many cases there will be insufficient evidence tojustify a prosecution under section 16(4), or to be sure of success ?  acase is brough&apos;:, even though if- is apparent that employees are seeking to persuade employers to act in breach of statutory orders.    To succeed in a prosecution under this sub-section, it would be necessary to provebeyond reasonable doubt that the employeeTs action was taken &quot;with aview tc compel, Induce or influence any employer, etc, &quot;,    The difficultyv/ill be in collecting the necessary evidence of intent tc satisfy this sub-section where the employees&apos; action stops short of ordinary strike action (e.g. working to rule, a ban on overtime or &quot;working withoutenthusiasm&quot;).    But although such action as working to rule can causegreat difficulty for employers, it is a more limited form of industrial action in many cases than a strike.15,      Prosecution will be particularly difficult if powers are taken toprevent retrospective payments of increases.    It will be necessary toshow that there had been, by the illegal payment of arrears of pay, animpiementatior1 of the original award and not merely an Increase awardedby an employer after the period of deferment had expired;  and for thepurposes of section 16(4) it will be necessary to prove that the employeehad taken action with a view to influencing the employer to implement the original award,,    In the Attorneys-General % view, there would be no great zeal for the enforcement of such provision by the criminal courts,and prosecutions might v/ell fail in such circumstances.16.      The Attorney-General considers that the pattern of enforcementin the courts would be exacerbated if the Government were free to make orders without reference to, and recommendation by, the NBPI because,in his view, the courts would be influenced by the fact that employersand employees had taken action contrary to the findings of anindependent statutory bedy,i7.      Problems of enforcement do, of course, apply whether there are few or many statutory powers.    They arise even in relation to Part II ofthe 1966 Act which is permanent legislation and in relation to sections i-3of the 1967 Act which lapse after 11th August, 1968.    The consideration ofextended powers, such as described in C(68) 45, does not make itnecessary to go beyond section 16(4) of the 1966 Act.    It Is difficult to see how one could narrow yet further the risk of imprisonment of trade unionists without destroying the credibility of statutory powers,    But,penalties apart, an extension of the powers will tend to widen the areaof uncertainty about enforcement where they are challenged.
AO18.      The Attorney-General has mentioned the question of industrial action resulting from action in the courts and this is an inherent risk inany statutory powers over pay awards and settlements.    The risk maywell be greater if the maximum period of delay is extended to 12 months and a bar to retrospection imposed.    But we have to weigh this riskagainst the serious danger of a &quot;free for all&quot; over pay af we have no powers to deter those who challenge our policy.19.      The view we finally take about statutory powers must in the last resort depend on our expectation of being able to enlist wide public support for the policy.    I agree v/ith the Attorney-General that, even with such support, we can expect difficult cases over enforcementswithout it, the extension of statutory powers would be a hollow exercise.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1.6th March, 1963,4.
