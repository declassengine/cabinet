1Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)c(68l4928th February, .1968copy no.  65CABINETMEAT imports memorandum by the First Secretary of state the Ministers directly concerned have been considering, under my chairmanship, future policy in relation to meat imports.    This   *followed a recent proposal by the Minister of Agriculture that thepresent ban on imports from potentially dangerous sources should notbe lifted until the Government were able to decide their long-term policy in the light of the report of the Northumberland Committee, whichhas been set up to review the policy for dealing with foot-and-mouth disease (though not, of course, the full economic and political implications of restricting imports).Z.     The existing ban on imports of carcass meat and offal from countries other than those where foot-and-mouth disease is effectivelyunknown was agreed, as a temporary measure, by the Cabinet on30th November and announced as such to the House of Commons on 4th December, 1967.    The Minister of Agriculture then told the House&quot;These arrangements are temporary.    They will last untilthe present emergency has been brought under controland will, in any event, be reviewed in three months1 time,if still in operation. &quot;3,     The case for now continuing the ban on imports from latin america (but not from most of the ctlfcer sources at present affectedwhose meat presents less risk) until the Northumberland Committeehas reported may be summarised as follows:-(i)      Since the decision to impose the ban was announced the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Ministry ofAgriculture has come to the conclusion thatArgentine meat was probably responsible for therecent epidemic and the Government cannot avoidpublishing this conclusion.
(ii)   If shipments from Latin America continue the risk of furtheroutbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease will be seriously increased and this is not a risk which British farmers should be expectedto continue to face after the recent and devastating epidemic,(iii)   The Irish Republic has drawn attention to the serious riskinvolved for Irish agriculture - and therefore for the wholeIrish economy and indirectly for our exports to Ireland - ifthe United Kingdom ban on imports is relaxed and consequently the risk of further outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease here is increased.(iv)   Public interest and concern have been aroused by the scale ofthe recent epidemic and there have been strong protests from many quarters, both in the country and in Parliament, againstlifting the ban.   A further outbreak of foot-and-mouth diseaseis virtually certain to occur sooner or later in any event:   ifthe Government now lifts the import ban it will be plaeed in amost difficult situation whether or not the next outbreak canbe traced to imports.4.     The case for lifting the ban on imports now may be summarised asfollows:(i)   The ban was declared to be a temporary one designed to reducethe risk of another outbreak while our veterinary services were stretched to the limit.   Since that declaration the onlynew relevant fact affecting the situation is the conclusion ofthe Chief Veterinary Officer that Argentine lamb may have caused the epidemic.   But we have for many years recognised thatthere is a risk to animal health from meat imports, and have accepted this risk because of the serious consequences whichcould be expected to follow a ban and which are referred tobelow.   The probability that Argentine lamb caused that lastepidemic is not a sound basis for banning imports of theirbeef indefinitely and so reversing our whole trade policy,(ii)   There would be serious consequences for United Kingdom tradeand political relations, particularly with Argentina,,   Thepresent Argentine Government has made good progress towardsstabilising the economy and is now embarking on a major develop-ment programme.   It is deliberately aiming to buy more from europe - particularly from the United Kingdom - and less fromthe United States.   The attached paper by officials estimates that we might lose  25-4-5 million a year in sales (includinginvisibles) to South America.-2-
(iii)   The consequences for our trade and political relations with argentina would be the more serious because the Governmenthad given an undertaking that the import ban would betemporary and would not outlast the epidemic,(iv)   There would be adverse consequences for the cost of living;the report by officials estimates that beef prices might increase by 10 per cent and that the cost of living indexmight rise by three-quarters of a point.5.    Wo have considered the case for and against the maintenance ofthe import ban at least until the Northumberland Committee has reported and the Ministers directly concerned are evenly divided on this.     Wehave therefore considered whether there were acceptable alternatives -(a) The possibility of raising the ban on boneless meat fromLatin America commended itself to no-ono.     It would make difficulties for the Argentine without sufficiently reducingthe risk of infection here.(b) The possibility of restricting sales of South American meat toLondon and possibly to some other urban centres did not commend itself either.     There is considerable doubt whetherit would be practicable even if it were acceptable, on theone hand, as a sufficient safeguard for animal health and,on the other, to restrict sales of possibly diseased meat toLondoners.(c) The limitation of any continuing ban to Argentine mutton and lamb alone - on the grounds that this was probably the causeof the epidemic - did not go far enough to meet the views ofthose concerned to reduce the risks from imports to animal health.6.    We have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no satisfactory compromise short of either raising the ban on imports now or continuing it until, at least, the Northumberland Committee has reported.    And, as I have said, the Ministers directly concerned areevenly divided on the merits of the two latter alternatives.M.S.70 Whitehall, S.W.1.27th February 1968-3-
CONFIDENTIALFOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASEThe Future of the Ban on Meat ImportsNote by Working Party of OfficialsIntroduction1.     We were asked by Ministers (MISC.192(68)lst Meeting) toexamine the implications both of keeping and of removing thepresent ban on meat imports and to take into account the likely consequences for British agriculture, for the balanceof payments, for the cost of living, and for the level of exchequer support.2.     In what follows we are speaking of carcass meat andoffals of cattle and sheep;  (pigmeat has been banned fromS, America among other countries for a number of years andis not in question).    Before the ban of December 4th imports were freely permitted, from countries having a long historyof freedom from the &quot;cfisease, v i) and these have not been affected by the ban.    Before the ban imports were already prohibited from countries - except the S. american countries - where foot and mouth disease was endemic.     OnDecember 4th this prohibition was extended to those countries from which imports had previously been licensed subject tocertain safeguards, i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay,Uruguay, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Austria,Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia,Hungary, South West Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.Many countries in this last group experience foot and mouth disease only in sporadic, not in endemic form, and the MAFFwould be willing to remove the prohibition on imports, either at once or after a relatively short interval, from all ofthem except Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay,Belgium and possibly South Africa.     Countries (e.g. Germany)from which imports were prohibited before the ban would also,of course, continue to be excluded from the United kingdom market.3.    We have therefore interpreted our remit as requiring usto assess, so   far as possible in quantitative terms, the comparative costs and benefits of the following alternatives:(a) The continuance of the ban for those countries namedat the end of para. 2 above for so long as foot andmouth remains endemic there.(b) The complete removal of the ban on 4th March,  (exceptfor countries from which imports were prohibited before december 4th) assuming that foot and mouth disease is then under control;In theory it would also be possible to retain the ban for allthe countries at present covered; but since the MAFF advise that there is no case for doing this on animal health groundswe have not considered it. However, as we point out below,a partial removal of the ban is likely to seem discriminatoryto those suppliers still banned. We begin by analysing indetail the effect of 3(a) and then go on to consider much(i)   These countries were Australia, Canada, Channel Islands,Falkland Islands, Finland, Iceland, Isle of Man, New Zealand,Northern Ireland, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Union of SouthAfrica, United States of America;    Cuba which has recentlybeen accepted as clear can now be added to this category;the Union of South Africa must be deleted.
CONFIDENTIAL Q,more briefly the consequences of the complete removal of y \the ban.4.     Among the countries affected by the ban, the mostimportant sources of carcass meat and offals have beenArgentina and Uruguay.     Other suppliers are much lesssignificant but, in South America, Brazil and Chile arealso interested;    in Europe, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Poland,Rumania and the Netherlands;    elsewhere, South Africa,South West Africa and Botswana.     The ban covers various categories of meat which are imported for different purposes,come from different sources of supply and are not necessarilyor widely acceptable as substitutes for each other whether in price or in quality.     Chilled beef, of which Argentinais by far our largest supplier and for which we are herprincipal customer, is acceptable at retail particularlyin the Midlands and South East as an alternative to freshbeef from which many buyers could not in   fact distinguishit.     It is usually cheaper, cut-for-cut, than home-killedof similar quality.     V/ith frozen meat substitution is not soeasy;   frozen lamb is little impaired by freezing and is widely retailed but most frozen beef is used by manufacturers,caterers and institutions, and is not acceptable at retailto any large extent.The future of the ban5.     The removal of the ban from all countries except those mentioned at the end of para 2 would affect mainly the SouthAmericans especially Argentina and Uruguay.     Table I of the annex shows the meat production and exports of these twocountries.     Table II shows United Kingdom production and consumption of the various types.     Argentina is of significanceboth as our major supplier of meat and as an importantcustomer for our exports, both present and future.     our total imports c.i,f. from Argentina in 1967 were  72.1m., ofwhich the main item was  29.1m. for carcass meat and offals.This latter figure is low in relation to the normal, andusually runs at between  32m. and  35m. which represents about half of Argentina&apos;s exports to the United Kingdom, 30 per cent of Argentina&apos;s total exports of carcass meat and 5 per cent of her whole export trade to all countries of the world.    Theother principal items in Argentina&apos;s exports to the UnitedKingdom are manufactured meat products, cereals and wool.     our exports to Argentina in 1967 totalled  25m., f.o.b. mainlymachinery, manufactures and chemicals;    this was a decline fromthe I960 figure of  50m., for reasons mentioned later.Effects of meat imports of continued ban6.    The continuation of a partial ban as at 3(a) would lose the United Kingdom initially about 175,000 tons of meat (about1% of total consumption);    of this 140,000 tons would be beef and veal including 120,000 tons from Argentina, 20,000 tons would be lamb, all from Argentina and 15,000 tons would beoffals including 10,000 from Argentina.     Half of the remaining20,000 tons of beef lost would be from Uruguay.     At 1966/67import prices (allowing for devaluation) the value of importsforgone would be approximately  40m. c.i.f.7.    The mutton and lamb and also the offals could probablybe readily replaced with little effect on import prices,    themutton and lamb mainly from New Zealand and the offals from u.S.A., Denmark and elsewhere.8-    As has been pointed out above,,  the chilled beef is not readily substitutable by frozen beef.     Higher prices in theUnited Kingdom could probably induce Australia and New zealand to divert some 20,000 tons of frozen beef to the United2
Kingdom from other markets.       But the chilled beef&quot; could bereplaced only to a small extent, say 30,000 tons, by chilledbeef from European sources e.g. Yugoslavia or Poland and thiswould take perhaps three years to build up.     Allowing forthis we should be left with a deficiency of about 90,000 tonsof chilled beef which represents about 4 per cent of our meatconsumption.     The higher prices which we should be paying for existing supplies and for replacements from non-banned sourcesmight mean, additional expenditure of the order of  35 millioninitially, but with the gradual build-up of additional supplies,substitution of other types of meat and declining prices,this might fall to  25 million.     Thus the balance of paymentssaving on meat imports allowing for this might range from 5 million at the outset to  15 million later.The Scope for Increased Home Production9.     It takes from three to four years to increase beef production, two years for pigmeat and a year for poultry.By pushing the expansion of home beef supplies to the limit of technical possibility accepted in the recent report of theSub-Committee on Agricultural Objectives it should bepossible to increase supplies between now and 1970/71 by about23,000 tons above what would be required to meet the expecteddemand at that time.     There would also be some small scope for increased mutton and lamb production.      In order to meet a demand for more pork, pigmeat production could readily beincreased by more than the 120,000 tons which the Sub-Committeeon Agricultural Objectives thought was the limit acceptablewithout incurring international difficulties on bacon.Poultry output would readily expand in response to a higherdemand resulting from a switch from beef consumption.10.     Assuming that 30,000 tons of beef and lamb could besecured by 1970/71, the remaining gap in home consumptionof 60,000 tons could thus be supplied by pork and poultryand the extra imports of , feeding stuffs required for thesetwo latter might total  8 million a year.     The build-up of pork and poultry supplies resulting from this would help tobring prices down as suggested at the end of paragraph 8,thus increasing the estimated saving on the meat importbill in the way there indicated.The Effect on Exchequer Subsidies11.     In the short term the effect of the shortages and higher prices resulting from the ban would be to reduce Exchequersubsidies below what they would otherwise be.     A shortfallof supplies in the immediate future of between 90,000 and120,000 tons of beef would result in higher prices for fatcattle and also for sheep and pigmeat;    deficiency payments would be lower and the saving might be somewhere between  30million and  40 million for 1968/69.     There would be continuing savings in later years but these would diminishas additional supplies come forward and prices declined.     to achieve increased supplies of carcase meat it would benecessary to increase guaranteed prices to maintain these ata high level and in consequence to pay on a higher volumeof production.      It is not practicable to estimate theadditional Exchequer expenditure which would be required toproduce the desired increase in supply by 1970/71-     Ineffect the choice would be between accepting a deficiency in supplies of up to 90,000 tons and allowing market prices to rise so as to reduce consumer demand for the kinds of meat(utherto eaten or, on the other hand, taking the opportunityin future farm price reviews to increase incentives to fat-stock production in order to fill part of this gap.
4Thp. effect on prices12.     The retail price of home-killed beef has increased by15*per cent during the last three months;    this results fromseasonal factors and devaluation as well as from the epidemicand the ban.     There has also been a significant increase inthe price of mutton and lamb and a small increase in the priceof pork.     In the medium term we estimate that a shortage of meat of the order we have calculated might cause beef prices to settle down at about 10 per cent and meat prices generallyat about 6 per cent above what they would otherwise have been;(This would be about 0.6 per cent on the Cost of Living indexor f of a point).     In the longer term, as customers adjust their purchases and alternative supplies come on to themarket, the effect should be for the price increase to bereduced to perhaps 2 per cent above the level which would otherwise have ruled.The political effects of a continued ban13.     It seems more satisfactory to discuss the political considerations before the economic considerations since theimportance of the latter will depend to some extent on the severity of the political reaction to be expected.     Thepolitical repercussions in South America must be assessed inthe light of repeated undertakings about the temporary natureof the ban.     As recently as 30th January the Minister ofAgriculture said in the House of Commons that the Governmentcould not break their pledge to remove the ban as soon as theoutbreak was under control.     Supplying countries will certainly argue that the evidence ascribing the currentoutbreak to Argentine lamb is admitted to be only circum-stantial and is not conclusive.     In these circumstances, theywould accuse us of continuing the ban beyond the presentepidemic partly as a political move to appease United Kingdomfarmers and partly as a manoeuvre to secure protection underthe cover of animal health restrictions .     Argentinaparticularly would react very sharply to what she would thinka slur on the reputation of her beef industry;    it would be argued that there was no case for banning beef since theevidence of disease related to lamb.     The economic effects of losing about half of her total exports to the UnitedKingdom would be severe especially as this would occur in an industry where the financial economic and marketing structurehas been built up over many years for the United kingdom market;    it would be difficult for her to replace the UnitedKingdom by other markets.     Argentina would also envisagea risk to her existing meat exports to other countries as aresult of our ban,  (though in some of them foot and mouthis endemic.)     A similar reaction should be expected fromUruguay, where the ban would also have a serious adverse effect.     Though the Uruguyan reaction could be expected tobe more moderate than the Argentine, it might for that veryreason secure more support from other South American countries.14.     A severe reaction is therefore to be expected.     Apartfrom the fact that exports, banking, insurance and investmentinterests would all be at   risk of retaliation in a way which1S. discussed below, we should also have to expect serious political consequences.     These would have a bearing on e.g.the present negotiations on the Falkland Islands which are nowat a critical stage, would greatly strengthen the nationalistelements in Argentina, would adversely affect the latin american vote in the United Nations and would generallyembitter Anglo-Argentine relations.     This reaction would be
greatly exacerbated if, as we have assumed the ban was continued,in effect, against Latin America only.15.     Such action against a group of developing countries would be extremely unfortunate at a time when UNCTAD is meeting in New Delhi.       The ban has already been brought up byUruguay at the Conference which provides an excellent forum for those affected by it to rally support.16.     The interest of the Irish Republic is strongly opposedin this to that of the Latin American countries. The Irish Govern-ment have recently represented to us the serious consequences for the Republic of the present outbreak and of the severemeasures which it forced upon them.     They have stressed thatif another outbreak occurred here, especially in the touristseason, similar control measures would be virtually impossibleof full enforcement and extremely damaging to their wholeeconomy.     If these measures failed and foot and mouth diseasewere conveyed from the United Kingdom to Ireland,the effecton the Irish economy would be catastrophic and would be reflected in supplies of meat and cattle to the United Kingdom.17.     If the Irish Government thought that we were taking anunjustifiable risk of reinfection which might be conveyed to them, this could lead to a serious deterioration in Anglo-Irish relations and might force them to reconsider the balanceof advantage to them in the Anglo-Irish Agreement which isalready under attack in Ireland.     Moreover an epidemic inIreland would so impoverish the Irish as to put at risk our exports to the Republic which in 1967 amounted to somethingunder  200 million.The Effect on Exports of a Continued Ban18.     United Kingdom exports would be affected in severalways by the continuation of a partial ban;    increased expenditure on meat from non-banned suppliers would increasethose countries&apos; earnings and hence their ability to importfrom all sources including United Kingdom;    the reduction inthe earnings of the banned countries would reduce their ability to import;    in addition our exports to them could befurther reduced by deliberate retaliation on their part*19.     It is estimated above that higher prices plus additional supplies from alternative suppliers might cost us about  35million, initially, declining to 25 million;    since thesesuppliers will include countries such as Australia, NewZealand and the Irish Republic, where the United Kingdom hasa relatively large share of the market, and also Poland,^where bilateral trade arrangements are important, the UnitedKingdom might expect to earn an additional  5-10 million ayear, all told,from increased exports to them.20.    As regards the risk to United Kingdom exports to thebanned Latin American suppliers, the country principally concerned would be Argentina.     Argentina&apos;s earnings from theUnited Kingdom will be reduced by the ban to the extent of 30-35 million a year and it seems unlikely that othermarkets can readily be found for the type and quantity of meat we have been importing.       Thus Argentines ability to import would be directly reduced and in addition we mustreckon with the probability of retaliation against our exports,United Kingdom exports to Argentina were  25 million in 1967,having declined from about  50 million in I960 owing partly to a lower import demand generally in Argentina and partly to a decline in the United Kingdom&apos;s share of the market from per cent to about 6 per cent.
CONFIDENTIAL .: , ... ,21*    But the prospects for increasing our exports to Argentinanow seem good.     In addition to the competitive advantageresulting from devaluation the Argentine economy has improvedconsiderably under the present regime and there are a number of major contracts in view for the next few years.     Only some  35million worth have reached the stage where completion with united Kingdom firms is being frustrated by the present difficulties but there are a number of others for which british firms have tendered or are likely to tender.     For example theArgentine Government envisages a naval programme of  145million over the next five years and enquiries for  45 millionworth of this are already with British shipyards with theadditional prospect of participating in locally built vessels to a further value of perhaps  60 million.       There are alsofurther major contracts totalling about  150 million to beplaced over the next few years including a nuclear power station ( 30-45 million), the El Chocon hydro-electric station( 75 million), two conventional power stations, two steelworksand possibly a major petrochemical plant.     (Within the last24 hours the nuclear power station contract is reported tohave gone to West Germany and one of the steel works to havebeen withdrawn).     There are likely to be difficulties in finding other markets for some of these exports;   shipbuilding and steel works plant are industries where capacity is already under-employed.     The Ambassador in Buenos Aires has also pointed out that the Argentine authorities are now embarking on a Development Programme (which is expected to amount to 325 million for next year and may include some of the contractsmentioned above).     They will presently begin placing orders and they have shown a pre-disposition to place such orders here.22.     Thus, in addition to contracts which have already been negotiated, there are important opportunities for United kingdom exports;   a continuation of the ban on Argentine meat wouldcertainly put us out of the running for these.       Argentinais now moving into a strong financial position and is theprincipal market in Latin America where there is new scope for expansion of exports and where we have an establishedposition from which to advance.     A continuation of the banwould endanger not only the existing trade but also our hopeof expanding it to the figure reached in the early sixties,i.e, double our present exports.       There is no means of estimating accurately the extent to which retaliation byArgentina might cut our exports, but in the judgment of theDepartments concerned, and given the degree of resentment whichwould be provoked by a continued ban, it seems by no meansunlikely that for several years virtually the whole of our export trade to Argentina might disappear.     We would expectthis effect to be gradually reduced and exports to recoversomewhat though probably not to the previous level;    theywould certainly remain much below what might otherwise have been achieved by way of expansion..     If this judgment is right, we might lose upwards of  20 million a year for several years and the possibility of sharing in a major increase inthe existing level of Argentine imports.23.     it would of course be possible for us to threatencounter-retaliation against Argentine exports to an equivalentor even greater amount.     But the Ambassador&apos;s advice is thatsuch a threat would not change Argentine&apos;s&apos; attitude, and ifwe had to implement our threat the resulting dislocation oftrade would be likely to damage our own interests and wecould certainly not assume that it would not harm our balance ofpayments.Invisibles24.- The effect on invisible trade with Argentina seems unlikely to be significant except for shipping, and to a lesser extent insurance.
CONFIDENTIALa)   Shipping - y (jMeat from South America to the United Kingdom iscarried largely by three United Kingdom shipping lines which have invested in eleven refrigerated ships speciallybuilt for the purpose.     A permanent ban on imports of meat from South America would result in the loss of these ships&apos;earnings and of the capital invested in them as they have very limited alternative uses.     The ships carry passengers and engage in the cross-trades but the services depend uponthe carriage of meat and their cancellation might resultin an annual loss to United Kingdom shipping earnings of 4-5 million gross.      (The shipping lines have alreadypressed H.M.G. for financial assistance to tide them overthe period of the ban and might look for compensationfor capital losses.)b)   InsuranceInsurance and reinsurance premiums accruing to theLondon market probably amount to not more than about  million.     Providing competitive terms were offered thisbusiness might be diverted by the Argentine StateReinsurance Organisation to American, Swiss or Germanreinsurers.     Business with Uruguay might be similarlyaffected.c)   British InvestmentsThe book value of British investments in the Argentineamounts to about  75 million with a market value of  120million, spread over more than 130 firms in industry, tradeand agriculture, including 1.0.1., B.A.T., Bank of Londonand Vesteys.     Earnings on these investments amount toat least  5 million annually of which the major part isremitted to United Kingdom.       Holdings in ranches amountto about  4 million and in meat processing and freezingplants to about  10 million at book value.d)   Export Credits Guarantee department the amount of debt currently outstanding is in theneighbourhood of  32 million.Shipping is clearly at serious risk, and some loss oninsurance seems probable.     There would also be some risk to our investments in Argentina, but we do not think it likely that they would be seriously interfered with.    Argentinais most unlikely to carry retaliation to the length ofdefaulting on their debts.Other considerations25.    There is a further point to be taken into account -the 0.6 per cent increase in the cost of living resulting from increased meat prices, could be expected to reflect itselfeventually in higher wages.     We have not attempted to assessthis factor but any effect which it had would be adverse.26.     in addition to the direct effects on export earnings whichwe have attempted to assess above, there will be otherrepercussions on the economy which are not quantifiable.     Theloss of trade with an established market will cause a degree ofdislocation to businesses which are geared to it, in manu-facturing, in shipping, and in distribution.     There will, forexample, be the loss of the work which has gone into building upagencies and connections in Argentina, the need to re-orientateproduction, and to begin building up connections elsewhere.The cost of all this to our economy, though impossible toestimate, would be widespread and perhaps sizeable.7
(b) Excheuqer SupportHigher market prices might reduce deficiency round by  30-40 million below present estimates in 1968/9;    there would be diminishing savings in later years as supplies increased and pricesdeclined.    But to achieve these increased suppliesof carcase meat it would be necessary to increaseguaranteed prices, to maintain these at a high level and consequently to pay on a higher volumeof production.    It is not practicable to estimate the additional Exchequer expenditure which wouldbe required to produce a desired increase insupply by 1970/71.    (para, 11).(c) British agriculture the effect here would be that entailed by increasing the output of pigmeat by means of thesubsidy and of poultry as a result of higher prices.   Any increase in beef supplies would be within that already postulated in the Report ofthe Sub-Committee on Agricultural Objectives.(d)   The Balance of payments the end-result here will be the outcome of many different factors, some of which are of quite adifferent nature from the others and most of whichcannot be estimated save within a very wide range.We have not thought it useful therefore to try to strike an arithmetical balance of the plusses andminuses discussed above.    But we have reached thefollowing broad assessment.    On the import side theadvantage to the balance of payments of forgoingArgentine meat imports might range from  5 million in the short-term when replacement prices will be high, to  15 million in the longer-term if pricesdeclined; but this longer-term figure would need tobe reduced by the import cost of additional feeding-stuffs to expand supplies, which we have estimatedat  8 million.On the side of exports, we think that we must reckonwith the loss of virtually the whole of our export trade toArgentina for a year or so and perhaps longer, and some loss in other South American countries.   We put the cost of this at 25 million a year in the immediate future but, as there are good prospects in the next few years of restoring our exporttrade to Argentia   to something like its 1960 level of 50 million, the cost would grow.    Thus, though   there mightbe some resumption of exports, the potential loss in thelonqer run might be of the order of  40 million a year.    Therewould also be a loss on invisible trade - mainly shipping and insurance - which might be of the order of  5 million.8Summary of Effects of Partial Removal of Ban (Course 3(&quot;a))&quot;27,    (a)    Cost of living in the medium-term beef prices might settle down at some 10% and meat prices generally at 6% above what they would otherwise have been;    this wouldbe 0.6% on the cost of Living Index (f of a point).In the longer term the price effect should decline to perhaps 2% above the level which would otherwise have ruled (para. 12).
Against this must be set the increase that we should expectin exports to countries from which our meat imports would increase - perhaps  5- 10 million - though this would take time to secureo    On the basis of all these estimates together -and it must be emphasised that they are very speculative andsubject to a wide margin of error - it seems probable that theimmediate impact on our balance of payments of maintaining the ban would be adverse, that it would result in lastingdamage to our exports to Argentina which could not be fullyrecouped elsewhere, and that the net adverse effect in thefirst year or two might be of the order of  15- 25 million,but this might be too low or too high.Removal of the ban28.   We were also asked to consider the consequences of acomplete removal of the ban.    For lack of time and informationit has not been possible to do this in anything like the samedetail as the study in the preceding paragraphs of the partialremoval of the ban.    In any case, a number of the factors involved will come within the scope of the Duke ofNorthumberland&apos;s Committee.    The Ministry of Agriculture have however provided estimates of the cost of the presentepidemic.    Other Departments have not had an opportunity of examining the calculations and are not therefore committed toall the figures.29.   The Ministry of Agriculture point out that it is notpossible to calculate the true internal cost of the epidemic.It is reckoned that the direct Exchequer cost including thecost of compensation, of disinfecting premises, burying ordestroying slaughtered herds, and staff costs will amount to 35 million,  of which  27 million is for compensation.    Inaddition it is estimated that the Milk Marketing Board has lost about  if million on various services and that farmworkers may have lost up to  150,000 in wages.   There havealso been consequential losses to farmers but these would bedifficult to quantify.30.   There are many other items which cannot be quantifiedalthough the cost of them must have been considerable.    For10 weeks the whole of Great Britain was a controlled area inwhich animals could move only under licence and store, markeksrwereprohibited.    At the height of the epidemic 18 countiescovering an area of 11,500 square miles of densely stockedcountry were subject to infected area controls and these restrictions brought considerable losses to farmers through-out the country who were not directly affected by the disease,as well as to the meat trade and have added to costs generally.It seems no more practicable to quantify the effects ofdislocation of rbfs kind than those of the dislocation ofbusiness referred to in para. 26 above which might follow themaintenance of the ban.31.   The current epidemic has been one of exceptionalseverity.   As compared with the resulting cost of compensationon this occasion of about  27 million, the total cost over the16 years from 1951-66 was about  10.4 million and in only  years did it rise above  2 million.   These figures of courserelate only to compensation and do not take account of furthercosts.   Nevertheless, they provide some guide to the incidenceQf the disease over the last 16 or 17 years.    The Ministry ofAgriculture accept that on past experience the present out-break is exceptional and that if the compensation figures wereto be averaged over the period since 1951 the annual compensa-tion cost would not much exceed  2 million.    But, apart from
the fact that compensation costs do not reflect the whole ofthe loss to the economy, they consider that since there is nopattern to the disease the past cannot be a guide to thefuture and that this year&apos;s cost is a measure of the risk weare constantly exposed to.32.   There is of course no ground for assuming that a con-continuation of the ban on S. American meat will give us complete freedom from the disease.   The question is how much it would reduce the frequency of epidemics such as we have had thisyear.   This is not a matter on which we have been able toform any opinion on the information available, but theM.A.F.F. consider that on the evidence of experience inother countries which do not admit meat from infected sourcesthe risk of further epidemics would at least be greatly reduced.10

^Jh^finally Outbreak1.    Th3 first case in the present epidemic was reported on25th October, 1967, on the premises of E. N. Ellis, Eryn Farm,flantmawr, Oswestry, Shropshire.     This was the initial case in the ,epidemic.     No subsequent case was confirmed in which animals hadevidence of earlier disease.2.    A very full inquiry has been made into the origin of theinfection.     I have considered all the possible means by whichfoot-and-mouth disease virus could have been brought to thisoriginal case, including movements of animals and persons,mechanical carriage by birds and wind, materials used on tho farm,infection remaining from sources in the U.K., and imported meat.3*    f/Iovemonts of Anima 1 s anu Pc-persons   .     There was no possibility that the disease was brought on to the farm in animals because theonly movement on to the farm was a boar which subsequent investiga-tion showed could not have brought the- disease.     No-one in the household hod been abroad and there had boon no foreign visitorson the farm, so that the possibility of the disease being introduced by human agency can bo disregarded.l&quot;    Technical Carriage by birds and wind.     Infection in tho pasthas reached the Eastern and Southern parts of this country from europe, possibly carried by birds, when there have been epidemicsin the countries across the English Channel, but the foot-and-mouth disease situation on the Continent has improved greatly in 1967.Banmark and Holland have- been clear since April;   France has hadI oniy 17 cases, the last occurring in early September in the[ Department of Corroze in the southern part of central FrancoI nere it was eradicated by a vigorous slaughter policy.     It isI -file that Western Germany has experienced serious epidemics in11965 :,nd 1966, and had over 3,000 cases in 1967, but I consider1^ distance is too great for the disease to have been brought fromCONFIDENTIAL1 .ANNEX j 0 1ORIGIN OF THE 1967-68 FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASEEPIDEMIC

In any case,   ^ Q2the prevailing winds over the three weeks before the outbreak were such as to rule out wind-borne infection.c     Materials Used on the Farm.    The importation of hay and strawis prohibited from dangerous sources;    and no imported hay andstraw had been used on the farm,6.    Infection from Sources in the U.K.     The last previous outbreakres in Warwickshire.    Infection was confined to 4 farms and the areaswas cleared on 29th September.     It is impossible for infection tohave remained quiescent in the intervening period and in any case there were no movements of animals between Warwickshire and BrynFarm.7,    In the early clays of October 1967 there was an escape of virusin an isolation compound at the Animal Virus Research Institute,Pirbright,     Due to a breakdown in the air filtration system^infection escaped from one unit to another, a distance ofapproximately thirty/forty yards.     This occurred in cool humidweather with strong south-westerly winds, so that infection couldnot have been spread to the North by this means.     None of theworkers from Pirbright went to the Oswestry district at thematerial time, nor were any vehicles sent there.     This incidentcannot be considered as the origin of the outbreak on Bryn Farm.&apos;    Imported Meat.   My enquiries showed that the only supplies of imported meat of any consequence distributed in the district at the relevant time were frozen lamb from Australia, New Zealand andSouth America.     The first two are free from foot-and-mouth disease and can bo discounted.     Inquiry has shown that the butcher whosupplies the Bryn Farm household purchased his supplies of importedneat from the LLC. at Wrexham.     He had received, as well as NewZealand lamb, 113 carcases of frozen Argentine lamb.Throughout October, both frozen lamb and lamb bones for the^Pgs ware supplied to Bryn Farm by this butcher.     It has not beenPossible to establish whether these supplies were of New Zealand or-:rgontine origin.
10,    Disease on Bryn FafiPWfP^T^aod in pigs, two of which  -j Qgshowed older lesions than the others.     These were two gilfs&quot;whichhad been in the yard and in a field adjacent to the stockyard a weekbefore disease was reported.     Cattle were not affected at the timeof diagnosis nor when the stock was slaughtered, so that the diseasemust have originated in the pigs.11,   The owner did not feed swill to his pigs, but bones were fed tohis dogs and could have been carried into the yard or neighbouringfields where the gilts had been.     In fact the veterinary officersresponsible for slaughter and burial of the animals saw bones in the yard at the farm.     The owner stated that bones were boiled and fedto the dogs but did not claim that this was always done effectively.12.    It was not possible to establish conclusively that importedfrozen lamb carried foot-and-mouth disease virus to the farm, but asall other generally recognised sources of infection had beeneliminated, it remained the most probable vector.Qjkgr...Cases in the Epidemic13.    Undoubtedly a majority of the subsequent cases in the epidemicwere the result of local spread by various means including perhapsbirds and the wind.     However, a particularly worrying feature in thefirst four weeks of the epidemic was the large number of cases whichwere reported almost simultaneously over a wide area.     There hadbeen no movement of animals, and stock owners were generally reportingtheir suspicions very soon after clinical signs became apparent.This strongly suggested the possibility that several primary casesoccurred at about the same time.     Here again there is a possiblelink with the imported frozen lamb carcases.H.    The carcases of Argentine lamb received by the butcher whosupplied Bryn Farm were part of a consignment of 770 frozen lambcarcases which had been despatched from Establishment 1408 in thel-rgentine and arrived at Wrexham on 25th August.     The remainder ofv,se 770 carcases were distributed over a wide area around Wrexham,lnp Udmg deliveries to Ellesmere, Shrewsbury, Prees, Market Drayton,--antwich and Chester&apos;. This is the area of the greatest concentra-^    n of infection in the first fourweeksof the epidemic.     BecauseCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthese carcases had been distributed it was not possible to take anysamples for examination.     Samples were taken from other lambcarcases from the Argentine and the resultswore negative. 104-15,    Other consignments of lamb carcases from Establishment 1408have been traced.     The groat weight of distribution was inNottingham, the West Midlands and London (which also supplied lambto the West Midlands) 5    smaller quantities wore, however, supplied-to the Southampton-Portsmouth district,; Bristol and South Wales,and Newcastle.16.   At a subsequent stage in the epidemic new unexplained foci of disease cropped up as far east as Lincoln and as far south as Brandonnear Coventry, all during a period of a complete standstill on animalmovements.     On some of these farms a connection has been established with frozen lamb from Establishment 14-08, but in no case is therestrong evidence that this lamb was responsible for the outbreak.Some examples are given in the Appendix,17.    Inquiries as to the possible origin of infection are continuingin two outbreaks, and the distribution of the meat is being examined in areas where it was sold, apparently without causing foot-and-mouth disease infection.18,    The only type of virus isolated in this epidemic was 0.1.It is known that this type of virus is present in South America, butit has not been possible to ascertain the situation regarding foot-and-mouth disease in sheep and the prevalent types of virus in thearea which supplies Establishment 1408.     It is known from returnsmade by the Argentine authorities that foot-and-mouth disease occursin the exporting area concerned but the returns do not distinguish between cattle and sheep.  nclosion% conclusions on the origin of the epidemic ares(i)     I have been unable to discover any possible source of the infection except Argentine lamb.4CON FIDE MT1AL
John ReidChief Veterinary Officer7th February, 1968(ii)   Although there is not conclusive evidence thatArgentine lamb was the source, I am of the opinionthat there is sufficient circumstantial evidencefor concluding that this lamb was the cause of the initial case on Bryn Farm and some of the subsequentcases.
