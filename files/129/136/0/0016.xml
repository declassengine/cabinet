142SDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)Ci6.8l.53_6th March, 1968COPY N00CABINETNATIONAL LOTTERYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExcheguerThe purpose of this memorandum is to seek the views of mycolleagues on three related questions(a) Whether as a matter of principle the Government shouldsponsor a National Lottery,,(b) The application of the proceeds,(c) The tactics for pursuing the idea furthera2,     The Home Affairs Committee have already given preliminary consideration to this subject, and the following summary takes accountof the views expressed at their meeting on 1st March,(a)   The^p^in^jp^jjf^ J^ationalJ^ottsryj30     Many other countries operate National Lotteries successfully andraise substantial revenues from thern for general Exchequer purposes.In this country it has been felt in the past that it would be wrong for theGovernment to take an initiative in sponsoring or approving a NationalLottery because this would cause disproportionate offence to importantsections of the community who object to lotteries on sincerely heldmoral grounds;  several attempts by Private Members Bills toestablish National Lotteries have therefore been frustrated by governments in recent years,4,     There are indications however that a growing majority of thepublic would now positively welcome a National Lottery.    On the most recent occasion for testing Parliamentary opinion - the National LotteryBill promoted by Mr. James Tinn - the Government spokesman did not oppose the principle of a Lottery but invited the House of Commons freelyto express a view on it; Second Reading was approved by 69 votes to 17,5.     The main arguments to consider are as follows s-There would still be strong criticism of a NationalLottery on moral groundss particularly in Scotlandand Wales,    Such criticism might carry less weighthowever if it were seen that the basic decision hadbeen taken by a large majority in Parliament on a free vote.
45Promoting a National Lottery might appear toconflict with the Governments policy underlying the present Gaming Bill.    But this Bill does notpurport to pronounce on the morality of gambling,only to prevent abuses,,In the Budget context a National Lottery might be criticised as an attempt to escape from ser5.ouseconomic difficulties by an irrelevant fiscal device.On the other hand many people would regard aNational Lottery as a popular means of raisingrevenue, preferable to the alternatives of even higher taxation.(b)   Application of proceeds6.     Most proposals for a National Lottery include hypothecating thenet proceeds to specific areas of expenditure, for example sportymedical research, hospitals generally, etc..    Traditionally theGovernment is opposed to su.ch hypothecation on the grounds that itconflicts with the rational ordering of expenditure priorities in line with resources and real needs j  it could also create prob3.ems ofParliamentary control over Supply.    It could be objectionable to buildinto a National Lottery a special position for say sport, as a priorclaim on our national resourcess independently of the claims of otherdesirable programmes, and to make the level of expenditure on sportheavily dependent or. the vagaries of lottery performance from year to year (with the added risk that the Exchequer might have to make goodany occasional shortfall in perfcrmance),7.     To hypothecate or not presents a dilemma,,      On the one hand it is clear that many supporters of a National Lottery attach greatimportance to raising money for expenditure purposes which are not primarily a Government responsibility or which are not otherwisesufficiently catered for by public finance.    Such hypothecation might also help to divert criticism of a National Lottery generally, and itcould also give the Lottery a sales appeal,,     On the other hand a NationalLottery would be an expensive undertaking, making demands on tftaffand other resources in the public sector, and possibly involving theGovernment in continuing controversy, and it would therefore be unreasonable to embark on such a venture unless there were asubstantial direct benefit to public revenues.    A second difficulty isthat there would be big problems of allocating and controllingexpenditure on fringe activities given the way in which the developmentof longer term public expenditure programmes and the allocation of resources is handled.8.     Views on this dilemma could be influenced by the likely scale ofa National Lottery!s operations.    The most optimistic guess,, basedon performance of gambling habits in other countries, puts the netproceeds, after prizes and expenses, at  50 million a year.    It is assumed that much of this yield would reflect an alternative toincidental consumer spending., rather than a diversion from other forms of savings, though there might be some diversion from national savings which the Exchequer would have to make good by additionalborrowing.    It is unthinkable that a large part of such a sum could befound worthwhile employment on secondary programmes, especially when so many other painful decisions are having to be taken to restrainpublic expenditure.(iii)
144a National Lottery should go direct to the Exchequer,    Further study isrequired of the scope for and degree of any hypothecation, and themechanics of it, and I would welcome the views of other Ministers on theneed for this,(c)   T^ct^^fo^thejae^^s^ge10,     If it were decided in principle to set up a National Lottery,, a careful study would have to be made of the detailed terms and theadministration, and there would have to be legislation,    It would not inany event be possible to begin actual lottery operations until some timein 1969 at the earliest.    But it would be unwise to begin this more detailed work before it was clear that the principle of a National Lotterycommanded broad acceptance.    I suggest, therefore, that we use theopportunity of the Finance Bill this year to test Parliamentary opinion by a free vote on the principle; this could be achieved by including inthe Bill a clause to remove the present legal obstacle in the way of running a National Lottery.    If acceptance of the principle were confirmed in this way., there would be a need for separate additional legislation inthe next Session,11,     In the meantime the further stages of Mr, Tinnss Bi?l have to bedealt with.    This Bill is unsatisfactory in a number of respects, but itwould be difficult to obstruct it on purely technical grounds,    I wouldlike to seek to negotiate its withdrawal however by indicating to thesponsors that a Government proposal will be submitted to Parliamentshortly, and by assuring its sponsors (without entering into any commit-ment) that we are giving very careful consideration to the arguments infavour of some measure of hypothecation of the revenues of a NationalLottery.R e c onimendation12,     I recommend agreement in principle to the Governmentsponsoring a National Lottery, subject to a further testing ofParliamentary opinion through a free vote on a suitable clause in thisyearcs Finance Bill,    Subject also to the views of my colleagues Iwould propose to examine further the possibilities of earmarking alimited part of the net proceeds of a Lottery for expenditure ondesirable activities which are not likely to be adequately catered for in public expenditure programmes in the foreseeable future.R0 H, J.Treasury Chambers, S. W, 1,5th March, 1968-3-SECRET9,     I regard it as desirable that a large part of the net proceeds of
