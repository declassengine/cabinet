THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT)C(68) 40 COPY NO.23rd February, 1968CABINETTECHNOLOGICAL COLLABORATION WITH EUROPEAFTER THE VETONote by the Minister of TechnologyI circulate for my colleagues&quot; consideration the attached paper on Technological Collaboration with Europe after the Veto, which hasbeen prepared by the Official Committee on the Approach to Europe.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1.23rd February, 1968
TECHNOLOGICAL COLLABORATION WITH EUROPEAFTER THE VETONote by 0fficlals1 ,     This memorandum examines the scope for technologicalcollaboration (excluding defence) in Europe in the post-vetosituation, taking account of the recent Benelux initiative and theGerman proposals.     The purpose of this paper is to examine theextent to which it would be practicable and advantageous for the uk to press forward with the proposals which the Prime Minister putforward in his Guildhall speech of 13th November 1967, and inparticular to introduce them into any discussions with the Five orthe Six which may develop out of the Benelux proposals.2.     In considering the technological aspects of the benelux proposals (and this applies even more to the Franco-German declara-tion of 16th February) the most critical uncertainty is the likelyattitude of the Governments of France and Germany,  the major industrial countries of Western Europe, and the only european countries which can approach the UK generally in their scale ofindustry.     The attitude of the French Government is likely to behostile to any proposals which might seem to advance the cause ofthe UK application for admission to the e.c., whilst the german attitude towards any proposals which are made,  even if openlyfriendly, might in practice prove to be no more than lukewarm in face of French antipathy.3.     On the other hand, France has a considerable interest in thedevelopment of European technological and industrial integration.Even if there is an element of tactics in public statements on thissubject by French Ministers, it will not be easy for France to stand out from European co-operation in this field if it is seen to&quot;be likely to lead to action.     As Mr. Schumann said on 18th January&quot;The very definition of a policy for scientific and technical co-operation is a policy of unrestricted openness and consequentlycan be applied to every country ...... I personally believe, andno doubt the French Government thinks, that it is not necessary to wait for the opening of negotiations /for British membership ofthe Communities/ to pursue or set in motion all forms and allpossible themes on technological co-operation.&quot;     If it became clear that progress in the scientific and technological fieldswould not be possible on a basis restricted to the Six member countries, France!s attitude to co-operation on a wider basis couldwell be positive.      Even if France&apos;s attitude were to prove- 1 -
reticent, that of Germany would, not necessarily be the sameparticularly if the co-operation and common action to which wecould ;leclge ourselves were seen to offer a worthwhile objective for germany.k.     Ministers of the Six Community countries decided in Luxembourgon 31st October that a study should be made of the possibility ofco-operation in certain specific scientific and technologicalfields (see paragraph k below)  and envisaged the possibility ofother European States participating in this co-operation.      Sincethe French veto on our entry into the Community, the Italian, dutch and Belgian Governments have for the moment refused to pursue workon the decision of the Ministers of the Six of 31st October.      TheNetherlands&apos; Foreign Minister in particular is anxious to reservework in this field for pursuit under the Benelux proposals.   Aslong as there is a possibility of achieving this, and so of ensuring our participation on a basis of equality, it would be incur interest that this work should be transferred from the Communityframework to that of the Benelux proposals.     But in case it lateremerges that this transfer is not possible, we should want to keep: open the possibilities of co-operating with the Six on the workbegun under the 31 st October decision.5.     The Prime Minister&apos;s seven point programme for establishing a european Technological Community was put forward as an integral part of our application to join e.c..      with the prospect of member-ship deferred, a decision to press forward as far as practicablewith arrangements for technological collaboration means departing from this prior condition and therefore removes a negotiatingcounter.     On the other hand,  it would enable some progress to bemade in demonstrating not only the reality of the concept of theEuropean Technological Community but also the inescapable limita-tions on its full realisation while we are outside the Community,s Moreover, action now not only helps keep the concept alive, butconfirms the UK conviction that there is an urgent need for action if Europe is to preserve that necessary degree of industrialI independence and competitiveness in a world dominated by the giantUS corporations.6.     There is a more immediate reason for pressing forward.     WeI are inevitably closely linked to Europe by industry and trade andthe European market will feature more largely in our future tradepattern:.     For this reason technological collaboration will be advantageous to us even while we are outside the Community, to the, extent that it facilitates trade and industrial collaboration
although the benefits would of course be greater if we were members.     It is against this general background that the varioussteos towards increased European technological collaboration areexamined, with particular regard to the economic benefits for the uk.(a) Inter-Governmental Projects7.     The Governments of Western Europe are already associated ininter-governmental projects such as ELDO and CERN and the Dragonreactor programme.     On the whole these projects have provedexpensive, offering little promise of immediate economic returnand national rather than European considerations have dominatedthe development of these projects, although to various degrees theGovernments still attach considerable importance to these programmes.This is not an area in which it seems at all likely that we should wish to take new initiatives.     Ministers have in fact, decided,but not announced, that the UK will not undertake any further financial commitment to ELDO or participate in the proposedEuropean experiments in telecommunications satellites or join inthe proposed very large new CERN accelerator.     Because there isto be a Ministerial Conference on space policy in Bonn, in June ofthis year,   which is to be preceded by meetings of the Alternatesin March and April,  it will hardly be possible to delay theannouncement of our decisions on the space projects beyond April,at the latest.      The question of tactics for disengagement from theproposed CERN project is still under consideration.     As regardsthe Dragon reactor, which is the only European technologicalproject in the UK, the Euratorn countries have been unable tocontinue their contributions this year, and we are meeting the shortfall for one year only, after which tAis will lapse as a jointproject unless the others are in a position to pay.8.     The decision of the Ministers of the Six on 31st October 1967called for a report by 1st March 1 968 on the possibility ofco-operation in data processing and telecommunications;    develop-ment of new means of transport;    oceanography;    metallurgy;    waterpollution and noise prevention;    meterology;    and to eamine thepossibility of co-operation in other fields.     Work was also to becontinued on methods of creating a Community system of handlingand exchanging technical information,  and of ensuring co-ordina-tion of training and exchange of scientists.      These reports areto study ways in which other European states might participate inco-operation.     But if the outcome of these studies or other likeproposals were to be to embark on multinational projects, our
COOTTOEWJIALattitude should be that each should be considered on its merits,taking account of the size of the probable UK contribution and of whether the resulting benefit to the UK would be commensurate withthe effort.(b) Bilateral Projects9,     There are a number of sectors of advanced technology in whichit is difficult for the existing individual European countries toestablish and maintain major competitive industries withoutlicensing or other arrangements with the United States force  -operation with the United Kingdom.      The main examples arenuclear energy, computers and aerospace.     These are at the sametime industries which are dependent either wholly or to a verylarge extent on Governments as both customers and providers of thefinance required for research and development.      They are therefore the obvious sectors of industry to examine for possible majorcollaborative projects whether on a Government to Government or a mixed Government/private industry basis.     A number of such pro-jects have of course already been started - notably with Prance -in the aircraft fiedd. There is a need to avoid prestigiousprojects.     The essential test here is that the project is well founded and that collaboration in research and production islinked with appropriate procurement policies in support of theindustrial effort.10.   If the British Government were able to stimulate collabora-tive industrial projects of this kind which were of economic value to ourselves as well as to other countries in Western Europe, notforgetting the members of EFTA, it would certainly underline theneed for the development of large-scale European companies,,.(c) Private Industry11.   There are important sectors which are subject to direct government influence but large parts of industry are not directlysusceptible to such influence and the development of Europeancollaboration is the outcome of managers&apos;  decisions in individual companies taken on the basis of an assessment of the commercialadvantage.     A number of these companies - ICI, Unilever,Courtaulds, Dunlop for example - are in a very real sense alreadywithin the Common Market as are many American companies.     but while the establishment of United Kingdom subsidiaries within theCommunity - and Community subsidiaries in the United Kingdom -may be commercially necessary and profitable to the companies concerned, it does not lead us measurably nearer to a.concentrated,continental scale industry.
12.     There may be considerable scope for integration and develop-ment on a European basis between British and continental companiesparticularly in those sectors of industry where the c cave of research, development, servicing and marketing are exceptionally heavy - for example electronics, motor vehicles, machine tools.But the development of new European corporations, and arrangementsfor joint marketing or other forms of collaboration betweenexisting companies in Europe, must clearly be worked out by thecompanies concerned.     The Government might, however, stimulateprivate industry in this country to give more attention to suchpossibilities;    and in so far as other European Governments couldbe persuade! to follow suit, a basis for European-scale integrationor collaboration might be established.    This is, however, a process which will take time to develop and in the meantime exchange controlimposes a limit on the extent to which UK firms can develop adynamic policy, and they are not likely to do so fully until weare are admitted to the Common Market and there is an evidentconcerted effort to achieve a full Economic Union.      The proposedTechnological Institute could do some valuable preparatory workhere in creating a climate of industrial opinion and in definingsome of the steps necessary to achieve industrial integration ona European scale.(d) A European Technological Institute13.     One of the initiatives we could take would be to propose toother Governments the desirability and practicability of setting upa European Institute of Technology.     There has already been someexploratory discussions by the CBI with some of their correspondingorganisations in Europe and they report that the reception has beer-favourable.     There has also been evidence of interest on the partof other European Governments.     There are a number of ways inwhich this concept could be developed.     The Minister of Technologywill shortly be reporting to the Cabinet on the results of hisexploratory talks with the CBI and. the TUC.      The main role of sucha European Institute or Centre could in the early days be to review the current state of technological progress in some Europeanindustries which seemed likely to be of major importance to europe&apos;s industrial future.      It would proceed, probably     throughthe establishment of expert groups to survey such industries, makeforecasts of the future development, indicate appropriate actionto remedy deficiencies and to accelerate progress.     Prom suchinvestigations, carried out with the full co-operation of industryand governments, there would emerge programmes of action, whetherby governments or by industries, designed to assure the realisation
of Europe&apos;s technological potentialities.      Such studies would heof value now and for the- years ahead.1k.     It is desirable to press forward with firm proposals to other european Governments, to gauge the degree of support for them andto discuss their Ideas on the form and functions of such anInstitute,     The later stages will depend on the nature of the response, but in the exploratory discussions between Governments -which would be pursued by HMG in the context of the benelux proposals - it would be necessary to keep in touch with the CBI whowill be pursuing related discussions with European industrial organisations on the European Technological Institute.(e) The Creation of a European,Industrial Environment orX^ras^trjactiire15.     Up to now the European Community has made virtually no progress in developing a co-ordinated industrial policy and only recently has the e.c. begun to move on the conditions necessary tobring into being a EuroT^ean economic union which will form asuitable framework within which a European industrial soc-iety could develop.     Some of the elements of such a society would only bemeaningful for the UK if we were part of the Community, e .g.harmonisation of taxation systems and social changes and regional policies, but other aspects would benefit us even while outside and could be pursued on a wider basis than the Six:    e,g&apos;, standards,patents, company lav/.      It is in the field of Standards that mostprogress is being made, with UK participation.     This work shouldbe pushed ahead as quickly as possible, in the general interest ofour exporteffort in Europe,      Its value persists whether or not weare members of the Community.     it is therefore important that no damage should be done to existing arrangements on standards and we need to keep up the momentum.     Work on Patents is important too inprogress towards achievement of our economic aims, whether or not we are members of the Community, if a common system can be devised which is applicable to non-members of e.c..    There would be advantagetoo in establishing consultation on Company Law, as suggested inthe Benelux proposals,  in particular the possibilities of realisingthe legal concept of a European Company,(f) The Role of the CBI and TUC&quot;16.     In any such forward programme it would be necessary to keep inclose touch with the leaders of the CBI and of the TUC.      They willbe in touch with their corresponding organisations in Europe.   TheyWill be able to explore national thought at the industrial level onthe conditions for and obstacles to the development of a European
industrial society of which UK could he a part even while outsidethe Community,     Reference has already been made to the role of the cbi of pursuing proposals for a Technological Institute with theirEuropean counterparts.Conclusion17.     The prospect of early membership of e.c. would have givenimmediate purpose and drive to the achievement of the technologicalobjectives set out by the Prime Minister.     Nevertheless, the benelux proposals offer a promising alternative way of pursuingthose objectives which remain valid in present circumstances.    Itis therefore recommended that, having welcomed and accepted the benelux initiative, we should generally press forward with proposals for technological collaboration with the countries ofEurope, whether on a bilateral or multilateral basis, whetherthrough governments or through firms, wherever it is judged in our economic interests to do so even while we are outside the e.c..In particular it is recommended:(a) We should endeavour to see that the exploratory studiesbeing undertaken by the Six in pursuance of the decisionof 31st October 19&amp;7 are now pursued in the context ofthe Benelux proposals;    but if this is not possible, weshould seek alternative ways of associating with them,(para.A )(b) Any proposals for multilateral projects should bescrutinised closely, the scale and timing of the benefitsbeing related to the contribution required from the UK(para.8)(c) A similar close scrutiny should be adopted towardsbilateral projects,  involving substantial government expenditure although mainly undertaken through private firms, but in some areas (e.g. computers, aerospace,nuclear power) this may be the only way to translateour research investment into a commercial return and to preserve an effective industrial capability in face ofthe pressure of US competition.      It will normally benecessary to link joint research development and production efforts with procurement commitments (para.9) -(d) rivate industry should be encouraged to develop its links with European enterprises.      There may be scope forintegration, expansion and mergersjand genorally encourage a trend in the direction of companies organised on a european basis (para. 12),
(e) We should embark on exploratory discussions with other-European Governments to attract support for the proposalfor a European Technological Institute or Centre (parajh).(f) In accordance with the Benelux proposals we should pushforward with the work on European standards and systems of quality specification and control, with work on patents,and we should be ready to explore the possibilities ofrealising the concept of a European Company (para. 15)-(g) The CBI and the TUG should be encouraged to keep in close contact with their- corresponding organisation in western europe and stimulate discussion of the means by whichEuror^ean technological collaboration can be more fully, ifnecessarily imperfectly, realised even while we are stillexcluded from the Community (per a, 1 6) . i
