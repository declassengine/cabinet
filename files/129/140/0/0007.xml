11 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 713th January, 1969COPY NO.CABINETINDUSTRIAL. RELATIONS;  DRAFT WHITE PAPER:THE.CONCILIATION PAUSE PROPOSALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Paymaster GeneralThe minutes of the Ministerial Committee on industrial relations (IR(69) 5th Meeting Minutes) record disagreement ona key passage in the draft White Paper.    It may be convenient for our colleagues in the Cabinet to have a- note focusing on thispoint and indicating the amendment which would in our view meetthe difficulty to which v/e have drawn attention, without detriment to the basic substance of the White Paper proposals.b 02,       The White Paper as now drafted goes some way towards meetingpoints raised in earlier discussion about the &quot;conciliation pause&quot;,particularly as regards clarification of the role of the IndustrialBoard and of its discretion in the imposition of fines.    But the changes made do not dispose of the basic anxiety indicated in the paymaster General&apos;s memorandum of 8th January (C(69) 3, paragraphs 5-6).    At present we have grave doubts whether the proposed power toenforce a pause can either be presented credibly or prove workable inpractice.    An announced decision at this juncture to enact it come what may in the teeth of widespread trade union opposition may well becounter-productive - from more than one point of view.3,      We therefore invite our colleagues to consider once againwhether further time should not be taken (the relevant legislationnot being envisaged anyv/ay before 1970) to persuade the trade union movement to offer an adequate alternative to a pause-enforcing power.The Y/hite Paper could make clear the Governments determination that machinery for a conciliation pause must be established;  it could also make clear that in the absence of a credible alternative it will feelcompelled to take a power on the lines described;  but by showingwilling to (at least) examine alternatives it would provide a betterbasis than the present draft for hoping that whatever course iseventually adopted will be accepted as necessary, and thereforemore likely to be respected in operation, by the movement andthe public at large.

44      For these reasons, we propose the following amendment:Delete from the end of paragraph 96 of the draft White Paperattached to C(69) 6 (paragraph 98 of the draft White Paper attached toIR(69) 4(Revise)) the sentence:&quot;Nonetheless the trade union movement should make it clear howit will discharge the obligation referred to in its statement if itrejects all other alternatives for dealing with a problem it hasitself recognised&quot;.Substitute (but as a fresh paragraph):&quot;The Government recognise that this proposal has serious andwide-ranging implications for all citizens and in particular for the trades union movement.    They intend to discuss itsdetails further with all the interests concerned.    In the courseof these discussions they will be prepared to examine carefullyany alternative proposals which may be put forward, providedthat these accept the principle that in one way or another an effective machinery for securing a conciliation pause in suitable cases must be established as soon as practicable.    If no adequate alternative proposals are forthcoming they will feel bound to proceed on the lines described&quot;.R., K. o. G.Department of Health and Social Security, S.E.I.13th January, 1969
