C(69) 213rd March, 1969CABINETTHE RELEASE OF OFFICIAL, INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Prime minister the Report of the Fulton Committee on the Civil Service made anumber of observations under the headings &quot;Consultation and Gecrecy&quot;and &quot;The Anonymity of Civil Servants&quot;.    An extract of these is at annex A.2,       There has recently been pressure in Parliament for an enquiry&quot;to make recommendations for getting rid of unnecessary secrecy&quot;, asproposed by the Fulton Committee,    A public speech by the Leader ofthe Opposition on 7th January took a similar line.    He has howeveradded the associated questions - from the Press point of view - of the law/ of libel, and committal for contempt.    Since then he has announced the appointment of a Commission heavily packed with Pressrepresentatives and lawyers who have mainly taken up a particularattitude on one or more of these three questions.    I have told parliament that I am considering the whole question of the release of official information, including the Official Secrets Acts.    I do not think that,in view of the public pressure, it will be reasonable to defer a decisionon the setting up of an enquiry for very much longer.    In this paper,therefore, I consider the main implications of agreeing to set up suchanC enquiry and the form that it might take.3,       The basic issue here is the provision to the public of more information about the workings of Government.    Also relevant arethe questions whether the Official Secrets Acts need to be amended,and whether the convention of anonymity on the part of civil servantsshould be further relaxed; but I think it is right to regard these asconsequential to the principal question how far we should publish more information.4.       The major implication of setting up a Committee from outsidethe Government service to enquire into this matter is that it invitesthem to advise how far the working of the machinery of Governmentshould be disclosed to the public.    We are free at present to issue as much or as little information about this as we choose.    The official secrets Acts do not inhibit us, because they bar only the release of-1-COPY NO.mDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC I,iAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

official information without authority - and it is inconceivable that any government should, by agreeing to the indiscriminate release of informationgive up control of its own machine.    The enquiry should therefore be concerned with what disclosures should be authorised:  the Acts areconcerned with the results of unauthorised disclosure,5,       There has been an increasing trend to publish official materialabout Departmental organisation and processes, and also some of thefactual information on which policy decisions have been based - notably in Green Papers,    And I feel sure that we could, with advantage,publish more of this.    For example, I think we could go further in informing people about the responsibilities of senior officials.The main limitations in many cases seem to be the extent of publicinterest in the subject matter, and of the additional Civil Service staff that we can agree to make available for preparing such material for publication.6.       But the main public interest is, I think, not so much in thoserelatively uncontroversial fields as in the disclosure of the considerations affecting policy decisions which have yet to be reached.     This brings us into an area of difficulty, because policy decisions not only take accountof objective considerations based on facts and statistics but also reflectsubjective judgments on such other questions as the influence of other relevant commitments and the likely reactions of a variety of interests which stand to be affected by the decision.    It is extremely difficult to lay down in advance what are the circumstances in which full publicity  /on these matters would or would not be expedient.    We can, no doubt,all think of circumstances in which it would not:  so we must recognisesome risk that an outside enquiry would produce general recommenda-   -tions for greater publicity about policy considerations which it would bedifficult to reject in principle but which, if applied in particular cases,could embarrass the process of Governmental decision-making,7.       From this point of view, it would be convenient to regard thequestion of releasing more official information as basically one of policy for ourselves to settle, with the help of such advice as we need from within the Government service.    But I judge that to dispose of the Fultonrecommendation in this way would not satisfy Parliament, the Press andthe public.    I have therefore given thought to the form and scope thatwould be appropriate to an outside enquiry into this matter.8.       The terms of reference should in my view be as at Annex B,The following safeguards seem to me necessary:-(a)    Information which is affected by considerations of national securityought to be excluded from the scope of this enquiry,    I believe that thereis a case for asking whether we at present try to protect too much official information by our security procedures, and I propose to arrange for this to be examined through the Government machinery.     It is not in my view a suitable subject for an outside enquiry.

(b) The enquiry should be specifically concerned with the release ofinformation &quot;to the public&quot;.    This would exclude consideration of thespecial problems of giving information to such bodies as the courts,Select Committees, the Parliamentary Commissioner and otherCommissions such as the R.oskill inquiry on the Third London Airport,and selected academic researchers,(c) Consideration of e.ny amendment of the Official Secrets Actsshould be confined to what might be required to implement theCommitteels recommendations on the release of information.Any wider review of the Acts (which, as paragraph 4 points out,are concerned v/ith the consequences of unauthorised disclosure)would tend to prejudice the already limited safeguards against improperleakages of information.    It would also take the enquiry directly into thesecurity field (see (a) above).(d) Similarly, I should wish to limit consideration of any change inthe existing rules governing the conduct of civil servants to what mightbe required to give effect to the Committee1 s other recommendations.This was the approach of the Fulton Committee in paragraph 280 oftheir Report,    AruAto embark on a full review of the convention of&quot;anonymity&quot; could lead to recommendations which would involve a fundamental modification of the whole ethos of the Civil Service and bring into question its non-political character.(e) In announcing the appointment of the Fulton Committee, I made clear the assumption that the existing relationship between ministers and their official advisers should be maintained.    In a statement onthe setting up of this new enquiry, I should wish to say that the sameassumption would govern it,9.       To sum up, I think it right that my colleagues should be aware of the implications of asking an outside committee to advise theGovernment on this matter; but I consider that the balance of advantagelies in setting up such a body, provided that its terms of reference are limited in the way I have proposed,    I invite the Cabinet, to agree withthis conclusion and to take note that I shall in due course make astatement to the House of Commons,10,      So far I have dealt only with the question of the release of official information and associated questions of the Official SecretsActs0    I should welcome the views of my colleagues on the extensionof the terms of reference to cover the other issues I have mentioned,the law of libel and committal for contempt.    Alternately, mycolleagues may consider that these questions - if they are held tobe proper and urgent matters for enquiry - should be handled in otherways.K.

ANNEXAExtract from the Report of the Committee on theCivil Service (The Fulton Committee)  (Cmnd. 3638)CONSULTATION AND SECRECY277.   We think that the administrative process is surrounded by too much secrecy.    The public interest would be better served if therewere a greater amount of openness.    The increasingly wide range of problems handled by government, and their far-reaching effects uponthe community as a wholes demand the widest possible consultation withits different parts and interests.    We believe that such consultation isnot only necessary in itself but will also improve the quality of theultimate decisions and increase the general understanding of their purpose.278,   We welcome the trend in recent years towards -wider and moreopen consultation before decisions are taken?   and we welcome, too,the increasing provision of the detailed information on which decisions are made.     Both should be carried much further; it is healthy for ademocracy increasingly to press to be consulted and informed.    Thereare still too many occasions where information is unnecessarily with-held and consultation merely perfunctory.     Since government decisionsaffect all of us in so many aspects of our lives, consultation should beas wide as possible and should form part of the normal processes of decision--making.    It is an abuse of consultation when it is turned intoa belated attempt to prepare the ground for decisions that have in reality been taken already,279.   We recognise that there must always be an element of secrecy(not simply on grounds of national security) in administration and policy-making.    At the formative stages of policy-making, civil servants no less than Ministers should be able to discuss and disagree among them-eelves about possible courses of action, without danger of their individual views becoming a matter of public knowledge; it is difficultto see how on any other basis there can be mutual trust betweencolleagues and proper critical discussion of different hypotheses.    Butthe material, and some of the analyses, on whicn these policy discussions are going forward, fall into a different category; unless there are over-riding considerations to the contrary (e. g. on grounds of national security, the confidential nature of information supplied by individual firms, or to prevent improper financial gain), there would be positiveadvantages all round if such information were made available to thepublic at the formative stage of policy-making.

280.   Civil servants, and perhaps also Ministers, are apt to give great and sometimes excessive wieght to the difficulties and problems whichwould undoubtedly arise from more open processes of administration and policy-making.     In this connection, therefore, we wish to draw attention to practice in Sweden.    At the formative stages of policy-making, there is wide and prolonged consultation, which normallytakes the form of setting up a committee of inquiry; its report isgenerally published; the report and the public discuesion that followsare then a major part of the basis on which the Minister has to come toa decision.    In addition, all files of any administrative office (inSwedish terminology * ministries and agencies) are open to the press and the public if not declared secret on grounds of military security,good international relations or for the protection of individuals named in them (e. g, because they may contain criminal or medical records);when policy decisions are in preparation, however, working material is not made available for public use,    Tfeis shows that opengovernment is possible; we suggest that the Government should set up an inquiry to make recommendations for getting rid of unnecessarysecrecy in this country.    Clearly, the Official Secrets Acts would need to beincluded in such a review.    Seme restrictions on the objective of&quot;open decisions openly arrived at&quot; will doubtless remain necessary;but a mature democracy rightly demands that they should be kept to the absolute minimum.    The fuller the information, the closer the links between government (both Ministers and civil servants) and thecommunity; and the smaller the gap of frustration and misunderstandingbetween &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;.THE ANONYMITY OF CIVIL SERVANTS283.   The argument of the preceding paragraphs has important implications for the traditional anonymity of civil servants.    It is,already being eroded by Parliament and to a mrae limited extent bythe pressures of the Press, radio and television; the process willoontinue and we see no reason to seek to reverse it.     Indeed we  hinkthat administration suffers from the convention, which is still aliye inmany fields, that only the Minister should explain issues in public and what his department is or is not doing about them.    This convention has dependad in the past on the assumption that the doctrine of ministerial responsibility means that a Minister has full detailedknowledge and control of all the activities of his department.    this assumption is no longer tenable.    The Minister and his junior Ministerscannot know all that is going on in his department, nor can they nowadaysbe present at every forum where legitimate questions are raised about its activities.    The consequence is that some of these questions gounanswered.    In our view, therefore the convention of anonymityshould be -modified and civil servants, as professional administrators,should be ,abie to go further than now in explaining what their departments are doing, at any rate so far as concerns managingexisting policies and implementing legislation.-5-

284*   We do not under-estimate the risks involved in such a change.It is often difficult to explain without also appearing to argue;however impartially one presents the facts, there will always be thosewho think that the presentation is biased.    It would be unrealistic to suppose that a civil servant will not sometimes drop a brick andembarrass his Minister.    We believe that this will have to be faced andthat Ministers and MPs should take a tolerant view of the civil servantwho inadvertently steps out of line.    On balance we think it best not tooffer any specific precepts for the progressive relaxation of theconvention of anonymity.    It should be left to develop gradually andpragmatically, though the inquiry we have recommended inparagraph 280 above amy well result in specific recommendations onthis closely related prcblem.     The further it develops, the closer the links between the Service and the community.-6-

ANNEX BCommittee on the Release of Official InformationTerms of ReferenceTo review the extent to which official information not affected by considerations of national security isalready made available to the public, and to advisehow far the provision of such information should beincreased.To advise whether, as a consequence of any changes in existing practice that may be proposed under (1), itwould be necessary:-(a) to amend the Official Secrets Acta;or(b) to change the existing rules governing the conductof Civil Servants.-7-
