THE REORGANISATION OF THE PORTS; DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Minister of transport i was invited (CC(68) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4) to submit adraft &quot;White Paper on the reorganisation of the ports when outstanding questions of policy had been settled,    Miy proposals are incorporated in the attached draft White Paper, which has now been approved by theParliamentary Committee,Hybr idity2,       Whilst it is not possible to give a cast-iron assurance until afinal draft of the Bill dealing with this complex industry has beenprepared, I have every reason to believe that, provided suitableprecautions are taken, a Bill can be drafted to give effect to theproposals as presented in the White Paper which will not be hybrid.The scope of the proposals-3.       Those harbours in which the great bull; of our trade is handledwould be placed under the proposed National Ports Authority (NPA) onthe vesting day, and there would be provision for subsidiary authoritiesto be established, under a scheme of organisation prepared by the NPA,to be responsible for managing these harbours.    In addition, the NPAwould have powers to propose schemes for further takeovers of harbours,4,       The subsidiary authorities would ha the main be based on theprincipal estuaries.    They would, however, be of a near-regionalcharacter and, as explained in the White Paper, they would be encouraged to plan the developments called for by the needs ofthe regions, working in close consultation with the economic planning Councils.5.      An initial takeover of port operators&apos; businesses is notpossible on the vesting day:  it could be done only in a hybrid Bill,which would have small chance of being passed in this Parliament.But the takeovers can be achieved by placing a duty on the NPA toprepare and submit schemes within a year of the vesting day0 andthis is what I propose.J.JHSJJCCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 12 COPY NO.

6.       The White Paper contains proposals for ensuring that the NPAhas a dominant voice right from the start on employment matters in theindustry as a whole and that workers in the residual private sector arenot worse off than those in the nationalised sector.Discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer7.       The Chancellor and I have reached agreement on the tv/o pointswe were invited to discuss further when the White Paper was consideredby the Parliamentary Committee.    I do not now propose to say in theWhite Paper that we v/ill make loans available to assist the existingharbour authorities to buy up port operators&apos; businesses voluntarilywithout waiting for the new legislation;  but v/e will consider syrnpatheti-cally any individual cases where such an acquisition is judged to be inthe long-term interest of the NPA but no alternative means of financeis available,8.       The second point concerned the prospective financial situation of the NPA.    The National Ports Council (NPC) had estimated a deficit on revenue account of  7 million in the NP-A&apos;s first year, a figure which,however, must be treated with some reserve.    I intend to seek theco-operation of the NPC and the individual port managements concernedin a thorough study of possible ways of improving the situation beforethe vesting day.Compensation9.       Following precedent I am not circulating the compensationproposals in this draft of the White Paper,    The proposals havebeen agreed by the Prime Minister and Treasury Ministers and i will be ready to explain them, and the financial implications, to .my colleagues in Cabinet,Timetable10,       The Bill will be complex, as v/ill the task of implementation.It seems unlikely that the vesting day could be before the end of 1970,To achieve that we would have to introduce the Bill very early in the1969-70 Session, and the drafting of the Bill would need to beginstraightaway,    I should also aim to get as much as possible of thepreparatory work on implementation done in advance,    I see no advantage, however, in formally introducing the Bill this Session;it would have to start all over again next Session and v/e would notsave any time,11,       I invite my colleagues to approve the White Paper (subjectto one or tv/o minor drafting amendments).    I propose to arrangefor it to be published on Tuesday, 28th January, immediately after a statement by me in the Commons following Questions and a similar statement at the same time in the JLords,R.

The Governments intention to reorganise the ports on the basis of public ownership was stated in the White Paper on &quot; Transport Policy&quot;(Cinnd. 3057) presented to Parliament by the then Minister of Transport inJuly 1966, following the report of the Labour Party Study Group on thePort Transport Industry. Extensive consultations have since taken place between the Minister of Transport and the interests concerned, based on a working document issued by the Ministry in July 1967.The working document was put forward by the Government as a basis for discussion. Views on it were submitted by the Trades Union Congress,the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the unions mainly concerned with the ports, the Dock and Harbour Authorities&apos; Association, the Confederation ofBritish Industry, the British Shippers&apos; Council, the National Association of port Employers, the Chamber of Shipping, the National Dock Labour Board,the Economic Development Committee for the Movement of Exports, the regional Economic Planning Councils and over a hundred other interests.As the statutory adviser to the Minister, the National Ports Council was kept in touch with these consultations and this enabled its advice to take account of the points raised. Separate consultations took place with theinterests concerned with pilotage.This paper sets out the conclusions the Government has now reached andthe policy it proposes to pursue.(iv)SECRET

THE REORGANISATION OF THE PORTSINTRODUCTION1. At all levels of the ports industry it is accepted that the present structure of the industry is inadequate to ensure that the best possible service is provided to the nation. As long ago as 1962 the Rochdale Committee*concluded that the lack of any central planning reflected a fundamentaldefect of organisation and it highlighted a number of other changes needed.The National Ports Council set up following the Committee&apos;s report has done much, within its terms of reference, to improve matters, and theGovernment is grateful for the valuable contribution the Council has made.But experience has shown that the Rochdale Committee was right to conclude that &quot; a Council with purely advisory functions would not be sufficientlyeffective or influential to ensure that essential changes are brought about&quot;.The Government believes that a much more radical reorganisation even thanthat envisaged by the Rochdale Committee is needed., 2. The Government has concluded that to control and promote theimportant changes which are required a National Ports Authority should beestablished. The Authority must have power to determine the nature andshape of the British ports industry, whose efficiency is of fundamental importance to the economy and the life of the community. Such power canonly be entrusted to a body which has the discipline of knowing that it is fully responsible for the success or failure of its policies: this must meannational ownership.THE SCOPE OF REORGANISATIONThe priority task for a National Ports Authority3. The National Ports Authority will have an immense task to fulfil if itis to plan the future development and rationalisation of physical facilities,whilst at the same time adapting the organisation of work in the ports to modern needs. The first necessity is to enable the proposed new Authorityto concentrate resources and management on essentials.4. There are some 300 harbour authorities in Great Britain, with agreat variety in scale and scope of operation and in forms of organisation.Some harbours are used just for local needs by a few small coastal vesselsa year, or for recreation, and are of little national economic significance.Others cater for massive amounts of our international trade. Furthermore,the role of the harbour authority and the way in which work is organisedwithin harbours vary widely: for example, in some harbours the authorityprovides almost all the facilities, and carries out much of the cargo handlingwork; while in others it is little more than a conservancy authority.  There* Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Major Ports of Great Britain (Cmncl. 1824).1

is no simple or uniform pattern, and in some harbours, notably in the majorones like London and the Mersey, there is a great diversity of relationships,and of operational and employment arrangements.5. This complex industry faces major change: the use of larger ships,the introduction of rapid throughput facilities for bulk cargoes, thedevelopment of unit load techniques (notably containerisatiqn of generalcargo) and the growth of through transport. The impetus of change mustbe directed to ensure(a) that new investment and the rationalisation of facilities produce thebest services at the right places;(b) that the work of loading and unloading ships within each harbour is organised in the most efficient way and makes efficient use of modernfacilities.If these objectives are to be achieved, management too must be efficient andthere must be effective worker participation. At the same time, standards of employment and productivity must continue to improve.6. These changes will have the greatest impact in those harbours wherethe great bulk of our trade is handled. In fact, over nine-tenths of our overseas trade and over three-quarters of our coastal trade is concentrated on a number of large harbours together with those of the already nationalisedBritish Transport Docks Board. Without national ownership of this sectionof the industry the present diffusion and misdirection of resources willcontinue.7. Within each, of these important harbours a large measure of unifiedcontrol of operations will be needed in order to minimise costs and to increase efficiency. It is neither practicable nor necessary to take over port facilities which are controlled by manufacturers wholly or mainly for thetransport of their own goods or raw materials; and there may be caseswhere a business forms part of a through transport system which it wouldbe undesirable to split up. But general stevedoring and similar activitiesneed to be concentrated to a much greater extent in the hands of the harbourauthority itself.8. Thus, the assumption of responsibility for these major harbours andthe general stevedoring and similar activities within them is the first priority.It will present a substantial but manageable first task for a new nationalAuthority. The take-over of the major harbour undertakings will be supplemented by the continuation of the Ministers power under the HarboursAct, 1964, to control major harbour developments costing more thanmillion. This will provide means of ensuring that investment in non--nationalised harbours does not conflict with the national interest.The harbour undertakings to be taken over9. The initial reorganisation will be on the following lines. The national ports Authority, acting through subsidiary port authorities to be established under the arrangements set out in paragraph 19 below, will replace the2

British Transport Docks Board and, with the exceptions mentioned inparagraph 11 below, the harbour authorities for all those harbours in which more than 5 million tons of goods are handled in a year.*10. Although published statistics do not in every case indicate thetonnages of cargo handled in the areas of individual harbour authorities, itwould seem clear from available information that the harbour undertakings which will accordingly be transferred on the vesting day to the national ports Authority will be those of the following harbour authorities:The Port of London authority the Medway Conservancy board the Port of Bristol Authority (Bristol Corporation)The Milford Haven Conservancy board the Mersey Docks and Harbour board the Manchester Ship Canal company the Clyde Port authority the Forth Ports authority the Port of Tyne authority the Tees and Hartlepools Port authority the British Transport Docks Board, comprising:Hull, Goole, Immingham, Grimsby, King&apos;s Lynn Docks,Lowestoft, Southampton, Millbay Docks (Plymouth), Lydney,Newport, Cardiff, Barry, Port Talbot, Swansea, Garston,Fleetwood, Barrow, Silloth, Ayr, Troon.It will be seen from the published statistical information given in Annex 1that the figure of 5 million tons should provide a natural dividing line between the major harbours and the rest. The National Ports authority will be empowered to obtain full tonnage figures and to serve transfernotices on the authorities shown by these figures to be the ones whoseharbour undertakings are to be transferred to the Authority.11. It is not proposed to transfer initially to the National Ports Authorityany harbour undertaking of the British Railways Board (such as ParkestonQuay or Newhaven) or the British Waterways Board (such as Weston Pointor Sharpness), but provision on the general lines of sections 7 and 8 of theTransport Act, 1968, will be made for possible subsequent transfers of theirharbour undertakings. The harbour undertakings (which in some cases mayconsist of no more than a jetty or wharf), of private harbour authorities (as defined in Annex 3) will not be liable to be transferred to the National PortsAuthority, either initially or subsequently under the arrangements set out inthe next paragraph.12. After the initial vesting of harbour undertakings, the national ports Authority will be required to consider whether it would be desirable in the interests of the efficient and economical management and operationof a national ports system for it to take over the harbour undertakings of* For this purpose a year means any period of 12 months falling between 30th June 1966and 1st July 1968.39475c*

other statutory harbour authorities. It will be empowered to submit schemes to the Minister at any time proposing such take-overs; if there are objectionsto a scheme, the Minister will cause a public inquiry to be held before hedecides whether to confirm it. Fishery harbours, marine works* and privateharbour authorities will not be subject to this power.13. The Authority will have power to become the harbour authority for,and provide port facilities and services at, any newly-developing harbourarea if this is required, for example, for a maritime industrial development area scheme (MIDAS).14. Where the harbour authority whose harbour undertaking is beingtaken over is a local authority, or a company carrying on other activities in addition to its harbour undertaking, it will be necessary to make provisionfor determining which property, rights and liabilities are comprised in the harbour undertaking and should be transferred to the National PortsAuthority. A company will, however, be given the right to require theAuthority to acquire any or all of the remaining parts of its business, subjectto arbitration if the Authority objects.Stevedoring and other port services15. The Government intends that there should be a greater concentration of port services in the hands of the harbour authorities. There is within the ports a large variety of businesses providing facilities and services. Thesebusinesses vary widely both in the nature of the work they do and in theway in which they fit into the commercial pattern of the port. Some serveone user only or a limited number of users. Others are parts of vertically-integrated concerns. Others again are the port links in a &quot; through transport &quot;system, available to users generally, but under one control from origin todestination. There are also specialists such as cargo superintendents, whocheck the quantity and condition of goods, acting as agents for one or anotherparty, not only in the ports but also possibly at factories, airports, and other points on the route. There are, however, many businesses whose purpose is to provide common-user port services such as stevedoring, wharf-operating,lighterage and towage. These businesses were greatly reduced in numberwith the introduction of employer licensing under the Docks and HarboursAct, 1966; but even so the organisational pattern remains exceedinglycomplex, leading to divided responsibilities, the fragmentation of operational control, and unreliability of service.16. In the Governments view, the achievement of the greatest possible degree of efficiency requires that the nationalised authorities should become the principal operators of port services and facilities within theirports, and, by virtue of this, the principal employers of port labour. Thisis, indeed, one of the cardinal requirements in the reorganisation of the ports.It would not, however, be practicable for them to become the operators of* Fishery harbours are certain small harbours in England and Wales which are principallyused by the fishing industry. Marine works are certain harbours in Scotland which areprincipally used or required for the fishing or agricultural industries or the maintenance of communications.4

all port facilities and services, for example of those, such as oil jetties andother private wharves, which are integrated into another transport or industrial activity.17. It is essential, bearing in mind the vital importance of the nation&apos;strade, that whilst the take-over of businesses serving this trade should proceed as rapidly as possible, it should take place as part of an orderly andmanageable process. The take-overs should be selective, and have the aim off securing the efficient and economical operation of the nationalised ports;and in particular the operation of at least the main common-user portservices should be concentrated in the hands of the nationalised authorities.The Government has therefore decided that the National Ports authority should be required to put forward schemes initially within one year ofvesting day for the acquisition of businesses providing port services such asstevedoring, within these ports; and the Authority will also be givencontinuing duties and powers to put forward such schemes as necessary. TheAuthority will have powers of compulsory acquisition for the purpose of implementing such schemes. The owners of the businesses affected willhave the right to object to take-over proposals, and a public inquiry willbe held to consider objections before the Minister gives his decision. Ingeneral, businesses carrying out the handling, movement, loading, unloading,or warehousing of goods, lighterage or associated towage, or the management of a wharf, will be subject to compulsory acquisition. (A more precisedescription of those businesses which will, and those which will not, besubject to compulsory acquisition, is given in Annex 4.) The effect of these schemes will be to increase considerably the number of registered dockworkers employed in the nationalised sector from the initial figure of about15,000 (see Annex 2).18. The Government, however, attaches considerable importance to themaintenance of progress in the further rationalisation of port services and activities in the immediate future. As mentioned below (paragraph 28), work has already started on the second stage of the Devlin Committee&apos;srecommendations.* The Government also wishes to encourage the unification of port services and activities under the control of the existing harbourauthorities. These authorities have powers under the Docks and HarboursAct, 1966, to acquire businesses or undertakings of these kinds by agreement.In a number of cases these powers have already been used; harbourauthorities should seek every opportunity to exercise the powers in suitable cases where satisfactory terms can be negotiated, without waiting for there organisation legislation.THE NATIONAL PORTS AUTHORITYOrganisation and general functions19. The National Ports Authority will be responsible to the Ministerand through him to Parliament for the harbour undertakings transferred toit.   It will, within the framework laid down by the Government, establish* Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry under the Rt. Hon. Lord Devlin into certain matters concerning the Port Transport Industry (Cmnd. 2734).59475 c* secret

the main economic and financial policies and management objectives of the nationalised sector of the ports industry. It will have responsibility for planning, investment, pricing policies, and the promotion of research anddevelopment. It will, however, be required to delegate to subsidiaryauthorities responsibility for managing the ports, with the effect in practicalmanagement terms that the Authority will stand somewhat in the relationship of a holding company to its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Within the policyframework set by the Authority the subsidiary authorities will have full responsibility for the management of the undertakings. The Authority willbe required as a priority task to prepare for the approval of the Minister ascheme of organisation in line with these proposals, which will provide forthe efficient management of its ports. The scheme may be expected toprovide for subsidiary authorities based in the main on principal estuaries.In working out the scheme the Authority will have to have regard to thedesirability of providing an integrated management structure, which could take the form of a Scottish ports authority, for the Scottish harbour under-takings involved in the scheme; and the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales will be associated with the Minister in considering the scheme in so far as it affects Scotland and Wales respectively. In preparing itsscheme of organisation, the Authority will be expected to pay particular attention to the scope for and possible alternative means of ensuring thatworkers&apos; interests are adequately presented to the Authority in its deliberations.  The approved scheme will be laid before Parliament.20. It will be the general duty of the National Ports Authority toprovide, or secure the provision of, efficient and economical port facilities and services at the harbours for which it will be responsible. It will berequired to carry out this duty in consultation with bodies providing inlandand sea transport facilities and services. The duty of the Freight IntegrationCouncil to consider and make recommendations on matters relating to theprovision and operation of an integrated freight transport service will beextended to cover the National Ports Authority. The Authority&apos;s dutieswill involve the preparation of a comprehensive development plan for thenationally-owned port transport industry. The Authority will prepare and present to the Minister an annual report on the exercise and performance of its functions during the year, and on its policy and programme. Thereport, together with consolidated accounts presented in a form prescribed by the Minister, will be laid before Parliament by the Minister and will bepublished.21. The functions of the subsidiary authorities will include the efficient and economical management, maintenance and operation of facilities and services at ports for which they are responsible; and the preparation andsubmission to the National Ports Authority of proposals for the development and improvement of these ports. In carrying out these important functionsthe subsidiary authorities will be encouraged to plan the developmentscalled for by the needs of the regions, working in close consultation withthe Regional Economic Planning Councils. They will be required to prepare and submit to the National Ports Authority annual statements of financial results, which will be shown separately in the Authority&apos;s published annual report.  They will also carry out certain regulatory and controlling functions,6

such as employer licensing under the Docks and Harbours Act, 1966, and thecontrol of pollution, at present exercised by the harbour authorities whoseharbour undertakings will be taken over.22. While as a result of these arrangements there will be co-ordinationof investment and planning, and of operations within the ports, this will not mean the elimination of competition. It is, indeed, important to ensurethat there should be competition on service and on price between individualports in the public sector. This would be in accordance with the policy laid down in the White Paper of November 1967 on the Economicand Financial Objectives of the Nationalised Industries,* which states(paragraph 18) that pricing policies should be devised with reference to the true costs of the particular goods and services provided.Constitution of the Authority23. It is proposed that, on the lines customary with boards ornationalised industries, the Authority will consist of members appointed bythe Minister from among persons who have had wide experience of, or haveshown capacity in, the operation, management or administration of harbours,or transport, industrial, commercial or financial matters, applied science,administration, or the organisation of workers. In appointing them he willhave regard, in consultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales, to the desirability of having members who are familiar with thespecial requirements of particular regions and areas served by the ports ofthe Authority. It is envisaged that there will be not more than about a dozenmembers, including both full-time and part-time members.Constitution of the subsidiary authorities24. The National Ports Authority will make appointments, whether full-time or part-time, to the Boards of its subsidiary authorities from a similarfield of choice to that described in the preceding paragraph. In view of theimportance of these appointments, however, the Authority will be required toobtain the approval of the Minister; in the case of those authorities with responsibilities in Scotland or Wales, he will consult with the appropriateSecretary of State. Members of the National Ports Authority will be eligiblefor appointment as members of one or more of the subsidiary authorities.Financial provisions25. The National Ports Authority will have a general financial duty,similar to that of other nationalised undertakings, to ensure that revenuesare not less than sufficient to meet expenses chargeable to revenue, includingproper provision for depreciation or renewal of assets; and to establish and maintain a general reserve. The Government attaches importance tothe establishment of sound financial management and control by the national ports Authority and will apply the principles of the White Paper&quot;Nationalised Industries: A Review of Economic and financial objectives &quot;* to the Authority as to other nationalised undertakings.* Cmnd. 3437.7

26. The Authority will borrow from the Minister to meet its require-ments for capital finance; it will also be empowered to borrow temporarilyfrom the Minister, or (with the Ministers consent) from other persons, andthe Treasury will be empowered to guarantee those borrowings. A limit on total borrowings of the Authority outstanding at any one time will be prescribed, with provision for raising it to a higher limit by resolution ofthe House of Commons. It is intended that the initial limit will cover the outstanding borrowings for which the Authority will become liable on the vesting day, the sums needed to meet compensation payments and the financing of capital expenditure; it will cover a period of two to three years,and the higher limit a period of about five years.27. The Authority will be eligible to receive grants under the portmodernisation grants scheme.EMPLOYEES IN THE PORTS INDUSTRY28. In 1965 the Government set in hand, on the basis of the DevlinReport,* one of the biggest and most important developments that has evertaken place in our ports. The virtual elimination of the casual system ofemployment in September 1967, coupled with the introduction of employerlicensing, has radically altered the working conditions of the registered docker.It has led to a very considerable reduction in the number of employers withinthe individual ports, and has provided an improved basis for the developmentof better industrial relations and for increased productivity and efficiency.Work has already started on the second stage of the Devlin Committee&apos;srecommendations for the rationalisation of the pay structure of the industryand the elimination of restrictive practices. It is of the greatest importance that all these processes should be continued.Employees&apos; participation and the future oSf the Dock Labour Scheme29. It is the Government^ general aim to encourage the more extensiveparticipation of employees in the industries and undertakings in which theyare employed, on the basis of effective machinery for negotiation and joint consultation. The Transport Act, 1968, has extended the statutoryresponsibilities in these matters of the existing nationalised transport under-takings. In the ports this is of particular importance, first because the extensive technical developments taking place will require radical re-thinking of traditional working practices, in which the employees themselves mustnecessarily be involved; and secondly because several of the statutoryauthorities whose harbour undertakings are to be taken over have includedmembers from trade unions concerned with the ports, and the National dock labour Scheme already provides joint control of a wide range of matters affecting employment.* Final Report of the Committee on Inquiry under the Rt. Hon. Lord Devlin into certain matters-concernins the Port Transport Industry (Cmnd. 2734).8

30. The Government will wish to have further consultation on thesematters with the interests concerned, in the light of the reorganisationproposals set out in this White Paper. It is, however, the governments general intention that all employees in the industry, including those in the residual private sector, should benefit from the arrangements for participationestablished for the nationalised sector, and be guaranteed terms andconditions of employment not less favourable than those obtaining underthe National Ports Authority for similar work in the same area. TheGovernment also considers it essential to continue for registered dockworkers generally statutory provision for joint control of those mattersat present dealt with by the National and local Dock Labour Boards, andto bring these arrangements as closely under the administration of theNational Ports Authority as is consistent with the preservation of jointcontrol. At the same time the Government attaches considerable importanceto fostering the direct relationship between registered dock workers andtheir operational employers which has been made possible by decasualisation.It is therefore desirable that residual private employers should continue tobear direct responsibility for their own registered labour forces, and berepresented on the negotiating and consultative machinery established bythe National Ports Authority as well as in the arrangements for the continuation of the functions now exercised by the Dock Labour Boards. Inview, however, of the intention that the nationalised authorities should, withina limited period, become the principal operators of port services and hence the principal employers of port labour, the Government intends to ensurethat the nationalised authority has, right from the start, the dominant voiceon the employers&apos; side of the industry.31. With these objectives, the Government proposes to include in thenationalising statute provision on the general lines of section 137 of theTransport Act, 1968, requiring the National Ports Authority, in consultationwith appropriate organisations, to establish effective machinery for negotiation and consultation for all its employees. (This would include the requirement for the Minister and the Secretary of Stale for Employment and Productivityto be kept informed of progress.) In addition the Government proposes toinclude provision on the general lines of section 15 of the Civil Aviation Act,1949, requiring private port employers to observe terms and conditions notless favourable than those observed by the National Ports Authority and itssubsidiary authorities for similar work in the same area, except where thereis joint agreement to do otherwise; this provision would be enforceable by reference to the Industrial Court. In view of this provision the private employers would no doubt wish, as in the case of civil aviation, to be associated by agreement with the machinery established for the nationalisedsector, which would therefore replace the existing National Joint Council(which covers only registered dock workers). These arrangements wouldprovide for the first time national industrial machinery for all port employeeswith a guarantee of minimum standards set by the nationalised sector.32. The Government proposes that all the functions, property, rightsand liabilities of the National and local Dock Labour Boards should, withany necessary modifications, be vested in the nationalised authorities, but9

that the exercise of these functions, etc., should be subject to the consent ofa National Dock Labour Committee, and appropriate local Committees,established by the statute. Detailed arrangements for this, and the composition and method of appointment of the National Dock LabourCommittee and local Committees, will be a matter for discussion with theinterests concerned. It is the Government^ present intention that theNational Committee should be appointed by the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity, half the members being nominated by thetrade unions concerned, a majority of the employers&apos; representatives by theNational Ports Authority and a minority by the residual private employers.Provision could be made if desired for the additional appointment of anindependent chairman and vice-chairman, as in the case of the presentNational Dock Labour Board; alternatively a chairman might be appointedfrom within the Committee.33. The National Committee would be responsible for the appointmentof local committees, with a similar composition, i.e., a majority of theemployers&apos; representatives would be nominated by the appropriatenationalised authority. This would apply to all local Dock LabourCommittees whether or not the nationalised authority was the main employer in the Committee&apos;s area.34. The Government is not at this stage proposing major changes inthe functions which are at present exercised by the National and local dock labour Boards, or to alter their scope, e.g., by harmonising the differingdefinitions of &quot; dock work &quot; existing in the various ports. It considers thatsuch matters might best be reviewed in the light of the new scheme of reorganisation.Protection of employees alfEected hy the reorganisation35. The Government acknowledges the valuable services given to the ports industry by the employees of the National Ports Council, the existingharbour authorities and the National Dock Labour Board. There is no special need for them to fear redundancy when the reorganisation takes place.The Government expects that most if not all will be needed by the national ports Authority and its subsidiary authorities. (For example, most if not allthe work done by the employees of the National Dock Labour Board will still be carried on, but under the control of the new Committees, and mostof the present staff will be needed to do it.) Provision will, however, be madefor the protection of their interests. The legislation will require the Ministerto make regulations providing for the payment of compensation to any who may suffer, as a consequence of reorganisation, loss of employment or loss or diminution of emoluments or pension rights. It is the intention that theregulations would be on the lines of the Harbour Reorganisation(Compensation to Employees) Regulations, 1967, made under Section 19 ofthe Harbours Act, 1964.,10

Training and education36. The National Ports Authority will be given powers and responsibilities for the training and education of its own employees similarto those possessed by the other nationalised transport undertakings underthe Transport Acts. It will also inherit from the National Dock labour board responsibilities for the training of registered dock workers generally,to be exercised under the control of the National and local Dock LabourCommittees. Consideration will, however, be given to the establishmentunder the Industrial Training Act, 1964, of an Industrial Training board for the ports industry.ADVISORY COMMITTEES37. The Government considers it important that an effective voice inport affairs should be given to port users and others closely concerned. Itis therefore proposed that advisory committees shall be set up to adviseand assist the subsidiary authorities of the National Ports Authority in the performance of their functions. These advisory committees would be on similar lines to those established in relation to the British Transport DocksBoard undertakings in South Wales, on the Humber and on SouthamptonWater. These are providing a valuable forum for local and regional opinion.For instance, the Humber Local Advisory Board has on it representatives of organised labour, local shipowners, the fishing industry, and local chambers of commerce, and nominees of local authorities, with a Chairman drawn from the Docks Board. The Port of Bristol Advisory Board similarly hasrepresentatives from a wide range of interested bodies, and the Chairmanis the Chairman of the Docks Committee of Bristol Corporation. It isintended that the advisory committees will have representatives from the range of organisations involved in or affected by the working of the ports.38. The members of the committees will be appointed by the minister after consultation with interests concerned, and after consultation with theappropriate Secretary of State in the case of committees concerned withharbours in Scotland and Wales. The Chairmen might be drawn from the subsidiary authorities of the National Ports Authority, or might be independent persons.39. The committees will have the right to be given information to enablethem to discharge their functions effectively. They will be able to make representations and recommendations to the National Ports Authority itself ifthey have been unable lo obtain satisfaction from the subsidiary authority.They will also, if they are not satisfied after consultation with the Authorityitself, be entitled to make a formal recommendation to the Minister. Insuch cases, the Minister will be empowered to give directions to theAuthority on matters dealt with in the recommendations, except individualcomplaints on dues and charges; these will be subject to the provisions setout in paragraph 45 below. These arrangements will replace the functions ofthe Transport Consultative Committees in relation to the British transport docks Board.11

PORTS OUTSIDE THE NATIONALISED SECTOR40. The Government considers it desirable to continue to provide,outside the nationalised sector, for appropriate bodies to be able to obtainpowers as harbour authorities, for the modernisation of harbour authorityconstitutions and procedures, and for harbour reorganisations. Sections 14to 18 of the Harbours Act, 1964, will accordingly be continued. TheMinister will be given power to promote harbour reorganisation schemeshimself under section 18; and section 15 will be amended to enable him to initiate harbour revision orders dealing with the constitution or procedure of harbour authorities. The procedures laid down in the Harbours Act, 1964,for considering objections to such orders or schemes would apply.41. Harbour developments costing over million outside the nationalisedsector will continue to be subject to the Ministers control under section of the Harbours Act, 1964. In considering such projects the Minister willtake into account the plans and programmes of the National Ports authority and any comments submitted by the Authority on the proposals, but thiswill not entitle it to receive confidential commercial information. Thenon-nationalised sector will continue to be eligible to receive government loans and grants.THE ROLE OF THE MINISTER42. The Minister^ relationship with the National Ports Authority will,as will be seen from the preceding paragraphs, be the normal one between asponsoring Minister and a nationalised undertaking. He will be empoweredto give directions of a general character to the Authority on matters which appear to him to affect the national interest. In matters involving majorcapital investment, the Authority will be required to act on lines settled fromtime to time with the approval of the Minister. The Minister will also beempowered to authorise or direct the Authority to do anything which itappears to him it ought to do in the interests of national defence.43. The Minister will, in addition to his powers relating to the national ports Authority, continue to exercise a number of his existing statutoryfunctions in relation to ports in general. His present powers of controlover major investment will operate in both the nationalised and the non-nationalised sectors. He will also retain the powers, which have been widely used to stimulate port investment, to make grants and loans to harbourauthorities in the non-nationalised sector and to make grants to operators of port services in certain circumstances.44. The Minister will also retain his functions in relation to the licensing of port employers under the Docks and Harbours Act, 1966.45. The Minister will assume the National Ports CounciFs function ofhearing objections to certain ship, passenger and goods dues. He will exercise this function in relation both to the nationalised and to thenon-nationalised sectors. In addition, the present requirement that certaincharges made by harbour authorities must be reasonable will remain.12

46. The National Ports Council will be dissolved. Provision will bemade for the transfer of its property, rights and liabilities to the national ports Authority; it will, however, be ensured that commercially confidential information in the Council&apos;s records relating to the non-nationalised sectoris not transferred to the Authority.PILOTAGE57. The present organisation of pilotage stems from the Pilotage Act,1913, under which pilotage services for all major and most minor ports are provided by separate pilotage authorities having their own byelaws. InGreat Britain there are 42 pilotage authorities for the 88 pilotage districts,with a strength of approximately 1,600 licensed pilots who derive their income as self-employed persons from shares of pilotage dues. TrinityHouse, London, the pilotage authority for 41 of the 88 districts,administers about 700 pilots, some 500 being in the London district. the effective executive pilotage bodies of almost all districts include pilots andshipowners and in most districts representatives also of the harbourauthorities. In some pilotage districts, the harbour authority is also thepilotage authority.58. It is clear that, whilst the present standard of pilotage service is satisfactory, there is need for a much greater degree of centralisation andrationalisation, including provision for adequate pensions and redeploymentopportunities, and for a radical revision of the Pilotage Act, 1913. As aresult of the consultations with the interests concerned with pilotage, theGovernment has concluded that the broad alternatives most iikely to achieve these objectives are unification of all pilotage under the National PortsAuthority or unification under a central pilotage authority independent of,but closely linked with, the National Ports Authority. Whichever course is adopted will require further consultations with the interests concerned,including the National Ports Authority when it is established. TheGovernment has therefore decided that pilotage should be excluded from thelegislation on reorganisation of the ports and that separate legislation forpilotage should be prepared at a later date. Meanwhile, the present arrange-ments for pilotage will remain largely unaffected by the ports legislation apartfrom consequential changes required where a harbour authority whoseharbour undertaking is to be brought into national ownership is concernedwith pilotage.CONCLUSION59. The existing organisation of the ports industry is not suitable for thepresent era of rapid change in transport requirements and techniques. Theexisting harbour authorities do not have the comprehensive powers and responsibilities needed. In spite of the provisions for harbour reorganisationschemes and for modernising the constitutions of port authorities under the harbours Act, 1964, there is not sufficient scope under existing legislation15

56. In the national interest and in the interest of the ports themselves,day-to-day operations and capital investment should continue. the safeguarding provisions should not hamper normal activities. Actions takenin good faith and in the normal course of business are unlikely to be challenged under these provisions; and the Minister is ready to discuss withthe bodies concerned any transactions of an unusual character.PILOTAGE57.

for the necessary radical improvement of the structure of the industry on anational basis. The National Ports Council has no executive responsibilityor powers.60. The Government proposes to modernise the industry by bringingunder the control of the new National Ports Authority the major ports of thecountry which handle about nine-tenths of the nation&apos;s sea-borne trade, andin which the vast majority (over 95 per cent) of the registered dock workers are employed. The reorganisation will ensure that there is a central body with the responsibility and the power to formulate and execute plans forthe future which will enable the industry to meet the challenge of technological development and provide a more efficient service to users.61. A Bill to give legislative effect to these proposals will be introduced in the 1969-70 Session.16
