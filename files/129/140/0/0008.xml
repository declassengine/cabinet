jfjs DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)G5C(69) 820th January, 1969COPY NO.CABINETTHE PAY OF DOCTOE-S AND DENTISTS AND OF TEACHERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes has considered proposals for increases in the remuneration of doctors and dentists, and in the salaries of school teachers, which raise issues of some importance.Doctors and Dentists2.      The Review Body on Doctors* and DentistsT Remuneration,, whoseChairman is Lord Kindersley, have reported to the Prime Minister on the remuneration to be paid to about 60, 000 doctors and dentists in the national health Service, for the period lot January, 1969 until 1st April, 1970.3.      The Review Body recommend increases averaging about 8 per cent.These recommendations are based on a comparison with movements inother wages and salaries.    In a special addendum the Review Bodyemphasise that they have taken note of the First Report by the national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on the pay of University Teachers(Cmnd. 3866), which in effect rejected claims based on broad comparabilityof this kind as being contributory to inflation.    They insist however that itis essential that they should not be thought to have revised their opinionsby reference to those of any other body.    They say that while theyconsider the increases that they recommend to be consistent with incomes policy, the detailed application of the annual ceiling is for the government alone, to ensure consistency of interpretation in incomes policy and avoiddiscrimination.4.      The Ministerial Committee at their meeting on 14th Januaryconsidered the Review BodyTs recommendations and saw difficulties in theway of either accepting or rejecting them.5.      Acceptance of the recommendations v/ould imply our acquiescence in the basis of comparability for doctors, at a time when the basis hasbeen rejected by the NBPI for University Teachers (who have been awardedless than a comparison of this kind v/ould justify and substantially less than-

the ceiling).    Moreover, we have asked the NBPI to investigate the pay ofagricultural workers (who are almost all low paid workers) and increases for doctors might be criticised as discrimination in favour of the betterpaid.    Finally, we are having difficulty over the interpretation of incomes policy in relation to the teachers1 claim.6.      On the other hand, rejecting the Review Bodyts recommendationsor referring them to the NBPI would at once be denounced as a breach of faith by the medical profession.    In the Appendix to this memorandum theSecretary of State for Social Services sets out the relevant history.Notwithstanding v/hat was said to the Kindersley Review Body, rejectionor reference to the NBPI of the present recommendations would leadalmost certainly to the resignation of the Review Body en bloc, and wouldhave a disastrous effect on the retention and emigration of the doctorsneeded for the National Health Service    There would be implications forthe parallel arrangements on the pay of the higher Civil Service, which isunder a general review by the Standing Advisory Committee under theChairmanship of Lord Plowden.    A rejection of comparability as acriterion for determining pay would also have mUch more widespreadrepercussions in the public sector generally.7.      The Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes considered thepossibility of our accepting the Review Bodyts present recommendations and at the same time announcing that there will have to be new arrangements to take the place of those by which three separate bodies,the NBPI, the Review Body and the Standing Advisory Committee on pay of the Higher Civil Service, are responsible for advising in different a reason pay in the public sector, the latter two (unlike the NBPI) beingunconnected with and not responsible for advice on pay in the private sector.    It would be difficult to go very far in making at once any statement on these lines, for the reasons outlined in paragraph 6.Acceptance of the Review BodyTs recommendations might, however, becoupled with a carefully worded announcement that we propose to beginconsultations at once with the medical profession and the others concerned about new arrangements to co-ordinate advice on pay in that area of thepublic sector.8,      There is another possible approach to this question which the prices and Incomes Committee did not discuss but which my colleagues may wishto consider, namely deferment of the date of implementation of the ReviewBodyTs recommendations for three months.    A reduction of  4. 5 million in the cost of the award would give substantial expression to a degree ofGovernment doubt about the Review BodyTs recommendations.    It might conceivably be tolerable (though highly unwelcome) to the Review Body;but it would still leave us with a major conflict with the profession.

Teachers9.      The Burnham Committee is in the course of negotiating a two-year agreement to start from next April on the pay of teachers in England andWales, the operative dabe of the 1967 agreement having been deferred by three months to 1st July on account of incomes policy.    The incomes policyceiling allowable for an increase in teachers1 pay from 1st April, 1969would be 6 1/8 per cent and the teachers1 original claim in tho current negotiations was for 21 per cent.    With the approval of Ministers, an offerhas been made at the ceiling and rejected by the teachers.    However, thereis a good prospect that agreement might be reached on an offer of .1 per cent, which would cost  33 million a year.    Agreement would bea welcome new departure, since in both the 1965 and 1967 negotiations theclaim went to arbitration (each time achieving a slight increase on the managements offer).    Should the claim go to arbitration and be given aresponse more favourable than incomes policy would permit, the awardcould be overturned only by an affirmative resolution of both Houses ofParliament.10.      The teachers1 claim is mainly based on comparability with other professions.    However 1 per cent out of the proposed 7.1 per cent isintended to provide for an Licrease in the number of senior posts inprimary schools and in the salary of most primary school headmasters;and it is argued that this can properly bo broadly regarded a3 a regradingexercise in recognition of the increased demands on and responsibilitiesundertaken by primary school teachers, which in a 3ystem giving normalmanagement discretion to the employers would not require any revision ofthe pay   rules.    On the other hand, it is argued that the 1 per cent will Infact simply pay some teachers more for doing die same work and that eventhe 6 1/8 per cent offer already sanctioned by the Government has escapedthe sort of scrutiny by the NBPI which we are giving the claim ofagricultural workers and have given to other wage-earnings1 claims.11.       Some members of the Committee also see a link with the questionof doctors and dentists pay.    They consider that if the Government grantsan award to the medical profession at the maximum, purely on the basis of comparability, without reference to the NBPI, it may be difficult to refer the teachers after a similar award,    Against this, other members of theCommittee point out that comparability for teachers has already beenconceded by the 6 1/8 per cent offer, and argue that acceptance of the same basis for doctors does not affect the question of raising the offer to teacherson other grounds.12.       I invite my colleagues -(a)    on the subject of doctors and dentists remuneration, to consider.. which of the following courses to adopt;

(I)  to accept the recommendations of the Review Body onDoctors1 and Dentists&apos;&apos; Remuneration, explaining that the increases approved are within the limits of incomes policy;or to do this, while putting the operative date forward from 1st January to 1st April, 1969;(ii)  to reject the Review Body*s recommendations or refer themto the NBPI (which would give rise to much the samereactions among the medical profession);(ixi) to accept the Review Body1s recommendations withoutalteration coupled with an announcement that we proposeto begin consultations with the medical profession and the others concerned about new arrangements to co-ordinateadvice on pay in the relevant area  of the public sector.on the subject of teachers^ pay to consider:(i) whether we should stand firm on the existing 6 1/8 per centoffer in the Burnham Committee or increase it by afurther 1 per cent, to cover claims for increasedresponsibility payments in primary schoolsj(ii) whether there should be a reference to the NBPI of thegeneral question of the structure of teacher3T pay,,R,H..J.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.20th January, 1969-4-

APPENDIXINDEPENDENCE OF THE REVIEW copy ON DOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REMUNERATION.The Review Body was established in March 1962, so that the remuneration of the professions could be (in the word3 of the report of the RoyalCommission) &quot;determined in practice by a group of independent persons of standing and authority not committed to the Government&apos;s point ofview&quot;.     The Royal Commission believed &quot;that seven people such as wehave in mind will make recommendations of such weight and authority that the Government will be able, and indeed feel bound, to accept them&quot;.Tho Report, including the recommendation for establishment of a review body on the basis proposed, was accej)ted as a whole by tho Government.All recommendations made by tho Review Body have been accepted by theGovernments (subject to staging of the 30 per cent increase for G.Ps.in 1966) and the profession would undoubtedly see a reference to the nbpi as a breach both of agreed principle and of established practice.The professions have all along been suspicious that incomes policy would undermine the independence of the Review Body and on the appearance of Cmnd 3235 they sent a formal deputation to protest about the statement in it that the criteria were &quot;intended to be applied by&quot; independentReview Bodies.     They were assured &quot;the status of the Review Body isin no way affected by that paragraph&quot;;   and their attention was drawn to a statement mo.de by the then First Secretary in the House on 14th July 1966,when he said, referring to the SAC on the Higher Civil Service and thoReview Body:&quot;These bodies will continue, but tho Government will discuss withthem and with the representatives of tho Higher   Civil Servicearrangements for ensuring that in conducting their reviews bothbodies have full regard to tho incomes and prices policy&quot;.It was explained that this statement applied equally to discussion withrepresentatives of tho nodical and dental professions.     No such discussions have taken place and reference of a Review Body report to the NBPIwithout then could be regarded as a breach of faith on this score.

In their Ninth Report of March 1968, which (with insignificant exceptions)rejected the doctors&apos; claims, tho Review Body added &quot;if it should laterappear that movements of wages or salaries exceed what can reasonably bejustified under incomes policy criteria then prevailing we should considerit unfair to tho professions and prejudicial to the officiency of the national health Service to deny appropriate increases to doctors and dentists&quot;.In announcing the Government&apos;s attitude, the Prime Minister said &quot;theGovernment have accepted the advice tendered in the report in its entirety&quot;.This also could provoke charges of doublo-dealing from a reference to thoNBPI.     The reference would also provide justification to the doctorsfor renewing their large claims.-2-
