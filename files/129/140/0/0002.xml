R-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)IC(69) 28th January, 1969CABINETA POLICY FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS: DRAFT WHITE PAPERMamorandurn by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and ProductivityWhen the Cabinet considered my draft T.7hite Paper on a policy for Industrial Relations, I was asked to arrange for the ministerial committee on Industrial Relations to examine the practicability and effectiveness of my proposals and to compare them with other proposalswhich had been made, in particular by Mr. Andrew Shonfield and by the confederation of British Industry as v/ell as by the Donovan Commission.2.       The area in which there has been significant differences ofopinion, both inside and outside the Donovan Commission - and whichthe Committee on Industrial Relations has therefore considered most carefully - is the measures which can be taken to discourage unnecessarystrikes, particularly unconstitutional ones which are the main presentsource of trouble.3.       Broadly speaking, the Donovan Commission considered that thedevelopment of satisfactory procedure agreements in industry (throughthe operations of the Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR)) would go far to eliminate those strikes which so frequently result from u-nsatis-factory procedures for settling grievances.    The only other majorityrecommendation by Donovan which is relevant to this problem was thatthe protection given by Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, shouldbe given in future only to registered trade unions and employers associations.    This would enable employers to sue for damagesunofficial strike leaders for inducing strikers to break their contracts.But the Donovan Commission itself recognised that employers would inpractice be unwilling to take action of this kind because of the seriousadverse consequences for industrial relations.    Moreover, this stepwill, I believe, be strongly resisted by the TUC as giving a generalisedpower of action against all unofficial strikes regardless of their cause.4,       Mr. Andrew Shonfield&apos;s proposals, as described in his note ofreservation to the Donovan Commission, are:COPY NO.

(l)     To amend Section 5 of the Conspiracy and Protection of PropertyAct, 1875, to make striking a criminal offence where there is a serious risk of endangering life, limb or valuable property,(2)    The CIR should have statutory powers enabling it to act-independently, and in a judicial capacity in the case of (a) inter-uniondisputes, (b) failure to draw up adequate collective agreements, (c)failure to bargain in good faith about the removal of restrictive practices,(3)    Collective agreements should be enforceable unless the partiesspecifically stated the contrary in the agreement,5,       The CBI&apos;s main proposal is that the Government should beempowered to impose appropriate procedure agreements on employersand unions where this seems desirable, and to enforce their observance,6,       My own proposals in the draft White Paper accept the view of the donovan Commission that the development of satisfactory procedure agreements in industry is the most promising long-term approach toavoidance of unnecessary strikes.    I propose in addition to make provision for dealing with inter-union disputes more or less on thelines proposed by Mr. Shonfield (but with enforcement by the Governmentrather than the CIR),    And instead of modifying Section 3 of the TradeDisputes Act, 190.6, to deal with unconstitutional strikes, I propose thatthe Government should have discretionary powers to require a compulsoryballot before members of a union are brought out on an official strike;and to require a maximum of 56 days &quot;conciliation pause&quot; in the caseof unconstitutional strikes.7. The Committee on Industrial Relations has considered these various proposals and reached the following unanimous conclusions:Against(l)     The CBI proposals for enforcement of agreements by the Governmenthave n-o merit,(2)    There are serious disadvantages in giving the CIR an independentjudicial function and direct powers of enforcement as proposedby Mr, Shonfield,    This would exclude the Government from an effective say in the development of industrial relations on thenew lines and would put the CIR in the extremely difficult position of having to combine the role of friend and adviser to both sides of industry with that of their judge,(3)    The majority Donovan recommendation for modification ofSection 3 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, would not be acceptable for dealing with unofficial strikes.

(4)    The extension of criminal liability for striking under the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, as proposedby Mr. Shonfield, is undesirable.For(5)    The proposals by the Donovan Commission and in the draft white Paper for improving procedure agreements throughthe GIR provide the best long-term approach to avoidingstrikes,(6)    The proposals in the draft White Paper for dealing with inter-union disputes - with intervention by the CIR and reserve powersof enforcement by the Secretary of-State if the TUC fail to obtain a settlement - are approved.(7)    The proposal in the draft White Paper is approved for reservediscretionary powers for the Secretary of State to require a ballot before an official strike.(8)    The Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposals for enforcement of the variouslegal sanctions by the Industrial Board in England and Walesare approved,    (I am considering with the Secretary of Statefor Scotland whether the same arrangements can apply inScotland),Thus the conciliation pause is the only major proposal in the white paper on which there was a continuing difference of opinion in theCommittee on Industrial Relations,Conciliation Pause8.      A minority of the Committee took the view that the conciliationpause would be, and would be seen to be, ineffective in practice;  wouldnot therefore serve even a presentational purpose; but would be a majorirritation for the trade unions.    Enforcement of the pause could inpractice only be attempted after the strike had started.    This mightwell lead to official recognition of the strike.    But in any event anenforced return to the factory would not necessarily mean a returnto work - go-slows and overtime bans would inevitably result.Experience under the defence regulations had demonstrated thefutility of seeking to compel v/orkers to return to work under the threat of legal sanctions.    There was no practical solution either on these lines or on those, suggested by the majority of the DonovanCommission, of enabling employers to sue for damages.    Thepractical remedy lay in a speedy reform of procedure agreements,which should be concentrated at the start on the main trouble spotsin industry,

9.       On the other hand, a substantial majority of the committee considered that the conciliation pause was a necessary part of the package of proposals and could be made effective if used with discretion.    Where a few men, in defiance not only of theirunion but of their fellow-worker s, resorted to unconstitutional strikes with far-reaching effects on the economy, the conciliationpause could be operated effectively.    The recent strike of 22 machinesetters at Girlings was a typical example of such a situation, and therehad been many others.    A considerable period must inevitably elapse before satisfactory procedure agreements could be negotiated and brought into operation in the more troublesome areas of industry,even if the CIR concentrated all its energies on these.    And evenif satisfactory procedure agreements were universally in operation,it would be naive to suppose that they would completely put an end tounnecessary and damaging strikes.    In any event, the conciliationpause could operate to the benefit of the strikers because of the requirement that during the pause the terms of employment shouldbe those obtaining before the strike.    For example, if an unofficialstrike were called to prevent a dismissal, the latter would have tobe postponed throughout the pause and would be the subject of negotiations.    The choice lay between simply providing for thelong-term improvement of procedure agreements (i. e. doing lessthan Donovan proposed) and introducing the conciliation pause as well.The latter, with its admitted imperfections, was most certainly betterthan nothing.    It had to be borne in mind that there were a considerablenumber of proposals, going beyond the Donovan recommendations, inthe White Paper for strengthening the rights and powers of trade unions.It was not unreasonable to expect the unions in return to accept theconciliation pause, which of course affected unconstitutional strikesonly.Conclusion10.      In the light of the discussion in the Industrial relations committee, I remain convinced that the substantive proposals in the draft White&apos; Paper are the best that can be devised to meetboth the immediate and the longer-term problems involved in improvingindustrial relations and avoiding unnecessary strikes.    I accordinglyask my colleagues to approve them.B. A. C,&quot;Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W.1,7th January, 1969
