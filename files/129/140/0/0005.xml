I.   IntroductionBackgroundThe United Kingdom will change from   s. d. lo a decimal currency onMonday, 15th February 1971- Decimal Day or D Day.2. The decimal currency system will be based on the pound sterling andthe new penny, the new penny being one-hundredth part of a pound stcrling.*3. The While Paper entitled &quot;Decimal Currency in the United King-dom &quot;t reviewed the background to the decision in principle to adopt asystem based on the pound divided into one hundred minor units ; described the benefits of decimalisation ; explained the reasons for the Governmentschoice of system ; and set out the Govcrnmenfs proposals lor the newcoinage and the broad arrangements for the change-over. The Governmentarc now presenting a second While Paper in order to place their proposalslor a second Decimal Currency Bill in the general framework of the arrangermeats for I he change-over to decimal currency and lo explain the main provisions of the Bill.4. Throughout this While Paper the abbreviation   s. d. and the term&quot; old&quot; refer lo the currency and coinage based on (he pound sterling,shillings and pence: the abbreviation  p and the term &quot;new&quot; refer to the currency and coinage to be introduced on the 15th February 1971 basedon the pound sterling and the new penny.Organisation lor (Sic change-over . The Treasury is responsible for general policy and has a particularresponsibility for co-ordinating the change-over arrangements of Governmentdepartments.6. The functions of the Decimal Currency Board, as set out in the decimal currency Act 1967, are to facilitate the transition from the existing currency and coinage (o the new currency and coinage, and in particular &quot; (a) to examine, in consultation with such organisations and persons asthe Board consider appropriate, problems involved in the transition ;(b) to furnish information and advice about the new currency andcoinage, and to publish, whether by advertisement or otherwise, such information as the Board think useful for familiarising the publicwith it and its relation to the existing currency and coinage ;(c) to promote arrangements for the adaptation or replacement of com-mercial and other equipment designed to record or calculate in theexisting currency or lo be operated by the existing coinage;* Decimal Currency Act 1967.t Cmnd. 3164: December 1966.
(V/) to receive and consider, with a view to such provision (it&quot; any) asmay hereafter be made by Parliament for the payment of compen-sation in special circumstances, representations with respect to expenditure or loss incurred or to be incurred by particular persons or classes of persons in consequence of the change ;(e) to make investigations and surveys for obtaining information relevant to the exercise of any of the functions of the Board.&quot;7. The general approach of the Board and the work they have done sofar on machine problems and publicity are not discussed in this white paper since they are fully covered in the Board&apos;s First Annual Report1967/68*, their reference booklets&quot;!&apos; and news letters.8. The Royal Mint is responsible for the manufacture of the decimalcoinage.The coinage9. There will be six decimal coins:Denomination	  s. io\ value	Metal	Approx. Diameter (mras.)

To help to prepare the public lor decimalisation 5p and lOp coinshave been issued as legal tender since 23rd April 1968 to maintain suppliesof shillings and two shilling pieces, with which they arc identical in value,weight, diameter and composition ; only the designs are different. Decimalcoin sets consisting of the new bronze and the 5p and lOp cupro-nickel coinshave been on sale to the public since 1 Ith June 1968.11. A seven-sided cupro-nickel 50p coin will be issued as legal tenderon 14th October 1969 to replace the ten shilling note. A 20p or 25p coinin the same tier as the 50p could be issued after the change-over if therewere a demand.* H.C. 303, July 1968.t Decimal Currency: Expression of Amounts in printing, writing and in speech. decimal currency: Three years to go Facts and forecasts.

12. The present halfpenny is to be demonetised from 1st August 1969and the hall-crown from 1st January 1970. The penny, threepenny piece andsixpence will continue to circulate as legal lender until the end of thechange-over period (but see paragraph 21 below) when they will be demone-used. The sixpence will not be retained as a 2lp coin after the end of thechange-over.13. Shillings and two shilling pieces will not be demonetised at the endof the change-over period but will continue to be legal tender as 5p andI Op coins.14. Most of the decimal coins required by D Day are to be minted at theRoyal Minfs new factory at Llantrisant in Wales, which started production at 4he end of 1968. The bulk of the decimal bronze coins will be speciallypacked in amounts of  1 or 50p instead of in the usual bags of  20. Thiswill case the task of the banks, and other organisations which handle coinin bulk, in distributing the new coins in the period immediately before andafter D Day. Most of the decimal coins will be sent to the banks for storage as soon as they have been manufactured.* Demonetisation: the act of depriving a coin of its status as legal tender; it is authorised by Royal Proclamation issued normally a few months before demonetisation is due to occur.After demonetisation the coins concerned may no longer be used as money.
II.   Planning for Conversion to Decimal CurrencyGeneral15. There are lour main subjects on which those responsible lor planningconversion arrangements may find it helpful to have some guidance fromthe Government.They arc:  (i) the change-over period ;(ii) prices :(iii) wages and salaries ;(iv) compensation.These are discussed below.The change-over period16. This is the period following D Day during which, for most purposes,business will be transacted in either the old or the new currencies (althoughcheques, other bills of exchange, promissory notes and all other monetarytransactions involving the banking system will have to be expressed in thenew currency from D Day). Both the old and the new coins will be legaltender.17. A change-over period of some months is necessary because it will beimpossible to replace or convert overnight all machines which record  s. d. amounts or are operated by   s. d. coins. Ollices and shops must be free to work in   s. d. until their essential machines can be replaced orconverted to decimal working.18. It would be impracticable for the banking system to work in bothcurrencies. For this reason banks generally will be closed for normalbusiness on Thursday .11th and Friday 12th February 1971, as well as duringthe week-end, lo enable them to clear   s. d. items and then to convert theirmachines and accounts (on the basis of the whole new penny table, seeAppendix, Table B) to decimal working; they will however arrange forcertain limited essential services to their customers on request. On and afterD Day the banks will work exclusively in the new currency: all amounts paid into or drawn out of bank accounts from that dale will need to be expressedin terms of the new currency. The banks will however continue to accept and where necessary issue   s. d. coins in mulliplcs of 5p (one shilling).19. For practical purposes the change-over will be complete when allorganisations are able to work in the new currency. The change-over periodcan then be formally brought to an end. It is desirable lo keep the change-over period as short as possible. Against this background the decimal currency Board estimate that not more than eighteen months will be needed for the replacement or conversion of   s. d. machines.  This sets an outside
limit to the length of the change-over period, which will end not later thanAugust 1972. The Board intend to keep the position under review and a shorter period may be practicable.20. However, a large part of the economy is likely to be working indecimal currency within a lew weeks of D Day. The speed of conversionto decimal currency working and use of (he new coinage throughout thecountry will he considerably influenced by the change-over arrangements of major cash-handling organisations the banks, (he Post Ollice, retailers,public transport authorities and those central and local government deparl-ments which cany out numerous monetary transactions with the public,[n addition to the banks, many of these organisations are already planning to go decimal on or about D Day. The cumulative clfccl of this processwithin a few weeks of D Day is likely lo be that organisations will find it increasingly advantageous to work in  p rather than   s. d.21. An important consequence of early conversion (o decimal currencyworking by major cash-handling organisations is likely (o be that I he  s. d. coins which are to be demonetised at the end of (he change-overperiod ((he penny, threepenny piece and (he sixpence) will becomeprogressively more scarce after D Day because a rapidly increasing numberof organisations will return   s. d. coins lo (he banks and draw- outdecimal coins for change-giving. Therefore, although (hese coins willcontinue to be legal tender throughout the change-over period, (hey mayno longer be freely available except directly from banks.22. The general conclusion (which is supported by experience elsewhere)is that it would be wise for all organisations to plan for conversion on theassumption that (he change-over in (he United Kingdom will for most practical purposes be a rapid process.23. The change-over lo a decimal currency will lead inescapably loadjustments in the price structure of some goods and services, but (heDecimal Currency Board and (he Government are satisfied that decimalisa-tion need lead lo no overall increase in price levels.24. The official table recommended by the Decimal Currency Boardand accepted by (he Government for converting an   s. d. amounl to the nearest new halfpenny amount is:  PriVicesPenceNew Pence345678910II1 +2444i2$33*1/-5
25. Whilst the use of this table for price conversion will not be man-datory, all those concerned with the retail prices of goods and services in both the public and private sectors are expected to use it wherever practicable. It is recognised that the use of the table would not be practicable where its application would lead to unacceptable losses orunjustified increases in the sale of low price goods or services; or where itwould eliminate small steps or distort relationships in price or tariff structure-tures. Where departure from the table is unavoidable, it may often bepossible to balance increases or decreases in prices by changes in other elements relating to the price such as distance, lime -awl quantity or bycompensating tteerounon elsewhere. CPf&quot;26. The implications of decimalisation (and of demonetisation of thehalfpenny in August 1969) for price and tariff structures require careful study by management to determine those appropriate in a decimal currencysystem and how they should be attained. In certain areas it may bepossible to work towards the new structure whenever prices are underreview between now and D Day. Prices should not be increased in the interim period solely to provide amounts which convert exactly to payabledecimal amounts on D Day. Any increases must either be justified withinthe Governments policy on prices or counterbalanced by product or otheranalogous changes.Wages and salaries27. At present it is common practice in industry and commerce to usefractions of a penny which are not payable in coins when expressing both limeand piece rates of pay and special bonuses. This practice has evolvedbecause the expression of rates solely in payable amounts would seriouslylimit the scope for line negotiation of new or revised rales.28. There will be no statutory conversion of wage or salary rales. Where,on decimalisation, it is considered desirable to express   s. d. rates in the newcurrency they can be converted exactly to their  p equivalents. This maymean some increase in Ihe number of pay rates which include fractions, but itposes no new problems in the actual payment of wages, since it has alwaysbeen necessary to round to payable amounts fractions of a penny derivedfrom hourly or piece rales.29. The Government consider it important that decimalisation should notbe used as an excuse for the re-negotiation or general rounding up of wage rates. Any proposals for pay increases at the time of decimalisation shouldbe such as can be justified under the Governments Productivity, Prices and incomes policy.Compensation30. The Governments general policy on compensation was described in the White Paper &quot; Decimal Currency in the United Kingdom &quot;. It wasthat compensation as a general principle was not acceptable ; but that if itcould be shown to the Decimal Currency Board that there were grounds for giving some assistance in special cases, the Government would consider any recommendations the Board might care to make ; such cases, if there
were any at all, would be exceptional. The Decimal Currency Act 1967(section 5(l)(^/)) slates that it is a function of the Decimal Currency Board:&quot; to receive and consider, with a view lo such provision (if any) asmay hereafter be made by Parliament lor the payment of compensa-tion in special circumstances, representations with respect to expenditureor loss incurred or to be incurred by particular persons or classes ofpersons in consequence of the change ; &quot;.31. Towards the end of 1968 the Board informed the Government thaithey had reached the firm view, after long consideration, that a compensa-tion scheme confined to special cases would be undesirable in principle and would be inequitable and inefficient in practice. Since the Governmenthad ruled out a general compensation scheme, the Board recommendedthat there should be no compensation in any circumstances ; and theyrequested that, if this recommendation was accepted, the Government should invite Parliament lo relieve them of the function referred to above byrepealing section 5(l)(c/) of the 1967 Act.32. The Board explained that before making this recommendation theyhad studied the general problems of the change-over for two years and hadcarefully considered almost one hundred letters, enquiries and formalrepresentations about compensation, but no clear, defensible principles onwhich a special compensation scheme could be based had emerged. Noselective scheme could even out the incidence and effect of decimalisationcosts on all the organisations affected, and the Board could establish noprinciple which would justify making a contribution lo the change-overcosts of one organisation but not to the similar costs of other organisations.33. Since they had found it impossible to establish principles whichwould enable valid distinctions to be drawn between the organisations affectedby the change-over, the Board had come to the conclusion that they wouldbe unable to devise clear, defensible criteria which were capable of being administered economically and which would permit of a compensation scheme confined lo special circumstances. The Board considered that it wasnot possible to find a middle way between a policy of general compensation and one of no compensation.34. The Decimal Currency Board have satisfied themselves that in no circumstances would they be able to propose any scheme for special com-pensation based on clear principles and capable of being administered fairlyand soundly. It would obviously be out of the question for the Governmentto put any scheme before Parliament unless the Board and they were confident that it was sound in principle and administratively viable. TheBoard have reached their conclusion after long and detailed study of thequestion, and the Government consider that their recommendation should beaccepted.35. Accordingly, the Government propose to ask Parliament lo relieve the Board of their function of receiving representations about compensation.A provision to this effect has been included in the Decimal Currency Bill.
III.   Legislation for the Change-OverThe need for further legislation36. The Decimal Currency Act 1967 provided that the decimal currencysystem based on the pound sterling and the new penny should be introduced in 1971. Further legislation is necessary to deal with the detailed arrange-ments for effecting the change-over ; the Governments proposals are set outin the Decimal Currency Bill.37. It is necessary to provide for the legal tender status of the newcoinage, and for a statutory change-over period when, for most purposes,amounts can be expressed in either the old or the new currencies, and whenthe coins of both currencies are legal tender.38. The main provisions of the Bill concentrate on what happens when anamount of money has to be paid, and thus the general emphasis is on how to make payments (with particular reference to payments through the bankingsystem), rather than on how to make conversions from one currency to theother.   Broadly speaking, the main provisions:  (a) provide for the legal tender status of the new decimal coinage ;(b) provide for a statutory change-over period of dual-currency working(see paragraph 16 above) ;(c) deal with the conversion of   s. d. amounts on bills of exchange,promissory notes and other instruments of payment written beforebut not presented until on or after Decimal Day and with the con-version of   s. d. amounts in bank balances ;(rf) deal with the payment of certain   s. d. amounts during, and all  s. d. amounts payable after the end of, the change-over period.The recommended jp table which is lintended for use by all concernedwith the retail price^of goods and services is not included in the Bill, sincethe Bill does not cover the circumstances in which it will be appropriate to use this table (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).39. The following paragraphs describe what the legal position will be ifthe Governments proposals in the Decimal Currency Bill are approved byParliament.Legal tender and cash payments40. From the beginning of the change-over period the legal tender limits for bronze and cupro-nickel coins will be increased from one shilling andtwo pounds to twenty new pence (four shillings) and five pounds respectively.This is desirable because the decimal bronze and cupro-nickel coins will beof higher value than the present coins.41. During the change-over period,   s. d. coins, decimal coins and mixed  s. d. and decimal coins will be legal tender for either   s. d. or decimalamounts. Where a given amount is due in either currency, the exact or ahigher amount in either currency or a mixture of both will be legal tender.
42. In practice, the old and new coinages are exactly interchangeableonly in multiples of 6d. or 2+p. The Decimal Currency Board will therefore recommend that as a rule   s. d. and decimal bronze coins should be offeredonly in multiples of 6d. or 2-Vp in payment of decimal or   s. d. amountsrespectively. On this basis, it will be open to a shop-keeper who is stillworking in   s. d. and who prices an article at, say, 7s. 4d. to insist, if he so wishes, on being paid not less than that price. Similarly, a shop-keeperwho has converted to decimal currency working will be able to insist on being paid not less than the decimal price. Provided that the customer cantender a higher amount in either currency in multiples of either 6d.or 2^p he can pay for the article and he can be given the correct change.Thus a customer can pay for an article priced at 7s. 4d. with 37 p (7s. 6d.)and receive 2d. change, and for an article priced at 36]p with 7s. 6d. (37^-p)and receive one new penny change. In neither case will it matter whetherthe coins offered by the customer are   s. d. or decimal or a mixture ofboth. This is not a matter on which legislative provision is necessary, butthe Decimal Currency Board will give practical guidance on the cashhandling and related problems of the change-over.43. After the end of the change-over period only decimal coins andshillings and two shilling pieces will be in circulation as legal tender.&quot;44. The change-over to decimal currency will not affect bank notes, apartfrom the replacement of the ten shilling note by a coin which will havebeen completed by D Day.Payments through the banking system45. For the reasons set out in paragraph 18 above, on and after D day the banks will work exclusively in the new currency. In effect this means that there will be no change-over period for banks. On and from D Day  s. d. references in cheques, other bills of exchange, promissory notes, money or postal orders and certain other instruments of payment will be read asreferring to corresponding amounts in  p on the basis of exact equivalentsof pounds and amounts of two shillings; amounts or remaining amountsless than two shillings will be rounded to the corresponding whole new pennyin accordance with the whole new penny table at Appendix, Table B.Similarly,   s. d. amounts in bank balances may be treated as correspondingamounts in  p on the same basis. Bills of exchange, including cheques, andpromissory notes written on or after D Day will have to be expressed interms of the new currency ; if they are not they will be invalid.Bills of exchange and promissory notes falling due before 15th February197146. From the 11th to the 14th February 1971 inclusive the banks willbe closed for normal business to enable them to make their conversionarrangements (see paragraph 18). Provision needs to be made for thepayment of bills of exchange and promissory notes falling due on these four days. Those which fall due on the 11th or 12th February will be payable on the 10th February ; those which fall due on the 13th or 14th Februarywill be payable on the 15th February.
Periodical payments47. There is an important exception to the general approach described above to payments during the change-over period. To facilitate the arrange-ments for the conversion of periodical payments made through the bankingsystem (e.g., by banker&apos;s orders and the like), it will be possible to pay(whether through the banking system or in cash) an amount in the oldcurrency, which is one of a regular series of payments of the same amount,by paying a corresponding amount in the new currency calculated on thebasis of the whole new penny conversion table (Appendix, Table B). Thosewho prefer during the change-over period to continue to pay the original  s. d. amount in cash may do so. Salaries and wages are excluded ; so arepayments under friendly society and industrial assurance company contracts,for which special arrangements will be made.Payments after tlse end of the change-over period48.   s. d. coins will no longer be legal tender after the end of thechange-over period and in consequence there will then be   s. d. amountsfalling to be paid which cannot be paid exactly, e.g. 7d. In the absence of a statutory conversion, or agreement between those concerned, the only wayof paying such an amount would be to tender a higher amount in  p, e.g. for7d., 3p (7-2d.). The Government consider that to round up in all suchcases would be inequitable. The choice is between the conversion of theseamounts on the basis of either a whole new penny table or a new halfpennytable. If the latter table were adopted it would still be necessary, in strictlaw, to round up amounts ending in %p paid through the banking system. by using a whole new penny table for the payment of these amounts (i.e.total amounts payable not individual items comprising the total), as isproposed, a balance is struck which overall is equitable both to creditors anddebtors.
