G0NF3DENTSALIINTRODUCTIONf.     The re-orientation of our defence policy is now completed,and the Armed Forces can look forward to a period of stability and progress.      It continues to he the basic objective   ofUnited Kingdom defence policy to maintain the security of thiscountry, and to make our contribution to the defence of the free world and the prevention of war.     To secure this objective, we still need substantial, well equipped regular forces.2.     The essential feature of our current defence policy is a readiness to recognise that political and economic realitiesreinforce the defence arguments for concentrating Britain&apos;military role on Europe.THE DEFENCE BUDGET3.     For the first time since 1958-59 the Defence Budget islower than that of the previous year,  even at current prices;at  2,267m, the Defence Estimates 1969-70 are  hm lower than theEstimates for 1968-69.     At constant prices,  i.e0  after allowing for pay and price increases last year of  106m,  they representa decrease of  110m on the total for 1968-69.      They are also 92m below the target set &quot;by the Prime Minister in his Statementof 16 January 1968 (cmnd. 3515).     They are under 6 per cent ofthe Gross National Product compared with about 7 per cent in theEstimates for years up to 1965.The Defence of Europek.     This reduction in the percentage of the share of the nation&apos;wealth spent on defence reflects the practical steps taken to curtail our defence commitments East of Suez and to wind up our military, bases in the Persian Gulf and South East Asia.      1968was the first year since 1962 in which British troops were not actually fighting in a Colonial or ex-Colonial territory.

5.     In spite of this reduction in our total defence expenditure,the Government&apos;s decision to leave the bases East of Suez has enabled Britain substantially to improve her contribution to thedefence of Europe and the seas around it.      In the past year theadvantages of concentrating our military effort West of Suezhers been strongly underlined by the events in Czechoslovakia andthe increase of Soviet naval activity in the Mediterranean.6,     Nothing which was said or done by the Soviet leaders in1968 suggests that they envisage the use of war in order to makepolitical gains in Western or Southern Europe.     The Czechoslovakcrisis, however,  shows that if N.A.T.O.  ceased to pose unaccept-abie military risks to any aggressor, political or moral consider-relations alone would not necessarily rule out their using force.For the last 20 years the members of the Alliance have securedfor themselves total immunity against the sort of fate which hasbefallen the Czechoslovak people.     The function of N.A.T.O.,and of Britain&apos;s contribution to N.A.T.O.,  is to see that thisimmunity is maintained.7.     It is clear that the Soviet Government is prepared to invade an independent communist state against the wishes of its government and people,   if it runs no serious military risks.Indeed,  it has explicitly asserted its right to intervene by force in any country which it considers to be a member of&quot;The Socialist Commonwealth&quot;.      Since the demand for greaterpersonal and national liberty is growing throughout theCommunist world, this doctrine foreshadows the possibility offurther crises like that of August 1968.    In the future some such crisis may present a more urgent and immediate threat to the stability of Europe as a whole than we have seen so far.Moreover the painful process of adjustment to the new forces now/stirring-2-

stirring within the Communist world may produce changes ofpolicy or personnel in Russia, which would bring new dangers to world peace.     Meanwhile N.A.T.O. must accept a serious set-back to its hopes of a fruitful dialogue with the Warsaw Pactabout the reciprocal reduction of forces in Europe.8.     The year 1968 was notable for the continuing activity ofRussian warships and maritime aircraft in the Mediterranean.The Soviet Union has demonstrated that it can deploy and main-tain maritime forces as far from their home bases as the indian ocean.      Moreover,  Soviet ships have frequently been seen in international waters around the United Kingdom from the Orkneysto the Scillies and in the Irish and North Seas.      Soviet long-range aircraft are also regularly identified in the international air space off our coasts.9.     The military power of the Soviet Union continues to grow.This year the Russian Defence Budget went up some 6 per cent;the Soviet Scientific Budget, which includes a lot of military expenditure, went up by 11+ per cent.      In terms of percentage ofthe Gross National Product,  the defence spending of the warsaw pact countries together is nearly twice that of the european members of N.A.T.O.; it is 50 per cent higher on a per capitabasis.      The Warsaw Pact countries have about half a million menin their navies;   nearly 3? million in their armies and para-military forces;    and slightly over 1 million in their air forces and strategic rocket force.     The weapons with which these forces are equipped span the whole range of modern technology.     the invasion of Czechoslovakia was proof that the Military Staffof the Warsaw Pact can plan and conduct a major land/airoperation with ruthless efficiency./10.-3-

10.     The dangers which may arise from these increases inRussia&apos;s military capability are intensified by the politicalinstability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.      But thereis no reason why members of N.A.T.O.  should not continue to enjoy the same immunity from such dangers, provided only thatthe Mliance on both sides of the Atlantic maintains its political unity and sufficient military strength.11,     The commitment of North America to the defence of western europe remains the foundation of N.A.T.O.&apos;s unity and strength.The immense speed with which military operations can be con-ducted in the modern world - illustrated so impressively by theintroduction of a quarter of a million men into Czechoslovakiain three days - means that an alliance cannot hope to reacteffectively to any threat unless its members are prepared to commit themselves in detail and in advance to common action.It is not enough simply to agree on what action would be takenin a crisis;    it is essential also to make physical arrangements in peace-time for the collective command,  control and deployment of allied forces in time of tension or war,  and to test thearrangements regularly in joint exercises.12.     It is this structure of prior commitments which has givenN.A..T.0. its unique value as a deterrent to war.      The size,training and equipment of its military forces is equallycritical to its success.     N.A.T.O., &apos;s military plans and inten-tions will remain convincing as a deterrent only so long as theyare supported by adequate forces operating within a strategicconcept which is relevant to the geographical, physical and technological circumstances of a potential threat.13.     Britain has a central role to play in supporting the solidarity, strength and strategy which are essential to/N.A.T.O. &apos;S-h-

N. A.T.O.1s success.     Our decision to concentrate our defence effort in the N.A.T.O.  area enables us to fulfil this rolemore effectively than in the past.     We are the only european power with a role and military capabilities which cover thethree main N.A.T.O.  fronts from the Arctic to the Caucasus on land,  sea and air.-Ih.     We intend to make the most effective military contributionto the Alliance that is compatible with our economic strength.It will remain based on all-regular volunteer forces maintained at the highest professional standards and.equipped with the mostmodern weapons.     We contribute the only European nuclear forces to the integrated military organisation of the -Alliance.     Asbefits a nation with large maritime interests, the Royal Navyis the strongest Western navy in Europe and virtually all of itis commited to N.A.T.O.     The British Army of the Rhine andR.A.F. Germany are a standing guarantee of our involvement toour friends and neighbours across the Channel.      In additionmost of our forces based in the United Kingdom are formallycommitted to N.A.T.O.15a     In addition to the substantial increases announced earlier in 1968,    we are making further improvements in our contributionto the Alliance following the invasion of Czechoslovakia.Throughout the year an aircraft carrier or Commando ship orassault ship will be deployed almost continuously in theMediterranean and a guided missile destroyer will be added nextyear.     Maritime patrol aircraft of the R.A.. F. will be used inthe Mediterranean to help N.A.T.O. keep a watch on the Sovietfleet.&apos;    Later this Spring we shall be conducting a majorredeployment and reinforcement exercise in the Baltic region and from 1971 we will be providing an extra Harrier squadron/for use-5-

for use in Central Europe.     We have agreed to contribute to theestablishment of a new on-call Allied Naval Force in theMediterranean which was agreed in principle by the defence planning Committee of N.A.T.O.  on 16 January 1969.16,     Besides pointing to the need for continuing strength andsolidarity in N.A.T.O. as a whole,  the Czechoslovak crisis hasreinforced the Government&apos;s view that the European members ofN.A.T.O.  should do more to establish a common identity withinthe Alliance,      In the past year we have extended the scope ofour bilateral military staff talks.      Detailed discussion of future strategy,  tactics and the resulting concepts for weaponrequirements has enabled all the participants better to under-stand their partners&apos; thinking and thus to prepare the way fora better co-ordination of the individual national contrfbutions.17.     We hope that increasing collaboration on major items ofdefence equipment will add to the effectiveness of Europe&apos;contribution to the Alliance.     The advantages of collaborationare greatest on projects where the expenditure needed for develop-raent is so large in relation to the number of equipments requiredby a single country that it is wasteful, both of resources and technological effort,  for one nation to proceed alone.18.     Potentially the most important of our collaborativeventures is the multi-role combat aircraft.     Last summer wejoined a consortium of countries which had been formed toconsider the joint development of an advanced combat aircraft.The consortium now consists of the Federal Republic of Germany,the Netherlands,  Italy and the United Kingdom.     Good progress has been made in defining and harmonising the operational requirements of the member countries so that they could be met by a common basic design of a multi-role combat aircraft./These-6-

These requirements are the basis of feasibility studies whichare now being carried out jointly by nominated firms from theindustries of the four countries.      Parallel discussions aretaking place about the industrial arrangements which would benecessary to carry the project on into development and production.19.     Meanwhile European Defence Ministers are now holdingregular informal discussions on the occasion of the normalN.A.T.0. meetings with a view to establishing a common approach on matters of common interest within the organisation.OUTSIDE EUROPE20.     Outside Europe, we are still responsible for the securityof our dependent territories and we still have forces stationed in Hong Kong, Malaysia,  Singapore,  the Persian Gulf,  and the carribbean area.     We have made good progress in planning with our allies new arrangements to help preserve stability in the areas concerned after we have withdrawn from our main land bases east of Suez;   and the process of withdrawal is going ahead smoothly.21.     During the year ending April 1969,  over 5,500 Service men will have returned home from Malaysia and Singapore,  and the brigade of Gurkhas will have been further reduced by about 1,500officers and men.      All British units will have been withdrawnfrom the Commonwealth Brigade by April 1970:    the first unitconcerned,  the 3rd Battalion, The Light Infantry, will return tothis country from Terendak in April this year.22.     The run-down of support facilities in Singapore is proceed-ing smoothly.      The naval dockyard was formally transferred tothe Singapore Government in December 1968;    it is now beingoperated on a commercial basis by Sembawang Shipyard (Private) Ltd.with Messrs. Swan Hunter (international) Ltd.  as managing agents.The number of local civilians employed by the Services in/Malaysia

Malaysia and Singapore will have been reduced by about 5,500and the number of TJ.K.  civilians by nearly 300 by April 1969,chiefly as a result of the dockyard transfer;    about hOOlocally engaged military personnel will also have been dis-charged over the same period.23.     Compared with the situation at the end of confrontation,the number of those working in or for the Services in SouthEast Asia will have fallen by next April by a total of over33,000,  of whom more than 21,000 are British Servicemen and reductions will continue during the coming financial year.By the end of it we expect to have transferred free of charge to the Malaysian and Singapore Governments land,  facilities and associated equipment to the value of  19.8m,  in accordancewith the agreement described in Chapter II of Cmnd 3701.2k.     We are planning with our allies the joint Five-PowerExercise in the Far East to be held in 1970,  and also thecontinued provision of facilities for jungle warfare training.A second Five-Power Conference will be held in Canberra nextMay, at which we hope that further progress will be made in settling the longer term questions relating to the defence ofthe area.25.     We have fewer United Kingdom forces in the Persian Gulf -something under /l,0Q0j officers, men and associated civilians -than in the Far East,  so that the task of withdrawal should besimpler.     An outline plan has been prepared, but the final arrangements for our withdrawal must wait upon political develop-ments in the area.26... We are continuing to co-operate with the local Governmentsm making alternative arrangements for regional stability in thePersian Gulf and South East Asia.     We hope that after we have/left,-8-

left, the Trucial Oman Scouts, who operate in the seven TrucialStates, will form the basis of a federal force to defend theUnion of Arab Emirates.      At the request of the Rulers, we havemade available the services of Major-General Sir John Willoughbyand a team of experts to advise them on their defence forces.British officers will continue to assist in the development ofother local forces in the Gulf and of the armed forces of the sultan of Muscat.27.     Even when most of our forces are stationed in Europe andtrained for their operational roles within N.A.T.0., we must ensure that we still have forces which can operate effectivelyoutside Europe as required.     All three Services will therefore continue to train and exercise in many parts of the world.Next year they will carry out training in about 30 different countries.     Overseas training, together with the continuedrotation of units between B.A.O.R. , U.K.  and overseas garrisons,will not only relieve the strain on training facilities in britain and Western Europe, but will ensure that we shall haveforces capable of meeting our N.A.T.0. commitments as well aspreserving the security of our dependent territories and makingwhatever contributions we judge to be necessary and practicabletowards keeping the peace in other parts of the world.REORGANISATION OP SUPPORT FACILITIES28.     Although it is not easy to reduce overheads in directproportion to reductions in defence tasks or activities, theGovernment is determined that cuts in the teeth arms of theServices shall be matched by cuts in the tail.     Major reduc-tions will be achieved by the elimination of supporting facili-ties, -such as Singapore Dockyard,  in our overseas bases.      Butit will also he essential to reduce and reorganise the support/facilities

facilities in the United Kingdom.      In planning the necessary-changes we intend to minimise any consequent economic andemployment difficulties, which might otherwise interfere withthe regional planning objectives of the Government.29.   While some changes must wait for more detailed long term planning of the force structures which are required to meet the revised N.A.T.O.  strategy when our withdrawal and run-down are complete,  all three Services have been able to take some initialdecisions.30*    Royal Navy.     We have now completed our review of the futureof H.M. dockyards in the U.K.      In assessing the needs of theFleet, we have taken into account the fact that SingaporeDockyard has been transferred but Gibraltar Dockyard will con--tinue to be used.     All four home dockyards will still be required,but the size of the total dockyard labour force will, however,gradually fall within the framework of a major programme designedto increase efficiency and productivity.     There will be a total reduction of some 5,000 civilian personnel by the mid-1970s,mostly after 1971, when the fixed wing aircraft carriers will beleaving the Fleet.     The aim will be to achieve it by naturalwastage and selectivity of recruitment within the framework of productivity agreements with the Trade Unions.      These agreementswill also provide for the retraining of workmen and the relaxation of some working practices.31.   Certain decisions relating to the air stations of the fleet air Arm are set out in Chapter VIII, paragraph 31.32.   The Army.     The Army is planning changes in its training and support.organisation in the U.K.    Among the most prominent so farare the reorganisation of the R.A.O.C. depot system in homecommands and of Pay and Rocord offices.

33&apos;     Royal Air Force.     With the merger of R.A.F. flying training Command and Technical Training Command into a singleTraining Command, No.  25 Training Group has been disbanded.There will also be a concentration of establishments involving the closure of Stradishall, Gaydon and Acklington.3I4..     All these measures will result in eventual savings of nearly 15,000 military and civilian posts and in savings in personnel costs of about  18m a year.      They are described inmore detail in Chapter VIII.      In each case regional considera-tions were taken.into account before a decision was reached,THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SERVICES35.     The future role of the Armed Forces imposes vital andexacting duties on Service personnel.      Both in the leadershipand management of men,  and in the operation of equipment,  theforces have responsibilities as demanding as any enterprise inthe country, and they need to keep in the forefront of technolo-psychological  and administrative advance.      To carry out their tasksthey will still need over 3h0,000 officers and men,  even whenthe reductions now unde/way have been completed.36.     The forces are manned by volunteers.      It is therefore essential to attract and keep sufficient men of the rightcalibre.     This means that the housing,  conditions and pay of the forces must be comparable with what could be got in/outside

outside employment and that there should he a due recognitionof the particularly exacting standards and mobile way   of liferequired of the Serviceman in his professional activities.Forces&apos; pay is at present the subject of a standing reference made on 1 November 1967 to the National Board of Prices and incomes.37.     Re-engagement is satisfactory at present.     The number ofmen re-engaging in the Royal Navy has remained fairly eteadyover the past few years,  averaging about 2,700 a year.      Inthe Army, the numbers have improved steadily, rising from10,67^1 in the financial year 1965-66 to 13,585 in 1967-68.Re-engagements and extensions in the Royal Air Force havealso risen;    in the financial year 1967-68, the numbers werek, 222 compared with 3,963 in 1965-66.38.     But we must not only encourage the experienced men already in the forces to re-engage for further service, we have alsoto obtain a steady flow of new recruits, notwithstanding that,for the next few years,  the size of the armed Services willbe shrinking.      Otherwise the forces will not be properlybalanced in their age distribution,  career prospects and/variety-12-

variety of skills.   Even by the mid-1970s, when the run-downoutside Europe is completed, the forces will need to recruitat a steady rate of about 35*000 men annually.39.   Recruiting, however,  is made more difficult because thenumber of young men available and eligible to join the armed forces is declining owing to the fall in the birth rate inthe middle 1950s.    The forces are, therefore, competing ina shrinking labour market.    More school leavers are obtain-ing higher qualifications and more opportunities are opento them in civil life.    Moreover, young men not only staylonger in full time education, but owing to the industrial training Act their employers offer them many of the advan-tages traditionally associated with the Services foracquiring special skills and trade and educational training.The tendency to marry younger also affects recruiting adversely.kO.   Thus in 1968-69 we expect to obtain 85 per cent of ourrequirement for officer entries and to recruit only 28,000men against a total requirement of 38,000 for all three Services.-1.3---

.   As the satisfactory rate of re-engagement shows, thosewho have experienced Service life find it a challenging andworth-while occupation.   ThejfLife and career of the modernServiceman bearsg little resemblance to that of a quarter ofa century ago, the memories of which still colour the attitude to the forces of those who help to form public opinion.   as last year&apos;s recruiting figures show, our problem is to convince those with no experience of Service life, or whoseexperience is out-dated, that the Services can now look forward to a period of stability in which they offer a finecareer which is of the utmost importance to the nation and provides sound prospects of good pay and promotion.1+2.   Closer association between the forces, and the civilian population at every level can help to bridge the gap inunderstanding.   During the past 12 months the extensive aidgiven by the Services to the civil community in dealing withnatural disasters has been valuable in bringing the armed forces into closer contact with thousands of civilians.   we intend to continue and develop this type of co-operation.(This topic is treated in more detail in Chapter II).A3.- 1h -

The increasing study of defence problems outside theGovernment is helping to create an awareness in the country asa whole of the value of the Armed Forces and a comprehensionof the problems of defence and foreign policy,,   We are working closely with the Universities in many fields.   Fivedefence lectureships have been established with Ministry ofDefence support at the Universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh,London, Oxford and Southampton.    The Universities are them-selves now organising study conferences and seminars, and weare making more use of training courses at universities,business schools and polytechnics in management problems.kk.   We would also welcome the creation of an independentnational institute to take a lead in promoting discussions onActsdefence.    The Royal United Service Institution reorganizeditself to fill this role and has launched a public appeal for funds.    It has initiated a large programme of discussion and seminars and has published the first of a number of studies of defence problems.k5.   Each year more than U0,000 Service men and women leavethe forces to start a new career in civil life.    Most ofthem have more than twenty years of their working lives before/them,- 15 -

them, and they make a substantial contribution to the nation&apos;sstock of educated and skilled manpower.   We aim to see thatthey can transfer smoothly to civilian occupations in whichthey are able to make full and productive use of their qualifica-tions and experience.    They are given advice on all aspects of re-settlement, further training, and help in finding jobs.CONCLUSIONI4.6.   The basic aim of our defence policy is now fully established.It is to ensure the security of Britain by concentrating our majoreffort on the Western Alliance,    This aim is sensible, stable and vital.    It is sensible because it recognises the basicrealities of our economic and political interests in the worldtoday.    It is stable because the task is irreduciblej    we canwithdraw from East of Suez but not from our situation in europe on which our national security depends.    It is vital becausenwithout the security which comes from the strength to deteraggression, we put at risk the achievement of ail our other national purposes.hi.   Thus the future role of the Services, is more clearly defined   dthan for many years.    It will pose new challenges, demandingenergy, imagination and adaptability, and high standardsto match first-class equipment.   Our main task now is to adjust our forces and their support to the new objectives.We have made good progress with this task in the past year.- IS -

CONFIDENTIALIIDEPLOYMENT. OPERATIONS AND EXERCISESDEPLOYMENT1,     Our forces are now deployed throughout the world as follows^UNITED kingdom,     Royal Navy.    Frigates, submarines and coastal minesweeperson home sea service carry out training, trials and fishery prote-c-tion.    Ships of all classes on general service commissions aleospend part of their commission on operations with the Western fleet and in the United Kingdom for refit,  leave and work-up.   royal marines are based in the United Kingdom, ready to embark in H.M.Ships or to take part in other operations or exercises withStrategic Command.    Operational Fleet Air Arm squadrons are alsotemporarily based in the United Kingdom while their parent carrieris being refitted,.3.     The phased programme for re-organising the Naval ShoreCommands under a single Commandcr-in-Chief in Portsmouth is going ahead.   Further changes will be announced during the year.^*     Army.   As foreshadowed in the Statement on the defence estimates 1968 (Cmnd 35kO   Chapter II, paragraph i^),a re-organisationof the Home Command structure took place on 1 April 1968.   Themajority of the field force headquarters and units stationed in theUnited Kingdom now come under the command of the newly createdArmy Strategic Command.   This command includes the land forces based in the United Kingdom, which have now been earmarked for assignmentto N.A.T.O.   Other front line units and the training organisationare also stationed in the United Kingdom, together with unitsengaged on public duties and on logistic tasks.    In addition, ourreserve forces of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserves aretrained to augment and support our regular forces committed toAt   h    m

CONFIDENTIALN.A.T.O. and also provide certain re-inforcements for N.A.T.O.headquarters. Further field force infantry and armoured units are stationed in Northern Ireland.5-     Royal Air Force.    Bomber and Fighter Commands have now beenamalgamated into a unified Strike Command.    Signals Command, asa functionally independent No. 90 (Signals) Group, became partof Strike Command in January 1969.   The introduction of the firstPolaris submarine in mid-1968 was the initial step towards thetransfer to the Royal Navy of responsibility for the UnitedKingdom contribution to the Western strategic nuclear deterrent.The programme for re-shaping Strike Command&apos;s front line to reflect the Command&apos;s changed role has beguri^^-^wT^botdisbanded in the latter half of 1968.   Luring the first quarterof 19S9 Vulcan aircraft of Strike Command will be deployedpermanently to the Near East Air Force in order to replace theCanberras in the strike role, which wo contribute to CENTO..   As a preliminary to taking Drear&quot; responsibility for the maritime &quot;pr*y*ieartLonrole from the Fleet Air&quot; Arm, the Royal Air Force will form its first squadrons of air-defence Phantoms and strike Buccaneers inthe latter part of 1969-   This year the ground-attack forces ofNo. 38 Group (Air Support Command) will be strengthened by theintroduction of the Phantom and Harrier.   From aircraft based inthe United Kingdom we contribute strike, ground-attack, reconnais-sance, short range transport and air defence forces to N.A.T.O.They are either assigned, or earmarked for assignment, to all three major N.A.T.O. Commanders.EUROPE^&apos;    jjozal Navy.    Ships of the Western Fleet operate in sea areasof the Atlantic Ocean and around Europe.    Ships are earmarked forassignment to the appropriate N.A.T.O. command to meetcommitments in the Channel, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean.   A3/frigate .....e

Ground forces consist of the British Army of the Rhine(B.A.O.R.) and an independent brigade in Berlin.   B.A.O.R.  is organised into a corps of three divisions, each of two brigades but,with the agreement of our allies,  one of these brigades togetherwith a heavy air defence regiment is stationed in the UnitedKingdom.    It remains, however, an integral part of B.A.O.R.8*     Royal.,Air Force.   A tactical air force, including strike,fighter reconnaissance, photographic reconnaissance and air defencesquadrons,  is assigned to N..A.T.O. and based in Germany as partof the Second Allied Tactical Air Force,   Furthermore, Wessexhelicopters of No. 18 squadron, though based in the United. Kingdom,are earmarked for assignment to N.A.T.O.  and ready to move toGermany at short notice.MEDITERRANEAN AND NEAR EAST5-     Royal Navy.   As announced, last November, our maritime presence in the Mediterranean v/ill include an aircraft carrier or commandoship or assault ship almost continuously from January 1969, thelast two with Royal Marine Commandos embarked.    In addition, twofrigates are stationed permanently in the Mediterranean and ear-marked for assignment to SACEUR;    a guided-missile destroyer willhe added next year.    Temporary additional deployments of frigates,submarines and other ships will also be made.    These naval deploy-ments will add substantially to N.A.T.O.&apos;s defensive capability onthe southern flank.10c   4?JS .   There are small garrisons in Gibraltar, Malta, Libyaand Cyprus.   The garrison in Cyprus provides the necessary securityrequired for our Royal Air Force units supporting CENTO.    The Army&apos;s/contribution ....

contribution of one infantry battalion, one armoured car squadron and the logistic support for the United Nations Force in Cyprus(UNFICYP) was reduced in October 1968 by approximately one infantrycompany and some 36 soldiers in the Headquarters and logisticunits.   This was part of an overall reduction of the force.11&apos;   Royal Air Force.    The forces in the area consist of strikereconnaissance and fighter squadrons, a medium-range tacticaltransport squadron, a Bloodhound MK2 surface-to-air missile squadron,a helicopter search-and-rescue flight and two Royal Air ForceRegiment squadrons.   Four helicopters support the United Nationspeace-keeping force.   By the end of the financial year 1968-69,the Canberra strike aircraft will have been replaced by Vulcan B2s(see paragraph 5 above).   A long-range maritime - reconnaissance squadron is stationed in the Mediterranean in accordance withN.A.T.0. policy.   This squadron will provide long-range search-and-rescue facilities, in addition to its normal tasks.PERSIAN GULF12.   Our land forces in the Persian Gulf consist of armoured cars,artillery, engineers and infantry in Bahrein and Sharjah under the unified command of Headquarters British. Forces Gulf.    These units have taken advantage of the challenging training conditions in thearea, and have been able to render considerable training assistanceto local forces.    British officers and non-commissioned officerscontinue to serve with local forces.    The air forces in the Gulf,&quot;based in Bahrein and Sharjah,  include ground attack and fighterreconnaissance aircraft, fixed and rotary wing tactical transport,long-range maritime-reconnaissance aircraft and search-and-rescuehelicopters.   Regular detachments are made from other theatres.   a continuous naval presence in the Gulf is maintained by frigates and mine-oountermeasures vessels operating from Bahrein./FAR EAST .....

FAR EAST13,   Royal Navy.    The Far East Fleet includes a Commando ship, anassault ship, destroyers, frigates, submarines, mine-counter-measures vessels and supporting ships.    They operate in the indian and Pacific Ocean areas as required and continue to undertakepatrol duties in the Mozambique Channel.   Snips of the royal australian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy operate with theFar East Fleet.    In addition the 3rd Commando Brigade is stationed in Singapore.   From July this year, the minesweeper forces will&quot;be based on Hong Kong instead of Singapore and will be reduced in numbers.1h.   Army.,    The reduction of our forces, which are to be withdrawnfrom halaysia and Singapore by the end of 1971, has continued.In the twelve months- ending last Janaary we Ir-rouglri back 1,35-0 menand 1,575 dependents.     With the agreement of the localunions concerned, we have discharged 2,897 locally employed civilianand uniformed personnel, who have received compensation.   FewerU.K.-based civilians are being employed in the area.    The reductionin the Brigade of Gurkhas has continued towards the level of 6,000men by the end of 1971.    This has necessitated a decrease in thegarrison we maintain in Brunei.   During the year the Brigade ofGurkhas has been reduced by 1 ,500 men.15.   The decrease in terrorism has permitted us to .restore thegarrison of Hong Kong to its normal strength for part of the year.We have, however, thought it prudent to reinforce the garrison inthose periods during which experience has shown that tension is most likely.   A battalion from the United Kingdom has taken itsturn in this commitment.16.   The &quot;troops which had to be sent to Mauritius to maintain lawtad order in 1 968 have been withdrawn./&quot;[&quot;7n       m *  0 O *- 21  -

The announcement of an accelerated withdrawal from the far east by the end of 1971, with the resulting   change in military commitments in the area, dominated events in West Malaysia and singapore.   Except for Mauritius, the area was stable, andthe Services have had few operational tasks.   They were mainlyoccupied with the formidable problems associated with the with-drawal.   They were nevertheless able to help the local people inmany ways..   A Royal Engineer survey troop from Singapore co-ordinated/and.....- 23 -

and connected the mapping of Thailand and Malaysia,.    The work was done in close co-operation with the Thai and Malaysian authorities,who contributed to the cost and gave logistic support.    Subsequently,in conjunction with the Singapore Government, who paid part of thecost, the troop started to resurvey Singapore.   The cartographicand map reproduction sections in Singapore produced large numbersof maps, town plans and charts for the Services and civil users.A small Royal Engineer bomb disposal team, which has been working on Penang Island for the past twenty months, completed the hazardoustask of removing and disposing of some 3,000bombs, mines, torpedoesand other explosive devices that were left behind in collapsedhunkers and tunnels by the Japanese in 19U.5.   /mother force of royal Engineers stationed in the Far East is undertaking a largedevelopment project in West Malaysia.    It will provide excellenttraining and v/ill involve the construction of houses, roads, tracksand a community centre.2I+.   In East Malaysia, the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force unitwas completed on 1 June 1968, and Labuan   became the responsibilityof the Royal Malaysian Air Force,Hong Kong25.   The garrison continued to assist the police to control thefrontier and to maintain law and order throughout the Colony.Battalions took turn and turn about to man exposed positions cover-ing areas in which violent disturbances can occtir often instantan-eously and without warning.   The garrison also carried out patrolsin the remote areas of the New Territories and helped the H*ng KongGovernment to deal with subversion in the small scattered villagesthere.   The garrison and the police, acting with fairness,discipline and detelimination, gained and held the confidence ofthe population.   Throughout the year Royal Air Force helicopters/assisted .....

assisted the garrison and the police in their internal securityoperations and training.   The defence forces were reinforced &quot;byelements of the Royal Air Force Regiment from Singapore.   visits by Royal Air Force aircraft on detachment and the continual presenceof a Royal Naval guardship and two mine-countermeasures vessels,augmented by periodic visits of ships of the Far East Fleet, kept up public confidence.Thailand26,   Royal Engineers completed their programme of road building inthe north east of the country and withdrew from Thailand at theend of April 1968;.   Apart from providing the squadrons working on it with very valuable training, the road has already broughtthousands of villagers into contact with the mainstream of theircountry&apos;s life and has been of great benefit to the Thai Government.This was a successful and valuable project in the peaceful use ofmilitary forces overseas.    The force employed, which includeddetachments from other corps, deserves the highest credit for its work in such trying climatic conditions.Mauritius27.   Increasing communal   disorders, exacerbated by economic difficulties, compelled the Government of Mauritius to ask for theassistance of British Forces in maintaining law and order on the island.   A company from the 3rd Battalion,    The Light Infantry(formerly 1st Battalion, The King&apos;s Shropshire Light Infantry) was accordingly flown in by transport aircraft of the Far East AirForce from Singapore on 22nd January, and H.M. ships were moved to&quot;the area.   The immediate task was to impose order in the urbanparts &quot;of the island, where clashes between rival factions werecausing loss of life and damage to property.   A series of cordonand search operations, coupled with patrolling and sudden read/blocks .....

blocks, stemmed, the rising tide of violence.    These operations,which were carried out with great determination and understanding,won the respect and admiration of local citizens and security forcesalike.28.   At the request of the Government of Mauritius, a furthercompany was sent to the island.    Operations were then extendedinto the plantations and jungle-covered hills of the countryside;patrols, aided by helicopters,  covered the rural areas in supportof the local security forces.    The well-co-ordinated actions ofthe Services and local forces restored the situation.    One company was withdrawn, in August, and the remainder of the force in mid-November.Rhodesia:    the Oil Embargo29.   The patrol of the Mozambique Channel off Beira was continuouslymaintained in all weathers by ships of the Royal Navy, supported by ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Services.    Shackleton aircraft of Coastal Command and the Far East Air Force also played a vitalpart in this operation.    These combined operations successfullyprevented the arrival at Beira of oil destined for Rhodesia, inaccordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution ofApril 1 966.British Solomon Islands Protectorate30.

The emphasis hasbeen placed on   advising     and assisting local forces to preparethemselves for our announced departure from the Persian Gulf &quot;by december 1971.    The Trucial Oman Scouts under the control ofBritish officers     patrolled       die 32,000 square miles of hilland desert and continued peacefully to resolve potential tribaldisputes within the Trucial States.   Coastal Command Shackle tons-ass is ted the Trucial Oman Scouts by searching for dissident tribes-men and illegal immigrants.    The Army and the Royal Air Forcecontinue to provide a small number of British personnel for theforces of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.3U.   Naval frigates and coastal minesweepers carried out patrolsto prevent the smuggling of arms in the Gulf.35.   A detachment of four Canberra PR9 aircraft from Near EastAir Force carried out an aerial photographic survey of Muscat andOman, the Trucial States, Qatar and Bahrein, covering an area ofover 138,000 square miles in about 100 sorties.Iran36.

employed.    The rapid response to the appeal for help undoubtedlyhelped to restore law and order.    The troops remained to cover theelections on 22 May, which passed off peaceably, and were withdrawnon 1-3 June 1968.U2.   Minor rioting also broke out in British Honduras at the endof April 1968.    This followed the publication of the U.So Mediatorsreport     on     the     dispute between Guatemala and the United Kingdomover British Honduras.    Troops from the garrison company (from 1st Battalion, The Green Howards) stood by but were not requiredto take action.h3.   On 1 March 1968, 53 Field Squadron (Airfields) Royal Engineersmoved to Beef Island in the Virgin Islands to aid the localauthorities by reconstructing the airfield.   This unit was put onstandby for assistance in aid of the civil power when there weredisturbances in the Islands, but in the event it was not required,kk&apos;   A frigate patrol was maintained in the Bahamas to prevent the illegal use of the small islands by intruders.    In September, a party of these was surprised and captured by Royal Marines from.H.S. Eskimo.    The presence of the frigates made a large contribu-tion to the maintenance of internal security, particularly in bermuda, Bahamas and St. Vincent.   A sizeable- squadron of WesternFleet ships visited the West Indies and Central America early in1968 and carried out exorcises with the local navies.    In February1968 three Shackletons, which had been exercising in the Caribbean,paid agood-will visit to the Venezuelan Air Force in Caracas.^5.   H.M.S.

Lightning squadrons of Royal Air Force, Germany maintained analert force to intercept, interrogate and identify aircraft viola-ting the airspace of the Federal Republic of Germany.UNITED KINGDOM50.   Throughout the year coastal minesweepers of the Royal Navy&apos;sfishery protection squadron patrolled the United Kingdom fishery limits.   With the introduction of the new United Kingdom fishery/limits .....

limits in 1961+,  the fishery patrol line was extended to over 3,000miles.   Since then, over 80 arrests for illegal fishing and poachingwithin the U.K. fishery limits have &quot;been made, most of them endingin successful prosecutions.   Frigates of the Western Fleet carriedout fishery protection patrols on fishing grounds off North Norway,Iceland and Greenland.51.   Mine-countermeasures vessels, including those from the EoyalNaval Reserve, were engaged in Operation NEW BROOM in May 1968with ships from the French, Netherlands, Belgian and Norwegiannavies.   The object of this highly-successful operation, was to clear the new traffic separation merchant ship routes off theNetherlands coast of war-time minefields.    Mine-hunters, divingvessels and mooring and salvage vessels have been periodicallyemployed in locating and recovering crashed aircraft, mines andmissiles.    The Aer Lingus Viscount aircraft, which had crashed intothe sea off South East Ireland, was found in an operation thatlasted from March to August;    many vital major components of theaircraft were recovered under most difficult diving conditions.Other operations involved a Royal Naval Sea Vixen in the Irish Sea,a Royal Air Force Gnat off North Wales and two Wasp helicopters,one off the coast of the Netherlands and the other off Portland.A number of war-time mines encountered by fishing vessels had alsoto be dealt with;       it   required long periods of mine-hunting torelocate and countermine them.52.   H.M. ships and Royal Air Force aircraft of Coastal Commandcontinued their surveillance of surface vessels and. submarinesoperating round the United Kingdom.53.

In June,  the Royal Air Force won both the team and individualtrophies in the International Helicopter Rescue Competition againstteams from Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands,Sweden, Denmark and the United States.56.   The normal diverse pattern of operations was carried out bytransport aircraft during the year.    These included the routinecarriage of Service personnel and their dependents to and from over-seas, any necessary airlift for support equipment, and medicalevacuation flights.57.   The VC 10 force reached its present planned normal workinglevel in April 1 968 and it has been flying some 35 scheduled services between the U.K. and the Persian Gulf and Far East (including HongKong) each month.   The aircraft has proved to toe popular with crewsand passengers alike and has presented few difficulties.    TheBritannia, a flexible aircraft to operate, made about h-5 scheduledflights to all overseas areas monthly.   Other scheduled services were undertaken by Argosies, Self as ts&apos; and Andovers with increasingsupport from the Hercules.   All 66 of the latter have been delivered to schedule.MILITARY AIDiTOi THE CIVIL ^COMMUNITY58.   The three Services gave much help during the fjjoods.- In theSouth West in July 1968 and South East in September 196&amp;*   Theyconstructed 12 bridges and provided amphibious and ordinary vehicles;over 250 space heaters to help dry out houses;    communications;Royal Air Force aircraft to carry out photographic reconnaissance of the flooded areas;    accommodation for the homeless and assistancem the evacuation of families.

also came to the assistance of the civil authorities in Glasgowfollowing the hurricane in January 1968.   They gave help in routeclearance, demolition, repairs to buildings, and removing furnitureto storage from damaged buildings, and assisted    - the police.    TheRoyal Air Force flew reconnaissance sorties and provided the civil authorities with aerial photography of the damaged areas.59.   Royal Navy helicopters made many sorties on rescue and emergency missions in aid of civil authorities round the world,including the night rescue in extremely unfavourable conditions ofa disabled lighthouse keeper from Longships Light in April.    InJanuary 1963, H.M.S. Diana answered a distress call from theburning Spanish tanker Bahia Gaditana in the Mediterranean.    Theship&apos;s company, in circumstances of great danger, promptly extin-quished the fire, saving the tanker and preventing serious loss of life.60.   Royal Air Force Shackletons, marine craft and helicopters of coastal Command and the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Team (allvolunteers) rescued 26 servicemen and 176 civilians;    72 civilianswere moved to hospital by helicopter.    In June a Shackleton found the solo yachtsman Joan de Kat in mid-Atlantic despite the factthat he was 200 miles away from his reported position.    Searchand rescue forces from Cyprus took part in the search for the israeli submarine Dakar and for a Jordanian and an Egyptian air-liner;   bodies from the latter were recovered and taken to alexandria by Royal Air Force marine craft.   After rescuing the crew of the Greek MV Prodromos.  a Royal Air Force marine craftcrew returned to the vessel and succeeded in making it seaworthyenough to &quot;be towed to Cyprus.

the public in time of emergency should attract publicity.   Never-theless the routine tasks which they perform for the civil community in the U.K., although they may not be publicized nationally, arejust as important.   While they are often on a lesser scale than the aid rendered during a serious emergency, they are of great value to the local people who benefit from them.   At the same time, they make excellent training for the Servicemen and foster good relationsbetween the armed forces- and the public.   Out of more than 200examples last year, the building of an airstrip for the remotecommunity of TJnst in the Shetlands, projects to improve localamenities and encourage tourist development in Argyllshire, andthe assistance given in the construction of a Youth Centre in glasgow deserve mention.   Although individually the tasks mayoften be small, collectively they represent an impressive effort by the Services in helping the community.62.   The Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1968 included aprogress report on a study which was being carried out within theMinistry of Defence with the object of improving and co-ordinating the ways in which the Services can help the civil community in peacetime.   One result of this study has been the production of apamphlet designed to let civil authorities and organizations inthe United Kingdom know what assistance, both routine and emergency,the Services may be able to offer,  the conditions which would apply,and how it should be sought.   Copies have been sent to the other government Departments and over 100 outside bodies (including theTrades Union Congress, Confederation of British Industries andLocal Authorities Associations) who were consulted during thePreparation of the pamphlet and for whose co-operation we are most grateful.THE YEAR&apos;S EXERCISES63.   As in previous years, British forces in 1968 engaged in an extensive programme both at home and abroad.    In addition to/National

National and Commonwealth exercises,  it included many arranged by international treaty organisations, particularly N.A.T.O&apos;.Such exercises help to strengthen the organisations concerned and provide valuable training for our forces,6U.   The following is a summary of the most important exercisesof the year:a. N.A.T.0,    Seven maritime exercises, includingthe largest yet staged by the organisation;    two allied command Europe Mobile Force exercises;    two airexercises;    and a large scale command post exerciseb, CENTO.

Three jointforce exercises, one in the Mediterranean, one inAustralia and one in the United Kingdom;    and fivereinforcement exercises, two to B.A.O.R. and three to the Far East.N.A.T.O. EXERCISES65.   In September, British naval and air forces took part in thelargest maritime exercise yet staged by N.A.T.0.    It extended fromthe Norwegian Sea to the Western North Atlantic and included aircraft carrier operations, in which the strike carrier, H.M.S. Eagle, was provided by the Royal Navy;    control and protection of shipping;anti-submarine warfare;    mining and minesweeping;    and logistic support operations.    The Royal Navy employed every available ship,and aircraft of Coastal Command provided the major air contribution.Merchant ships were chartered for convoy operations, and navalreservists took part both ashore and afloat.66. British units assigned to the Allied Command Europe MobileForce trained both in Canada and in Norway where,  in June, they/took .....

took part in a major exercise.,   A commando ship with its embarkedRoyal Marine Commando Group and helicopter squadron was alsoengaged for the first time in a N.A.T.0. exercise in northern waters.   Between September and November, 6 Brigade were deployedto Germany in what is to become an annual training period.    36Heavy Air Defence Regiment carried out a similar training periodearlier in the year.    11,000 Territorial and Army VolunteerReservists trained in Germany, some of them participating in theN.A.T.0. command post exercise referred to in paragraph 69.67.   Squadrons from Royal Air Force Germany had several successesin the competitive exercises run by Allied Forces Central Europe.At the annual Tactical Weapons Meet, they provided the winningstrike crew and the highest-scoring strike squadron;    in thephotographic competition a Hunter FR 10 squadron took first place;and in the tactical evaluation exercises high efficiency ratingswere maintained.68.   A Royal Navy helicopter squadron went to Denmark in May inorder to take part for the first time in a N.A.T.0, exercise whichinvestigated the use of helicopters against fast patrol boats in November, while H.M.S. Eagle was in dockyard hands, allthe squadrons of her air group were deployed to airfields inSardinia and Malta to provide air support for a major exercise inthe Mediterranean.69.   All three Services took part in the N.A.T.0, biennial commandpost exercise which was held in October.    In addition to the largerexercises summarised above, British naval, land and air forcesparticipated in numerous minor N.A.T.0.  exercises in and overEurope and in the surrounding seas.CENTO EXERCISES70.   As in the past, British naval and air forces were employed in/the.....

the three major CENTO exercises in 1968,,    The first of these, inwhich units of the Near Par East Air Force were engaged, was an air defence exercise0    The second was a search-and-rescue exercise,involving Royal Air Force parachute medical and mountain rescueteams;    and the third was an anti-submarine and minesweepingexercise in the Persian Gulf, in which surface ships and a submarineof the Royal Navy and maritime aircraft of the Royal Air Forceoperated.S.E.A.T.0. EXERCISES71.   British personnel participated in a major S.E.A.T.O. commandpost exercise in Thailand, support for which   was provided by transport aircraft of the Far East Air Force.NATIONAL AND COMMONWEALTH EXERCISES72.   A joint U.K./U.S. exercise in arms control inspection techniquestook place in southern England during the period June to September1968.   The aim of the exercise - which was called FIRST LOOK - wasto test in the field different inspection techniques for arms controland to obtain practical experience of verificationproblems.    Units of the Army o.nd the Royal Air Force were engagedin this exercise, which was visited by Members of Parliament andby delegations from our N.A.T.O.  allies and from members of the eighteen National Disarmament Committee.   Reconnaissance Canberrasand Victors of the Royal Air Force provided over 12,500 photographicPrints for the test.73.   During the year.   Army units undertook 8h overseas exercisesin more than twenty different countries.    These included territorial and Auxiliary Volunteer Reserves specialist units exercising in cyprus.   Similarly, Naval and Air forces exercised in areas as farapart as Australasia  and the Caribbean, transport aircraft of air support Command being engaged in an average of 21 exercises a month.

7U.   Extensive use was made of the Libyan training area by unitsof Strategic Command and units in B.A.O.R.75.    In April, the Commanders-in-Chief Committee (West) conductedan exercise in the Mediterranean.    The exercise involved the deployment from the United Kingdom of one major and three minorArmy units as well as Fleet Air Arm and Royal Air Force aircraft.It was followed by an air defence phase and training In desertwarfare.76.   Our forces- have exercised with those of Australia from timeto time.    In October, units stationed in the Far East engaged ina major combined exercise, in which 3rd Commando Brigade royal marines made an amphibious assault, which was followed by a land battle in Queensland.    Shackletons from Singapore deployed toQueensland and operated with Royal Australian Air Force maritimeaircraft in the air/sea phase of this exercise.77.   Vulcan squadrons carried out deployment exercises to theMediterranean and the Far East, and twice joined in air defenceexercises with the Royal Australian Air Force in Northern AustraliaLightning squadrons also carried out deployment exercises to europe the Mediterranean, Persian Gulf and the Far East and, togetherwith Fleet Air Arm Buccaneers and Sea Vixens, practised air-to-airrefuelling with Victor tanker aircraft.   Lightnings, assisted by thetankers,      flew non-stop from the U0K. to Bahrein and for the first time across the Atlantic to Toronto.73.   Air Support Command aircraft undertook a varied programme ofnew continuation training flights to all parts of the world.    on one of these a Belfast with a double crew undertook a normal trunkroute flight to Singapore and back with only one and a half hour&apos;sturn-round throughout.   A Hercules on a Polar training flightcarried huskies and stores for the British Trans-Arctic Expedition.79.   In August, four naval Buccaneer aircraft, supported by tankeraircraft of the Royal Air Force, were flown by stages from the U.K.to land directly on board H.M.S. Hermes off Penang.CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALIIIMINISTRY OF DEFENCENUMBERS1.     The Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1967(cmnd. 3357) forecast a reduction of about 80,000 (30,000 U.Kemployees and 50,000 local entrants) in the number of civiliansrequired for the support of combat forces in this country and in overseas commands by the mid-1970s.     The Supplementary statement on Defence Policy 1968 (Cmnd 3701) forecast that the targetwould be reached in 1973-7U and subsequently exceeded.      By1 April 1969, the reductions achieved are expected to be about27,500, (8,500 U.K.  employees and 19,000 local entrants).     Afurther decrease of about 7,500 (2,700 U.K.  employees and h,800local entrants) is expected during the coming financial year.2.     The Headquarters numbers on 1 April 1969 are expected to total about 16,200.     This figure is about 500 less than the headquarters total on 1 April 1968.3.     Outside Headquarters, the numbers of U.K.-based employeeson 1 April 1969^.are expected to total about 255,2+00.organisation+.     Steady progress has been made in implementing the changesin organisation announced in the Statement on the defence estimates 1968 (Cmnd 352+0).5.     Service Boards.     The membership of the Service Boards hasbeen reduced by the abolition of the appointments of DeputyChiefs of Staff:    their former responsibilities have been-allocated between other Board members.&apos;     Statistics.      A post of Director of Defence Statistics was created in June 1968.     The former separate statistical brancheshave since been combined and re-organised on functional lines.This new service comprises three groups concerned respectively/with

with manpower statistics (for the individual Services and defence as a whole), with equipment statistics,  and with thedevelopment of statistical systems (such as mathematicalcomputer applications).      Statistical analysis and forecastingplay an important part in management and planning,  especiallyin the fields of manpower and logistics.     These changes shouldimprove the service provided and give greater flexibility inthe use of scarce professional statistical resources,7.       The Defence Manpower Studies TTnit has been integratedinto the new defence statistics organisation, which has taken over responsibility for the manpower work mentioned in theStatement on the Defence Estimates 1968 (Cmnd 3701 Chapter IX).8.       Organisation and Methods.     The Organisation and MethodsDivision at Headquarters and the civilian training branches ofthe Wavy, Army, Air Force and Central Departments have beenbrought together and re-organised as management services divisions to serve the whole Ministry:    one division deals with organisa-tion,  another with management techniques and training,  and a third with computer development.     These divisions are also being strengthened in order to improve efficiency and give greater impetus to the introduction of the most up-to-datemanagement techniques in all parts of the Ministry.     A newdivision has also been set up to foster schemes for increasing productivity in defence industrial establishments.NEW FORM OP DEFENCE ESTIMATES9.       In the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1968 (Chapter I paragraph 31), we stated our intention of introducing,  subjectto the approval of Parliament, a unified defence vote structure.We have accordingly framed the following plan to &apos;relate the/Votes- kO -CONFIDENTIAL

seven Votes:		Vote	1	Pay and allowances of the Armed ForcesVote	2	Retired pay, pensions,  etc.Vote	3	Administrative services,  stores and suppliesVote	h	Pay of civiliansVote	5	Equipment and related stores and servicesVote	6	Royal Ordnance FactoriesVote	7	Purchasing (Repayment) services the Accounts will,  of course, correspond in form with these Esti-mates, and,  in accordance with Civil Vote practice, the account for each Vote will he certified by the appropriate AccountingOfficer.     The Second Permanent Under-Secretary (Administration)will he the Accounting Officer for Votes 1,  2 and 3;    the permanent under-Secretary for Vote h,  covering the c^mon oorvioo of the pay of civilian staff;   and the Second Permanent Under-Secretary(Equipment) for Votes 5, 6 and 7.10.   These proposals were approved by the Estimates Committee on23 October 1968 (H.C. khk) and by the Public Accounts Committeeon 25 November 1968 (H.C.  27).      They are now before the SelectCommittee on Procedure./RAT 10NA.L IS AT ION- k1  -CONFIDENTIALVotes more closely to the organisation of the Department.      Thethree Votes A (which show the maximum number of officers and menon the strength of each of the Armed Services at any time duringthe year) will continue to be presented by the Secretary ofState for Defence.     The money Votes will form a separate Classof general Estimates, presented by the Financial Secretary to theTreasury, and,  like the Civil Votes, they will be initially fundedto cover expenditure between the beginning of the financial yearand the passage of the Appropriation Act,  from a Vote on Account.The new Defence Class of Estimates will consist of the following

RATIONAL I SAT ION11.     Paragraphs 28 - 3k  of Chapter I describe the majordecisions which have been recently taken as a further step towards reducing the size of the U..K. base and cutting the costof the resources devoted to support.     The following paragraphsrecord further progress in rationalising responsibilities and activities in the support field.      Rationalisation is one ofthe ways by which we are seeking greater economy and efficiency;it usually means that one Service acts on behalf of all three services, and separate single-Service organisations are nolonger maintained.-LOCtISTICS12.     Aircraft Support.     The Royal Air Force, which is alreadyresponsible for the provisioning,  stock control and stockholdingof Army air stores,   has now  taken over similar responsibilities for the Royal Navy&apos;s Phantom aircraft and will do so forall other naval air stores, when fixed-wing operational flyinghy the Fleet Air Arm comes to an end.      The base repair andoverhaul of army aircraft is also a Royal Air Force responsibility.Consideration is being given to a more economical apportionmentof aircraft repair and overhaul work between the Royal Navy andthe Royal Air Force.13.     Food,     Trials of Rlternative methods of supplying food tothe Services in the United Kingdom which, with the co-operation ofthe Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes, have been conducted inArmy Northern Command and in five Royal Air Force Stations, havenow been completed;    the results are being evaluated.Hovercraft Support.     The Navy Department has become responsible for base repair and overhaul of all Service hover-craft engines.     There were overriding practical reasons for/leaving

leaving the logistic support of existing hovercraft for thetime being with the Army Department as major users:    thisarrangement is, however, being reviewed.      The support of any future hovercraft,  such as the BH7, will be managed by theNavy Department from the outset.15.     Motor Transport.      The rationalisation of Service motor transport under Army management is being extended to includeother types of associated equipment,  such as mobile cranes andfork lift trucks.     The Army Department expects to assumecomplete responsibility for the supply of motor transport sparesby May 1970.      Plans are also being put into effect to make thebest use of available motor transport repair resources in theILK.  and thus to achieve economies in workshop facilities and manpower.     Motor transport rationalisation has been extended to overseas Commands, modified where necessary to take account of future changes in the deployment of our forces.      Although the rationalisation programme is not yet complete,  substantial savingshave already been made.      Por example, the rationalisation ofvehicle storage and issue has produced a saving in the TJ.K.  ofover  300,000 a year, mainly in wages;    it has freed over600,000 sq, ft.  of covered storage for other purposes;    and ithas reduced the annual cost of handling each vehicle by9.6 per cent.16.     Water Transport.     The Navy Department is now responsiblefor research,  development, design, production and procurement oi&quot;marine craft for all three Services,  except the Army&apos;s LandingShips Logistic (L.S.L.s),  one remaining Landing Ship Tank(L. S.T.),. and amphibians.      A study is in progress to determine the best way in which the Navy Department should take over the/provision,- h3 -

provision, procurement and supply of associated spares and stores, and carry out major repairs and refits.      these measures will save &quot;both money and manpower.      It is not atpresent practicable for the Navy Department to operate andcontrol any Army inter-communication craft.      Common maritimetraining between the Services cannot usefulxy be introduceduntil rationalisation in other fields produces standard craft and equipment.17.      Standardisation in Management.     Logistic practice isbeing increasingly standardised as effective machinery for consultation and co-ordination between the Services evolves.Recommended standard items of stores and equipment are published;items are being identified to the N.A.T.O.  standard of codifica-tion;    standard procedure and terminology are being developed.The purpose of all this work is to improve still further themanagement of material for the support of the forces throughcloser co-ordination and interdependence.     During last year,the following progress was made in the N.A.T.O.  codificationprogramme and in the setting of defence standards:a.      Over 210,000 new items of equipment and about150,000 items already in Service inventories havebeen identified with N.A.T.O.  stock numbers.      some,575,000 items have now been centrally referencedunder the N.A.T.0, codification rules in accordancewith the policy of developing a common supplylanguage for the Services.      A computer, which isto be installed this summer, will greatly aid the complex process of codification.A.- kh -

b.     The number of Defence Standards issued in a revised and more sophisticated form has continued to increase..Action on the simpler Defence Specifications has nowbeen completed.      A further 500 standards are in course of preparation.The year&apos;s efforts to reduce the variety of equipments in usewill result in the progressive elimination of a further 8,000items from Service   inventories, making a total of 15,000 sincethe Centralised Directorate of Standardisation began operations in 1966.INSPECTION SERVICES18.     The integration of the arrangements for chemical inspectionhas now been completed, and further progress has been made withthe rationalisation of the inspection of textiles.     Much work has also been done in conjunction with industry in d-a^i-s-rngcommon inspection documents.      Standard conditions of contract,including inspection clauses,  are now under discussion with industry.19.     An independent committee of enquiry under the chairmanship of Colonel G.W. Raby, C.B.E..   (Chairman, United Gas Industries)has been appointed jointly by the Ministry of Defence and theMinistry of Technology to examine the organisation and methodsof the Equipment Inspectorates and to determine whether and,  if so, how they can be improved.MEDICAL SERVICES20,     In accordance with the decision announced in the statement on the Defence Estimates 1968, Chapter III, paragraph 19(Cmnd 35hO),  the number of Service Medical Rehabilitation Unitskas been reduced from three to two.     The Army Medical/Rehabilitation

Rehabilitation Unit, Chester, has been closed and its workabsorbed by Joint Services Medical Rehabilitation Units locatedat Royal Air Force, Chessington and Royal Air Force, HeadleyCourt.     Both of these Units will be administered by the RoyalAir Force but will be staffed on a joint Service basis.21.     The collection and analysis of medical statistics forpurposes of administration and research is an important adjunctto the work of the medical services of the Armed Forces.Studies are being made into the feasibility of establishing a computer-based Combined. Services Medical Statistics Unit.22.     Plans are being made to replace the old Service hospitalsat Catterick, Tidworth and. Aldershot and for the modernisation of several other hospitals,  including those at Kalton, Haslarand Plymouth.EDUCATION SERVICES23.     The review of the administration of Service children&apos;sschools abroad,  referred to in the Statement on the defence estimates 1,968, Chapter III, paragraph 20 (Cmnd 35h0)9has beencompleted.      As from 1 April 19*59,  the overall responsibilityfor the education of Service children and for the administrationof their schools will be centralised within the Ministry ofDefence under a joint-Service organisation, which will be knownas the Service Children&apos;s Education Authority.      It will be the equivalent of a small Local Education Authority for the Services.The new organisation will save money and manpower, and will lead to more effective administration.     Abroad,  the service which sponsors the greatest number of children in an area willtake local administrative responsibility for the schools there,/2k.- br6 - I

2k.     The first of &quot;the two Service primary schools in Gibraltarshould open by April 1969 and the second by September 1969.As from 1 January 1969,  the Ministry of Defence has taken over from the Government of Gibraltar responsibility for the primaryeducation of Service children in Gibraltar.     The Government of gibraltar will remain responsible for their secondary education.25.     A Youth Service has been set up with effect from1 January 1969 to cater for the special problems of british service personnel and dependents in B.A.O.R.   and Royal Air Force,Germany between the ages of 1h and 20 years.      A Chief youth service Officer,  and three Assistant Youth Service Officers,have been appointed.     This new service will embrace   bothsponsored and voluntary youth organisations,  and will offerfacilities for recreation and training comparable to those provided in Britain by Local Education Authorities.ROYAL DEFENCE ACADEMY26.     As already announced,the Academic Advisory Council of theLoyal Defence Academy has been established under the chairman-ship of Dr. F.A. Vick, O.B.E. , Vice Chancellor of The Queen&apos;sUniversity, Belfast,  to advise on the academic aspects of theeducation of young officers both at Universities and at theService Colleges.27.     The requirements of the individual Services differ inregard to the optimum sequence of professional and environmentaltraining during a young officer&apos;s early years.      But all three services have adopted schemes of academic training which,while differing in detail, maintain the common aim of offering young officers educational opportunities similar tothose which exist outside/the- hi -

the Services and of developing to the full extent theintellectual qualities increasingly demanded &quot;by a Service career.28.     The Navy and Army Departments will continue their existing arrangements whereby young officers enter a university eitherthrough the University Cadetship Scheme or from Dartmouth andSandhurst within a year or two of their commissioning.      TheRoyal Navy are also discussing with a university the possibilityof integrating the year&apos;s academic instruction, which is now given at Dartmouth at the conclusion of sea-time as a midshipman,into a three-year degree course for those officers who reach the requisite standard.     The Army Department are changing theSandhurst syllabus to include in the two-year course a completeyear of uninterrupted academic study.      It also hopes to arrange with a university that this academic year - should be considered asthe first year of a three-year degree course,  so that selectedofficers can study later at this university for the furthertwo years needed to complete the degree course.29.     The Air Force Department has decided that,  in order tomaintain continuity of flying; training and avoid the high costsoccasioned by interruptions,   young officers of the GeneralDuties Branch should complete their academic education beforeentering on professional training,  including flying.      It will,therefore,   introduce an all-graduate direct entry to the GeneralList of all the main officer branches, by increasing the numbersof graduates recruited direct into the Service and by increasingthe number of University Cadetships.     This policy may take threeyears or so to mature.      Meanwhile, any cadets entering Cranwell whofire able and willing will be given special academic training tohelp them to obtain places at universities and colleges after/one- k8 -

one year at Cranwell.      This new policy does not mean thatthe Royal Air Force will cease to recruit young officers who do not want,  or cannot obtain,  university places.     admission to the Royal Air ^orce through a Supplementary Listcommission will continue, and there will be full opportunities to transfer to a General List permanent commission.- 1+9 -

The Royal Air Force contribution to the western strategicdeterrent is now provided by the Vulcans of Royal Air Force strike command, the Victor B&apos;2 Blue Steel aircraft having been withdrawnfrom this role last year.    The Royal Air Force will, however, handover the entire task to the Royal Navy during the year, when thethird Polaris submarine H.M.S. Renown becomes operational.   As theVulcans are released from their strategic nuclear role they will betransferred to the tactical role.   They v/ill remain committed toN.A.T.0. except for those which are to replace the Canberras inthe strike role in support of CENTO.The Polaris force.     The build-up of the Polaris force is proceeding as planned.H.M.S. Resolution has now been operational for some time.   H.M.S.Repulse and H.M.S. Renown were accepted into service by the royal navy in October 1 968 and ^February 19697 respectively.   Bothsubmarines are undergoing their final trials and work-up, which include the test firing of Polaris missiles off Cape Kennedy.H.M.S.

The cost of nuclear strategic forces during 1 969-70, in termsof money and manpower, is estimated to &quot;be: M     Service     CivilianMedium Bomber 5       1,000 100Polaris 51       3,200        2,700Total 56       k,200 2,800EUROPEAN THEATRE GROUND FORCES5,     Our ground forces; on the Continent comprise the British army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) and an independent brigade in Berlin.B.A.0.R, is organised as a corps of three divisions,  each of two brigades.   One of these brigades is now stationed in the UnitedKingdom, but remains under the operational command of the commander in Chief, B.A.O.R.    This force^which is a component of N,A.T.0.&apos;sNorthern Army Group, and is the major part of our contribution tothe shield forces of the North Atlantic Alliance totals about53,000 men.   In addition, arrangements exist for B.A.O.R. to be re-inforced, if necessary, to more than double this figure, mainly by individuals and units from the reserves, but to some extent also byregular units and personnel from the United Kingdom.   Apart fromB.A.O.R., certain units of Army Strategic Command which are stationed in the United Kingdom now have employment in the European theatreas their primary role.   These forces, which were declared toN.A.T.0. at the Ministerial meeting in May 1968, consist of HQ 3rdDivision and three infantry brigades, the parachute force and oneregular Special Air Service regiment.   We have also added an air-Portable armoured reconnaissance squadron and a voice communicationsignals troop to the battalion group which we contribute to theAllied Command Europe Mobile Force.   We have indicated our willingness to make available to N.A.T.0. at least for the next two years or so,/a further .....

Pour regiments have now been equipped with Chieftain tanks, and two further regiments will have been soequipped by April 1969.7,     Field Artillery.    The main change here is that Field ArtilleryComputer Equipment (F.A.C.E.) is in the process of being issued to field gun units.   This will improve response time and accuracy of our support artillery.8&apos;     Communications.    The semi-automatic multi--channel trunk system for communication in the combat area is now in use and provinghighly successful.9.     Infantry.    Infantry battalions in B.A.O.R. are now fully equipped with the armoured personnel carrier.    Some armoured personnelcarriers in each battalion will be converted to allow the 81 mmmortar or the Wombat anti-tank gun to be fired from them.10.   Surveillance.   An operational surveillance drone (i.e. anunmanned reconnaissance aircraft which is able to identify targets and acquire intelligence in enemy-held territory) will start cominginto service early in 1970.   A limited number of devices givingwarning of vehicles and men on foot, and some night fighting aids,will be available.11&apos;   Bridgingg    The issue of the medium girder bridge, the M2amphibious bridge ferry and the Class 16 bridge (air-portable),all of which can be erected very rapidly by hand, will substantiallyimprove our ability to surmount physical obstacles.&apos;   COST OF EUROPEAN THEATRE GROUND FORCES12.

[- EQUIPMENT15.   Preparatory work on the three new classes of surface ships already announced - the cruisers, destroyers and frigates - is going/ahead .....

ahead.   A start has already been made with the order, placed inNovember 1968, for the first of the new destroyers to carry theSea Dart surface-to-air missile.   While they will be only about half the size of the County class of guided-missile destroyers,these new destroyers will carry a much more powerful anti-aircraft and anti-missile armament.   Discussions about the design and construction of a new frigate designed by Messrs Yarrow-Vosperare at an advanced stage.    This design is for a vessel which willbe much smaller than the Leanders but will carry the same range of general-purpose armament, including a helicopter.16.   Aircraft carriers.   H.M.S. Eagle and H.M.S. Hermes will be in commission throughout 19&amp;9.   H.M.S. Ark Royal will complete herspecial refit and conversion to carry Phantom aircraft early in1970.17.   Amphibious Forces.   Both commando ships, H.M.S. Bulwark and h.M.S. Albion (with Royal Marines Commando Units embarked), and both assault ships, H.M.S. Fearless and H.M.S. Intrepid, will bein the active Fleet in 1969.^*   Cruisers.    H.M.S. Blake joins the Fleet in 1969 upon comple-tion of her conversion to carry helicopters.    She will be equippedinitially with Wessex Mk. 3 and later with Sea King, helicopters.H.M.S. Tiger&apos;s conversion continues, and it is planned to convertH.M.S. Lion later on.19.   Destroyers and Frigates.   H.M.S. Antrim and H.M.S. Norfolk willjoin the Fleet at the end of 1969 or the beginning of 1970, thuscompleting the class of eight County class ships.    Construction ofH.M..S. Bristol, the Type 82 destroyer, is on schedule and she isdue to join the Fleet in 1971.   Four new Leander clafes frigateswill join the Fleet in 1969, and a further five are building.20.   Hjslicqpters.   All ships.of frigate size and above v/ill carry/helicopters.

helicopters.    The Wessex Mk 3, equipped, with advanced sonar, radarand a fully automatic flight control system, is now hi service;  and theSea King fitted,with a similar weapon system, will he introducedthis year.    The Wasp is now able to carry light air-to-surfacemissiles, and its successor, the WG 13, which will come into service in the mid-1970s, will have a better strike and reconnais-sar.ce performance.   Particular attention is being paid to theoperation of helicopters under all conditions of weather and sea.21 *   Submarines.    The fourth nuclear powered &quot;Fleet submarine,ILLS. Churchill, was launched in December 1968 and will enter service in January 1970.    The fifth, sixth and seventh submarinesare under construction and the order for the eighth was placed in/Jj anuary 1 96jjj7.22.   Mine Countermeasures Forces.    The programme for convertingmine-sweepers into a minehunters will be completed this year.23.   Survey Ships.    With the completion last year of the new construction programme, the Royal Navy now has a well-balanced andmodern surveying fleet.    The replacement of naval conversions bycommercially designed purpose-built vessels has yielded a saving of 200 officers and men.2[j-*   Support Ships.    The first of the three small fleet tankersof a new design, which are intended to replace some of the Waveand Ranger class tankers, will be in commission during 1969.

As the result of the decision to equip, only one of the RoyalNavy1s aircraft carriers with the Phantom, the naval Phantomsthat were to have made up the complement     of a. second carrierwill he introduced into the Royal Air Force on delivery;    a squadron of these airOraft will form in the Royal Air Force formaritime air Aefence at the end of 1969.    The crews of this squadron will he trainew. by the Royal navy.32.   The second aircraft type to be transferred from the royal navy, the Buccaneer, will be in Royal Air Force service by theend of 1969, when the first maritime strike squadron will be formedand will be supplemented by the additional purchase announced inthe Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy, 1968 (Cmnd 3701).33.   This re-equipment programme will considerably strengthen the Royal Air Force.    The Harrier will be the only V/STOL aircraft in front line service in the world.    Its unique characteristicswill allow a new approach to close support techniques.   We plan,as was announced in November 1968, to supplement our existing frontline by a further squadron.   By so doing we shall be making anincreased contribution to N.A.T.0. of a sort which only the U.K.can at present provide.

It v/ill help undertake the major tasksstemming from the withdrawal from East of Suez.    Thereafter, itwill be the means for rapidly moving U.K.-based forces to thecontinent or elsewhere in emergency, and supporting the overseastraining of our forces.36.   The rapid deployment of our air forces and the extension oftheir combat radius on strike, reconnaissance and air defencemissions requires a force of tanker aircraft for air-to-air refuel-ling.   Our tanker force is at -present equipped with Victor Mk aircraft;    requirements for its successor are under examination.COST OF AIR MOBILITY FORCES37.   During 1969-70 the cost of air mobility forces, in terms ofmoney and manpower, is estimated to be:-

CONFIDENTIALVRESERVE forces royal NAVAL RESERVE forces,     Naval reserve forces consist of two main elements:a. The Regular Reserve,  i.e0 the emergency list and retired naval officers, pensioners and theRoyal Fleet Reserve, who do not train (or need to train) regularly.    Individual officers, however, areoccasionally recalled for exercises.b. The Volunteer Reserves, i.e. the Royal naval reserve,  the Royal Marines Reserve and the Women&apos;royal Naval Reserve.   Members of these trainregularly throughout the year at sea or in their headquarters ashore, generally undergoing a fort-night&apos; s continuous training.2,     The majority of the Royal Naval Reserve consists of civiliansfrom all walks of life who volunteer to train as naval officersand ratings in their spare time.   They would, in war-time, performa number of invaluable services for the Royal Navy;    they wouldman minesweepers and back up other ships of the Fleet, and theywould provide the increased manpower necessary for manning shoreheadquarters, communications centres and the naval control ofshipping organisation.    In peacetime, they train in eleven sea-going coastal minesweepers, each of which is manned entirely bythe R.N.R, and, is based, on one of the R.N.R. &apos;s sea training centres.They take part in N.A.T.O. and national exercises on equal terms with the regulars, and pay visits to British and continental ports.Last year they carried out a live minesweeping operation in co-operation with other N.A.T.0. navies,3.     The remainder of the R.N.R. consists of professional seamenfrom the Merchant Navy and fishing fleets.A......

confidential,     One of the most important functions of the R.N.R.  in peace-time is to bridge the gap between the civilian and the Navy and tomaintain a naval presence in important seaports where the royal navy would otherwise seldom be seen.5.     In all, nearly 17,000 officers and over 22,000 ratings andother ranks can be mobilised;    of these nearly h,000 officers andover 5,000 ratings and other ranks belong to the voluntary reserves,ARMY RESERVE FORGES6.     The Army Reserve consist of two main elements:a. the Regular Army Reserves, including the LongTerm Reserve,  into which Regular reservists will ultimately pass;    and the Army General Reserve,which consists of certain former National Servicemen.b. the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve(T. &amp; A.V.R.).7.     As announced in paragraph 6ix of the Supplementary statement on Defence Policy 1968 (Cmnd 3701), these Reserves have been underreview.    In the case of the T. &amp; A.V.R., the main features havebeen settled and Parliament was told of them on 28 November last.Some final adjustments will be necessary when the role of theadditional forces earmarked for N,,A.T.0. has been determined.8.     Recruitment to the &quot;Ever Readies&quot; has ceased and existingundertakings are not being renewed.    The requirement for whichthis liability was designed - immediate reinforcement of theRegular Army - will now be met by the Regular Army itself.9.     It was announced on 16 January 1968 (Cmnd 3515) that homedefence would be put on care and maintenance and that this wouldmean the disbandment of the Territorial and Army Volunteer ReserveCategory in (to &amp; A.V.R. III).    Many of its training centres arebeing taken into use by the T. &amp; A.V.R. II, which will be spread/more .....

more evenly throughout the country and thus he able to draw on a wider recruiting area.    Many of the members of the T.- &amp; A.V.R. IIIhave transferred to the T. &amp; A.V.R.  II.10.   Additional units are being formed, and some existing units are being expanded,  in the T. &amp; A.V.R. II in order to meet theincreased requirements for the support of the Regular Army.   Upto one hundred cadres are being formed, each of about eightofficers, N.C.0.S and men attached to a unit of T. Sc. A.V.R, II.They will take some of the load of peace-time administrative workaway from the officers and men of the T. &amp; A.V.R. II units and allow them to concentrate more on their military training.    They willalso provide a framework for any expansion which might in thefuture be necessary.    The increase in the establishment ofT. &amp; A.V.R. II will be by about 6,500 to about 56,000.11.   Fourteen new Territorial, Auxiliary and Volunteer ReserveAssociations, replacing the former Territorial and Auxiliary ForcesAssociations, were formed on 1 April 1968.12,     A bill will shortly be introduced to maintain the ArmyGeneral Reserve in existence for a further and final period offive years.   This is to allow time for the Regular Reserve and theT, &amp; A.V.R. to build up and replace the Army General Reserve as a source for certain specialists &apos;.13.   The University Officers&apos; Training Corps, which is part of theTo &amp; A.V.R. IV, continues to provide a valuable link with the universities, from which the Army aims to secure a regular flow of graduates to regular commissions.   Certain changes are, however,being made in its organisation which will lead to economies.ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE FORCES^h.   The Royal Air Force Reserve Forces consist of the RegularReserve, the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force./&quot;I 5 * * * * o *

15. These Reserves provide a pool for the reinforceraent of regularunits. Certain officers and airmen are earmarked for special tasksin an emergency.16.   The University Air Squadrons, which form part of the RoyalAir Force Volunteer Reserve, are being re-organised in order toreduce their total cost.   Great importance is attached to these squadrons both as a source of high-quality entrants to the RoyalAir Faroe and as a means of keeping in touch with the xmiversities.The squadrons are also responsible for administering and training the increasing number of University cadets who are being recruitedas part of the policy of encouraging a larger graduate entry tothe Royal Air Force. .17.   The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of three MaritimeHeadquarters Units, whose function is to reinforce Coastal Command&apos;soperational control organisation in emergency.    They receive RoyalAir Force rates of pay during training, together with an annualtraining bounty.18. The Royal Air Force Reserve Forces have a strength of approxi-mately 13,000 officers and 70,000 airmen.19.

VIRESEARCH AND development .     We do not foresee dramatic changes in the types and character-istics of our future weapons.    Our role in N.A.T.O. has alwaysrequired a wide range of sophisticated equipment.   nevertheless the forecast again shows a reduction in the funds to he devotedto research and development:    the total expenditure on research and development for 1969-70 is estimated at ^ 235m7;    at constant prices, this represents a fall of   314.1^ on the estimate for 1968-69.2.     One of our aims is to reduce demands for skilled manpower andto release resources to the civil sector.   We have been concentra-ting our search for savings in the following directions:a. avoiding over-elaboration of operational require-ments;b. securing maximum value for money;c. pursuing every opportunity   of collaborationand rationalisation of effort with our allies.3.     The strengthening of the organisation for the examination and review of operational requirements which was announced, in theStatement on Defence Estimates 1968 (Cmnd 35hO Chapter I,paragraph 22) has already proved its worth.   We are now better able to assess which proposed new weapons offer the most effective means of supporting our military strategy.h.     We are placing increasing emphasis on the detailed definition of a project before incurring any commitment to its full develop-ment.   We are continuing to improve our procedure for controllingdevelopment programmes.   The &apos;. rewards are already appearing interms of better estimating and more&apos; stringent control of individual projects.   For example, none of the original estimates for thedevelopment of the Harrier or Jaguar aircraft or for the combined/development .....- Sh -CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALdevelopment and production of the Nimrod aircraft is proving very-wide of the mark.5.       We are also paying a great deal of attention to the &quot;bettermanagement of defence development projects both at governmentaland industrial level.    On the government side, we try so far aspossible to concentrate responsibility for a project in a singleproject officer to ensure that it remains within the limits oftime and cost laid down for it,  and that decisions can be takenrapidly.     The polaris programme is a strikingly successful example of these arrangements.    (See also Chapter VIII, paragraph k6)SWe seek to use incentive contracts wherever possible, thus limit-ing our commitments while allowing a suitable reward for efficient industrial management.6.      We are also enlisting the co-operation of industry in thegreater use of partnership arrangements for equipment that islikely to sell well abroad.    In return for an assurance of firmorders for the U.K. forces and in the expectation of profitableexport orders, firms are invited to share the cost of developmentwith the Government.7.       The nation gets value for the money spent on defence research and development in other ways.    The rigorous and exacting standards of performance and reliability demanded of defence equipment are a powerful stimulus in many key areas of technology.    The work done under defence contracts is of considerable benefit to industry generally, both by reason of its direct applications to civil pur-poses and by the cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques.8.       The Government defence research and development establishmentsalso constitute a first-rate technological asset.   We are, howeverexamining ways of running them more economically, the possibility offurther rationalisation and whether the present balance between themand industry is right.    We attach great importance to reinforcingtheir already strong ties with industry and the academic world,  andwe shall continue to disseminate the results of defence work aswidely as security and ^fe^AL /resources

resources permit, and to encourage the declassification and circula-tion of reports produced by establishments.    Open Days are being held regularly in order to draw the attention of industrialists tofields of work which might be of interest to them.   We alsoencourage the exchange of scientists with the universities andwith industry.INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION9.     As stated in Chapter I, we look forward to wider collaboration with our allies in the development of major items of defence equip-ment.   For although the development of a project in collaborationmay increase the total expenditure, the cost to each partnershould be substantially less than that of going it alone.10.   Collaboration is not easy.   There are real difficulties in reaching agreement about operational requirements and time-scales.The sharing of the work and the reconciliation of conflictingindustrial interests often present problems.   Long and. patienteffort is necessary to resolve these questions.   Nevertheless, wedevote considerable effort to the search for collaborative projects.We have regular and frequent contacts with our European partnersboth within N.A.T.0. and bi-laterally.    The Jaguar aircraft, theMartel air-to-surface missile, the SA 330, SA 340 and WG 13 helicopters(all five projects Anglo-French), and the artillery and electronicsprojects on which we are collaborating with the Federal republic of Germany, are evidence of the progress that we have made.DEFENCE SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COUNCIL11.   In framing defence policy we have long recognised the valueof independent advice on scientific and technological issues.Various ways-have been devised of meeting this need at all levels,a notably successful example being the Army Departments AdvisoryCouncil on Scientific Research and Technical Development.    The time/llElS     9 * o * *

has come to draw the threads together.   We have therefore decidedto set up a Defence Scientific Advisory Council, which will replace the existing arrangements.    It will he modelled on the army department&apos;s Advisory Council and will embody and broaden much ofits existing practice.   Professor W.R. Hawthorne, C.B.E., F.R.S.,Master of Churchill College Cambridge, the present Chairman of theArmy Scientific Advisory Council has agreed to accept the chairman-ship of the new body.PROGRAMMES 1969-7012.

VIISALESi.     Sales of defence equipment continue to make an important contribution to our exports.    This is an increasingly competitivefield.   Careful controls are applied to ensure that each sale is consistent with our foreign policy towards the country or areaconcerned and with the longer-term aim of general disarmament,but British defence industries, including the Royal OrdnanceFactories,  are more than holding their own.    In the year 1969-70the total value of defence exports is expected to reach over 170m, of which the Ministry of Defence share is likely to heabout  55m.SALES TO GERMANY2.     Under the offset agreement concluded with the German Governmentin March 1968, about 90 per cent of the overseas currency element of our stationing costs for 1968-69 will have been covered.

Programmed Instruction.   Programmes covering a wide range oftopics have been written and are used increasingly in naval train-ing establishments ashore.    These programmes are easily moved fromone place to another.    They enable more productivity to be obtainedfrom the instructors.3&apos;    Closed-Circuit Television.   Closed-circuit television,especially when the cameras are supported by video-tape recorders,is recognised as a valuable teaching aid and is therefore being developed in the Navy.    It provides clear instruction about equip-ment which is difficult for trainees to get at or too expensive toinstall solely for training purposes, and can demonstrate operationalsituations recently recorded in ships.k.

A      larger     proportion of the General List will, however, befound by transfers from the Supplementary List,  as at present.-  FLYING training the   ROYAL NAVY23.   The last fixed-wing pilots and observers to be trained willgraduate in 1970.   Helicopter pilot training continues at the normalrate, and conversion courses will also be given to a number of former fixed-wing pilots.   Observers are being trained for anti-submarine duties, and preparations continue for the introduction ofthe Sea King into the training organisation towards the end of 1969*24.   The practice of having aircraft in certain training unitsmaintained by civil contractors has been extended with a consequentsaving in naval manpower.    The flying training organisation isbeing progressively adjusted as the requirement for fixed-wingtraining diminishes.THE ARMY25.   The School of Army Aviation, Middle Wallop continues to trainall Army pilots.    In recent years, approximately 100-110 pilotsannually have successfully completed the seven-month course, which includes a minimum of 185 flying hours for each pilot./THE .....

THE ROYAL AIR FORCE26.   As forecast last year, the number of Basic Flying training schools in the Royal Air Force has been reduced from four to three.The Jet Provost Mk. 5 will begin to replace the Mk. 1+ at these schools during the first half of this year.27.   A contract has been placed for an air electronics simulatorfor use in the basic training of air electronics operators.   Thiswill permit a reduction in the number of flying exercises in thesyllabus.28.   The first flight simulators for the Phantom&quot;, Nimrcd andHarrier should be delivered during the year for use in operational training.COST OF INITIAL,  SPECIALIST AND PLYING TRAINING29.   The cost in 1969-70 of initial, specialist and flying trainingin the three Services, in terms of money and manpower, is estimated to be:- M     Service     civilian a.

REDUCTION AND RE-ORGANISATION OP SUPPORT30.   Paragraphs 28-34 of Chapter I summarise briefly the majordecisions on the reduction and re-organisation of supportfacilities, which have been taken since the publication of cmnd. 3701.   They are set out fully in the following paragraphs.31,   Fleet Air Arm,   When our withdrawal from East of Suez is complete, fixed-wing flying will come to an end, and three royal naval Air stations will no longer be needed from about 1971-72.The Navy will retain the stations at Culdrose, Portland, Yeoviltonand Lee-on-Solent;    the Royal Air Force expects to take overLossiemouth;    and the Army and Royal Air Force are now activelyenagaged on a thorough examination of alternative uses for Brawdy,The possibility of continuing to use Arbroath for either defenceor civilian purposes is also being urgently considered.    Thereduction in the number of Fleet Air Arm stations is expected to yield an eventual cut of about 5,000 military and about 1 ,000civilian posts and a financial saving of about  8.75m. a year.32.   Royal Marines.   We also plan some re-organisation of royal marines establishments.   It has been decided to transfer to theAmphibious Training Unit at Poole and to the Infantry training centre at Lympstone certain training tasks which up to now havebeen carried out at Deal, at Fort Cumberland and at the R.M.Barracks, Eastney.   These transfers will begin in 1970, and areexpected to be complete by early 1973;    it is too early to assesswhat savings will be made.   Fort Cumberland will be given up.33.   R.A.O.C. Organisation.   A review of the existing R.A.O.C.organisation in the U.K. is being conducted in two main parts./The first- 81 -

The first part, covering the &quot;base organisation - &quot;broadly the wholesale function - is still under study.     ^he second partcovers the R.A.O.C.  stores organisation in U.K. Commands, andis well advanced.     Thus the reductions in the size of theArmy have made it possible to streamline the present systemof Command Ordnance Depots, Command Ordnance Sub-Depots andBarrack Stores;    and we intend to replace these by two new types of unit, Regional Depots and Ordnance Support Units.The former will hold stocks required for training and mobilization-tion, and the latter will hold maintenance stocks of frequentlyrequired accommodation stores and other selected important items in locations close to the major areas where troops are concent-rated.     The details of consequent economies are still beingworked out, but we expect that they will result in an eventualsaving of about 800 posts and  .8m.  a year.3k.     Pay and Record Offices.      Starting this year,  there is tobe a major re-organisation of pay and record offices which willtake some years to complete.     New computer equipment is beingordered for the use of the Royal Army Pay Corps to replaceexisting machines at worthy Down, which become obsolete in 1970and 1971.     This equipment will have a larger capacity,  so that much of the work associated with the maintenance of soldiers&apos;records can be carried out in addition to the tasks nowperformed.     There are at present 23 separate record offices andregimental pay offices at 19 different locations in the UnitedKingdom.     in order to reduce the administrative effort and toenable information to be fed to the new computers more economically, the number of pay offices is to be reduced andSouped with record offices at five locations - Brighton,/Exeter,-82-CQNF1DENTIAL

Exeter, Leicester, Winchester and York.      There will he an eventual saving of over 900 military and civilian staff and an eventual net saving of  .75m.  a year.35.     R.A.F. Training Command.     Flying Training command and Technical Training Command were merged to form a singleTraining Command on 1 June 1968 and No.  25 Training Group wasdisbanded on 1 July 1968.     These changes resulted in a saving of 255 military&apos;and 210 civilian posts;    and financial savings of about  .5m.36.     Other R.A.F. Reductions.     Plans have been made totransfer the Air Navigation Schools from Ftradishall and Gaydon,with the Air Electronics and Engineers School from Topcliffe,to a combined Aircrew Training School at Finningley.     Theresult of        these moves^together with the closure of RoyalAir Force Acklington   which has recently been announced, will bea saving of over 7k0 military and about 275 civilian posts;financial savings are estimated at just over  1.5m.PRODUCTION. REPAIR AND SUPPLY organisation in THE UNITED KINGDOM37.     The following paragraphs report the main features of the programmes of the production establishments in 1969-70 anddescribe the progress made with further measures to improvemanagement efficiency in the production,  repair,  and supplyorganisation./ H.Me DOCKYARDS

H.M. DOCKYARDS38.   As stated in Chapter I, paragraph 30, a review of the futureof H.M. Dockyards in the U.K. has now hcen completed and all fourhome dockyards will still he required.   The main aim of the reviewhaa heen to work out the most effective and economical dockyardsupport for the Fleet.    It has also heen to plan a dockyardorganisation which will match the reduction in the future size ofthe Fleet, and in naval support as a whole.39,   The workload for the next ten years has already heen largelydetermined by the destroyers, frigates and submarines which arenow in service or on order.   Rosyth Dockyard, which has been developed to support the Polaris force and at present is engaged on the refit and refuelling of H.M.S. Dreadnought, v/ill slightlyincrease its labour force over the next five years.    The labour force at Portsmouth, Devonport and Chatham Dockyards will gradually06 pay     peVuirU-fall in size, by   natural wastage,/ithus producing the total reduction-tion of some 5,000 civilian personnel by the mid-1970s mentionedin Chapter I.   This is a continuation of a rundown which, over thepast five years, has amounted to some h,000 in the IT.K.    SingaporeDockyard has already heen transferred to the Singapore Government,together with 3,500 employees.   Until we finally leave the Far East,the yard will continue to carry out a substantial amount of repair work for the Royal Navy, but after our withdrawal we shall not need to plan for its regular use.hO.   Portsmouth, Chatham and Devonport Dockyards will continue tohave a full load of work.   Portsmouth Dockyard, which has juststarted the first long refit of the guided missile destroyerDevonshire, will become the type yard for this class:    itwill continue to refit a wide range of other ships including/conventional- Qk -

conventional submarines and frigates.   Chatham Dockyard can nowcarry out the intermediate dockings of SSNs and is expected to startits first nuclear refit about the end of the financial year 1969-70;Devonport Dockyard will, when the major refit of H.M.S. Ark Royaland the building of the Leander class frigate H.M.S. Scylla is complete, become the &quot;lead&quot; yard for Leander class frigates.    Itwill also be developed as a third nuclear submarine dockyardcapable of undertaking refits as the need builds up in the 1970s.U1.   In the longer term, substantial dockyard support will stillhe needed;    for the new, more advanced classes of ship and submarine which will enter the Fleet during the next ten yearsrequire even greater skills and work of even higher quality thanin the past.   The refit of nuclear submarines involving the mostadvanced techniques, for example, will be a particularly largecommitment, which will grow until, by the end of the 1970s,    itwill at least equal the workload of aircraft carrier refits inrecent years.   We thus have the strongest incentive to fit moreand more standardised equipment in ships in order to simplifymaintenance and repair.   We shall also design ships with a greater emphasis on ease and economy of refit.k3.   H.M.G.&apos;s decision on the future of the home dockyards willbe the basis for a vigorous policy to get greater productivitywith a smaller labour force.    The efficient upkeep of the Fleetwill depend upon its success.4-3.   Many of the measures necessary to achieve this are theresponsibility of management and are already in hand.    They will lead to changes in responsibilities and procedures which willrequire a willingness by the Trade Unions to accept some modifica-tion in traditional practices..   For without such changes, substan-tial increases in pay cannot be justified.Ah.- 85 -

ilk.   The following steps are &quot;being taken to stimulate productivity:a. to follow up the improvements in management whichwe have made in recent years by giving greaterauthority to General Managers in the individualdockyards.   At Headquarters, an Executive underthe Chief of Fleet Support will be the responsibleauthority for managing all the yards.b. to replace, rather than repair, individualcomponents in ships.c. the gradual introduction of a system under whicheither complete classes of ships will be basedon particular dockyards or one dockyard willbecome the &quot;lead&quot; yard for a large class, suchas the Leander frigates,d. a comprehensive rationalisation and modernisa-tion of workshops and other facilities in the yards.l&apos;:5.   If the aims of the dockyard review are to be carried intoeffect, we must plan, at the same time, for reductions in thelabour force and for greater output in the dockyards.   Productivityworking parties have already been set up in the dockyards, and discussions have started with the Manpower and Productivity Serviceof the Department of Employment and Productivity.   The aim is toobtain greater productivity without redundancy, but this can onlybe done if satisfactory agreements for retraining certain trades-men can be negotiated.   We want to work in the closest possiblePartnership with the Trade Unions with the object not only of taking the dockyards more productive and efficient, but at the/same- 86 -

same time seeing that those who work in them obtain a fair shareof the benefits which these improvements should bring.A6.(PAGE 88 NOT ALLOCATED)- 87 -

k6*      Royal Ordnance Factories.      The main function of theRoyal Ordnance Factories will continue to he the manufactureof equipment and ammunition for the Services,  and for Common-wealth and other friendly Governments.      Ammunition for thethree Services constitutes the main group of factory products;other items include explosives,  tanks, guns,  small arms andspares for equipment already in service.     The factories alsoundertake some development and experimental work for theServices as well as work for civil customers.k6a0    The value of the output of the Royal Ordnance factories in 1969-70     will he about  U5m.,  excluding some  25m.  of equipment and material supplied to the factories free of charge and incorporated in their products.      The factories are continu-ally being modernised.      Improvements include new types of machine tools and machining centres, which are automaticallycontrolled by punched or magnetic tape;    and advanced techniquesare being applied, in the fabrication and forming of materials for new designs of guns and ammunition.hcb.    Individual ordnance factories have been given greaterautonomy in recent years through the further decentralisationof management.     For certain complex projects, where controland co-ordination are especially important, project managers aredesignated with responsibility for the co-ordination of technicalcontrol through all phases of research, development, procurement,production and delivery.     This technique is also being used bythe other Services.      In the Army Department, project managershave been appointed for a number of projects,  including thelightweight close support gun,  the towed medium gun (FH.70),  andthe tracked version of the combat vehicle reconnaissance./Among-89-

Among the industrial management techniques employed are networkscheduling and computer-aided production control,  linked tocritical path analysis.AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING AND OTHER MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUESIffm     Budgetary Control.      All work done in the Royal Dockyards,the Royal Navy Aircraft Yards and the Royal Ordnance Factoriesis costed;   work measurement schemes and incentive agreements are used.1+8.     Budgetary control and standard costing systems are now operating in two R.E.M.E. workshops,  and are well advanced in others.     The information from these systems is already having an impact on workshop management methods, particularly in the handling of materials.      Similar techniques have also heenapplied to two R.A.O.C.  depots and are being progressivelyintroduced in other R.A.O.C. depots.      The possible applicationsof the latest management techniques and of cost accounting inthe Royal Corps of Transport are now being studied.1+9,     The introduction of budgetary control has also facilitatedthe conclusion of the Army Department&apos;s first productivityagreement - in 38 Central Workshop R.F.M.E.     Under this agree-ment,  it is planned to increase the production in the workshopin two stages by some 25 per cent over the next three years without increasing the labour force.      It is hoped that thiswill form the basis of similar productivity agreements in otherstatic Army Workshops and in the Ordnance depots.50.     In Royal Ordnance Factories5 fixed prices for production orders have been introduced experimentally to replace theprevious system of charging actual costs;    factory management isnow faced with the need to keep within quoted prices, while/customers-90-

customers know their financial commitments in advance.     fixed prices,  coupled with greater management autonomy and other measures, have improved productivity; an indication of&apos;this isthat output has gone up without an increase in the labour force.51       Computers for Management.      As we have said previously,all three Services have been using computers for managementpurposes for a number of years.     More sophisticated equipment is being installed to replace earlier types, and the scope ofthese systems is being broadened to embrace new areas ofadministration.In the Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service, computersare now used to control supplies of electronic stores and sparegear to the Fleet;    special emphasis is being put on maintaining the Polaris and nuclear submarine forces at maximum efficiency.Centralised control of all other stores is planned for 1971, anda centralised computer system to cover all naval supply needs in the late 1970s is under investigation.53.     Automatic data processing has been introduced in theRoyal Ordnance Factories for processing management information,particularly production and cost data control.     A contract was placed in July 1968 with International Computers Limited fora computer for the R.A.O.C. depot at Bicester.      It is due tocome in to operation 1970, when it will take over store accounts and allied functions for Bicester itself and for the R..A.0.C.ammunition organisation.      A new system is being devised for the computer which employs the most modern techniques of inventorymanagement.5k.     The Royal Air Force Supply Control Centre, Hendon, continuesto take further ranges of stores and eqiiipment under its control,and the benefits to supply support have increased accordingly./Planning

planning is going ahead for the installation of the next genera-tion of computer.      A computer has now been installed at eachof the four equipment supply depots in Royal Air ForceMaintenance Command to deal with the recording,  identifying andprocessing of demands for equipment and to provide immediateinformation about holdings and precise locations of stocks.The forecast staff saving of about 500 posts has already been madand other savings are expected.     The introduction of modernstorage methods in the equipment supply depots is going ahead andfurther staff savings of about 500 posts should be realisedduring the coming year.     The Materials Handling Research Unit,Cranfield,  is helping with this task.55.     Management Consultants.     The Navy Department has arranged for a firm of consultants to carry out a pilot study of theapplication of operational research techniques to the problemof minimising the stockholdings required for the support of a mobile fleet.     A firm of consultants is also assisting in apilot study of management by objectives at a major naval storeestablishment.     This study, undertaken on behalf of the CivilService Department,  is aimed at evaluating the possible benefitto be derived both in the Ministry of Defence and elsewhere inthe Government service.      The Royal Ordnance Factories alsoemploy management consultants as necessary;    at present twoparticular problems are being studied,,56,      A firm of management consultants has made preliminarystudies of managerial practices in Royal Air Force MaintenanceCommand;    and trials at No.  Ik Maintenance Unit, Carlisle,and No. 23 Maintenance Unit, Aldergrove,  on the lines recommended by the consultants,  are taking place./A radical-92-

57.     A radical review of accounting arrangements in ships andfleet establishments, undertaken by the Royal Naval Supply andTransport Service and the Supply Branch of the Navy,  is leading to worthwhile reductions in paper work relating to stores.COST OP PRODUCTION,  REPAIR AND SUPPLY ORGANISATION58.     The overhead costs in 1969-70 of the production, repair and supply organisation,  in terms of money and manpower,  in theUnited Kingdom are expected to he about         m.     They include those of storage, repair and production establishments in theUnited Kingdom;    the costs of similar units overseas areattributed to the combat forces.j M       Service     civilian a.

The reorientation of our defence effort towards Europe ledto a review of planning assumptions based on current N.A.T.0.strategy which, when complete, will affect the general level of stocks and reserves required.     The annual incidence of expendi-ture is influenced by re-equipment programmes and the rates of delivery of the more costly items.      Our expenditure for19&amp;9-70     is expected to be  //&quot;22-/m.      In addition, peacemaintenance stocks are being reduced to correspond with thereduction in our forces.     For instance, in the Army, the large stocks formerly held in our base depots in Singapore are beingsteadily run down,  and our holdings in the U.K.  are also being/carefully

COMF1NT1ALcarefully pruned.     An example is the Armyfs fleet of trucks,cars and their trailers, which over the last two years has heenreduced by 20 per cent.60.     personnel.      Almost all personnel movements to and fromthe United Kingdom are now by air.      The number of singlejourneys by air in 1969-70 is expected to be about 395,000.Rather more than 75 per cent of this task,  in terms of passengermiles, will be undertaken by Air Support Command,  in additionto its tri-Service training commitments;    most of the troopingwill be carried out as a part of route familiarisation flying.Movements for north west Europe continue to be handled by civilcharter.61.     A unified system is being introduced for handling allunaccompanied baggage of Service personnel and their familiesleaving and returning to the U.K.      As a first stage, thefunctions of the Royal Air Force Baggage Flight at Woolwichwill be transferred to the Royal Navy Store Depot, Deptford,which already deals with the baggage.of Naval personnel.62.     Freight Movement.      Cargo movement from and to stationsoverseas will continue to be mostly by sea.     The continuedclosure of the Suez Canal naturally increases costs,  transittimes and the use of air freight.     Most air freighting willcontinue to be carried out by Air Support Command.G3.     Changing commercial methods of handling and moving freightare being studied together by the Services.     All three services have now adopted the commercial International StandardsOrganisation container system for the movement of stores toGermany; * the containers are conveyed to the continental portsMOVEMENTS/in-94-

min specialised container ships.      The door-to-door movement ofthese containers between U.K.  depots and units in Germany   isquicker and cheaper.     Most stores,  other than ammunition andexceptionally heavy loads,  are now travelling by this means.Shi     Landing Ships Logistic.      Six Landing Ships Logistic arenow in service,  and all but one Landing Ship Tank has been with-drawn.     Towards the end of the financial year,  these vesselswill be transferred from commercial to Royal Fleet Auxiliarymanagement.     There will be no change in their employment;when not required for their primary role in support of operations,they will be used for major training exercises and increasinglyfor routine maintenance tasks, particularly to B.A.O.R.COST OF MOVEMENTS6.5.     During 1969-70 the total cost of movements in the three services excluding the cost of those movements by air covered in Chapter \f    , para   TJ, will be about   /jSv^  m.,  of which some    jtfj m. has already been attributed in the various costs of the combat forces.COMMUNICATIONS66.     The rationalisation of the Defence Communication.  Networkhas been completed in Cyprus, Bahrain,  Singapore, Mauritius andGan.     The remaining stations in the U.K., Gibraltar, Hong kong and Malta should be finished by the end of 1971.67.     Contracts have been signed fcr the automation of theDefence Communication Centre in the Ministry of Defence by 1970.It will lead to a greatly improved message-handling anddistribution system,  and considerable staff savings.68,.     U.K.. trials in the U.S.  Initial Defence Satellite Communica-tion System (IDSCS),  (previously known as the U.S.  InterimDefence Communications Satellite Project (IDCSP)), were/successfully

successfully carried out between June 1966 and March 1968.Earth stations in U.K,, Cyprus and Singapore,  a shipborneterminal in H.M.S. Wakeful, and a vehicle mounted station were used.     These trials enabled the Ministry of Technology and thethree Services to obtain valuable experience and knowledge,  in preparation for the introduction of a U.K.  defence satellitecommunication system (SKYNET).      The three static earth stations are now being modified,  and two further earth stations are being set up to complete the initial network in readiness for the launching by the U.S.  of the two SKYNET satellites - the firsttowards the end of 1969 and the second about six months later.The SKYNET programme also includes two mobile air transportablestations for use in contingency operations and two ships&apos;stations to be installed in H.M. S.  Intrepid and H.M. S. Fearless.On the withdrawal of our forces East of Suez in 1971,  someSKYNET earth stations will be redeployed.for 1969-70 is estimated to be about  [2-cfJ   m.      All other expenditure on communications in the three Services is attributed to the costs of the combat forces.iv.      we have begun to implement the U.K.  share in WorldFeather Watch in a number of ways.      A cash contribution andoffers of equipment as aid for developing countries have beenmade to the World Meteorological Organisation;    a british merchant ship is in regular use for upper air soundings;    threeoverseas students have been awarded fellowships at ReadingUniversity;    and planning is proceeding for the extension of cost OF COMMUNICATIONS69.The cost of communications networks in the United KingdomMETEOROLOGY/observation-96-

observation coverage and the use of the Meteorological Officeheadquarters as an international Regional Meteorological and telecommunications Centre.71.      Services to industry and public authorities are still being expanded and improved.     A regular weather routeing service is now available for ships on the North Atlantic.     the meteorological Office has submitted evidence to the Committee ofEnquirjr into foot and mouth disease.     The office is co-operating with other authorities in reviewing flood problems and planning a general study of river flooding in the U.K.      Local broad-casting has been used to give the public better service and more effective arrangements for warnings of adverse weather havebeen made.72.     Consultations have been undertaken with industry to prepare for the introduction of a powerful new computer which the meteorological Office will need in a few years time.      Thiscomputer should help to extend the range of reliable forecaststo 5-7 days ahead,  improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasting,and provide better research facilities and a more efficient andcentralised organisation of the Office.      A new radio-sonde hasbeen developed for measuring pressure,  temperature and humidityup to a previously unattainable height of 100,000 ft. withsignificant improvements in accuracy.     The development of automatic observation systems has continued.73.     The Meteorological Research Plight has measured air motion in a region of clear air turbulence using a stable platformmounted in a Canberra.      In rocket soundings of winds andtemperatures from 30-60 km above the ground in the Hebrides,unprecedented changes were recorded over 10 winter days inwind (from 350 knots westerly to 100 knots easterly) and in/temperatures

temperatures (from n-h.0oC to -300C) at the U0 km level.     Rocketfirings for similar purposes started from Gan.     Cloud observa-tions by radar at Can and Singapore and those obtained from u.S.  satellites were used in studies on tropical meteorology.The velocity of raindrops was measured with doppler radar atMalvern to provide data of a reliability probably not previouslyachieved about air motion in rain areas.7^4-     New arrangements have been made with the Natural Environ-ment Research Council for geomagnetic,  seismological andmeteorological work at the Observatories at Eskdalemuir andLerwick0     The N.E.R.C. has taken over Eskdalemuir, butmeteorological work will continue there, and both observatorieswill be jointly manned.COST OF METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES75.     The net cost of meteorological services to the defence budget is estimated at   m.     This includes:    first,  thecost of operational services directly provided for defence purposes, mainly at Royal Air Force stations,  at home and overseas:    secondly,  the cost of meteorological research;    and,thirdly,  the net cost of services for the general public and forother civil purposes,  including World Weather Watch, afterrecoveries have been made from certain users,  includingprimarily the Board of Trade in respect of civil aviation.LANDS7^&apos;.     The Services&apos; requirement for training areas in the UnitedKingdom has been fully reviewed against the planned strengthfor 1969-70, and,  so far as it is possible,  for the following years.     The review has taken into account the re-organisationand reduction of the Reserve Forces and the return to theUnited Kingdom of personnel from overseas./The main

77.     The main result of the review has been to confirm that theexisting training areas on Salisbury Plain,  Stanford,  Otterhurnand Sennybridge will continue to be required for major exercises-.Further consideration is being given to requirements fortraining on Dartmoor.SURVEY78.     Royal Navy.     The Hydrographer of the Navy provides chartsand navigational publications to facilitate the safe passage ofthe Fleet in all parts of the world.      Since 1823 AdmiraltyCharts have been sold, through commercial agents-,  to the world&apos;smerchant fleets.      Last year nearly two million charts and150,000 associated publications brought in a revenue of three quarters of a million pounds,  ah cut 60 per cent of it from overseas.      The charts are compiled, printed and issued from theHydrographic Department of the Ministry of Defence in Taunton,Somerset.      The Hydrographer controls the work of twelve navalsurveying vessels employed on both hydrographic and oceanographicsurveys.79,     The hydrographic surveys are required to keep the AdmiraltyCharts up-to-date, and in British waters are urgently beingprogressed to permit the safe passage to and from our ports ofvessels of increasingly deep draught.80.    The oceanographic surveys are required to give a better understanding of the vital part played by the ever changingenvironment in submarine and anti-submarine warfare;    and toimprove our knowledge of the movement of sediment on the seabed,which can bring about drastic changes in the charted depths andpositions of navigational channels in shallow waters.81.    Many of the oceanographic surveys are carried out in/collaboration-99-

collaboration with British oceanographic and fishery research establishments under the direction of the Natural EnvironmentResearch Council,  thus contributing to the general advancement of national oceanographic research.82.   The training and the examinations at the RN. HydrographicSchool, Devonport, are closely akin to civil practice,  thusfacilitating qualification of naval surveying officers asChartered Surveyors in the hydrographic field.     Many such officers and surveying recorder ratings move easily into civilhydrographic posts on retirement as surveyors to port authorities^contract survey companies and oil companies.83.    Army.      Military survey units at home and overseas have continued to provide the maps, aeronautical charts and geodeticdata needed by the three Services.     The demand for fieldsurveys of high accuracy connected with new tactical conceptsand their associated weapons and navigation systems has increased..Many of these systems require cartographic information to bevisually displayed, and considerable research has been devotedto improving the methods of producing and presenting this information.     The Directorate of Military Survey has continuedto co-operate in survey and mapping with the United States andother allied nations.      Two British teams are taking part in theUnited States geodetic satellite programme, which will lead to amore exact knowledge of the size and shape of the earth, with consequent benefit to mapping and navigation.      Similarly,  asmuch of the work of the Military Purvey Service is equallyapplicable to civil requirements,  close co-operation has been maintained with Civil Aviation, various scientific bodies andother mapping organisations./SUMMARY

SUMMARY OP OTHER SUPPORT COSTS AND MISCELLANEOUS EXPENDITURES8u.      The total cost in 1969-70 of Support functions other thantraining, production and repair and war and contingency stocks in the United Kingdom, in terms of money and manpower,  is estimated to he / 393m./.

The costs of other miscellaneous items of expenditure inall departments which, by their very nature, do not fit easilyinto categories nor are readily or accurately foreseeable,  are recovered hy a separate programme:    they include, for example,compensation payments.      These costs are offset hy receipts,  thelargest part of which is for those sales of defence equipment, the credit for which has not been attributed to other programmes.     Asa result, the figure for the programme as a. whole amounts tom. net income to the defence budget.86.      A programme covering special materials amounts to about C32J m,:    of this sum,  about/jLoJ per cent represents the payments/made

Cadetships and Scholarships.      159 General List Cadetsentered Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth in September1968.     This was slightly less than in 1967.      As in former years,the principal shortfall was of suitable candidates for theengineering specialisation, but several seaman places were alsounfilled.      A second General List entry is being introduced inMay.     72 Royal Naval and 6 Royal Marines Scholarships,  85 royal naval Reserved Cadetships and 3 Royal Marlines Reserved Appoint-ments were awarded in 1968.A.IXRECRUITING AND RE-ENGAGEMENTPUBLICITY1. Expenditure on advertising for recruits to the services will he / m/.STRENGTHS OF THE services . The strengths of the Services are summarised in thefollowing table:TOTAL STRENGTH (UNITED KINGDOM PERSONNEL)

^*       University Cadetships and Graduate Entry.     The results ofthe 1968 University Cadetship Competition were most encouraging,and 28 Cadetships were awarded compared with 13 in the previouscompetition;   the scheme has now heen extended to the royal marines,  and the total included 2 Royal Marine awards.5.       Supplementary List.     The entry of rotary-wing aircrew has been adjusted to allow for the transition to an all rotary-wingforce.6.       The shortage of candidates for the seaman and engineeringspecialisations has heen reflected in cadet entry into the supplementary List.      There has heen a considerable improvementin recruitment of qualified engineers,  although many more are needed.7.       Instructor, Medical and Dental Branches.     The requirednumber of instructor officers has heen entered.      Only 3 qualifieddoctors have been entered during tine year,  and mostentrants into the medical and dental branches have been recruitedthrough the cadetship schemes.8.       Royal Marines.     The annual entry of permanent royal marine officers was slightly below target, but there has been nodifficulty in recruiting officers for short service commissions,THE ARMY9.       Regular and Short Service Officers.      The Army is now up to strength in total numbers of officers,  although some individualcorps have deficiencies or surpluses.     For example, there areshortages of junior officers in some technical and specialistcorps.      It is becoming more difficult to obtain the necessarynumbers of young officers of the right quality for the various categories.

CONFIDENTIAL10.      The annual target for the Special Regular Commission andthe Short Service Commission remains at 500.     The SpecialRegular Commission has now been in existence for a year,  and itis becoming clear that it is not yet attracting enough youngcivilians.     During the early months of 1968 the number of applications for short service commissions dropped sharply;but the introduction of a scheme by which service on a short service commission can be linked to a future career in industry has produced more candidates.11.     The intake into the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst,for September 1968 was 1h8.      This was up to target,  allowing for the reduction in the size of the Army.      The numbers for the january 1969 entry (109) were satisfactory.     Forty scholarshipswere awarded between the Spring and Autumn competitions,  thegeneral standard of applicants being high.      6k boys enteredWelbeck College in 1968 against a target of 75.12.     University Entry.      Our target is 65.      Of these we were able to award 23 University Cadetships in 1968, the same as in1967.     The number of graduates who took commissions in thecombatant branches in the Army remains at about 25.13.     Medical.     The number of medical cadets joining the activelist reached a peak of 67 in 1968.      One third of the medical officers in the Royal Army Medical Corps are no?/ ex-cadets.Unfortunately, the recruitment of both qualified and registereddoctors and of cadets has fallen markedly,  and the number of voluntary retirements has risen.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE1^.      Cadetships and Scholarships.      In 1968 recruitment to theRoyal Air Force College Cranwell was satisfactory.     Due to the cancellation of the Spring 1969 entry for the General Duties/Branch,

CONFIDENTIALBranch, the Autumn 1968 intake was increased hy 31 cadets;    90of the 98 non-engineer places were taken up.     The engineerentry was again below requirements although it was better thanin 1967.15.      University Cadetships and Graduate Entry.     The annual increase in applications for university cadetships was maintained and 83 awards were made in 1968 - an increase of 33 over theprevious year.     The total number of cadets in residence at universities was 137 against a target of 201. 3h University Cadets,three cx-Henlow cadets,  16 Cranwell Engineer Cadets (degree-trained) graduated during the year.     h.6 graduates joined theService direct from civil life.16.      Other Entrants to Commissioned Service.      The reducedtargets for pilot and navigator entries were met.      It was stilldifficult to attract high quality entrants to the Engineer Branch.Recruitment to the other main ground branches was at the same level as in the previous year and was again below requirements,17.     Medical and Dental Branches.      35 Medical and 2 DentalCadetships were awarded.      It remained very hard to attractqualified doctors into the Service to replace the increasing number who declined a full Service career.RECRUITMENT OF RATINGS.   SOLDIERS AND AIRMENROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES18.     Throughout 1968 recruitment ran at the rate of 5,000 ayear.     This is substantially below the level required;    inparticular,  there are major shortages of recruits for the SeamanCommunications and Electrical Branches,THE ARMY19. During 1968, /T13727 male adults were enlisted into theArmy of whom /&apos;257i07&apos; or /22.GJ per cent were young soldiers age/17 to

17 to 17? years.     This compares with 3246 young soldiers (or21 per cent)     recruited in 1967.     Adult recruiting during 1968was running at /267 per cent below the 1967 level.     The numberof junior soldiers enlisted (ages 15 and 16) decreased from56OI+ to ,/53427.20.     The number of adults and young soldiers who elected toserve for nine years (as opposed to six or less years) onenlistment was /42.47 per cent of the total enlisted.     this compares with 48.1 per cent for 1967.21.      Efforts are being made to improve methods of selectingrecruits and so reduce wastage.     Pilot schemes for thecentralized selection of adults and junior recruits were started in 1968 and are showing promising results.     We hope that both schemes will go a long way to reduce the present high rateof wastage Of recruits and trained soldiers.     These are completely new systems of residential selection, consisting ofa carefully devised programme of occupational guidance,  aptitudetesting, assessment and assignment.      They should lead to abetter matching of men and jobs, greater job satisfaction for individual soldiers and a better distribution of manpower tomeet the Army&apos;s needs.     Reduced wastage and increased workingefficiency should also produce financial savings.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE22.     During the year 4584 adult mal-e^-airmeivvrar^^with 5,161  in 1967.      Recruiting was poor during the first half of the year but had improved by the autumn./23.- 107--

23.      The main shortfalls were in the trades of aircraftmechanic (weapons), aircraft mechanic (electrical) and electronicmechanic (navigation instruments).2k.      The requirement for engineering technician apprentices was largely met.25.      &quot;1035 craft apprentices were recruited against a requirement of 1692.      The recruitment of administrative apprentices was insufficient.THE WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES26.     The recruitment rate for the Women&apos;s Royal Naval service has fallen since 1967 and has &quot;been running slightly below thelevel required.     Recruitment for the Queen Alexandra&apos;s royal naval Nursing Service is, however,  satisfactory.27.     Officer recruiting for Queen Alexandra&apos;s Royal ArmyNursing Corps continues to be short of requirements,  and the corps is 27 per cent under strength.      The Women7s Royal army corps is in a better position, but slightly under strength.Recruiting for other ranks of both Corps has been down on 1967.28.      Recruitment to the Women&apos;s Royal Air Force wasdisappointing;    only 1,261 were enlisted compared with 1,805 in1967.      Recruitment of Princess Mary,1 s   Royal Air Force NursingService student nurses   was satisfactory, but the response tothe state-enrolled nurse scheme was not as good as we had wished.CADET FORCES29.     Naval assistance to the Combined Cadet Force and the SeaCadet Corps in 1968 was on a similar scale to 1967.     Althoughfinal figures are not yet available, the number of sea cadetsjoining the Royal Navy may fall short of last year&apos;s figure.30.     The total cadet strength of the Army Sections of the combined Cadet Force and the Army Cadet Forces is 70,500.

31.      The Regular Army Training Teams are proving to he ofconsiderable value to the Cadet Forces.     Regular Army units in both the U.K.  and B.A.O.R. are helping, where possible,  toprovide facilities for training and annual camp.     alternative accommodation for detachments of the Army Cadet Force displacedby the re-organisation of the Territorial Army in is nearlycomplete.32.     The total strength of the Air Training Corps (A.T.C.)and Royal Air Force Sections of the Combined Cadet Force (C.C,F.)is now 39,500, an increase of some 2,500 over&quot; the past 12months.      Former cadets continue to form a substantial propor-tion of entrants to the Royal Air Force;    in 1967,  20 per cent of all entrants to the Royal Air Force had been members of theA.T.C.  or the Royal Mr Force Sections of the C.C. F.33.     The Committee set up to review the organisation,administration and training of the A.T.C. has now reported andits recommendations have been accepted by the Air Force Board.The recommendations covered the whole scope of the Corps&apos;activities,  including the introduction of a regional system ofadministration, larger training and administration grants to individual squadrons,  a better standard of accommodation,  theprovision of new and more interesting forms of training and a lowering of the enrolment age of cadets.      Certain changes,suchas a reduction in the upper age limit for officers of the Corpswill be effected gradually in order to minimise disturbance.,R E-ENQA GEMENTROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES3k.     The improvement in re-engagement rates of men completing9 and 12 years&apos; engagements continued in 1968.     The rate formen who stay on for a further 5 years after completing

9-year engagements has risen from 29 per cent to 31 per cent in1968;   for men on 12-year engagements who opt to serve a further10 years to complete 22 years^pensionable service,  the rate has risen from 48 per cent in 1967 to 51 per cent in 1968,      therate for men on 14-year engagements who stay on to complete22 years, has, however,  fallen from 87 per cent in 1967 to 80 percent in 1968.THE ARMY35.      Considerable effort has again been put into re-engagementwithin the Army.      In 1968, about 76 per cent of all soldierscompleting six years service remained in the Army to serve on for nine years;    of those who completed nine years1 service, about53 per cent have remained to serve on for twelve years or more:and of those reaching the twelve years service point, about90 per cent are serving on to complete the full 22 years&apos;engagement.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE36.     The numbers of those re-engaging to complete 22 years&apos;service or more are controlled and remain satisfactory.      Aboutthe same number of airmen as in 1967 - some 2,200 - re-engagedfor pension in 1968.      2,430 additional airmen extended their service in 1968 compared with 1,903 in 1967.

XPERSONNEL AND FAMILY SERVICESACCOMMODATION1.     The redeployment of our forces in the United Kingdom inthe light of withdrawals from overseas,  reductions in support,and the run-down cf the Services has led to a thorough reviewof our long-term requirements for both single and marriedaccommodation.     The full implications are still being worked out.     At locations where there is no doubt about our continuedtenure,  the building and modernization programmes are continuing.M.ARRIED QUARTERS AND HIRINGS2.     The special programme introduced in 1966 to provide housingfor Servicemen and their families returning from overseas is nearly complete:    of the 8,000 houses we planned to buy, nearly7,500 have been purchased or are under negotiation:    about,200 are already occupied.     Requirements will be kept underreview, but we do not expect to take further special measuresto provide houses for the families who will have returned tothis country by 1971.3.     The total number of married quarters of the three services in the United Kingdom,  including those recently purchased, nowamounts to over 82,000,      3,500 married quarters are at present being built in this country.      Our forecast of expenditureon the building programme for all three Services during 1969-70is approximately  9^m.     Hirings will continue to be used wheremarried quarters are not available;    their cost in 1969-70 forall three Services is estimated to be  km in the United Kingdomand  10m overseas,/BARRACK- 111  -

BARRACK ACCOMMODATIONk.      It is estimated that during 1969-70 over  29m will hespent on better accommodation and facilities for Service per-sonnel.     Work has now been completed on the renovation of thetemporary camps needed in the short term to accommodate troopsbrought home from overseas.HEALTH OF THE services.     In spite of shortages of staff, particularly of doctors,the medical services of the armed forces are keeping up high standards.     The health of the forces is excellent.      In theArmy, for example,  in 1967 (the latest year for which we have complete figures) hospital admission rates for all cases werethe lowest yet recorded.      The average proportion of men non-effective for medical reasons was less than 1 per.cent. This comparesvery well with the rate in industry.     Our medical services carefor dependants as well as servicemen;    for instance,  in 1967 theArmy and Royal Air Force Medical Services attended to nearlyh, 000 births in B. A. O.R.MANPOWER RUNDOWN6.     Further progress has been made in the rundown to the newforce levels.      Between April 1968 and January ^969,  thestreng+hs of United Kingdom uniformed officers and other ranksfell by:Royal Navy and Royal Marines /2,056/Army /?, 108/Royal Air Force /U,938/7.     Detailed plans for the rundown of the Royal Navy havebeen worked out and promulgated to the Fleet.     There will beno redundancy discharges until October 1970, but applications/for the- 112 -

confidential for the first phase have been invited in order to give thoseselected a year&apos;s notice.8.       Redundancy figures for the Army up to April 1969 areexpected to be as follows:Officers Soldiers        Total(1)    Up to April 19*58        300 606 906(2)    April 1968 to k97 1138 1635April 1969TOTALS 797 174L 25U190 per cent of the officers and 77 per cent of the soldiersmade redundant were volunteers.      The forecast redundancy forthe year I969--7O is 2h2 officers and 9U6 soldiers.9.       The first phasefof redundancy in the Royal Air Force endson 31 March 1969.      Of some 2,k00 officers and men declaredredundant,  1,900 had left by December 1968 ;     about 90 per cent of these were volunteers.      Apart from a few senior officers,no further redundancy is expected in the Royal Air Force in1969-70.RESETTLEMENT10.     Mr. C.A. Roberts, C.B. e., who was until recently a memberof the National Coal Board and has served in the Armed Forces,has accepted the appointment of Honorary Adviser on ForcesResettlement foreshadowed in Chapter X, para 63 of Cmnd. 3701,He will help with a review of resettlement arrangements whichis now under way;    advise the Ministers concerned on possible improvements;    and will generally   promote   the co-operationof employers in the resettlement of Servicemen.11.&apos;&apos;    Eight Regional Resettlement Committees are now functioning.These committees serve a most useful purpose, acting as a link between the Forces Resettlement Service and the employers,/trade

trade unions and educational establishments in their areas,and in helping with particixlar cases of difficulty.     the resettlement Service is indebted to these businessmen andothers who generously give their time and experience in servingon these committees.12.      Ail three Services have overhauled and expanded theircounselling facilities.     Additional resettlement panels (onwhich the Department of Employment and Productivity is represented) have heen established to give guidance to membersof the forces in their resettlement problems .and advice on employment and training.     Two-day advisory courses on careersin civil life have been introduced for officers,  and for non-commissioned officers with appropriate qualifications.      their object is to show the opportunities which exist,  to assistindividuals to decide on a suitable career, and to advise onthe preparation necessary.     The courses include personalvocational guidance and offer the greatest benefit if they are taken at least two years before retirement so that there willbe time for a suitable course of study for a specific qualifica-tion.      Service personnel of all ranks who require specialadvice and guidance can have interviews with the OccupationalGuidance Units of the Department of Employment and Productivity.13.      The capacity of the Forces Resettlement Centres, whichoffer pre-release courses of 28 days in a wide variety of trade,commercial and general subjects, has been considerably expanded to cope with the increased requirement.     Arrangements arebeing worked out with the Department of Employment and productivity, whereby the time spent at a Resettlement Centremay count towards the time required for a course at a government training Centre.      It has also been agreed that Servicemen may/start

start courses at Government Training Centres up to two months before their discharge.1k.     A number of new pre-release courses have been introducedor are under negotiation.      The capacity of the BusinessTraining and Potential Supervisors&apos;  courses, run under the auspices of the Department of Employment and Productivity, hasbeen increased.      The arrangements for the refund to studentsof tuition costs for certain pre-release courseshave also been improved.

XIHOME defence in the Statement on the Defence Estimates; 1968 (Cmnd 3540),it was stated that the Government had decided that civil defence should he put on a care and maintenance basis.    This has now heendone.    Training and planning is to continue at the minimum levelthat will permit more active preparations to be resumed if thisshould prove necessary.    Total annual public expenditure on homedefence was reduced to  ^i^zJ in &quot;1968-69 and is expected to fallin subsequent years to under  8m.- 116 -

The strengths in Table 2 are additional to those in Table 1  and consist of forces and units enlisted over-&apos;seas and personnel enlisted into the forces on local service terms.2.     In 1969-70 the Armed Forces will need about Uh,000 male entrants.This figure consists of men who enter upon regular engagements andthose who enter as juniors, junior soldiers, youths and apprentices.3.
