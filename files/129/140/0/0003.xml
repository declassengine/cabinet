(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 3 COPY NO.8th January 1969CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS:   THE CONCILIATION PAUSEMenorandun by the Paymaster general  an deeply concerned about the proposals for a conciliation pausein their present form, and have suggested to the First Secretary of Statesome changes which I think worth exploring to meet sone of the objectionsto this passage of her Qiite Paper as it now stands.     I think it rightto outline these to my colleagues.2.     I should first indicate both the area of my agreement with theFirst secretary approach, and secondly the reasons for ny reservationson certain aspects of her proposals.     I agree -(i)   that Donovan as it stands, minus its proposal concerningSection 3 of the 1906 Act, which she rightly rejects as an anti-union step, is not enough to deal with the problem ofthe unconstitutional strike and the effect it can have on the economy in some instances;(ii)   that the Shonfield approach is to be rejected;(lii)   that a conciliation pause procedure is potentially a valuablemethod of encouraging a return to work in unconstitutional strikes;(iv)   that the Industrial Board should, during the pause, investigate the situation.3. My reservations are on the proposition that fines should beinpQsable by the Board upon all the employees taking part in theunconstitutional strike.

The sanction will often prove cither ineffective-., or unworkablo.4,,     The First Secretary of State explains that she would invoke theconciliation pause only rarely.     Inhere the pause procedure is invoked,several possibilities arise.(a) The union concerned nay declare the stike official, either inthe nomal course of events, or in order deliberately tocircunvent the now sanctions.     In either case, they would pay strike pay to the nen.(b) The strikers nay stay out, and refuse to pay the fines, sothat the difficult process of attachment of earnings whenthey eventually return to work has to be invoked.     Thiswould nean that deterrence had been transformed intoretribution post hoc.(c) Strikers nay leave their enploynent in order to avoidprolonged paynent of fines, and the Connittoe on industrial relations agreed that it would be wrong to pursue then intheir new enploynent, or to soek any repercussions on social security paynonts to which they would be entitled duringunenploynent (although the committee agreed that this shouldnot be so stated in the White Paper).     Leaving enploynentwould, of course, be nore likely in sone regions than inethers, depending upon job opportunities, so that there wouldbe an unfortunate regional differentiation in the ability to &quot;avoid&quot; fines.I fear that  ^ny of these possibilities, or a coribination of one or two ofthen, nay be as likely to occur in cases where the pause procedure, asat present envisaged, is invoked as a snooth return to work, or a returnto work plus; ready paynent of any fines incurred.Public expectations will be disappointed5.     If the deterrent effects of the proposed sanction of fines on allunconstitutional strikers are capable of being avoided or counteracted, and ifthe pause procedure is in any case to be invoked only rarely, th? proposals will lack credibility at the outset, and nay well prove ineffective in-2-

operation.   They .could therefore, as tho President of the Eoard- of Trade saysin his rocont minute addressed, to tho Prime Minister and copied to our colleagues, &quot;create expectations which are hound to be disappointed.   Thus theG-overnment would appear ineffective, and the field would be left open for more violent Tory proposals&quot;.   Any alternative to Conservative policiesmust be both credible and workable if we are not to give great political advantage to the Opposition.The Labour movement will become embittered6.     On this occasion, considerable sections of the Party and the movementare likely to feel deep doubts and to oppose the conciliation pauseprocedure for fines, however much they welcome other provisions in theWhite Paper.   Dispute is likely to follow the publication of the white paper, stretching&apos;into the Trades Union Congress and Party Conference, and leading up to contentious, difficult, and lengthy legislation in theHouse in the 1969/70 period which precedes the next election.   At thattime we shall need not only acquiescence in Government policies, but a revival of enttmsiasm.   It may be argued that the strike ballot pro-cedure will be opposed equally vigorously, but there is, in my view,a sharp difference between a sensible proposal which can be justified,and a proposal which lacks credibility in any case.The philosophy of an alternative pause procedure for sanctions7.     There are two views about unofficial unconstitutional strikers.   one is that they are all wicked and disruptive people.   The other is that untilboth management and unions reform their procedures, many of those whostrike unconstitutionally are reacting with varying degrees of impul-siveness to difficult and sudden situations but that a few individualsbehave malevolently and disruptively and wilfully (e.g. Mr. Rourko 6fGdrlings).   It is the second view which we take, I think.   And it iscertainly the second view which has been expressed in support of theconciliation pause procedures.-3-

8.     The real difficulty in which we find ourselves on this issue seensto ne to be that this &quot;accepted&quot; philosophy is not the one which thepause procedures oribody.   The monent one proposes to fine all unconsti-tutional strikers engaged in a dispute, one has ceased to differentiatemeaningfully between the Rourkes and the rest, and ia therefore appearingunjust to workers who genuinely &quot;down tools&quot; in response to a situationwhich appears to then at the tine to be wrong.     Also, since the&quot;accepted&quot; philosophy embraces bad managements as well as disruptiveworkers, it is logical that sanctions should be able to be imposed uponemployers as well as upon employees, and I an therefore glad that thisis now to be considered.     If a way through these inconsistencies betweenphilosophy and proposed practice can be found, I am inclined to believethat both party and public opinion would be very much more favourable.An Alternative Pause Procedure9.     (i)   As soon as the Secretary of State makes an order requiringthose involved in an unconstitutional strike to desist fromany strike or lock-out, the Industrial Board would autona-tically bo brought in, and - if it thought it desirable to investigate the natter - would begin an investigation of the causes of the dispute, and would decide whether or not to3ay that responsibility for the unconstitutional strikerested either with management or with one or more individualstrikers.     In some cases, it would choose not to assignresponsibility.     In others, it would.     Where it did so,it would impose fines either on the employer, or on thoseindividual strikers it decided were to blame.     (At Girlings,this might be all 22, or ju3t Mr. Rourke).     Thus theresponsibility for whether action was taken leading to fineswould rest more 3quarely on an independent body than on theGovernment.(ii)   The Board would be free (and indeed expects) to recommend tothe Union concerned any steps which in the Board&apos;s viewnight help to avoid a recurrence of similar troubles - e.g.the withdrawal of shop steward&apos;s credentials from anyparticular individuals.     But of course such recommendations would be purely advisory.-4-SECRET

(iii)   The possibility has also been suggested that, in addition,the Y/hite Paper might propose that employers seriously affected by an unconstitutional strike at a factory owned by another firm be given povrers to prosecute the persons foundto be responsible      (e.g. Fords could prosecute Mr. Rourke).The powers might, conceivably, not be used:   bub in that event,responsibility for failure to implement an effective policy would lie heavily with employers.     However, there are someobvious difficulties in this idea.10.   In practical terms, would such an alternative preclude any of thedifficulties outlined in paragraph V?     I believe it would, becauseunion antagonism would be less likely, and so the post facto declarationof an unconstitutional strike to be official would be less likely to occur.     Avoidance of fines by giving up the job-would be less likely,because fines would not automatically follow participation in a dispute.Arrestment of wages would occur only in those cases where such a stepwas clearly justified.     All in all, the likelihood of the pauseprocedure securing the objective of bringing the men back to work wouldbe considerably increased.The Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR)11.   There is one further point which ought, I think, to be included inthe Yihite Paper.     It is clear from the DEP&apos;s valuable analysis of recentunconstitutional disputes that troubles, and probable troublemakers, are concentrated in a relatively small section of industry which is capableof affecting a much wider section of the economy.     While it is alsoclear that the big task to be tackled by the CIR will be long-term, itwould seem useful to consider that as soon as it is set up, it should setup Working Parties to consider these limited and difficult areas ofindustry as a matter of extreme urgency, and to indicate this in theY/hite Paper.     It might then be possible to show some practical achievementsby the time legislation is under way.     This would clearly be most helpfulfrom every point of view.Conclusion12.   I would hope that colleagues will agree that the alternative proposals  have suggested should be fully explored.     I recognise that this will involve some further slight delay in presenting the uhlte Paper.   But the issues involved are so crucial that I believe this to be worthwhile.J.H.70 Y/hitehall, S.W.1.7th January 1969 &quot;5&quot;
