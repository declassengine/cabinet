TRADES UNION CONGRESSWHITE PAPER ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS -comments &quot;by General council the T.U.C. General Council have examined with care the proposals madeby the Government for changes in the system of industrial relations and Inthe law relating to trade unions.   A number of the suggested changes - thosewhich relate to the establishment of a Commission for Industrial relations and to the registration of procedure agreements;    to the assurance toworkpeople of the right to join trade unions and to trade unions of the rightto recognition;   to the maintenance and indeed the extension of the protectionnow afforded to trade union activities by the Trade Disputes Act, 1906;   tothe protection of workpeople against unfair dismissal;    to the extension ofthe jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunals;    to the provision of betterinformation for collective bargaining purposes;   and to the removal of someobstacles to workers&apos; participation in management - could in principle help to improve industrial relations and to promote trade union objectives.   TheGeneral Council will wish to clarify certain aspects of these proposals intheir further discussions with the Government.The General Council however are opposed to, or at least have reservations about, the Government&apos;s other proposals, and they wish to leave theGovernment in no doubt about the nature of those reservations and thestrength of their objections.The General Council&apos;s aim is to reach agreement with the Governmenton ways of improving industrial relations and of strengthening voluntarycollective bargaining.   This is the test by which the General Council have examined both the Report of the Royal Commission and the Government&apos;sproposals - which in some significant respects discard advice givenunanimously by the Royal Commission.   As the General Council emphasised both/in their

in their evidence to the Royal Commission and in their comments on the Report(Action on Donovan), trade unionists recognise the need to make such changesin the structure and the activities of their organisations as are requiredto promote the social and economic advance of the nation.   Affiliated unions,in association with the T.U.C., are embarking on a detailed examination of how such changes can best be made on the basis of voluntary action which isat the same time the foundation of free trade unionism and the essentialprerequisite if the men and women who together make up the trade union movement are themselves to accept such changes willingly.   This processhowever would be impeded if the Government allowed itself to be misled,against the advice of the Royal Commission, by outside criticism which is at best uninformed and at worst ill-intentioned.   Any attempt by Governmentto impose unreasonable and therefore unworkable constraints on the freedomof working people to pursue their legitimate objectives could only harmthe relationships between the trade union movement and the Government and between working people and employers.Inter-union disputesThis danger is clearly illustrated by the Government&apos;s proposal that,in an inter-union dispute, the First Secretary should have power to imposefinancial penalties on an employer who or a union which refuses to comply witha recommendation by the C.I.R. that the union should be excluded fromrecognition.   The General Council are themselves concerned that such disputesshould be avoided or at least amicably settled without causing industrialdisruption.   They accept that arrangements for handling such disputes are oneof their central responsibilities, and will be considering, in the lightof the Report of the Royal Commission, ways of strengthening T.U.C.procedures in the context of improving trade union organisation and extending membership./The General

The General Council accept the view of the Royal Commission that,in addition to the development of the T.U,C.&apos;s own activities in these directions, the C.I.R. itself may well have a useful part to play in bringing persuasion to bear on the unions involved, and indeed ininfluencing employers&apos; recognition policies.   The General Council do not exclude the possibility that in some situations the Government mightadd its weight to a recommendation by the C.I.R.   They are howeverconvinced that to impose financial penalties on a union, on the grounds that in a Minister&apos;s opinion such a dispute may cause economic damage,would militate against finding a genuine solution for this problem.Trade Union Development fund the General Council are by no muans enthusiastic about this offer to establish a state-financed trade union development fund.   The general council&apos;s consultations with unions following the Donovan Report will cover a range of matters from the development, reform and extension of collective bargaining to the reform of trade union structure and areduction of multi-unionism.   The General Council will themselves haveto consider, in consultation with the unions concerned, ways in whic hany deficiencies can be rectified, but experience gives no ground for believing that financial problems are a significant obstacle toamalgamation, or that trade unionists are unwilling to recognise the need to increase contributions where Executives can show that this is needed to improve such services as training, education and research./Legal

The General Council welcome the Government&apos;s acceptance of the view,argued by the T.U.C. and endorsed by the Royal Commission, that collective agreements neither should nor in practice could be made legally enforceablecontracts by statute.   They have noted the Government1 s proposal that tradeunions and employers1 associations should be enabled, by an amendment ofthe Trade Union Act, 1871, to enter into contracts which would be legally enforceable by an agreement between the parties to write this expresslyinto the collective agreement.   They are bound to point out, however, thatthere is very little prospect of unions or employers&apos; associationsmaking use of such a provision.   In any particular case it would leadto the same difficulty as would arise generally if all contracts were madelegally enforceable by statute.   The prospect that judicial decisionsmight be required about the rights of a dispute would compel unions and employers to frame the terms of the agreement in such a way thatthey would be legally sustainable.   A union would need to adopt inpractice a quite novel relationship with its members by acting as theiragent and committing them in procedure agreements, since individualsare not implicitly parties to procedure agreements.   There is also thedanger that the introduction of legal terminology into collective agreements would make these less comprehensible to the members.   Thiswould run counter to the need for comprehensible and flexible agreements,particularly as company bargaining develops./Ballots on

The General Council regard as completely misguided and quite unacceptablethe Government&apos;s proposal to take discretionary powers to require a union to conduct a ballot which, in a Minister&apos;s opinion, threatens economic damage, andto back these powers with the threat of financial penalties.   Here again theGovernment has disregarded the considered view of the Royal Commission, whichpointed out that there is little evidence for the view that workpeople are less likely to vote for strike action than their leaders.   The experience of responsible trade union leaders is that to remove from them the right to exercise any responsibility is likely to militate very strongly against confidence inunion leadership, and that unofficial action would be encouraged, not reduced,as a result.    The resentment of trade unionists at such an intervention wouldbe increased by the proposal that a Minister should decide the tennis of thequestion to be incorporated in the ballot paper and to determine the appropriatemajority (of two-thirds in some cases).There are also very serious practical objections to compulsory ballots.The timing of the ballot would clearly be crucial and the result could dependon this.   There could also be a whole range of possible arguments about such things as entitlement to vote, and irregularities in arrangements which undera statutory procedure could give rise to a real danger of injunctions anddisputes about the proper procedure.   These are matters which are theresponsibility of responsible bodies in unions;    there is no argument about thegeneral record in the exercise of these responsibilities in the past.The General Council do not question the right of the Government to discuss with a union which is contemplating an official strike the desirability of holding a strike ballot.   Advice from the Government would not be lightlydisregarded, but to go beyond this and to force an Executive against itsjudgment to hold a ballot, under the threat of financial penalties, wouldworsen, not improve, the situation./Unconstitutional strikes

The Royal Commission made an exhaustive examination of proposals thatstatutorily enforceable procedures for imposing &quot;cooling-off&quot; periods onunofficial and unconstitutional (and indeed on other) strikes should beintroduced.   The Commission^ unanimous conclusion was that procedures of this sort would not be beneficial, and that the Government&apos;s powers should not beincreased.   Despite this, the Government has proposed that it should take areserve power to impose such a procedure, and to fine individual workers who did not comply with an order.The General Council do not believe that this proposal is either practicableor desirable.   Such a provision could not be applied where ther are no procedure agreements.   Even where thsue are such agreements they are not legal contracts,and it is therefore difficult to see how a judicial pronouncement could lay down when the procedure had been broken by individuals or groups (assuming thatas a matter of elementary justice unions would be able to appeal to a Courtagainst a Minister1s decision).   Moreover, it is not unlikely that trade unions,whether or not as a result of pressure from the membership, would seek to moketheir procedure agreements so general in their terms that they would not givethe Government the opportunity to initiate action:    this would be the reverseof the development which the Royal Commission cogently advocated.   Finally,in terms of achieving the objectives of securing a resumption of normal working,even if it was possible to compel strikers to return to work, it would not bepossible to prevent them, if they so ohose, from working without enthusiasm(with which no conceivable law could deal)-.The Government acknowledges that it would not be possible to define preciselyin a statute what strikes would be unconstitutional, or to define at all in what circumstances its consequences were &quot;likely to be serious&quot;, and that these issues would have to be defined by the Minister concerned.   The General Councildo not accept that it accords with democratic procedures to give a Ministerunfettered discretion to invoke powers to fine workpeople solely on the grounds/that in his

that in his opinion the results of a strike are likely to he serious, usingsuch criteria as he may think appropriate.The General Council fully share the Royal Commission&apos;s concern that the causes of unconstitutional strikes should he removed, and their view is thatthe most constructive way of achieving this lies in reforming the institutions of whose defects they are a symptom.   The (Government&apos;s proposal would in facthinder such a reform.Compulsory trade union registration and the Independent Review BodyThe General Council set out at length in &quot;action on Donovan&quot; their reasonsfor dissenting from the Royal Commission&apos;s recomendation that trade unions shouldhe subjected to compulsory registration and should be obliged by statute toensure that their rule books cover certain defined subjects.   The Governmentis in fact proposing to go even further than the Royal Commission by addingone significant subject, strike ballots:    apparently its intention is that,while unions would be free to frame the specified rules to meet their own requirements, this would not apply to strike ballots.The proposal that the matters to he dealt with in union rules shouldeffectively be statutorily determined, and that an independent review body should be established to ensure among other things that the statutory requirements are adhered to, are not based on evidence that there is a serious problem which is not dealt with.   Furthermore, the Government has apparentlydisregarded the General Council&apos;s assurance that they are to examine jointly with unions whether their rules are satisfactory, and the possibility of instituting a procedure under the auspices of the T.U.C. for hearing individual cases of complaints that a union&apos;s rules have not been fairly applied.   TheGeneral Council do not accept that there is any justification whatever for theGovernment to pursue these two proposals unless and until it can produceevidence that the General Council&apos;s own plans are not going to produce asatisfactory result./The General

The General Council hope therefore that the Government will, before itsWhite Paper is published, reconsider those issues in the light of the general council&apos;s comments and proposals for action and of the advice that it receivedfrom the Royal Commission.
