DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 1917th February, 1969COPY NO.0CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN 1968-69. 1969-70 AND 1970-71;WHITE paper note by the Chancellor of the exchequer as foreshadowed in Cabinet on Tuesday, 11th February,(CC(69) 8th Conclu sions, Minute 2), I am now circulating for theinformation of my colleagues the draft of the statement on public expenditure which I shall be making on Thursday, 20th February andsubsequently publishing as a White Paper.2. I am also circulating this to the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy,R.H. J,Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.17th February, 1969

STAgMMT BY THE CEAHCX LOR OP THE HCEEQNER ON&apos;    THE vtmmTON ACCOMTTl^i/The St at erne nt would also be the tejxV of a&apos;Y/liit&quot;e&quot;Paifer/With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement.2.     I am now able to report progress to the House on the management of public expenditure for 1968-69 and 1969-70, and to indicate theGovernment&apos;s further plans for 1970-71.3.     I indicated to the House on 25th November and 2nd December that public expenditure for both 1968-69 and 1969-70 was running withinthe tobals announced by the Government just over a year ago.1After taking into account the Spring Supplementary Estimates for1968-69 and later this cprecision and detail.the Vote on Account for 1969-70, which will be published.fternoon, I can now give this indication greater firmness4.     Por 1968-69 I estimatebest available information aboi.itoutturn, that aggregate expenditure will be  15,870 million atforecast outturn prices, as againstfor 1967-68 at the same price level,terms over the previous year of 4.6the announced figure of At per cent.an aggregate of  15,165 million this is an increase in realr cent, satisfactorily within5.     Por 1969-70, in accordance with the Government1s announcement in January of last-year, the increase in public expenditure over1968-69 will be held to 1 per cent in real terms.    The presentestimate puts the aggregate for specific programmes at 16,365 million, at 1969 Estimates prices, with  75 million availablefor contingencies making a total of  16,440 million,increase of almost exactly 1 ;;er cent over the 1968-69 targetenvisaged a year ago.on6.     I shall bo making the t;of this statement availableWhite Pauer, which will also include details of the latest estimates of the various mam services ana programmes.7.    I have explained that the figure for 1968-69 takes full accountof the Supplementary Estimates which are being published today.    01the total&quot;of  165 million for which Supplementary provision will besought, taking civil and defence Estimates together, only  81 minionrepresents an&quot;increase in public expenditure in real terms.    Theremainder relates to two elements:    first, transfers within thepublic sector and other transactions which add nothing to public ^expenditure, amounting to  22 million-,    and secondly, ray and price increases amounting to  52 million.    As the House knows, the conventions which govern the form of Supplementary Estimates precludethorn from showing the full extent of under-spendings on Votes;    andthese under-spendings will be substantially greater than the supplementary&quot;Estimates now being presented./8.1&quot;Public Expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70&quot;, Cmnd. 3515.

8.     Figures for 1969-70 similarly take account of that part of central Government expenditure for which provision is made in thenew Supply Estimates, which will be published in summary form todaywith the Vote on Account.9.     It may be helpfi.il if I explain briefly how Supply expenditurefits within the framework of the planned 1 per cent increase in public expenditure at constant prices.    The net total of the Supply estimates for 1969-70 is  11,571 million, and making the crudest comparisionwith the net total of Supply Estimates for last yoar&apos;s Budget this represents an increase of 7.9 per cent before discounting price increases.    But Supply Estimates include a number of financialtransactions which are not part of public expenditure.    The great bulk of these are grants and net lending to local authorities andpublic corporations which are not counted towards public    expendituretotals, because otherwise there would be double counting:    it is thefinal spending by local authorities and other public bodies whichenters into the public expenditure total,    for these reasons, asmuch as a quarter of Supply expenditure is not public expenditure.But public expenditure&apos;is several more steps away from supply expenditure, since public expenditure includes a number of largeitems which are not voted annually bp the House.    The main ones arethe outgoings of the national insurance funds, the expenditure oflocal authorities, ana the capital investment of public corporationsother than the nationalised industries.    Thus the total and make-upof public expenditure is very different from those of supply expenditure;    and consequently, comparing 1969-70 with 1968-69, theincrease in public expenditure is also very different from theincrea.se in Supply expenditure.    Talcing all the steps in thereconciliation - and these will be found set out in the White Paper -and making the necessary adjustment to discount the effects of price changes, the estimated increase in public expenditure in 1969-70 in real terms is the planned figure cf 1 per cent.10.   The relationship between the Supply figures and the figuresfor public expenditure as a whole which I ha.ve traced in this statement is not easy to present or to apprehend, and the mere factthat it requires lengthy explanation is one of a number of unsatisfactory consequences of procedures for handling the Vote onAccount which were devised for another age.    I liope that by theappropriate processes of the House it may be possible in the courseof the coming year to devise some simpler and more informativearrangements.11.   To complete the picture, I should tell the House that capitalexpenditure by the nationalised industries, the B.B.C., the I.T.A.and Covent Garden Market Authority in the current year is now expectedto be at least 6 per cent at constant prices below the level expecteda year ago, and to continue at about the current level in 1969-70.In 1970-71 Pit is provisionally estimated to revert to around thehigher 1967-68 level, though firm figures have not yet been approved.

12.    The Government have now completed a review of public expenditure for 1970-71.    I shall give details of the specific programmes inthe White Paper, but as with the original figures for 1968-69 and1969-70, the amounts given there must be read as subject to suchmarginal adjustments, within the overall total, as may from time totime be needed to ensure that the expenditure plan as a whole isadhered to.    The aggregate of the specific programmes in 1970-71is -planned to increase by about 2 per cent above total public expenditure in 1969-70, plus a further margin of up to 1 per cent which will be available, if required, to meet whatever contingenciesmay arise.    It is the firm intention of the Government to mana.gepublic expenditure in 1970-71 within these limits, which have been selected as fully consistent with attainment of-the Government&apos;sdeclared objectives for social progress,  economic advance, and,as the first priority in present circumstances, the required switchof resources to the balance of payments.
