The Prime Minister of Britain was in the   Chair.2. This was the largest meeting of CommonwealthHeads of Government and one of the biggest consultativegatherings of Heads of Government from all parts of theworld since the signature of the United Nations Charter.Heads of Government warmly greeted the President of Botswana,and the Prime Ministers of Barbados, Lesotho, Mauritius andSwaziland, whose countries had become new members of theCommonwealth since the previous meeting,

3. The Republic, of Nauru hac become the Commonwealth1 first &quot;special member&quot;, with the right to participate in allfunctional meetings And activities, and to be eligible for commonwealth technical assistance.   The Associated Statesof the West Indies, having reached a full measure of self-government although not fully independent, also take partin Commonwealth meetings and activities in fields within their constitutional competence.    Heads of Governmentwelcomed these arrangements which had been agreed since their last Meeting to enable very small States toparticipate in the work of the Commonwealth.INTERNATIONAL onal Affairsk. Heads of Government were aware that they weremeeting at a time of some misgivings about the effectiveness of international organisations and associations1.    They woreunanimous that effective international co-operation was morethan ever important.    Any weaknesses and failures of inter-national machinery were a reason to improve that machinery,not to despair of it.    They expressed their continued support for the purposes and principles of the United nations charter and their wish to contribute to efforts to strengthen the institutions and work of the United Nations, particularlyits role in maintaining and promoting peaos.5, They noted with pleasure the part played by commonwealth countries in the development uf regionalco-operation.    At the same time they recognized that exchanges of view and consultation within a wider association, such asthe Commonwealth offered one morns by which its members couldform a better understanding of one another&apos;s fjroblems andattitudes and of their .,rowing interdependence.6. With these considerations in mind, they reviewedsome-of the major issues and trends in the world politicalsituation.

7, They were in agreement that the principles ofnon-interforence by one St?&apos;&apos;to in the internal affairs of another.-jul    of - scrupulous respect for the sovereignty, theterritori&quot;l integrity and political independence of all states are the very cornerstone of the structure of world peace.3. Heads of Government -Iso felt that events in czechoslovakia in violation of these principles and of theUnited Nations Charter tended to undermine respect for theterritorial integrity and sovereign independence of allSt:&quot;ten, particularly small States.9. They considered that events in the Middle East in violation of the United Nations Charter and the &quot;security council resolutions emphasised the need for the establishmentof a durable peace in the area as a matter of urgency.This could be achieved in. accordance with, the Security Council&apos;resolution of 22 November, 1967.    The Heads of Governmentexpressed support for tho efforts of Dr. Jarring, the special representative of the UN Socretary-Gonoral,,and urged allconcerned to give him their fullest co-operation.    They wereencouraged to note the round of consultation now in progressr.mong tifas four permanent members of the Security Council andurged these Governments to persist in their efforts tohelp bring about a settlement in accordance with the november 22 Resolution of the Security Council.    While the role of major Powers was important, other countries especially those who have an interest in the re-opening of the suez canal, including Commonwealth members could contribute towards a settlement.- 3 -

Recalling the views expressed at their meetings in 1965 and 1966, Heads of Government welcomed the cemmence--&quot; -   lt 0f the Vietnam talks in Paris and expressed the hopetKt they would lead to discussions aimed at securing a just,lasting and genuine peace.y\t It was the view of the majority of Heads of Govern-mcnt that the Peopled Republic of China has a right and a duty to participate in full in all the world1a efforts towards peace.K:si Heads of Government expressed the hope that the People-&apos;sfjjRepublic of China would be able to take its rightful place inthe international community, although some of them also/stressed that this should bo achieved without prejudicing thericdits of the people.of Taiwan to an independent existence ifi/money chose.   However, certain Prime Ministers of countriesv/im-ae Governments recognised- the Government of the Republic ofChina (Taiwan) reiterated their support of that Government1sri/it to membership of the United Nations.12. Hoods of Government, recalling the ending ofIndonesia&apos;s policy of confrontation against Malaysia and singapore in 1966, wore encouraged by developments towardsStability in Indonesia since their last meeting in 1966 and[ felt that this would contribute to tho general stability andeconomic development of the region.

13, The Meeting observed that difficulties betweenMalaysia and the Philippines arising out of the Philippineclaim to Sabah had hampered the progress of regional co-operation in South East Asia.    It expressed the hope thatthese difficulties could be resolved by peaceful means, up-holding the right of self-determination which has been exercised by the people of Sabah,The Meeting also noted with concern and sympathythe difficulties which Guyana was experiencing in connectionwith Venezuela&apos;s claim to more than one-half of Guyana&apos;sterritory.   Acknowledging that threats to the territorial integrity of the State make inevitable the diversion of re-sources and energies from the constructive tasks of develop-ment, many members shared the view advanced by Guyana&apos;s PrimeMinister that there was an urgent need for an internationaleffort to secure the territorial integrity of every state -and especially, of the small developing countries of the world.15. The Meeting expressed the hope that the recentachievement of independence by many small states would bring home the international community the need to introduce special and effective measures to guarantee their territorial, inf. .,:-it:*.2L6, The Meeting considered that major barriers to pro-gress on negotiated agreements in critical areas and fieldswould be overcome by significant progress in achievingdetente and in co-operation between the major Powers.    Itwas therefore considered essential that efforts to reducetension and extend areas of peace and co-operation shouldcontinue.&apos;XfJt Heads . of. Government recalled that at their meeting in September, 1966, they had expressed the view that eventswere throwing into ever sharper relief the need for firm and far rea-ching agreements on disarmament.    They considered- 5 -

that tho need for such agreements was oven more urgent now than it was then, and hoped that the Eighteen Nation Disarma-ment Committee would resume consideration of this matter.18. The Meeting considered that the Eighteen RationDisarmament Committee should, as a matter of priority, explorepossibilities of reaching agreement on effective measures designed, to bring about a cessation of the nuclear arms raceat a very early date.    With this end. in view a universallybinding comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty was an urgent necessity.    In this connection, the British proposal to the eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee for a phased approach to a comprehensive tost ban treaty was deserving of further study.    They considered that the Eighteen Nation disarmament committee should also seek to achieve a cut-off of the produc-tion of fissionable&apos;material for weapons pur-poses.    Both these measures could be of great significance in halting the nucleararms race.   Mention was also made of the possibility that the eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee might undertake the study of various proposals made for a convention on the pro-hibition of the use of nuclear weapons.    The Meeting gaveparticularly st.ro.ng support to one of the recommendations made by the Conference of Non-Nucloar Weapon States (whosedistinguished President was present at this Meeting) and repeated by the General Assembly of the United Nations to theGovernments of the United States and the Soviet Union, thatthey should at an early elate begin their bilateral discuss-ions on the limitation of offensive strategic nuclear weapondelivery systems and systems of defence against ballisticmissiles.19. The Meeting stressed again that effective disarma-mont must cover non-nuclear as well as nuclear weapons.   Inthis connection the Heads of Government drew attention to the urgent&apos;need for action, to deal with the throat presented bychemical and biological weapons andwelcomed, the British proposal- 6 -SECRET

-i;0 the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee for a new conven-tion prohibiting ,micro-biological methods of warfare.   Theylooked forward to the report on chemical and biological weapons which the Secretary-General of the United Nations had been requested to prepare; they hoped that this would make a valuable contribution to the consideration of arms control measures todeal with, these weapons. ;20. Heads of Government recalled that at their meeting in September 1966 they had stressed that while there was stilltime it was imperative to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.A atop towards this goal was taken with the opening for signa-ture of the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of nuclear weapons.In so far as the Treaty achieved this objective, most Heads ofGovernment welcomed it.   However, some Heads of Government hadreservations on certain aspects of the Treaty including itseffectiveness and the reliability of security guarantees fornon-nuclear weapon states.    It was recognised that the Non-Proliferation Treaty would not fulfil all the hopes set upon it unless progress could also be made by the nuclear powerstowards effective measures of nuclear disarmament.   It wasalso recognised that member states which were subjected toattack or threat of attack by either nuclear or non-nuclear weapons had the right to the protection afforded to them underthe United Nations Charter.. 21. The Meeting heard a statement by Britain on theprogress of the remaining British dependencies towards self-government or independence.   Twenty such dependencies were nowleft - many of them very small islands - and there had beenrecent constitutional advances in sixteen.    It noted that in theI case of British Honduras, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar,theIBritish Government stood ready to hold discussions with interest-pel neighbouring countries, consonant with its basic principle,I which was enshrined in the United Nations Charter, that theI interests and- wishes of the inhabitants must be paramount.- 7 -

22N The Prime Minister of Malta drew the attention ofother Heads of Government to the situation arising from therapidly increasing technological.capacity to exploit the immense resources cf the sea bed, which constitutes nearlythroe-quarters of the surface of the earth.    They consideredthat the area of the sea bed and.ocean floor beyond the limits of present national jurisdiction, for which a precise defini-tion should be sought, should bo accorded a special legal status as part of the common heritage of mankind, and as such shouldbe reserved for peaceful purposes and for the orderly explora-tion and exploitation of its great resources, by such, appro-priate international machinery as is agreed acting for thecommon benefit of all States, irrespective of their geogra-phical location, and taking into special consideration theinterests and needs of the developing countries.23.. The Meeting welcomed the initiative cf the Govern-mcnt of Malta which led to the appointment in December 1968by the General Assembly of the United Nations of a Committeeon the peaceful uses of the sea bed and the ocean floorbeyond the limits of national jurisdiction, and declaredits support for the committee^ work.rhodesia the Meeting had a full discussion on the problemof Rhodesia.    Heads of Government agreed that there were several reasons why Rhodesia was so important in Common-wealth consultations.    Tho legal authority and the re spoil-sibility for the terms on which it would be brought to indo-pendence rested with Britain, a Commonwealth member.    the attempts of Commonwealth countries adjacent to Rhodesia toestablish non-racial societies and prosperous economieswere jeopardised by tho growing threat of race conflictwithin the region.   But the overriding reason was thatproblems such as this involved principles of racialjustice and equality and the right of all peoples to self

determination, which are embodied in the United nations charter and in the Declaration of Human Eights.   Thesematters went to the heart of the Commonwealth relationshipand were therefore of deep concern to all Commonwealthmembers,25. The Meeting recalled that, for these reasons,Rhodesia had been an important subject of discussion atrecent Commonwealth conferences, and Heads of Governmentreiterated the principles and objectives affirmed at their&apos;four previous meetings.26. They also reviewed developments since their -last meeting, noting that the Illegal regime had continued acts of political repression against tho African majority popula-tion, and that there were increasing trends towards an apart-held system in Rhodesia.27. The constitutional proposals drawn up on board MSFearless were discussed.   Most Heads of Government emphasized,their view that those proposals were unacceptable as the cons-titution of an independent Rhodesia, and should therefore be withdrawn.   They considered that to transfer sovereignty to aracial minority as tho result of an agreement reached withthat minority would settle nothing, if the settlement was notfreely accepted by the people of Rhodesia as a whole includingthe four million African. Rhodosians and seen by tho inter-national community, especially the independent African eountrieto be so accepted.    Otherwise internal strife, and outsidesupport for guerilla activities would increase, with, the inevitable risk of increasing instability and eventual rasewar.   They stated that historical experience suggested that once independence was achieved, a minority in power couldlot be prevented from changing a constitution in whatever way they might wish.    The only effective guarantees of politicaland civil rights lay in vesting those rights in the people asa whole.

23. Tho Meeting recalled the pledge given by the british prime Minister, following discussion at the commonwealth conference in September, 1966, that independence would not begranted before ma 3 arity rule was achieved (NOME).    the british Prime Minister stated that although tho Fearlessprppos&apos;&apos;&apos;.ls remained on the table, there had been no change inthe British Government1s policy on NIBMR.    The Mootingwelcomed the statement that the British Government&apos;s policy on NIBMR remained unchanged., but most Heads of Governmentreiterated their position that the Fearless Proposals shouldbe withdrawn.29. Some He--as of Government reiterated their callon the British Government to use force to.quell the rebellionin Rhodesia.    The British Prime Minister explained thereasons why the British Government regarded the use of force03 wrong and impracticable.30. The British Prime Minister said that he had takencareful note of the view expressed by most other Heads ofGovernment that the Fearless Proposals ought to be withdrawn.But ho could not himself accept this view since ho considered&apos;that it would be right, if it proved possible, to give thepeople of Rhodesia as a whole an opportunity to decide for themselves whether or 11 ot they wished for a settlement which would be fully consistent with the Six Principles laiddown by successive British Governments.    Any such settlement would need to be clearly shown to be the wish of the Rhod.es ian people as a whole.    If that took place, he would consult his Common-wealth colleagues about the rUBMft commitments.    He emphasised,however, that a settlement based on the Six Principles would notbe possible if it were shown that there could be no genuinetest of its acceptabi ity in present circumstances in Rhodesia,-)1 * It was agreed that any settlement must depend forits validity upon the democratically ascertained wishes ofthe.people of Rhodesia as a whole.    The process for ascer-taioing their views was the British Government&apos;s responsibility,but the test of the acceptability of any proposed settlement would need to be made in a manner which would carry convictionin the Commonwealth and in the international community

generally? so &quot;that its results would he accepted as trulyreflecting the wishes of the people of Rhodesia.   Many Headsof Government urged that this could only he carried outthrough the normal democratic process of election or refer-endum, and doubted whether adequate safeguards for freepolitical expression and verification of the resudats couldbe provided so long as the rebel government remained in power.   The Meeting noted the British. Prime Minister&apos;s state-ment that it would be open to the proposed Royal Commissionto say that in the circumstances prevailing in Rhodesia, nogenuine assessment was possible of the acceptability of theproposed settlement to the people of Rhodesia as a whole andthat, further, if the Royal Commission felt themselves unableto adjudicate on the acceptability or otherwise of theproposals to the people of Rhodesia as a whole, they wouldbe free to recommend any alternative method, including a referendum, which in their view would adequately test Rhodesianopinion.32. The Meeting had before it a review of the working ofeconomic sanctions prepared for it by the CommonwealthSanctions Committee.    The Meeting agreed that the comprehensivemandatory sanctions were having some effect.    It was important to strengthen the enforcement of these and other pressures onthe illegal regime, and to intensify them wherever possible,in order to bring about an acceptable political settlement.Heads of Government therefore affirmed their support for the supervisory Committee of the United Nations Security Counciland for the Commonwealth Sanctions Committee, which theyrequested to continue to keep the situation under review.53. Notwithstanding some differences of opinion on method,Heads of Government remained unanimous on -the ultimate objec-tives to be sought in Rhodesia.   They were more than everresolved that, whatever the time needed to reverse it, the seizure of power by a small racial minority could be neither- 11

recognised :oor tolerated.    Concerted international action was being steadily built up particularly through the United(Nations end the Commonwealth, and Heads of Government pledgedtheir continuing support for all efforts to strengthen and extend this and. to continue to assist Ehodosian Africans in preparing thensevies to take their rightful place in theGovernment and administration of their country.   Tho special problems encountered by Botswana and Zambia arising from the rhodesia crisis were recognised.&apos;3k. The British Prime Minister undertook to continueto consult Commonwealth members on the issue of Rhodesia,Southprn. Africa35. The Meeting considered other problems in southern Africa.    It reaffirmed the condemnation expressed at previous meetings of the policy of apartheid of the SouthAfrican Government - a policy totally abhorrent to world opinion.   It expressed serious concern at the continuedrefusal of South Africa to accept its international obliga-tions in respect of the territory of South. -Vest Africa.,36. Tho meeting deeply regretted that Portugal continuedto deny the right of eelf-dctorminatien to the inhabitants of her colonial territories in Africa and called on Portugalto concede that right without delay.    Some Beads ofGovernment felt that the situation in Southern. Africa ifcontinued, would endanger peace and security and pointed tothe throats which they felt were posed to their countries bythe armed forces of South Africa and Portugal,- 12 -

- 12A-S        /--------------36A. Informal discussions took place outside themeeting between some Commonwealth countries on certainproblems of migration between those Commonwealth countries.The Secretary-General was requested by the countriesengaged in these discussions to examine in consultation withrepresentatives of those countries general principlesrelating to short and l6ng term movement of people between their countries and to consider tho possibility ofexploring ways and means of studying this subject on a,continuing basis with a view to providing relevant information to those Governments.36B. The Prime Ministers re-affirmed&apos;the declaration made in communiques.of 1964 and 1965 that for all commonwealth Governments it should be an objective ofpolicy to build in each country a structure of societywhich offers equal opportunity and non-discrimination forall its people, irrespective of race, colour or creed.The Commonwealth should be able to exercise constructiveleadership in the application of democratic principles ina manner which will enable the people of each country ofdifferent racial and cultural groups to exist and developas free and equa.1 citizens.

Be onord c Affadrs37. Heads of Government held a goner. .1 discussion onthe world economic situation and broadly reviewed recent developments and trend;:.   They agreed that the representativecharacter of the Couaonwcalth and its tradition of informed and sympathetic interest in the prcblcros of development makeit a nest valuable fcruoi for constructive discussion and a useful instrument for cc-opcrativ... endeavour.36. They noted that early last year, in Pew Dchli duringUNOTAD II, Commonwealth hliiist^rs h..d exchanged views on someof the problems affecting trade and development of member countries, and that 1:0re recently, Commonwealth Finance Ilinistcat their animal no - ting held in Lciid&apos;--n had a full discussionof the world economic situation with special reference to international monetary problems, development and aid.39. Heads cf percent..rara.nt were concerned that the gap between tho rich and poor was widening, but were encouraged bygrowing recognition of tho increasing inter-dcpendencc ofnations.   Greater co-opcr- live acti-r. wea vital to ensureeconomic progress and prosperity on which stability and peaceso largely depend.   Postponement of adequate and united effortswould lead to greater political and oconcr.de problems.40, The;&quot; took not:, of the fact that developing countries of the Commonwealth were making efforts to help the: is elves.They wore stcCily laying tho ground-v.ork of future self-sustained growth by paying increasing ....ttonticn tc agriculture,education, population control and c-.d:. du i strativo and instil-tutional reforms.    It was therefore hoped that if they wereassisted by appropriate interactional measures, they wouldbe in a positi:n duriog the decade of the 1970&apos;s to achieve  -higher rates of economic growth.- 13 -

1,1.1, HeaCo of Government rioted the growing movement towards greater regional co-operation among the developing countries of the Commonwealth,     This represented a valuableform ol self-help on the part; of the developing countries.L[2* Heads of Government recognised thai; tho results ofUNCTAi) 11 had been very disappointing to the developing countries.     While there had been, agreement on the need toevolve an international policy for development and a globalstrategy to implement it, little progress had been mode in achieving this.     On the other hand UNCTAD II had mapped out certain promising lines of approach.k&apos;5* They stressed tho need to give practical effect tothe unanimous agreements reached in principle at UNCTAJ) II,They expressed the hope that it would soon be possible to conclude successfully the negotiations on a scheme ofgeneralized preferences which would be of benefit to alldeveloping countries end which would provide compensationfor the less developed countries whose export trade mightbe adversely affected by the introduction of such a scheme.They agreed that close and continuous consultations amongCommonwealth countries would bo necessary during the con-side ration of the -scheme of generalised p:re fere nee .     Theyemphasised the importance of continuing consultation at theTrade and Development Board and other organs of UNOTAD and asked -tho Secretary-General to maintain close contacts withthese and other international agencies in order to keep these developments under review.1A --SECRET

kk. Heads of Government agreed that the -first Develop-ment Decade had fallen short of expectations in achievingpractical results.    They hoped, however, that the experience gained would help in the identification of areas of development and the strategy to which urgent attention needs to be directedwith a view to achieving greater concrete results during thesecond Development Decade.V5. it was recognised that the terms of trade had moved against some countries of the Commonwealth who depend to a great extent on the export of primary products.   Moreorderly and satisfactory markets for primary products werecrucial for Commonwealth countries.   Recognising the present unsatisfactory state of major export markets for many primary products, Heads of Government stressed the need for further efforts by Commonwealth countries in international forums tosecure improved conditions for international commodity trade,including better access to markets in both developed and developing countries and. equitable and stable prices for primary products.    They expressed, gratification at the exten-sion of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement which has always been of special interest to the Commonwealth producer countries.They welcomed the recent conclusion of the InternationalSugar Agreement and expressed the hope that those governments which had not already signed it would do so. They furtherhoped that other commodities of special economic importanceto Commonwealth countries would be covered similarly bysuitable international arrangements which arrangements wouldbe pursued and be supported by Commonwealth countries.

45, In this connection, they noted recent developments in the negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement on Cocoa,   They urged all parties to the negotiations to intensify their efforts so as   to roach a speedy agreement,and on the progress of which the Secretary-General should keep members fully informed.47. Heads of Government welcomed the liberalization oftrade in respect of manufactured products consequent on theconclusion of the Kennedy Round of negotiations, and hopedthat this process of trade liberalization would he carried further in respect of all products.    They regretted however that these negotiations had produced no significant benefits for most developing countries^   They expressed the hope thatcontinuing efforts would be made under the auspices of GATTand UNCTAD to enable developing countries to secure improved;access for their products to international markets with aview to increasing their foreign exchange earnings, while making every effort to increase trade among themselves,,16

48.     i&apos;hcy stressed tho dangers of excessive protoctiohienin c number of Foreign industrialized countries foragricultural produces of export interest to commonwealth countries.l+y.     i/hile it was recognised, that Commonwealth trade mustbe seen in the larger context of global &quot;trade of which itwee a vital part, they agreed there was continuing scope forthe expansion of Commonwealth trade and for this purposethere was need to strengthen the wcll-esiaaelished linksamongst Commonwealth members.50.     Ho-.dc of Government took note of the Socrotary-General&apos;3 report that, in pursuance of an earlier decision,the Secretariat had begun a study on the feasibility of commonwealth co-operation to assist in trade promotion,they  looked forward to the completion of this study.51.     The Meeting took note of the special difficulties ofLesotho and other African landlocked Commonwealth countries.These countries ,s expressed the hope that all concerned would,find it poceiblo to accede to or ratify ahe international convention on tho transit tr.ade of landlocked countries.Heads of Government hoped that all countries&apos; concerned wouldmake every effort to provide adequate transit facilities tothe trade of such landlocked countries.- 17 -SECRET

52. Heads of Government reiterated the importance of continuing close consultation by the British Government with commonwealth Governments in regard to developments of interestto them concerning the British application for entry into theEuropean Economic Community,53. In discussing the international monetary situation,Heads of Government stressed the importance of restoringstability in world payments - and of adapting the world mone-tary system to meet evolving needs.   They stressed the needfor providing adequate international liquidity for implement-ing and activating as early as practicable the scheme forSpecial Drawing Rights through the International Monetary fund to supplement reserve assets.   They regretted that it had notbeen possible as yet to get the necessary broad international agreement on a special link between international action toincrease liquidity and the needs of developing countries.They hoped that further consideration would be given to establishing such a link.54. They expressed the hope that more liberal tradepolicies would follow from improvements in the internationalpayments system.55. Some Heads of Government felt that commonwealth countries should call for a world monetary conference, opento all members of the I.M.P., to reappraise the World Mone-tary System since Bretton Woods and to make recommendations for its improvement, and. that there should be a commonwealth meeting prior to such a Conference,   Others while sympathisingwith these objectives felt that it would be inappropriateto attempt to achieve them through such a conference and thatit would be better to continue official discussions throughexisting channels.56. The meeting discussed international^assistance for economic development, and noted with concern that the nettransfer of resources from industrialized to developing- 18 -

countries had stagnated at a level which was inadequate tofacilitate an acceptable rate of economic development in thodeveloping countries.    A critical situation was emerging fora number of countries because of the burden of debt servicing.Heads of Government expressed the hope that countries whichhad not already done so would bo in a position to signify their acceptance of an early date for complying with the IMCTADresolution on the target of 1$ of gross national, product at market prices.    They stressed the urgency of the replenishmentof the resources cf the International Development association and expressed the hope that all countries concerned would follow the lead already given by some in effecting suchre pie ni s hme nt.57. Heads of Government noted with approvalvtho recenttendency on the part of some Commonwealth countries to softenthe terms of -their loans which they were extending to theless developed Commonwealth countries. They considered that commonwealth donor countries should take the lead in seekingfurther improvements in the terms of international aidgenerally, and hoped that donor Governments would viewsympathetically in appropriate cases the granting of moref1exiblo t erms.58. Heads of Government expressed the hope that theconsideration of the scheme of supplementary financing would lead to e^rly results of benefit to developing countries.59* They welcomed tho appointment of an international commission by the world Bank to review the total aid.experience of the past two decades and to make recommendationafor future aid programmes, and were particularly gratifiedthat a former colleague, The Feb. .Hon. 1 ester B. Pearson, waspresiding over the Commission&apos;s work.- 19 -

Commonwealth Co-operation

60. Heads of Government reviewed the extensive range of co-operation which exists among Commonwealth countries in such areas as technical assistance, education, science, medicine, law and many other functional fields. Such co-operation is facilitated and rendered more fruitful by the advantages the Commonwealth association offers - a common working language, similar traditions in government, administration, educational methods, and the organisation of the professions. With the increasing membership of the Commonwealth and the potentially wider areas of co-operation, they recognised the importance of seeking ways and means achieving more effective co-operation among members in all fields.

61. Much was being done through bilateral arrangements between member countries. The Meeting noted that intra-Commonwealth official bilateral assistance, which accounts on the average for about 85% of the total of such assistance provided by Commonwealth members in all developing countries, had increased in 1967 and 1968, and hoped that this would continue to grow.

62. They also reaffirmed the value of programmes of specifically Commonwealth effort in certain fields. An example would be increasing application of the principle of third-party financing, as a useful mechanism for bringing qualified experts and important tasks together quickly and efficiently. Third-party financing, by which experts from one country can be financed wholly or in part by another, can significantly enlarge the pool of expertise available for technical assistance arrangements by drawing on skills available in developing countries. These skills, moreover, are often of particular



relevance to the needs of other developing countries.   TheMooting agreed that early consideration should be givento the extension of the principle of third-party financing to education, training and consultations.   This would allowstudents to be trained in surroundings and under conditionsmore appropriate to their future employment, and in this wayease the problem of the brain-drain.65. Tho Meeting noted several examples of mutual assistance which had already grown up among developingmembers of the Commonwealth.    The Commonwe. 1th Programme of technical Co-operation, established within the Secretariat theprevious year and on which the Secretary-General submitted rprogress reaort, was a further stop in building on thespecial advantages which the Commonwealth affords.   A number 0&quot;hem underlined tho p-rticu.&quot;1 ar usefulness of the programme to tho smaller members.    They noted that a review of this programme is to be carried out later this year,6k. Tho Mooting also considered a number of proposalsfor strengthening Commonwealth co-operation in specificfields.65. They agreed that the nature and work of the Commonwealth should be more widely Jmown in member countries.They approved in principle the proposal by Guyana, for a commonwealth Information Programme, and authorised theSecretary-General, to appoint an Information Officer and toundertake in consultation with Governments a study of the implications of a programme a s proposed.66. heads of Government also welcomed in principle the proposals submitted by Pakistan on co-operation in the fields of mass communication and education and asked theGecrct&apos;-.ry-General to undertake studios in detail and inconsultation -with Commonwealth governments.

67. The Meeting had before it three proposals byBritain for increased Commonwealth co-operation.    Tho first was tor extension of co-operation in the legal field,    Thisproposal involved the establishment of a small Legal section in the Secretariat, which was agreed:; and. a conference onlegal education, to which further consideration should be given .68. The (second British proposal wag for regional centres for the teaching of English and the teaching of science,which was welcomed in principle, and which it wag agreed shouldbe further considered by the Commonwealth Education liason committee and the Secretariat.69. Tho third British proposal was for a series ofstudios on the problems of youth.   l&apos;he Meeting asked theSecretary-General to examine its feasibility taking intoaccount the work in this field undertaken by other1 n t e rn a tic n al o r ga n i sr. t i cms.- 22

70. In addition the Meeting discussed proposals for a commonwealth &quot;Book Development Programme designed to assistdeveloping Commonwealth countries to obtain hooks and journalsfor educational and research purposes.
