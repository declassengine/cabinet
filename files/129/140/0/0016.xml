C(69) 16 COPY NO.        g3rd February, 1969CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEVf 1969Memorandum by the Minister without portfolio the Agricultural Policy Committee has not been able to reach agreement on the limits to which the Agricultural Ministers should go inthe negotiations of this yearTs Farm Price Review,    I accordingly set out below the divergent views of the Committee and my own recommendations.We considered first the total size of the Award and then the possiblebreakdown between cattle, wheat and barley, which - on any basis proposed -together account for much the larger part of the total Award,background,      The Steering Committee on Economic Policy considered theproduction objectives for agriculture to 1972-73 at a meeting last november.    They then approved the programme for individual commoditiesshown in AnneK II to this memorandum, on the understanding that theprogramme would be flexible and subject as necessary to modificationfrom year to year in the light of changing circumstaxices (the Governmentshould not be publicly committed to specific targets); and that theChancellor was not committed to accept the public expenditure consequences,which could not then be foreseen, of seeking to attain the objectives.The Minister of Agriculture announced the Governments policy objectivesto 1972-73 to the House of Commons on 12th November, and a copy of his statement is at Annex III.    The detailed proposals by the agricultural departments for changes at the forthcoming Farm Review are shown in annex I. ,Total size of the Award3.      It will be seen that the Agricultural Departments recommend a totalaward of  -50 million.    This exceeds the estimated increase of  38 millionj       m farmerst-costs and, together with the assumed annual gain of  30 million       as a result of improved productivity, would represent an addition *jo netI      farm incomes in the coming year of  42 million (or about 8 per cent).**1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)

It has to be remembered that, although net farm income is struck afterprovision for depreciation, it must nevertheless provide a substantial contribution to new investment as well as a return on past investment and payment of the farmer for his work.    So an increase in net farm income is not directly comparable with a wage or salary increase.4.       The Treasury have indicated that they would be prepared to accept an award of about  20 million.    The Department of Economic Affairsoriginally proposed  23 million, but raised this to  24,5 million in thelight of discussion in the Committee - particularly the discussion ofcereals production.    These various, proposals compare as follows withthe outcome of the last two Reviews.	1967	-   1968	1969		 m	 m		 mCost increases	15. 5	68. 5		38Productivity gains	30. 0	30.0	( try.	30 DEA Agr.Award finally agreed	25.25	52.5	proposed (	24.5    50Increase in net farm income	39.75	14. 0	12	16.5   425.      The discussion in the Agricultural Policy Committee about the totalsize of the award may be summarised as follows.(l)    The peloctive expansion programme,   The Agricultural ministers have argued that the announcement of Government policy on 12th Novemberhas aroused justifiable expectations that the Government will ensure at this first and crucial Review since the announcement that adequate incentiveswill be given to expand production on the scale required.    The agricultural departments had reached the conclusion, after the most thorough analysis,that an award totalling  50 million and distributed as they proposed was essential to provide adequate incentives.    Serious dissatisfaction on thepart of the farmers with this yearTs award would imperil the wholeprogramme to 1972-73, for which planning and investment must start very shortly, and put at risk the very substantial import savings on which weare counting.    When, as in 1965 and 1966, the farmers had to absorb asubstantial part of their cost increases, production stagnated.    An awardless than  50 million - that is full recoupment for increased costs, plusan additional incentive - would lead the agricultural industry to theconclusion that the Government was not serious about the 1972-73 programme.-2-

The Economic Ministers, on the other hand, have argued that,ae the Minister of Agriculture made clear in his statement in November,the Government have simply decided to roll forward from 1970-71 to1972-73 the selective expansion programme which was announced in1965.    No extraordinary new incentives should therefore be required on this count, but rather a continuation on previous lines.    Indeed,when the Government agreed to the new programme to 1972-73, itwas on the understanding that no extraordinary incentives would berequired.    An award as in 1968, which left the farmers to absorb halfthe increase in their costs in 1969-70, should be fully adequate.    Therewas no worthwhile evidence on the relationship between particular levels of incentive and production, and an over-generous settlement might wellmaintain inefficient farmers in production and so prevent the rationaliseation required to increase efficiency and hence production.(2)    1968-69 was a bad year.    The Agricultural Ministers have pointed out that owing to abnormally bad weather during the harvest andto the aftermath of the foot and mouth epidemic, net farm income was expected to decline by  39 million as compared with 1967-68 and therewould be a corresponding decline in output.    In consequence, farmers would not have the necessary funds to invest during 1969-70 On thescale required by the expansion programme, nor would they be able to borrow these funds from the banks unless this yearrs award indicated that a profitable year was in prospect.The Economic Ministers have argued that the farmers and the banks upon which they rely for   credit are accustomed to fluctuationscaused by the weather and that there was no need to give specialcompensation for the poor results in 1968-69 in order to ensure that adequate credit would be available in the coming year.    Would the farmers accept a special reduction in the award after an exceptionallyfavourable year ?(3)    Public Expenditure.    The Agricultural Ministers have pointedout that an award of  5 0 million would still leave the estimated cost tothe Exchequer of agricultural support for 1969-70 within the existingPESC figure of  321 million.    Moreover, in recent years the actual cost of agricultural support has been significantly less than theestimates.The Economic Ministers have emphasised the government decision, announced a year ago, that public expenditure would be contained in 1969-70 within 1 per cent of the total for 1968-69.    Thiswould be the smallest increase for very many years and would beachieved by the most severe restrictions on nearly all public expendi-ture programmes.    In these circumstances, it would be very difficultto justify an award on a more generous basis than in 1968, when the farmers ^had been left with half their productivity gain.An award in the current Review on the same basis would amountto   23 million.-3-

CQNFJOENTSALCommodities6.      Of the total award of  50 million proposed by the agricultural ministers,  41.4 million is for cattle and cereals.    There is generalagreement in the Agricultural Policy Committee that the main emphasisat this Review should be on cattle and cereals, but not of course on the sums proposed.7.     Cattle.    The Agricultural Ministers have pointed out that,owing to the foot and mouth epidemic and the slow rate of expansion ofthe beef herd, the total home production of beef in 1968-69 has fallen,and in. 1969-70 is expected to regain the 1967-68 level.    The target for1972-73 is 85, 000 tons or 9 per cent above the level in 1967-68, so thatan increase of 3 per cent per annum is required between 1969-70 and1972-73,    There is a three year production cycle for beef, so that output over these years will be determined to a large extent bydecisions taken now.    The Agricultural Ministepe aofialdsr that asubstantial increase in the guaranteed price of fat cattle is required\xi order to achieve the target for 1972-73 and have proposed anincrease of 15s. a cwt.    In addition, they propose that the subsidies for hill and beef cows should be increased by a total of  2 million.8.      The Economic Ministers have pointed out that the productionobjectives agreed by the Government for 1972-73 (subject to theconditions which have alreaty been noted) were based on a report(AP(68) 18) where it was agreed that the proposed expansion could beachieved while continuing as in the past to reduce support costs in real terms; i, e. on the basis that the farmers should be expected tocontinue to absorb some of the increase in their costs out of theirproductivity gain of  30 million a year.    The estimated increase infat cattle costs for the current Review is put at 6s. Tjd per cwt, andthey suggest that an increase of the order of 7e.6s a cwt ai the guaranteed price, which would more than meet the increase in costs and thusleave the farmers with more than the whole of their productivity gainon cattle, is fully adequate to meet the needs of the situation.    K theincrease were no larger than this the Economic Ministers would beprepared to agree to a long-term assurance to the farmers that the guaranteed price would not be reduced between now and 1972-73.9.     Q$:Z-2:lfL*    &quot;^ke Agricultural Ministers have argued that theincrease of 2.75 million tons of cereals - and the associated import saving of about  70 million - foreseen in the production objectiveswill only be achieved by substantially increasing the acreage of arable land and by introducing more break crops into the production cycle toreduce the incidence of diseases which have been reducing yields.These measures will require substantial additional investment.Moreover as a result of the tight squeeze on cereals in recent farm price Reviews the financial return from cereal production has been falling..   They therefore propose an increase of Is, 9d in the guaranteed prices of wheat and barley and of 6d, for oats, whichwould add  20. 4 million to the value of the cereal guarantees.-4-

10.     The Economic Ministers have argueds as in the case of beef,that the farmers should normally be expected to absorb a substantial part of their cost increases.    These amount to 9, 3d and     Od per cwtfor wheat and barley respectively.     An offer this year slightly inexcess of the cost increases would in their view provide a substantialincentive and be fully adequate to the needs of the situation,    they recommend that the value of the guarantees for cereals should beincreased by   10 million to   10. 6 million, as compared with theproposed by the Agricultural Ministers of  20,4 million,^ILELB^J^J-^jAgx^^tural J^o^kers^JBajr.11,     The National Board for Prices and Incomes issued theirReport on the pay of agricultural workers (NBPI Report No, 101)as the Committee were concluding their preliminary considerationof the Farm Price Review, so that they did not have an opportunityof giving the Report their considered judgment.    I should, however,draw to the attention of my colleagues that the NBPI in their reporthave made two points which appear to be directly relevant.    extracts from the! Board&apos;s Report are in Annex IV.12.     I have considered very carefully the divergent views whichhave been expressed in the Committee.    I have also taken note of theReport by the NBPI which related to the wage increase of 17s. a weekwhich has just been approved; will cost about   18 million in a full year; and has been taken into account in the cost increases on whichwe have been working.    I have reached the conclusion that, despite the extremely serious public expenditure position in 1969-70, itwould be right to settle with the farmers on a elightly more generousbasis than last year, taking account of the Governments policystatement last November and of the setbacks to agriculture duringthis season.    I therefore recommend that the negotiating limit shouldbe eet for the forthcoming Review at a total award of  26 million.This would leave the farmers with  18 million - 60 per cent - of theirexpected productivity gain in 1969-70, as compared with  14 million -just under 5 0 per cent - last year.    Moreover, it should be possilbe within this total to provide nearly full recoupment cf the cost increases for beef, wheat and barley - the commodities on which, by generalconsent, we should now concentrate - while making some smallreductions to the other proposals by the Agricultural Ministers.If my colleagues agree that the award should be limited to  26 million the Agricultural Policy Committee will decide on its distributionbetween the various commodities involved.G.

ANNEX IIIAGRICULTURAL OBJECTIVES:  STATEMENT BYTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE IN TUB HOUSE OP commons on 12 NOVEMBER,,   1 968With your permission, Mr.  Speaker? and that of theHouse, I should like to mpucp a statement about agriculturalobjectives.The Government have carefully reviewed the contributionmade by agriculture to tho national economy over past years.This review has amply vindicated the industry as one whichhas made efficient use of the resources devoted to it.Productivity has continued to rise.    Output has increased.There has been a valuable saving in imports.    All this hasbeen achieved without, a significant increase in supportcosts and consistently with our international obligations.The industry has given good value for money to the british people, both as consumers and as taxpayers.Against this &quot;background the Government have decidedthat the selective expansion of agriculture should continue,provided that this is based upon the maintenance of therate of increase in the industry&apos;s productivity.    Theprogramme announced in 1965 took us forward to 1970-71.    now we are to project it to 1972-73.    We shall, of course,continue to take stock from year to year as we go along.We have had a valuable report from the economic development Committee for Agriculture on the import savingpossibilities of agriculture to 1972-73.    The Government have-examined the Committee&apos;s technical assessment.    In addition,we have had to take into account tho likely consequences on&quot;the use of resources and support costs and oub internationalobiigatThe Economic Development Committee,  in looking atcereals production for the next four years, believed that it

would be possible to overcome the husbandry and diseaseproblems to achieve increasing average yields.    We considerthat, taking into account the quality of the additional land which would have to be brought into production,  the objectiveset by the Economic Development Committee may prove to havebeen a little optimistic.    This year&apos;s difficult harvestunderlines some of the uncertainties which cereal growerscan f&amp;c$.Por pigmeat, the Economic Development Committee proposed a very large increase indeed.    Much of the expandedproduction would have to go for bacon.    The Committeeassumed that it would be possible to obtain a rapid expansion in the production of British bacon of the right quality andat the right price.    There are some difficult technical and marketing problems in doing this.    But we are looking to thecuring industry to increase its share of the market by improving its productivity and competitiveness.    Subjectto these points, we welcome and endorse in broad terms theEconomic Development Committee&apos;s assessment.Our broad objectives over the next four years will beas follows.    I have sounded a note of caution about thepractical pace of advance in cereals production.    our objective, however,for cereals is clear.    We aim to expandproduction as much as is technically possible and consistent with reasonable resource use and support cost.    With this objeive, goes an expansion of the appropriate break and foddercrops.    Por sugar beet, we shall maintain the acreage againsta level of consumption of sugar which is, at best, static.We shall continue to aim at meeting the demand for main croppotatoes for human consumption.    We shall encourage theoutput of the right quality potatoes for the processingindustries.It remains important that we should make significantlybetter use of our grassland.    The Economic Development

Committee considered that, on this basis, a continuing growth of beef production was possible.    We should like to see an1 tic 2? o 3. se in suitable calf retentions.    We should also like tosee any increase in the dairy herd for beef productionrelated to cheaper milk production;    for example, on summergrass.We accept that we should continue an expansion of beeffrom the beef and dairy herds.    This means that for these important commodities, beef and milk, we are aiming forincreased output, similar to that suggested by the economic development Committee up to 1972-73.    We recognise theimportance of sheep and aim at a continued shift of the flocktowards the hills and uplands.For those commodities where we are already virtuallyself-sufficient - namely, poultry, eggs and pork - we shallaim to increase production to meet rising demands.    We shallencourage the bacon curing industry to improve further itsproductivity so as to produce more bacon of a quality and ata price which will attract the consumer.    We also wish to seethe encouraging expansion of the horticultural industrycontinuing on the basis of its competitive efficiency.I have tried to set out clearly the broad aims of a balanced programme for the whole industry.    It goes a long way towards the import saving objectives of the economic development Committee.    Although, for the reasons I have setout, the full import saving envisaged by the Committee wouldnot be reached by 1972-73, nevertheless, by that time, weshould achieve a net saving of about  160 million a year.1 should emphasise that, in the context of the programme,the Government are well aware of the need for stability in ourmarkets.    This stability contains support costs and givesconfidence to the industry.    Measures to promote such stability.... -    /already

already exist for many commodities, such, as cereals, butter,bacon and potatoes.    Further measures for other commoditiesmay he required.    This is under consideration by theGovernment,We believe that it is within the capacity of the Britishindustry to achieve the objectives of selective expansion whichI have outlined.    Much must depend, however, on the ability of the industry to go on improving its technologicalstandards;    on the extent to which its rising productivitycan help to hold down support costs;    and on the attentionwhich it pays to marketing.We believe that, if this progress can be made, the selective expansion can be achieved with an economic useof resources and consistently with our international obligations.    The development of the programme, its cost, theresources required and the market situation will clearly have to be examined with the industry at each Annual Review.I believe that the industry and the country will welcome the guide lines that we are laying down for the years ahead.I am sure that farmers and growers will do their part.    Theycan be sure that the Government believe in them and in theirpotential for making a further major contribution to our economic prosperity.

ANNEX IVEXTRACTS FROM. NBPI, REPORT NO.   101  ON PAY CFAGRICULTURAL WORKERS&quot;In the first place it is to be inferred from the contention of both sides of the industry that theagreement is in keeping with the White Paper that they believe that the cost of the increase can be met by theworkers&apos; direct contribution towards raising productivity.Taking into account contributions to productivity from sources other than labour, this would imply as aminimum that prices need not rise on account of the pay increase.&quot;    (paragraph&apos;28)&quot;It is an essential feature of the situation that theGovernment themselves have the means by which to ensurethat the cost of the pay increase is not automaticallypassed on to the community, contrary to the intention ofthe incomes policyj    The annual farm price review is dueto be conducted next month, and it is open to theGovernment to take the view, when they are deciding thelevel of financial support for agriculture in thecoming year, that the    cost of this pay increase is to be offset by the direct contribution of workers towardsincreasing productivity and will not therefore resultin the taxpayer having to shoulder higher supportcosts.&quot;    (paragraph 29)
