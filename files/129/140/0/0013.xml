If is document is the property of her britannic majesty ls government) (i^LA3. COPY NO. OJ^2Lgt January, 1969CABINETM-^lHE^P^HHi-^y-^SJ^5ES*!iE5L2^ ^Jate^ f orEducation and science the Chancellor of the Exchequer is reporting to the Cabinet onthe issues raised for public sector pay policy by proposals brought before the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes for increases for doctors and dentists and for teachers.    My own proposals are foran offer to the teachers at ths ceiling (6^8 per cent in this case), plus a settlement of the &quot;primary/secondary differential&quot; at 1 per cent to be excluded from the ceiling, but justified by Section 40 of the White Paper;the whole offer being at 7. 1 per cent to run for two years from 1st April, 1969.    This memorandum reports the latest developments since the meeting of the Prices and Incomes Committee on 14th January.2.     The Burnham Committee   met on 17th January,     The teacherssubmitted a new ciaimjat about 8 per cent, superseding their first oneof 2l4 per cent.     The new claim was for almost the same basic scaleas that envisaged in the 7. 1 per cent offer which the management wantus to authorise.     The management asked for time to consider this andthe Committee adjourned until 31st January.3.     The teachers1 panel showed very clearly their wish to get anagreement this time, if at all possible.     Off the record, they said thatthey would be prepared to try to get through their executives and conferences even a settlement at 7. 1 per cent, though they could not guarantee success.     The management see this attitude as new and mostwelcome evidence of realism and flexibility in the teachers, and arestrengthened in their wish to make the 7. 1 per cent offer for anagreement.4.     In addition the management took soundings, again off the record,about the possibility of a main settlement from 1st April at oV8 per cent,combined with an effective date of 1st September, 1969, for the1 per cent for the &quot;primary/secondary differential&quot;.     The teachers,not surprisingly, rejected this, but the management are seeking ourcontingent authorisation of it so that they can put it forward on31st January, if we still refuse to authorise the whole 7. 1 per cent offer.They do not think that a settlement, reached as a single whole but givingadditional pay after five months to a defined sub-group comprising about

10 per cent of a whole group, need be precluded by the &quot;twelve monthsrule&quot;.     And they think that a five month delay on the 1 per cent might help the government presentationally.    It is not certain that the teacherscan be brought to accept this alternative package, but the prospect will clearly be improved if a further adjournment can be avoided.5.     The National Association of Schoolmasters, the most militant ofthe unions concerned, withdrew from the Committee on 17th Januarybecause they were not prepared to be associated with the 8 per centclaim, which they regard as an abject surrender by the teachers&apos; panel.They are planning industrial action.    This strengthens the case forreaching an agreement with the more moderate elements in the NationalUnion of Teachers and the other unions.6.     For my part I still want to urge my colleagues to authorise thewhole 7. 1 per cent from 1st April, including the i per cent to be excluded from the ceiling but included in prices and incomes policy,but, if we decide against this, I would hope that we would have nodifficulty in giving contingent agreement to the fall-back offer of6l/8 per cent from 1st April plus the 1 per cent on the differential from 1st September.     I am in any case strongly opposed to a reference to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes.E.W. S.Department of Education and Science, W. 1.20th January, 1909
