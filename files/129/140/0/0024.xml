C(69) 24 COPY NO. jjjj10th March, 1969CABINETOVERSEA POLICY; NIGERIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsThe bombing of civiliansRecent reports about indiscriminate bombing have aroused freshcriticism of our Nigerian policy, both in Parliament and elsewhere.There is certainly strong pressure in some quarters in Parliament fora change of policy, but it is difficult to judge how widespread this feeling is.2,       The immediate issue is that of the bombing of civilians in Biafra.The Times and other critics have concentrated entirely on the bombingby the federal side.    They choose to overlook the fact that the Biafransbegan the bombing in this war, that they bombed Lagos at one time and bombed a Federal village causing deaths as recently as 31st January.On my instructions, Sir David Hunt took this up personally withGeneral Gowon on 3rd March and I myself saw the Nigerian HighCommissioner on the same day.    We pointed out that these air attacks, which many would consider deliberate attacks on civilians,were doing great harm to the Federal position for little or no militaryadvantage.    We pressed that immediate steps should be taken to ensurethat the instructions to pilots to attack military targets only werescrupulously obeyed and publicised.    We also urged the federal government to consider making it clear publicly that they wouldnot object to the observer team visiting rebel territory if Ojukwuagreed.3.      General Gowon replied that he had never approved indiscriminatebombing of towns; that the state of captured towns now in Federal handsproved this;  that he regarded the ordinary people in rebel areas asfellow Nigerians;  that the only bombing authorised was against military targets (he handed over a copy of current instructions to the Air force which state that efforts must be made to preserve as many lives aspossible and that no non-military targets should be bombed andgatherings of civilians must be avoided);  that interrogation of prisonersDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)

had produced full information about numerous targets (ordnanceinstallations, petrol dumps, training establishments) on the edgesof towns.4,       Gowon was doubtful about letting the observer team visit rebelterritory but promised to think again about this.    He also promised toconsider making a further public statement about the orders given tohis pilots.5. The real problem is that, while Gov/on is sincere, throughincompetence or recklessness lower down the line his orders maynot be fully carried out, particularly by Egyptian pilots,6.       We are continuing to urge him to ensure much more detailedsupervision of their briefing and control.    We.have also pointed outstrongly that air attacks on targets other than the airstrips used by aircraft bringing in arms, even when the targets are legitimate, do their cause much more harm than good.The principles underlying our policy7.       Our policy is based on the principle that secession is damagingboth to Nigeria and to Africa as a whole.    In this we are fully supportedby U Thant and by the overwhelming majority of African Governments.We must have regard both to the welfare of Nigeria as a whole and tothe future of Africa, and to our own standing both with Nigeria and withAfrica.    The fact is that Nigeria needs the Ibos and the Ibos needNigeria.    Iboland is an integral part of Nigeria not just politicallybut geographically, commercially and in every other way.    It cannotexist on its own and the minority peoples adjacent to it have no wish tobe incorporated in Biafra or to be dominated by the Ibos.    Any solution which stops short of recognising this cannot last and only stores uptrouble for the future,8,      Some of our critics have suggested that we are ill-informed about the situation in Nigeria,, and more especially inside Biafra.I think this criticism is wide of the mark.    We do not of course have the advantage of a resident Diplomatic Service mission in Biafra.We used to have a Deputy High Commissioner in Enugu, butColonel Ojukwu made his position so difficult that we were compelledto withdraw him.   The High Commission in Lagos do in fact send usvery full and carefully considered reports on the Federal side and theirassessments have been borne out by events.    So far as the Biafran sideis concerned, v/e have information from a stream of visitors of all sorts -British and Canadian MPs, United States Congressmen, relief workers,missionaries and journalists, a great number of whom come to see usin the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.    We therefore have a greatdeal of information from visitors and others supplementing the high commission^ information.    We compare notes regularly with the

Americans, the Canadians, and with European Governments, as well aswith the International and British Red Cross, OXFAM, the Save theChildren Fund, Shell/BP, the United Africa Company and a large numberof British firms, with whom we maintain regular contact.    We alsomaintain official contact with the Nigerians and unofficial contact withthe Biafrans in London.    We know a very great deal about Nigeria andBiafra and are probably better informed than any foreign government.Our interests and policy9,      What some critics of our policy, in and out of Parliament, wantis for us to stop supplying arms to the Federal Government which means,in effect, withdrawing our support for them.    It would be wrong to thinkthat this action would put us into a neutral position.    As creators andtraditional suppliers of Nigeria, any move to stop supplying conventionalarms to the Federal Government would mean in effect that we weresupporting the rebellion of Colonel Ojukwu.    We should not be hustledinto taking action against our better judgment which would, in fact, bevery damaging to our interests and which v/ould do nothing at all to bring a solution nearer.    The considerations advanced in the paper which I circulated to my colleagues on 9th December (C(68) 126) are still valid.The stopping of arms supplies to the Federal Government at this stage would have very serious consequences for us,10,      It might well endanger the 16,000 British subjects living inFederal Nigeria;  it v/ould also put at risk the tremendous Shell/BPinvestment in Nigeria on which they are spending about  1 million av/eek.    This great investment is now beginning to produce a returnwhich will quadruple in the next four years and have an important effect on our balance of payments.    Already oil exports are againapproaching the figure which they reached before the war.    Interferencewith Nigerian oil supplies would certainly affect adversely the negotiationswith oil-producing countries in the Middle East;  and might damageinternational confidence in our economic recovery.11,       We might decide to run the grave risk to life and wealth if therewere overriding moral or political considerations.    But it is certainly not axiomatic - and I do not believe it to be true - that it would bemorally right to cut off traditional arms supplies to Nigeria when she is combating a rebellion, the success of which would be disastrous to Nigeria and Africa,    Politically the main effect of a change of policy would be to make Nigeria increasingly dependent on the USSR, to the damage of both Africa and ourselves.The military prospects12,       The Federal Government are aware that we are under very great pressure and that we shall find difficulty in holding the line here if thewar continues indefinitely on present lines.    The Prime Minister made this clear to Chief Awolowo when he saw him on 19th January.

Chief Awolowo was optimistic about the prospects of a final offensive butit has not developed yet.    During recent weeks the Biafrans have had some success in pushing tov/ards the south-west on either side of Owerri,which was for a time cut off, but in the last few days a Federal reliefcolumn has pushed through to Owerri,    The Federal forces for their part have linked up their two divisions in the north.   We cannot rule out the possibility that the Federal Army will be able to advance fromthe north.    The latest assessment I have had from Sir David Hunt isthat he would expect the Federal forces to lurch forward on the northernfront any day now though he is resigned to possible disappointment.    Ifthe Federal forces were able to overrun the remaining Biafran area   .quickly (and to do this they would have to complete their advance beforethe end of May when the rains come) our immediate dilemma is resolved.What should prove decisive would be the knocking out of the Biafranairstrips to which the arms flights go at present.    The best practicablehope is that they might be able to make enough gains to persuad Ojukwuthat he cannot win (especially if there had been no further recognitionor other moves in support from outside).    Alternatively, if there wasa demonstrable turning of the tide against Biafra the more reasonableBiafrans might get rid of Colonel Ojukwu.    In either of these eventsnegotiations could begin with a real will to settle on both sides whichis in fact a prerequisite of success.    Up till now the Federal sidehave taken up what is, in our view, a reasonable negotiating positionand are prepared to give reasonable guarantees for Ibo safety and well-being.    The Biafrans have not.    They are unwilling to settle for lessthan independence; yet no Nigerian Government could concede this andsurvive.    General Gowon has sworn to restore the unity of his countryand, given the support of the Russians and most of Africa, does not doubt his capacity to carry out his promise,13,       We must, however, face the fact that the war may drag on andthat the Federal forces which are greatly extended and indifferentlyled with very long lines of communication may not be able to establish an early ascendancy of the type which would bring about realisticnegotiations.    It is even possible, though at present I think unlikelythat the Biafran-s might advance further south and threaten PortHarcourt, though there are no grounds for thinking that Colonel Ojukwu&apos;forces can, in the long run, prevail against the much stronger Federalforces.    It is, therefore, right that we should consider the worstpossibilities and review the alternative open to us.

Efforts to bring about negotiations14.      Ever since the beginning of the dispute we have taken a leadingrdle in efforts at mediation.    Ministers have had repeated discussions with both sides, most recently during the Commonwealth Conference.We have also fully supported the efforts of the Commonwealth secretariat and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) which have both brought thetwo sides together in negotiations which in the event were abortive.    Sofar all efforts have failed.    The OAU is expected to try again next month.    But there is as yet no sign of a real willingness to compromise on either side on the essential question of independence and sovereigntyfpr Biafra,   and the gap is still as wide as ever.    If Nigerian unity were accepted, negotiations could concentrate on protection for the Ibos in a free and equal Nigeria;  if Biafran independence were accepted,negotiations could concentrate on co-operation.    But at present there isno common ground on this issue, although in reality there are strongcommon interests.Alternatives15. (1) To go on as we areAdvantages:  British subjects and our commercial interests aresafeguarded.    Our relations with the Federal Governmentremain reasonably satisfactory and we are in a position to helpbring about a settlement when the makings of one appear,    Weare also well placed to rebuild our position politically and economically in what is the largest and most important blackAfrican country, a member of the Commonwealth in whosecontinued prosperity and stability we have a genuine long-terminterest.Disadvantages;   We shall remain subject to strong attack inParliament and in the Press at home, to criticism in Europe,Canada and elsewhere and the limitations on the degree of our support will continue to make difficulties for us with theNigerians themselves.    The Government appear to theuninformed to be joining with the Russians in backing the stronger side against a brave and struggling small country.(2)   To step up our support for the Federal Government so as toproduce a military solutionAdvantages; This could bring about much earlier an end to thewar or a situation favourable to negotiations as I have earlierdescribed.    This is what General de Gaulle did in not toodissimilar circumstances in The Chad last year.- 5-

Disadvantages; In domestic political terms, any change in the type, or marked increase in the scale, of overt support forFederal Nigeria can be ruled out.To stop arms supplies, to withdraw support from the federal government and to seek to disengageAdvantages; We escape for a brief space from the pressure of criticism in Parliament and in the Press.Disadvantages: We face the grave risks described inparagraphs 9 and 10; and when these risks became realities -as some of them certainly would - we should be criticised just as violently from a different standpoint.    In local terms weshould make much more probable in the long run the break-upof Nigeria, probably with bloodshed and chaos like the earliersituation in the Congo.    We should be doing real damage to thefuture of millions of Africans and might help to set backAfrican political development by many years.To bring strong pressure on the Federal Government to enterinto negotiations unconditionally (i. e. instead of requiring theBiafrans to accept in advance that the purpose of negotiations is to achieve &quot;one Nigeria&quot; in some form).Advantages; This might theoretically help to bring aboutnegotiations which, while they might not succeed, would reduce the pressure onus politically.    It is possible that inthe course of negotiations the tv/o sides would find themselvescloser to a situation which they could both accept than atpresent seems probable.    It would also put off the day when we would otherwise find ourselves obliged to make-a more radical change in our policy with more unwelcome effects onour relations with Nigeria.Disadvantages:   The Federal Government would strongly objectand might well not agree.    We have already brought a greatdeal of pressure to bear on the Federal Government.    their position about negotiations is reasonable and it would be unreasonable to press them to negotiate when we and they know perfectly well that there is for the present no genuinewish to compromise on the other side.To see whether it will be possible to bring about a general armsembargoAdvantages: This would enable us to respond to widespreadopinion in this country and elsewhere.    It would, if effectivelyimposed, gradually reduce the ability of each side to maintainthe fight to the finish.-6-

Disadvantage3: We should appear to the Federal Government tobe changing our support for them, with the results already-indicated.    The Russians are unlikely to co-operate, and theFrench declare publicly that they are not supplying arms.    We,therefore, do not believe that an attempt to impose an effective international embargo would succeed.    Even if onewere agreed, the black market flow of arms to both sides would continue.Conclusion16.      I conclude therefore that it would be neither right not wise for usto cut off at this stage the supply of arms to the Federal Government.In the House of Commons on 12th June last I stated the conditions inwhich we might do this, but neither of these conditions have beenfulfilled.    At the same time it is important, both for the welfare of nigeria and for the rebutting of criticism that we should:(l)     press the Nigerian Government to keep on emphasising their willingness to reach an agreement provided that this does not involve the dismemberment of Nigeria;(2)    press them to repeat their assurances to the Ibos and to hold tothe statesmanlike line propounded by General Gowon in his speech at Zaria on 30th November;(3)    whenever the situation for negotiations looks promising, seek to play an active part in consultation with the OAU and theCommonwealth Secretariat;(4)    impress on the Nigerians the need to avoid actions likeindiscriminate bombing which are inhuman, militarily uselessand politically damaging;(5)    continue to play our full part in relief.M.S.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S. W.l.10th March, 1969-7-
