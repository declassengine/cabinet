6BC(69) 22 COPY NO.____4th March, 1969CABINETAGRICULTURAL POLI6Y; FARM PRICE REVIEW 1969Memorandum by the .Secretary of Slate for S contend and theMJJgigter of Anricnifcuref Figheriea and FoodAfter three weeks of disaussion and negotiation with the Farmers&apos;Unions it is quite clear where they stand in relation to an award of 30 million.2.     They reject it -(a) as quite unrealistic in the light of cost increases (now up from 38 million to  40 million as a result of the 8 per cent bank rate) and,daft year&apos;s fall in net income and output;(b) as denying them the capital resources they neecTto lnvestforfurther expansion; and therefore(c) as inconsistent with the future policy for agriculture announced on 12 th November in the light of the Report of the economic development Committee on agriculture^ import saving role.3.     Even those of our colleagues who still seem to think the counter-arguments are strong may allow that they are very difficult to put acrossto the industry.     We can assure them that the most has been made of thearguments in meetings between officials and the Unions, between theAgricultural Ministers and the Presidents ef the Unions, and betweenthe Minister r*f Agriculture and the President of the National Farmers1Union who leads the farmers1 team.    As these encounters have progressedthe Unions1 reaction has been one of mounting incredulity and indignation.4,       They cannot believe that, if we are sincere in our expansionpolicy, we are prepared to give so little weight to agreed figures which show clearly that farm incomes (providing return on capital and funds for investment as well as personal incomes) are on a downward trend,and that as a result output and productivity are suffering,IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)

5,        They cannot understand that the Governmonl; havethoy see it, lost interest in import saving during the three months since the november statement in which the only hopeful sign for the balanceof payments has been one set of improved trade figures.    And bythe time they have studied the Green Paper &quot;The Task Ahead&quot; andall it says about a shift of resources into import saving they will beeven more mystified and disillusioned about our economic strategy.6.      For all the reasons we have given, withdetailed argument and personal conviction, to the Ministerial Committeeon Agricultural Policy and to the Cabinet, wo fikad i:c difficult to disagreefundamentally with the Unionfer assessment.    We see no hope of defendingan award of  30 million as consistent with our policy,,    The agricultural ministers have always taken the view that some injection of capital overrecoupment of costs is necessary to get expansion.    We remainconfirmed in this view.7.       There are, of course, arguments we can use in relation to individual commodities.    As the talks have developed we have stressed that ton beef and cereals we think of giving significantly more thanrecoupment wf costs.    But against the background of the treatmentof the industry as a whole, they find such arguments quite unconvincing.They come back relentlessly to the global figures for costs, net income and output which the whole industry will see as the indicators of itspresent position.8.       Against this background we must make it clear that we cannotregard the present figure as capable of credible defence.    Unless wecan improve on it substantially, we do not believe we shall get theproduction (and import saving) we have said we want.    But it may also be ef concern to our colleagues that we shall face a first-classrow which will erupt in the House of Commons (fanned by the Report ofthe Select Committee on Agriculture due out on 5th March) and throughoutthe couitry.    The Conservatives, now at odds with the farmers, will find it easy to cash in on this.9.      We shall be continuing the negotiations right up to the meetingof Cabinet at which this paper will be discussed and will give a fartherreport orally..    At the kind of figure we are now having to work on. thereis, of course, no hope of an agreed Review.    Bui we r*re less troubledby this than by the central argument that we are not fulfilling the policywhich the Minister of Agriculture announced on 12th November.wj:i.C.H.Scottish Office, S.W.I.4th March, 1969
