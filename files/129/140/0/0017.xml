(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)CI69117COPY NOcCABINETAGRICULTURAL, POLICY; FARM PRICE REVIEW 1969Memorandjam^bY the^CJijaj^js llj^j)fjW^^x^J^uierI start by re-stating the assumptions about the continued rise in productivity on which our whole agricultural policy is based.    Thedecisions taken on production objectives towards the end of last year had as their starting point an agreed report by senior officials on production Objectives and Support Policies.    This stated in paragraph 66that - irWe have taken into account the reduction in inputs which can beexpected as a consequence of the increasing productivity of the industryand, in particular, of the continuing outflow of labour which can beexpected to lead to a reduction of some  90 million in labour requirements over the period&quot;.     That is to say, over the four-year period upto 1972-73, the report expected a saving of  22-j million a year on labour costs alone, on a constant price basis.2.     The report continued (in paragraph 69) as follows&quot;The Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s best appraisal, from which wehave no reason to dissent, is that producers would have to beleft with some  40 million to  60 million more a year in real terms by 1972-73.    This compares with the estimated increasein net income of   110 million a year on Review commodities bythat date.     55 million would therefore be the amount left with the industry after four years if they were allowed to keepabout half of their increased profits.    It would therefore bepossible, as in the past^ to continue the squeeze on the industry at Annual Reviews to reduce support costs in real terms. &quot;3.     This assumption of a continuing annual productivity gain underlayall our subsequent consideration of the issues and the Minister ofAgriculturers statement to the Commons on 12th November 1968, when hesaid.that &quot;The Government have decided that selective expansion ofagriculture should continue, provided that this is based upon the mainten-ance of the rate of increase in the industry&quot;ls productivity. &quot;   If theappraisal which was made only a few months ago of the prospects forproductivity is now to be called into question, then the selective expansion programme itself is called into question.    For my part I see no reason

for reversing our position in either respect.    One bad year does not affect the underlying productivity trend,    I believe that, unless anduntil there is much more concrete evidence to the contrary, we should proceed on the basis that, taking one year with another, agriculture is capable of a continuing substantial gain in efficiency, that part of thisshould be applied towards increasing the farmers&apos; potential net income and the remainder towards reducing the potential cost of exchequer support, and that this should be a fundamental criterion for the specificdecisions to be taken in these Annual Reviews,    The immediate issue,therefore, is to what extent the award resulting from the present review should be designed to leave farmers with the benefit of the efficiency gainwhich can be expected to reassert itself in the coming year, given normal weather conditions, and to what extent part of this gain should go to mitigate the cost falling on the taxpayer and the consumer.4.     Comparisons between the movements in the net income of farmers in recent years and the changes in income of other graups depend on anumber of factors including the period covered and the other groups with whom a comparison is made.    I am enclosing at Annex A some figuresextracted from MAFF material, which show that in money terms net income per farm rose by 40 per cent in England and &quot;Wales between 1963and 1967 and by 55 per cent in Scotland and Northern Ireland.    these years are exactly those which the MAFF thought relevant when discussingbeef productions it is not reasonable to treat them as significant from one point of view and irrelevant from another.    Over the same period the monthly index of earnings of all employees including salary earners andwage earners rose by about 27 per cent in money terms.    Although thereport by officials refeired to above pointed out that farmers1 incomes in real terms had risen by about 20 per cent since the mid-fifties, comparedwith a rise of over 30 per cent in average incomes outside agriculture, theEconomic Statistics now circulated by the Ministry of Agriculture seem toindicate that farmers&apos; incomes have kept abreast since the mid-fifties withthe aggregate incomes of other sole traders and partners,    I also attach-.,at Annex B a table on net income and net output which has already been circulated to APC and which has the advantage of giving a moving three-yearaverage in farming income, thus avoiding the bias involved in taking anuntypical base year.    So far as one can judge on the available material,my conclusion is that, prior to 1968, farmers&apos; net income as a whole had done reasonably well.    We must also bear in mind the annual reductionin the number of farmers, running at about 5,000 a year, which means that the total is shared among a decreasing number of people.    It is alsogenerally acknowledged that, within this total, there are wide variations in the circumstances of individual farmers, depending in many cases onthe size of their operations.-2-

CO NFS DENTS AL5,     We must now, however, take account of the reduction in net income in 1968 because of bad weather and disease.    I understand thatan examination of the material on this particular point circulated by theMinistry of Agriculture suggests that not all types of farming and not all parts of the United Kingdom suffered such a reduction.    Nevertheless I agree that this is a factor militating against being too severe in applying to this particular review the general approach which I have set out above.6.     But it is not an argument for abandoning this approach entirelyor for excessive generosity.    But for bad weather, the agricultural departments have estimated that the upward trend in net income wouldhave continued during the past year.    Given normal weather, thistrend will reassert itself in 1969 without an over-generous settlement.If we add something to an otherwise reasonable award purely becauseof what happened last year, then with normal weather conditions theincrease in farme rs1 income in 1969 would be wholly out of keeping withour general incomes policy.7,     If we were to fix very high guaranteed prices, designed to compensate the farmers this year for last year&apos;s bad weather, to alarge extent these would be paid on output already in the pipeline.Moreover, because of the basis on which we calculate the annual awardthese very high prices would automatically be carried forward into future years,.    Suppose we were to give a bonus of  5 million this year on accountof the bad weatner in 1968.    If costs increase next year, say by  40 million and we decide to leave the farmers with 5 0 per cent of their productivitygain, the award would be  25 million.    But a settlement on this basis would provide farmers in 1971 and subsequently with their additionalbonus of  5 million for the bad weather in 1968.     I doubt whether wecould have any expectation of getting these price levels down again, andI should see extreme difficulty over extemporising at such short notice anew formula of this kind for fixing guaranteed prices in the present review.If this approach is to be seriously considered as a basis tor long-term policy in this field, I suggest that it should be thoroughly consideredbetween now and the next review,.    Meanwhile, though I agree that lastyear&apos;s performance has to be taken into account in a general way, I donot think that the subsidy levels can now be fixed so as ^specifically to compensate farmers for last yearrs weather, with a view to abating themin the future if the weather has been good.    In the important case of beefsuch a course would be irreconcilable with the proposal of the agricultural departments to give an assurance that the new guaranteed price will bemaintained for a period of years.15 SB*SJ^ 4: j-BYe stment8.     It has been suggested that the fall in net income in 1968 willprejudice the farmers1 ability to invest and expand operations in 1969,and that the subsidy levels should be increased to avert this danger.While it is not disputed that net income plays an important part in agricultural investment, I understand that no detailed material has beenmade available to help in forming a judgment on the weight to be attachedto this point, and no evidence has so far been brought forward to suggest a general lack of liquidity among farmers to finance their current

operations.    In any event, guaranteed prices which accrue after outputhas been sold cannot in themselves provide the finance required at the outset.    The availability of bank finance is much more relevant to thequestion of the resources available for farm operations at this particularjuncture.    It is relevant that total bank advances to agriculture, fisheries and forestry rose to  533 million in mid -November, 1968, as comparedwith  510 million a year earlier.    Furthermore the willingness of banksto lend and the availability of capital from other sources is far more likely to be affected by future prospects than by the experience of onebad year, which is well known to occur occasionally in agriculture.Public expenditure implications9.       The treatment of agricultural support presents special difficulties for the forecasts of public expenditure.    Forecasts made on the basis ofany given level of guaranteed prices are subject to big variations in either direction according to the actual level of home supplies and of market prices, which in turn can be affected not only by changes in demand but also by import levels and prices,    In several recent years the provision for agricultural support has for these reasons beenunderspent^ but in 1961-62 there was an over-spending of  63 million,and in 1967-68 there would have been an over-spending but fordevaluation, which put up market prices and therefore reduced the size of deficiency payments.    The figure for agricultural support in 1968-69 which appeared in the i960 public expenditure survey was the best estimate that could then be made for the current year - though it is in fact being substantially underspent - while thesame figure was projected for subsequent years, in the absence of anyforecast in the true sense for those years, because we must have some basis for allowing provisionally for agricultural support in our totals.But this projection - though any excess above it would mean that adifferent allowance would have to be made in the public expenditure total - does not in itself provide a rational basis for determining thepresent award.     The objection from a public expenditure point of viewto the proposals of the Agricultural Departments is not simply that instatistical terms they would exceed the projection for 1970-71, though not for 1969-70, but that from every other point of view they implycriteria quite out of keeping with our general approach to public expenditure,10,      In terms of the provision for agricultural support in VoteEstimates, the position is that the Main Estimates for 1969-70 arebeing submitted to Parliament at  293 million on the basis of existingguaranteed prices.    (This figure excludes certain assistance to agriculture and fisheries not classified as agricultural support).Supplementary Estimates will be required to meet the gross costof higher guaranteed prices, though the net change in outturn maybe either bigger or smaller than this according to changes in market conditions.    Other things being equal the supplementary provisionrequired in 1969-70 by the proposals of the Agricultural Departments-4-

will be abcnit  28^ million.     The full-year supplementary cost on Voteswould be  11 million higher than this making nearly  40 million.     Thedifference between this figure and the  5 0 million award proposed by theAgricultural Ministers is accounted for by that part of the cost which will fall directly on the consumer and by certain technical changes in the seasonal adjustments to the guaranteed price for beef.    All otherDepartmental Estimates have been handled, by common agreement amongtie, on the basis of identifying uncommitted expenditure and keeping it toa minimum.    This approach has been adopted even where the expenditurein question has been allowed for in previous public expenditure forecasts.We are now dealing with precisely such a case of uncommitted expenditure and, while I have not proposed that the general approach should be appliedas rigorously as it has been in most other cases, because of the other considerations involved, I am sure that we should preserve some degreeof consistency.11.    The 1969-70 figure for agricultural support which is included inthe draft White Paper on Public Expenditure is the Estimate figure of 293 million, and not the projection which was assumed for the purposeof the 1968 Public Expenditure Survey.    The Supplementary Estimatesrequired by the proposed award will therefore come out of the contingency reserve for 1969-70 and, though this is reasonable in the circumstances,the more that is allocated from the reserve for increases in guaranteed prices, the less will be available for other contingencies either in agricultural or in other expenditure.    There will be no possibility of cutting guaranteed prices during the year if their case proves to be excessive,Q  I^ l--io L12.     The conclusion which I recommend to my colleagues is therefore that, on a balrnco of these various considerations, the total award to the farmers from this year&apos;s review should be based on the proposals putforward by the Minister without Portfolio, and the underlying principle should be maintained that the farmers should make a significant contribu-tion out of increased productivity - though not so great as we should haverequired in other circumstances - towards absorbing cost increases andrelieving public expenditure of part of the potential cost of agricultural support.    Any other approach would entail a change in the baais onwhich our agricultural policy has so far been framed.R. H. J,Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.10th February, 1969-5-1*
