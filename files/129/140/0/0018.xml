66C(69) 18 COPY NO._7th February, 1969CABINETAGRICULTURAL POLICY:  FARM PRICE REVIEW 1969Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food was invited by the Cabinet (CC(69) 7th Conclusions, Minute 3)to circulate a memorandum setting out the salient figures bearing on theAward to be made following the Annual Review, with particular reference to costs, efficiency, and net income in the agricultural industry.Costs2.       The aggregate change in the cost of ail farm imports sincethe 1968 Review amounts to an increase of  50 million on all commodities,and  38 million on Review commodities, in a full year.    About two-thirds of these increases have already occurred, and have been reflected in farmers1 income in 1968-69.    The rest are known costs that will occur in 1969-70.    Possible future cost changes are ignored.     The cost increase of  38 million this year compares with  68-1- million lastyear and an average for the previous five years of  22-1 million.Output3.       The net output of the industry is forecast to fall in 1968-69 bysome  35 million or five points on the index (using the average 1954-55to 1956-57 as the base 100).     The index in recent years has moved asfollows:-1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 1968-69136 135 135 143 138 (forecast)4,   ,  Each year we take account at the Review of the gain which isexpected to accrue to the industry as a result of increasing efficiency.The figure is reassessed periodically and was raised to  30 million in1966.    The gain arises from new technology, from better farmmanagement and from the economies of scale as farm structureimproves.    The measure of the gain is the extent to which outputrises in relation to inputs of labour and capital.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

5,       The assessed figure of  30 million is based on the assumptionthat output will maintain a steady rate of increase.    If this increasedoes not occur, then output will bear a less favourable relationshipv/ith a given input of capital and labour, and the gain actually realisedfrom greater efficiency will be less than the assessed figure.    In 1968-69,output fell, with the result that the gain will in that year have beennegligible.Income6,       Farming net income is not the same as salaries and wages.Besides providing for the living expenses of the farmer and his family,it must also provide a fair return on the working capital he has invested in his business as well as resources for further investment.    TheGovernment have explicitly recognised that net income is a majorsource of finance for further investment.    Of course, farmers alsoborrow investment money from the banks.    To do so they must offerreasonable security for the investment.     This means that the prospectsmust be adequate to cover the interest charges and repayments7.      In 1968-69, net income has fallen sharply, as a result of theaftermath of the foot-and-mouth epidemic, of the exceptionally difficultharvest which cut cereals production by more than one million tons, andthe extra costs farmers have had to bear.   It is down by  39 million onthe previous year,8.      -Aggregate net farming income (United Kingdom) in the last fiveyears has moved as follows1964-65 1965-66 1966-67 1967-68 1968-69 472^m.         460fm.         480 m.         516m.  477m. (forecast)Taking 1964-65 as the base year of the Selective Expansion Programme,as a 100, the movement in money terms and in real terms is given below.(Different base years would give different results but none of this would affect the current trend, which is steeply down).Money terms100. 0 97. 5 101. 7 109. 2 101. 0Real terms100.0 93. 5 94. 0 98.6 86.99.       The Agricultural Departments each year prepare an analysis of income by farm size and type of enterprise, based on farm accountscollected on our behalf by the University Agricultural EconomicsDepartments.    Accounts for 1968-69 are of course not available.

The following figures, relating to England and Wales, illustrate income distribution in 1967-68.    The position on all farms will have deterioratedsomewhat in 1968-69.    The figures on cereals and beef are the best available to show the broad position on these commodities, althoughit is not possible to isolate these commodities precisely, since theyare produced on a wide range of general farms, not simply on specialistone so.j?p;reF;ate income 1967-68 by size of businessSmall    Medium     Large      All Sizes	 	 	 	 All farms (excluding horticulture)	856	1 2,066	3, 588	2,251Mainly cereals	1,036	2, 809	4, 375	2,994Mainly beef	772	2, 093	3,863	1, 672Note:  In this table, size of farms is not based on acreage but onthe size of the farm business.    Small businesses as shown here arethose run by one man with part-time help;  medium businesses two to four men;  large businesses four to six men.    In all cases, the numberincludes the farmer himself.10.      Allowing for a return on the farmer1 s working capital investment in his business at the exceptionally low rate of l\ per cent, the figures given in paragraph 9 have been adjusted to show v/hat was left to the farmer and his wife for their manual labour and management, insurance contributions and tax, and for investment.

Using 1964-65 as the base 100, income movements have been as follows:-

1964-65 1967-68 1968-69 (forecast)Farmers 100 109. 3 101.other sole traders 100Rural workers 100Professional persons 100Company profits 100110. 7 114. 2 (1968)118.3 124.5110.7 114,1 (I960)104, 9 111. 6 (   &quot; )General12,      At the 1968 Review, we made an Award of  52-1 million againstcost increases of  68^ million.    On the assumption that the efficiencygain would be  30 million, this implied, that farmers would have to bearabout  16 million of their cost increases and would then be left with about 14 million as an incentive and reward and to provide for furtherinvestment in expansion.13,      In the event, because of the drop in output and income farmers are now not only  39 million worse off than in 1967-68 but they failedto get the additional  14 million which the 1968 Review was intended toprovide.    Their current income position is thus substantially worse than we aimed at,14.      Assuming that next year&apos;s weather is normal, we can of courseexpect income to-be restored to the sort of level which could have been expected in 1968-69.    But we cannot possibly expect it to make good theloss of income which farmers sustained that year.    This is why Ibelieve that, in this quite exceptional situation, our Award this yearmust give reasonable prospects that the depletion of the industry&apos;resources will be restored.    Only if we do this can we expectinvestment for expansion to go ahead in line with our objectives.Delay now cannot be made good, so that each year between now and1972-73 we should forgo a substantial part of the net import savingwhich the industry is capable of making to the benefit of the balanceof payments,15.      I have also been considering how far it would be possible tomake a definite link from year to year between the size of the award and the effects of the weather, disease, etc, in the preceding year.The object would be to ensure that if income losses were made goodfollowing an exceptionally bad year, farmers would automatically give up. some of the higher income produced after a good year.    This is infact how the Review machinery has been used in the past, although noton an automatic basis.    And it ie important to keep enough flexibility inthe arrangements to allow not only production considerations, but also

any special international^ public expenditure or other considerations tobe reflected in the Award in any year016,       Of course, I fully accept that on the assumption that output, income and the efficiency gain are restored, and the industry is on course andbuoyant, it should be our objective over the four-year programme that farmers should bear out of their rise in productivity a reasonableproportion of their increasing costs.    On this principle, it would follow that we should be allowing in good years for Awards whichare necessary in bad years,    I think that an approach of this kind -rather than any automatic one - would be best, and fully consistent with, the flexibility which, as has all along been stressed, should applyto the implementation of the expansion programme.CH.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S,W,1,7th February, 1969
