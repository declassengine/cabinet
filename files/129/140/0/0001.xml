ft \f SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVES.N2/IENT)C(69) 1 COPY NO.        jj g7th January, 1969CABINETINDUSTRIAL. RELATIONS:  LEGISLATIVE TIMETABLEMemorandum by the Lord President of the council I was invited by the Cabinet at their meeting on 3rd january to submit, in consultation with the First Secretary of State, a memoran-duro on the possibility of introducing the Industrial Relations Bill duringthe current Session (CC(69) 1st Conclusions, Minute 1 (Conclusion lfc^).2.       For such a Bill to achieve even a Second Reading before the summer Recess it would need to reach Legislation Committee at thebeginning of July, that is to say in rather less than six months&apos; time.This will be both a long and complex Bill, as is evident from the summary of proposals given in Appendix 1 of the First Secretary ofStateTs memorandum (C(68) 131),    Even when the terms of the white paper have been decided there will be a great deal of work to be done,in consultation with both sides of industry, before the proposals canbe worked out in the full detail necessary to provide a basis fordrafting the Bill,3.       The best estimate that can be made at this stage is that itwill take not less than three months to produce a satisfactory Billfrom the time when comprehensive instructions are available.    Inother words instructions would be needed by the end of March if theBill was to receive a Second Reading by the Summer Recess,    to free the necessary drafting resources we should have to abandon theidea of introducing both Ports and Merchant Shipping this Session;and there might be some interference with the preparation of SecondReading Committee Bills,    But drafting of this Sessionrs main programme, essential and contingent Bills would not be affected,4,       There is however no prospect whatsoever of having comprehensive-sive instructions available by the end of March;  while it is impossibleto be precise, it is thought that it will be June before such instructionscan be ready.    Even assuming this estimate to be on the pessimisticside I am sure that we stand to lose rather than to gain by trying torush instructions in before they have been fully worked out.    The endresult will be to delay the Eill rather than expedite it,

5,       Finally there is the question of Parliamentary time.    The cabinet approved a legislative programme for the current Session which was estimated to require 55 Parliamentary days, which is the average amountof time available in recent Sessions (autumn spillovers excluded).    since then we have had to find time for a number of Bills for which we -had notbargained, of which Customs (import Deposits), Shipbuilding Industryand New Towns are the most significant; and there is the prospect ofa further essential Bill on Redundancy Payments.    Finding a day for second Reading of an Industrial Relations Bill would make things that much worse.6,       To sum up, I do not think that there is any real prospect of our being able to introduce the Industrial Relations Bill and give it a SecondReading before the Summer Recess, let alone pass it through all its stages.T.F.P.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.7th January, 1969
