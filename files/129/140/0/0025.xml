KIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 25 COPY NO.11th March, 1969CABINETINFLUENCE OF OVERSEA AGENCIES ON parliament memorandum by the Prime minister on 10th March the Parliamentary Committee discussed thequestion of Lobbies and Parliamentary and other pressure groups.It was agreed, following the distinction I made in my interventionat the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting on 6th March, that therewere two main problems:(1)     The problem of the employment of Members of Parliament ona salaried or fee-paid basis to represent particular pressuregroups or lobbies, frequently without their fellow MPs - andthis can include Ministers - being aware of their interest.(2)    The problem of public relations firms operating on Parliament,Government, and public opinion generally, on behalf of over-seas Governments,    The public relations firms may or maynot have paid Parliamentary contacts: this is not the onlyissue.The Committee felt that action was urgent on both questions, and feltseparate treatment was required for the two problems,2,       On Members of Parliament it was felt that the existing rulesabout &quot;declaration of interest&quot; as set out in Erskine May were quite inadequate.    In general the rules are related strictly to MPs who aredirectors, or -more doubtfully substantial shareholders, in firms whoseprofits could be directly affected by matters coming under discussion inParliament.    They do not provide for the growing practice of employingParliamentary consultants, and other Parliamentary representatives,very often at high rates of pay.    In many cases MPs regard it as their duty to make their position clear by public statements, and indeedsometimes by statements in Parliament.3,       The Committee agreed that this was a matter primarily for parliament, not for the Government to clear up.    It was decidedtherefore to recommend to the Cabinet that an early announcement should be made referring the question of the definition of declaration

of interest to a Select Committee.    It will be a matter for consideration whether there should be a new and separate Select Committee, or whetherthe existing Select Committee on Procedure could take on the assignment.4.      On the question about outside pressure groups, whether or not members of Parliament are on their pay-roll, the Committee felt thatthe problem was most acute in respect of public relations and other firms holding accounts, of ten undisclosed to the public, from overseas governments or indeed overseas financial interests.    Some of these arepublicly known, respectable and accepted - such as certain of the organisations concerned with European unity.    The Cabinet will however be aware of others which have given rise to great concern - the pressures on behalf of the Katanga lobby, not disconnected with substantial financial interests in that part of Africa? the recent disclosures about Greece;and indeed the highly effective public relations campaign on behalf of&quot;Biafra&quot;.    There is also reason to believe that similar operations arebeing undertaken on behalf of the PUiodesian regime.    Spain and Portugalwere also mentioned.5.      The activities of these lobbies are not confined to pressure on government and Parliament, though our public life would be a great dealhealthier if their activities in these two directions were more fullyknown.    More and more, however, some of these lobbies appear to bedirected towards influencing public opinion through newspapers and,still more, though radio and television.6.      The Committee were given a brief outline of the measures takenby the United States Congress requiring a registration of all such lobbies,including the fees received and the out-payments for lobbying purposesby the organisations concerned.    The Paymaster General and the attorney-General are preparing a joint paper on the American system for consideration by Cabinet.7.      The Committee felt that there was no need, at any rate at present,to register lobbies and pressure groups which operate in a purelydomestic sense, e.g. the NFU, the NUT, Trade Unions and theCo-operative Movement,8.      Seme but not all members of the Committee felt that whereas thequestion of Members of Parliaments &quot;declaration of interest&quot; should be entirely a matter for Parliament, as suggested above, the Governmenthad a responsibility - such as that asserted in the case of the AmericanLegislation by the United States Government - to act so far as &quot;foreignlobbies&quot; are concerned.    Others felt that, when the Government hadtaken its researches further, this problem too could be handled by theproposed Select Committee on the basis of facts and guidance providedby the Government,-2

9.       This problem has been with us for a very long time and there isnow great public and Parliamentary concern about it.    It was felt that subject to approval of Cabinet a statement should be made this week;(a) informing the House of the Government^ decision to refer the problemof the declaration of interest to a Select Committee;  and (b) stating thatthe Government had decided that action must be taken in relation to overseas lobbies,10,       I append a suggested statement.H.W.10 Downing Street, S. W.l.11th March, 1969-3-

APPEND ECDRAFT statement the House will recall that on 4th March I was asked by myHonourable Friend the Member for West Fife &quot;whether in view of the increasing number of hon. Members being remunerated by outside bodies, he will re-examine the desirability of legislation to establish apublic register of such interests. 11      I said that the Government were continuing to watch the position and in answers to Questions by the R.T.. Hon. Member for East Hertfordshire referred to the disparity between the treatment, so far as this House is concerned, of honourablemembers who are required by long established practice to declare their interest, and others who are not so required,I should now like to tell the House the results of the Government1 sexamination of the issues raised.As I have more than once suggested there are two separateissues here.The first is the position of Members of Parliament who by virtueof some paid connection with an outside interest, be it domestic oroverseas, are involved in matters which are the concern of parliament and of Government.    As I indicated in reply to my honourable Friend,it is important that the position of such members should be made clear in all matters which affect their responsibilities to the House and totheir Parliamentary colleagues.This is an issue for Parliament,    The Government have therefore decided to recommend to the House /here insert either the proposedestablishment of a new Select Committee to consider declaration ofinterest, c*r the proposed reference of the issue on declaration ofinterest to the existing Select Committee on Procedure/.There is however a second issue about which there is considerablepublic concern, and concern in this House.    This relates to theoperation of public relations and other organisations holding an accountor a commission on behalf of an overseas Government, or an overseas-4-

political or fhmncial interest.    The activities of some of these organisations has been raised in this House on a number of occasions,and there is concern about their activities, v/hether or not they employon any basis individual Members of this House.    What is important isthat Parliament, and the public, should know when activities of this kindare being conducted!,    Many of these organisations do valuable work in informing Parliament and the public:  the danger occurs when it is not done in an open way.    There is increasing evidence that some of these organisations are at least as concerned with operating on the media of communications outside Parliament as on Parliament and on theGovernment.    Again the public has a right to know.The Government have therefore given urgent consideration tothe means of ensuring that organisations conducting such activities onbehalf of overseas interests are publicly registered,I hope to make a further statement in the near future about theGovernments proposals in detail on this issue.-5-
