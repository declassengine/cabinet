MEETING OF COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERSWORLD POLITICAL SITUATION AND TRENDSSPEECH BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AND COMMON/i/EALTH AFFAIRSExtract from the Minutes of the Second Meeting held atMarlborough House on Tuesday, 7th January 1969 at 3.30 p.m.*      *      *      *MR. STEWART said that he had been asked to give a broad reviewcovering the whole international scene and to be brief.   He would try tosatisfy both requirements;   it might help if he were to avoid dealing withsubjects which would be covered in other contexts - for example economicnatters and Rhodesia.   Nor would he deal with Nigeria, not because it wasnot an important subject but because it was Commonwealth practice thatthere should be no interference in the internal affairs of member countries.He would therefore confine his remarks on this subject to saying that   hewas sure that all present would wish to extend their profound sympathy tothe people of Nigeria in their sufferings and would wish to express thehope that there might be a speedy solution to a problem which was a causeof deep concern to all humanity.Mr. Stewart said it was reasonable for each country to look at theworld situation from its own point of view and he would do this for Britain.It was necessary to keep one&apos;s own anxieties in proportion.   He did not wish to think that he was in much risk of taking a parochial approach asBritain1s interests through trade, historical connections and   responsi-bilities as a permanent member of the Security Council were so far flungthat there was scarcely any part of the world in which Britain couldtruly   deny both a general or particular and immediate interest.It was for this reason that, in both the long and short run, Britain1spolicies wero aimed at reducing tension, achieving peaceful settlementswhere there were disputes and ensuring that necessary changes in response tothe understandable demands for a better life were produced peacefully andnot violently.   Such preoccupations were not peculiar to Britain and couldbe applied to all areas of the world.-1-

Mr. Stewart said that one of the main problems was that of relationsbetween Eastern and Western Europe - between the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) Powers and the Warsaw Pact Powers - in the aftermathof the Czechoslovak crisis.   The Soviet Union as the Head of the warsaw pact Powers was a giant in the world;   action by the Soviet Union helped to shape world policies.   What the Soviet Union had done in Czechoslovakiawas a challenge to human rights and to the principles of the Charter of theUnited Nations.   Their attempt at justification of their actions made quite clear what the real challenge was,   Czechoslovakia, being a member of the warsaw Pact, was a threat to the security of the Soviet Union;   if theSoviet Union was endangered, then this was a threat to all the nations ofthe Warsaw Pact.   Edmund Burke had said that the language of tyranny was always the same - &quot;your liberty is incompatible with my safety&quot;.   russia had said that if Czechoslovakia was free, then Russia could not feel safe.This doctrine constituted a threat to freedom everywhere, and it was forthis reason that Britain had decided that the matter should be takenspeedily to the Security Council.Although the NATO Powers had often spoken of the dangers of communismit had to be recognised that there were many parts of the world where thecommunist ideology had great appeal to those attempting to overcome povertyand social injustice.   The British Government&apos;s argument was not with anideology that sought to improve social justice but with the ideology of aggression.   The vital question was whether communism was directed towardsco-existence or aggression.   It seemed from the example of Czechoslovakiathat it was moving  -towards aggression.   The moral was that policies of peaceful change should take place in a peaceful manner and that countries should so order their affairs that aggression did not profit.   It was forthis reason that the NATO Powers had reviewed and strengthened theirdefences.   At the same time they would continue to seek co-existence withthe Communist Powers;   for example they continued to trade with them.-2-

Where- the Soviet Union was prepared to seek settlements, e .g. mVietnam or the Middle-East, the British Government would he prepared tomeet them.     Britain would continue to work with the Soviet Union and theUnited States of America towards limiting the areas of disagreement.   the door was still open but much would depend on the attitude of the CommunistPowers.   He felt that recently the Soviet Union had shown more signs than previously of seeking settlements.Turning to European integration, Mr. Stewart 3aid that, although thegood of integration - and also of association for the African States - was further away than had previously been thought, it was still an importantobjective of British policy.   This was not only because of the economic advantages to Britain in having the access to, and challenge of, such alarge market, but also because a united Western Europe would be much stronger to check dangers and ensure stability;   this would be of benefitto the world as a whole and to the developing world in particular.   Aprosperous and united Europe would also be able to help developing countries much more than a divided Europe and it would be tho BritishGovernment&apos;s intention to see that Europe was outward looking.Mr. Stewart then discussed the conflict in Vietnam where, he said,the casualties were such as to blunt the senses.   Some commonwealth countries were closely involved in the conflict, and the British Governmenthad a special interest as Co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference.   Hethought that the fact that the United States of America had ceased bombing and that negotiations had begun in Paris were grounds for feeling lesspessimistic than previously - the progress which this represented wouldnot have been expected a year ago.   It should not be too heavily discountedbecause of the fact that the negotiations in Paris were being delayed byprocedural wrangles:   it was a common experience that wrangles of this kindin fact often covered some point of substance which it was important to resolve in order to make progress.   But if progress were to be made, Hanoimust begin de-escalation.   The United States of America whose policy had inthe past been subjected to much criticism, which the British Government didnot accept had made the first step with the cessation of the bombing and inthe British Government&apos;s view it was now up to Hanoi to reciprocate.   Theimportant point was to arrive at a settlement the criterion of which mustbe that the people of South Vietnam must be able to choose their own form-3-

of government.   He recalled a statement by the Prime Minister of Singaporethat &quot;We are aware of the dangers of the escalation of this war and weare also aware of the dangers of withdrawal.   If only communist nations would admit the right of non-communist nations to exist, then we shall beable to make progress&quot;.   The real problem was therefore whether non-communist governments would be allowed to choose their own form of government.The British Government as Co-Chairman was ready to do whatever it could tohelp a settlement.   He hoped too that the International Control commission would be enabled to play a more active role in any settlement.As regards the situation in the Middle East, Mr. Stewart said that inhis view the first thing to be enjoined upon the participants was restraint.They should realise that a policy of continuing reprisals would not achieve the security of the parties who practised them.   They were too quick to useweapons and too slow to put their ideas to the United Nations mediator,Dr. Jarring, and if this were to continue the danger would increase.   he felt that the parties concerned should heed the advice:   &quot;Agree   with thyadversary quickly&quot;.   He was encouraged by the fact that the Soviet union had recently shown fresh interest in this problem and the British G-overnmentwas considering the proposals that the Soviet Union had put fomrard.   Thefour Security Council members had responsibilities in this matter but theycould not impose solutions;   if the parties primarily concerned did not agree, then no solution was possible.   The British Government thereforefelt that the four permament members of the Security Council had a duty to. encourage a settlement through Dr. Jarring and efforts were being concentrated on this,Mr. Stewart said that the world had learned from the situations in vietnam and the Middle East that it was unrewarding to look back on events and to attempt to apportion blame.   If progress were to be made it must beasked what kind of settlement could be achieved given the existingcircumstances.   The world had at its disposal the machinery of the united nations which was better than nothing, even if it was not as good as hadbeen hoped when it was first created.   If further progress were to be madenations must try to make the United Nations work more successfully but theymust be realistic about its potentiality and about what the United Nations

could actually do.   Britain had commented on the passing of ineffectualresolutions which were designed purely for debating purposes and which resulted in a waste of energy and had stressed the importance of effortsheing directed towards reaching solutions.Britain supported processes of poaco-making and upheld the rule oflaw.   Thoy had recently reviewed their reservations to the Charter of theInternational Court of Justice and were looking again at the Law of treaties.   Britain was also interested in United Nations agoncios for economic and technical co-operation and had decided to increase thechanneling   of aid through multilateral agencies, including the WorldDevelopment Bank and the United Nations Development Programme.   But itwould be important that resources should be skilfully utilised and that asmuch money as possible should be devoted solely to development purposes and that no moro than necessary should bo diverted to conferences and thoproliferation of the international staff of agencies.Referring to the problem of disarmament, Mr. Stewart 3aid that therehad been progress but the British Government which had signed and ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty, was anxious to see this Treaty, which had been so patiently negotiated, should be brought into effect.   The dangers ofproliferation were only too obvious and the Non-Proliforation Treaty atleast reduced one danger on that road to proliferation but it would not be effective unless followed by further action such as imposing a ceiling ontho nuclear capacity of the USA and the Soviet Union.   Britain also hopedthat progress would be made with regard to chemical and biological warfare.The Non-Proliferation Treaty was evidence that with patience it v/as possibleto make progress on disarmament.In conclusion Mr. Stewart said that he had covered a number of areas and a number of problems, but perhaps there were some other points whichhe ought to have included or thoro may have been some errors in his ownperspective and he looked forward to hearing the views of others.   he wished to emphasise Britain&apos;s belief in the importance of the united nations, of participating in the development of its aid activities and ofdealing with the gap between rich and poor nations, referred to earlierby the Prime Minister of Ceylon, on which the future peace of the world would depend.-5-

Great changes were taking place in tho world, and with the presenceof communism, they could take a violent and aggressive form.   Wo shouldbe prepared to defend our liberties and to malco liberty and our way of lifosomething which would attract the support and sympathy of mankind.   TI1030wore tasks to which all prosent could address themselves and whioh shouldbe part of tho policies of thorn all.   Tho Commonwealth was an organisation with the advantage of being large enough to sproad all over the world, and yet not so deeply divided ideologically as tho United Nations;   it was a body which could help each member to improve its policies for tho benefitof mankind.   The problem facing govornmonts was to recognise tho neods ofcommon humanity before it was too late to moot them.-*      -x-      *      *-6-

MEETING OP COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERSRHODESIASPEECH BY THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIOExtract from the Minutes of the Fifth Meeting held atMarlborouafa House cm THURSDAY. 9th JANUARY 1969 at 10.30 a.m.*      *      *      *MR. THOMSON said this was a problem that, as the Secretary-general had observed in his Second Report, went right to the heart of all thatwas meant by the multi-racial Commonwealth and it rightly arouoed strong feelings in them all.     The memorandum circulated by the Government ofTanzania reminded them - if they needed reminding - of the strengthof those feelings, and of the importance of this question both forthe future of Africa and for the future of the Commonwealth.As far as the British Government was concerned, the overriding consideration throughout the Rhodesian problem had been to fulfil theirtrusteeship for the largely unfranchised African population of Rhodosia.Their aim had been - and remained - to secure the political rightsof the Rhodesian people a3 a whole, seventeen out of eighteen of whom were Africans.     Whatever differences there might bo round the tablo,all of them shared that common aim.They had had to seek means of doing this in tho face of difficultiesunique in colonial history arising from tho fact that, in Rhodesiaalone among British colonies, Britain had had legal responsibilitywithout ever having had the power on the ground inside Rhodesia toexercise that responsibility.     This was tho key to tho limitations imposed on Britain when they considered how they could beat end thorebellion.

SECRET

He recognised that some sincerely believed that Britain could have broken through these limitations, and assumed direct control over Rhodesia by the use of force, which would in effect mean waging war. He understood, but could not share, the views of those who advocated this and he respected their sincerity. Whatever Britain&apos;s a legal rights, the practical difficulties of a military operation were formidable. The results of such intervention would be doubtful and it would carry a grave risk of escalation. It was always easy to start a war, but it was never possible to say where it would spread or how it could be brought to an end. The consequences of an attempt to solve the problem by war could be disastrous for Rhodesia and Central and Southern Africa as a whole, and for Britain.

With war ruled out, the only alternative to surrender - which would not be contemplated - was to apply economic and political pressure against the regime, with international support, until an acceptable settlement could be reached. When considering the outlines of an acceptable settlement, through sanctions, they had to bear in mind the political impossibility of doing anything to advance the interests of the Rhodesian Africans so long as a settlement had not yet been reached.

They had all learned what sanctions could do and could not do -the hard way, through experience. Surely they now knew enough to make a realistic assessment both of the effectiveness and of the limitations of sanctions. Sanctions, could - and were - creating an economic stagnation which provided a powerful incentive inside Rhodesia to negotiate. They could not, of course, do what a victorious war could do, namely remove the regime and bring about direct British control on the ground in Rhodesia. He was bound to report his firm impression from his own visits to Salisbury that a majority of the Europeans - including those opposed to Mr. Ian Smith - would never voluntarily agree to that. Such a solution could be



SECRET

imposed only by force. It followed that if one rejected war and supported sanctions, one was supporting the search for an honourable settlement by negotiations. The British Government therefore had no apologies to offer for keeping on the look-out for opportunities to negotiate. No other policy made sense of sanctions. But it had to be a settlement that offered Rhodesian Africans guarantees of economic and social advance, and especially of unimpeded progress to majority rule. Above all, it had to be a settlement that had been convincingly shown to have been accepted by the Rhodesian people as a whole. During the preceding summer and autumn there had been some developments in Rhodesia, including changes in the membership of the Rhodesian regime, which had suggested to the British Government that they ought to make a fresh attempt to explore whether the conditions for a satisfactory settlement existed. At the same time there had been indications that, if a settlement could not be reached, there was a danger that the racialism, and the apartheid elements which already coloured the philosophy of the Rhodesia Front, would become sharper and more extreme.

It was in these circumstances that the Fearless talks had been held. He was sure that everyone at the Meeting would have read the Tanzanian Government&apos;s memorandum with the care and close attention which it certainly called for. The memorandum discussed the British Government&apos;s main proposals, and it found in them much to criticise. He would not wish to claim that the Fearless proposals were perfect, still less that they themselves had found them easy to work out or to adopt. The criticisms of these proposals which the Tanzanian memorandum made were familiar ground to Mr. Wilson and himself - not so much because their critics had made them before, as because they themselves had throughout been well aware of those risks and imperfections. It would, he was sure, be generally agreed that the ideal outcome would be steady progress



to majority rule, followed by independence.     But against the rhodesian reality which he had described, it seemed that the obstacles in tho way of achieving that outcome in any reasonable period of time were very groat indeed, if not in fact insuporablo.That was why they had thought it necessary to see whether thorewas some loss than ideal solution which the people of Rhodesia asa whole should be allowed to judge for themselves.     Tho wholeobject of a uonstitutional settlement on Fearless lines would boto secure unimpeded progress to majority rule.     Tho Fearlessproposals incorporated the changes to tho 1961 Constitution whichhad been worked out on board HMS Tiger, though in some cases thosochanges had been set out with greater precision.     In one importantrespect it was true that the Fearless proposals differed from theTiger working document, in that it was envisaged that the tost ofacceptability would take place before a return to legality.     Onthe other hand - unlike Tiger - it would also take place whilesanctions wore still boing maintained.     In some other respects the proposals represented an advance on the Tiger proposals.     Inparticular he wished to stress two now foaturos.     Ono was that thoRoyal Cor.-u.iission set up to carry out the tost of acceptability wouldbo charged with the task of looking into the registration of voters,with a view to clearing away obstacles in tho way of Africanregistration.     another featuro would be tho development of Africaneducation through tho oxpondituro of one hundred million pounds overa period of ton years, of which tho British Government would providehalf.     This proposal would more than doublo the current expenditureon African education and it included a Joint Working Party to becharged with the planning and supervision of tho expenditure involved.It was a central part of tho British Government&apos;s proposals that an impartial Royal Commission should test the acceptabilityof any proposed settlement to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.

Thoir proposals aide no provision for nominees of the Rhodesianregime - as the Tanzanian memorandum had suggested;    tho membersof the Commission would in fact all bo chosen by tho BritishGovernment and would be men of the highest integrity who would beas independent, and ho hoped astute, as any Commission whiohBritish Governments had appointed in Africa or elsewhere in thepast.     It was the Royal Commission, and not the regime, who wouldhave to judge whether the conditions of freedom for peacefulpolitical activity necessary for holding the test had boon achieved.Since the regime would know that thoir only hope for an end of sanctions lay in a favourable report by the Commission, thoy wouldhavo a strong incentive to ensure that those conditions did infact exist.     Secondly, it would bo the Commission^ task to ascertain whether the people of Rhodesia as a whole found tho proposals acceptable.This process would not just be a rubber stamp; tho members of thoCommission would judge for themselves, and roach/their own conclusions.If thoir verdict wont against the proposal, there would be no settlement.There had been suggestions that the Tiger and Fearless safe-guards against retrogressive amendment of the Constitution wouldbe ineffective.     Clearly this view was not shared by Mr. Ian Smith,who had described tho British Governments proposals for a secondsafeguard as a denial of full independence.     This had in fact boena fundamental point of difference between them when he had met mr.. Smith for talks in Salisbury early in November.     There had alsobeen other points of difference.     One had been on the question ofthe jurisdiction of the Privy Council sitting as an ordinary court of law,as opposed to acting as a safeguard against unjust constitutionalamendmonts;   another point had boen that the British Governmenthad refused to accept the regime&apos;s wish to extend the period of aState of Emergency.     Thoy had failed to reach agreement over the composition of legislature, since he could not accept Mr. Ian Smith&apos;s-5-

suggestion that the relative proportion of directly and popularlyelected Africans should be reduced.   There had been disagreement overcross-voting and over the proposed &quot;delimitation&quot; formula, both ofwhich directly affected the timescale for the attainment of majority rule.   He had been unable to accept the extension which Mr. Ian smith had sought of the criteria which the Judicial Tribunal should apply when considering whether detainees and restrictees should be released to take part in the test of acceptability.     The Meeting would note that all those matters on which they had refused to retreat had one thing in common:they concerned the political rights or the political prospects of the african majority in Rhodesia.   There also had been important differencesover the treatment of loyal Rhodesian public servants who had leftRhodesia when the rebellion took place.In a broadcast after their talks in Salisbury Mr. Ian Smith had said that during them &quot;The British Government were obsessed with thequestion of African majority rule, and this dominated all their thinking&quot;.This was certainly true; the British Government could never give up theprinciple of unimpeded progress to majority rule, and until that was accepted in Salisbury, there could never be a settlement.   The BritishGovernment had sometimes been charged with trying to engineer a &quot;sell-out&quot;in Rhodesia.   They could have done that at any time in the preceding threeyears - or before - if that had really been their aim.   But they had refused to give way on the principle of unimpeded progress to majority rule.   They had been ready, despite Britain&apos;s own economic difficulties,to accept costly financial sacrifices in order to implement sanctions, andthey would go on doing as long as it ?;as necessary.   He hoped that theMeeting would recognise these plain facts of the British Government position.No progress had been made towards a settlement since the Salisburytalks had ended; and little had happened inside the Smith regime since then to encourage any hopes that a settlement could be reached.   The gaprevealed by the talks had certainly not been closed since.   They hadpublished&quot; the Fearless proposals and they remained on the table; but therewas no sign that the regime was prepared to take them up.-6-

It was, however, important that they should bear&quot; in mind thesituation inside Rhodesia.   There was ample evidenoo that the Fearlesstalks, and the prospect they held out of on ending to the ij^isse,had given an important impetus to the stirrings of opposition to the illegal regime among the Europeans a3 well as among Africans and others in rhodesia.   He asked the Meeting to bear in mind the fact that theproposals remained on the table had been a stimulus to those politicalgroups which were opposed to the regime, but which had previously been largely quiescent.   A new multi-racial Centre Party had been formed, andhad recently held its first convention in Bulawayo.He did not want to over-emphasise the importance.of the present strength of this opposition in Rhodesia; but it was something new that itexisted.   There had been a resurgence of European criticism of Mr. Smithand his policies in the form of letters to the press, written for thefirst time by people prepared to sign their names and give their addressesIt took courage to stand up and be counted in this way in a country whererestriction on personal liberty had become an accepted fact of life andit was the Fearless proposals that had brought this about.   All this had clearly shalcen Mr. Smith and the Rhodesia Front.    In a national broadcast on 13th December Mr, Smith had devoted most of half an hour to an unprecedented attack on two of his chief critics, Mr. Newson andMr. Campbell,  (one of whom had said earlier.that it was the duty of thebusiness community to beat sanctions), as well as on the Centre party and the Rhode sian newspapers.Meanwhile, although the &quot;Fearless&quot; proposals remained on the table,the British Government&apos;s policy on NIBMR remained unchanged.   There hadbeen no change in the circumstances of the kind they had sometimes spoken of as justifying a review of the statement of British intentions recorded in the communique after the last Prime ministers Meeting.   They had saidmany times, and ho repeated again, that if ever there were such a changein the circumstances, so that they considered that a fresh look should betaken at that question, they would then put the matter before theirCommonwealth partners, and have full consultation with them on it.   Atpresent, however, they were not suggesting any fresh look at that question-7-

Against this background he stressed that the British government regarded the maintenance of comprehensive sanctions a3 essential.   Thounanimous adoption on 29th May 1968 of Security Council resolution no. 253 calling for comprehensive mandatory economic and other sanctionson Southern Rhodesia was on impressive testimony to the refusal of theinternational community to accept tho regime and its objectives for southern Rhodesia.It was too early to say what additional effects the comprehensivemandatory sanctions imposed by the Resolution were having on tho Rhodesianeconomy.     Some Governments had yot to take steps to implement it - forinstance by passing the neoossary legislation.   But, on the whole, progress had not been unsatisfactory.   Up to the present oighty-six Member states had informed the UN Secretary-General of the steps that had been taken to implement the Resolution.   But even when the legislation had been passed itwould take some time for the effects to work their way through.   the british assessment of the effects of sanctions on the Rhodesian economybetween 19&amp;5 and mid-1968 (which had been circulated to tho CommonwealthSanctions Coriimittee) showed a reduction   in por capita income in real terms of some six por cent and a fall in exports to sixty per cent of the1965 level.   This was a picture of a stagnant economy in contrast to an expanding economy previously.   But to some extent tho effect of sanctionswas offset by internal conditions, not least the liquidity position and thefact that money previously used to finance trade wa3 now available for local investment.   There were signs that these factors would no longer boso favourable to the regime in the future.   Indeed, the Chairman of theIndustrial Development Corporation in Rhodesia had warned that in view ofexporting difficulties, the advantages of local investment were diminishingand there was now the risk of inflation.Mr. Thomson said that it would seem that the cumulative effect ofthe various sanctions measures had been to shake the morale of the rhodesian business community and to induce widespread gloom and uncertainty^TThen he first visited Rhodesia after the rebellion in November 1967, thegeneral attitude there, and to some extent in Britain and in othercountries,&quot; v/as that sanctions were a farce.   Many people felt that theywore not working and would never work effectively.   On his visit last november, however, he had gained the very opposite impression; although-8-

sanctions had not yet succeeded in their objective, they were far fromboing the subject of ridicule.   Indeed, it would not be going too far tosay that, but for the effectiveness with which sanctions were working,Britain would never have got the representatives of the illegal regimeto the negotiating table in October/November last year.   He was convinced that after their present experience of sanctions the Rhodesianswould think long and hard before subverting any further settlement andso risking a re-imposition of sanctions.He suggested that the Meeting should consider what could be done to intensify and strengthen the pressure of sanctions.   He did not thinkthat there were any new dramatic initiatives available.   Ideas in thefield of communications and travel had been thoroughly examined, andwritten into the UN Resolution as far as this proved to bo practicable.But one simple way of intensifying sanctions would be for otherindustrialised countries who were subscribing to the Sanctions resolution to do as well as Britain did in implementation of it.   The crucial question for the success of comprehensive mandatory sanctions in 19&amp;9was the willingness of United Nations Member States who were co-operatingover sanctions to close the gaps which existed in their own sanctionsarrangements and through which Rhodesian exports worth some thirtymillion pounds a year were still being imported into their own countries.The Sanctions Supervisory Committee of tho Security Council had animportant role to play in the achievement of this aim.   This Committee,under the able Chairmanship of the distinguished Indian Representative atthe United Nations, had so far hold three meetings and had submitted its first report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.   TheCommonwealth Sanctions Committee in London which had foreshadowed thoUN Committee!s work, and whose report had been circulated to this meeting had also done valuable work and he hoped that the Meeting would agreethat it should continue with its task.As requested in Resolution 253 the British Government had been giving,and would continue to give, the maximum information to the security council.Committee.   They had already submitted five reports to the Committee,two of which had been referred to the Secretary-General for action, andMr. Thomson hoped that other Commonwealth Governments would give the supervisory Committee all possible assistance in response to any requeststhey might receive from it.-9-

In conclusion, ho reiterated that it wa3 the British Government1shope that the continued pressure of sanctions would encourage thosetrends in Rhodosian opinion which he had described earlier and thatovontually wiser counsels would prevail in favour of a settlement thatwould effectively safeguard African political interests, aspirations and rights.   But that stage had certainly not been reachod yet.   Thepresent position could bo summed up as follows.   First, Mr. Smith had rejected the Fearless proposals; secondly, there was no change in britain&apos;s undertaking on no independence before majority rule; thirdly,only if there woro a substantial and guaranteed change in the situationin Rhodesia would tho British Government wish to come back to theirCommonwealth partners on this matter; fourth, meanwhile economic sanctions and all other agreed pressures on Rhodesia v/ould bo maintained andstepped up so far as was practicable.Reiterating that the British Government&apos;s NIBIffl pledge still stoodho said that, if in the British Government&apos;s view, there woro ever asufficient change in the situation to call- for a fresh look at theBritish Government&apos;s undertaking not to agree to independence before majority rule, thon it would enter into consultation on this subject with the other members of the Commonwealth.   But this was not the position that now confronted tho British Government.Mr. Thomson said that he hoped that he had said enough to show that,having ruled out war as a solution, tho British Government was right tomake its latest effort for a negotiated settlement.   But he would like toemphasise that so far as the proceedings of this Conference were concerned,the British Government would not be asking its Commonwealth colleagues to endorse any British proposals for Rhodesia, nor to abandon their ownpositions.   Equally, ho hoped that tho Commonwealth colleaguos would not press the British Government to givo undertakings, or to join instatements, that would conflict with policies to which the BritishGovernment was publicly committed and which it believed were right.   Itwould surely be the reverse of statesmanship to divide the Commonwealthover something that had not happened and indeed that showed no presentsign of happening.   He most earnostly hoped that apprehensions that night never become real would not overshadow the existing co-operationor obscure all the many very real and very important things which they all had in common.-10-

MEETING- OF COMMONVffiALTH PRIME MINISTERSRHODESIASpeech by the Prime Minister at the Eighth Mootingon Friday, 10th January 1969 at 3.00 p.in.

I should make it clear that in this statement I am nottrying to give a Chairman!s summing up.   That is not needed.Every head of delegation has made his or her position crystalclear.   I am speaking now on behalf of the British delegationI regret that 1&quot; shall not be able to be as brief as I shouldhave liked, because a very large number of points have beenmade and they deserve, indeed demand, a full answer.I think all of us would agree that our Debate on Rhodesiahits been in the very highest standard of Commonwealth Confer-ences,   I am grateful for the tributes that have been paid toMr. Thomson for his lucid exposition of the problem as theBritish Government sees it.   And I think we would all agreethat President Nyerere?s opening of the general Debate, likethe memorandum which he circulated to us, combined moderationand comradeship in expression with extreme cogency and force,both in its analysis of the Rhodesian situation and in the clear and unequivocal re-statement of the Commonwealth ideal:a speech marked, as all those which have followed have been,by the deep sincerity which came through.   Strong chargeshave been made, but I will observe President Kaundafsinjunction to take these criticisms in good spirit.There have been wide differences expressed,differences above all of judgment about the path which britain should follow, judgment about what the attitude ofour Commonwealth colleagues should be0   There are nodifferences between us as to our objectives, or about notmerely the non-racial, but, as President Nyerere fairlyreminded us, the anti-racial ideal without which thisCommonwealth has no meaning:   the principles so movinglydescribed by President Kaunda this morning.We all start from the fact of rebellion in Rhodesia.I know how difficult it is - as it has been on previous occasions - for countries who have emerged throughcolonial rule to full sovereign independence, to understandor accept the baffling situation with which we are faced.I can understand all those with lively memories ofBritish troops on their territory in colonial days, mostpith memories, too, of the Royal Navy not very far awaypver the horizon, critical even resentful of the fact thatMs rebellion has not been crushed by force - as many were-ft the old imperial days.   There has even been, yet again,Ipe suggestion that Britain is applying different standardsn this case because the rebels are white.   Let us get thisiear once and for all, since the phrase has been used,lV^yone of us round this table recognises every man, womanchild in Rhodesia of every race as our own kith and kinjpa the words have no other meaning to any of us at all.h , We have said, and this has been quoted round this table,fn+ii    onIy would it be wrong to use force: it would beIS1^impracticable.   The Prime Minister of Barbadosemimed the Meeting that the problem we/are discussing

are discussing goes back 45 years to the granting of localself-government to.the settler minority and with it theauthority they were given to raise their own armed forces under their own control.   Indeed as President Banda rightlyreminded us, the Chartered Company had the right to raisetheir own troops in 1898, 70 years ago.   This was not thesituation in any other British colony since decolonisationbegan.   In all of those, the armed forces were under british command and were available in the last resort for use bythe British Government to ore serve law and order against anywho sought to disrupt that law and order.For the reasons so clearly given by a number of speakers,these conditions do not apply in Rhodesia, have not applied for 45 years, even longer.But since a. number of colleagues, from the speech of the(Leader of the Kenyan delegation very early on to the speechjof the President of Zambia this morning, have strongly presseditheir view that force should be used, X feel it is right thatil should deal with this, I hope once and&apos; for all.First, we believe that it would be wrong to attempt tojsettle this issue by the use of force.   This view waspowerfully put forward by the President of Botswana, and by others.   We believe that the inevitable outcome would be abloodbath in Southern Africa, involving great destruction andiloss of life in Rhodesia, but also going far beyond Rhodesia.But apart from all this the proposal is impractical.Unlike in former colonial territories, there are no Britisijtroops on the ground in Rhodesia.   There is no coastlinethrough v/nich troops could be landed and armies supplied.   the neighbouring countries which have a coastline providing accessjto the sea would be hostile to the enterprise, and are themselves capable of mounting substantial military forces.i     No one here will be in any doubt about the size of theoperation that is propused, for it would have to deal with efficient, highly equipped and well trained army and airfares,supplemented by a largo white citizen force of territorials,Police and others.!     Those forces would be operating on interior lines inprram which would help the defence.lh   It is totally unrealistic to think of landing troops onIhpn h  ? ?0quired by air.   We have Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s memoirsIprj JJS t?lls us that fearing a. very small landing he moved ai^y small number cf lorries to block access,lam^ President of Malawi has realistically described what wou.ineinhho   - hepe were to be a build up over some months inI iyiDOuring countries such as Malawi or Zambia.I ; . /Quite

Quite apart from all these elements, the operation would have to be mounted and carried out, not as in1944 across a vejy narrow channel, but over many thousands of miles.   Even if Britain still had Aden as a militarybase, through sheer distance, through the absence of asea approach, it would be one of the most formidable militaryenterprises ever undertaken, almost urparalleled in militaryhistoryo   I cannot remember our colleagues here suggesting that we should not confer independence on Aden, indeed,they welcomed our action.   But to mount this operation from Britain 6,000 miles away would be impossible, and noone would seriously suggest it.   I must make clear thatno British/Government

Government could or would entertain a proposal of this kind,whether it included aerial bombardment or not, it would inevitably result in a tragic loss of human life.    It wouldalso be totally unattractive in securing the politicalsolution we seek.This brings me to another proposal that has been made.I recognise the strength of feeling which has prompted anumber &apos;of colleagues to suggest that we impose a period of direct rule.     It sounds attractive and logical and indeed it was envisaged by many of us in Lagos.    It is totallyresisted by those who exercise power In Salisbury,     Toimpose it, as Mr. George Thomson pointed out at the beginningof this debate yesterday would mean military action,.the impossibility of which I have tried to demonstrate.    perhaps i could here refer to something said just now by the PrimeMinister of Jamaica, who finds it incomprehensible that weshould on board RAILS. Fearless have failed to provide for direct Involvement of the British Government In theadministration of Rhodesia in the interim period.The question is how this can be enforced.     In the 1966communique it was envisaged this would be secured by negotiation, and that in return sanctions would be ended inthe interim period.    When the Prime Minister of Jamaicacompares this 1966 pre-Tiger proposal with the terms ofFearless, he fails to notice (a) that the Tiger formulainvolved the removal of sanctions at once;   (b) that theFearless formula Involved, the maintenance of sanctionstill after the acceptability test - and indeed beyond.Noithcr the use of force nor direct rule implying force was included in the very powerful speech of the Presidentof Tanzania yesterday nor in his specific proposals whichhave secured the support of so many of our colleagues.I think it is right to address myself to some of hisarguments which I recognise to be formidable, and which havebeen expressed in other, but no less compelling, ways by thePresident of Zambia and the President of Uganda and many others.In his speech President Nyerere drew a sharp distinctionbetween the implications of his proposals and the implications of a settlement based on negotiation providing copperbottomed guarantees of the Six Principles such as Mr. Thomsonoutlined yesterday.    The main difference ho saw was that inthe Fearless proposals, and I quote his words, f&apos;the people would have no choice&apos;&quot;.    He said that if the test ofacceptability of the proposals provided for under the Fifthmnciple gives the answer &quot;Yes&quot; the oppressive Smith regimeHe went on to say that if the people of Rhodesia - andwe are talking about the African population - were to/no, the oppressive regime would remain.What he omitted to say was that If we..adopt Tanzania,^^posals, exactly the same result will ioIIow at any raLerthe immediate future.    The racialist regime, as he called5 will remain in the saddle.And what will follow in its wake, if we have rejectednRrfrvMated solution and adopted the Tanzanian proposals,will stay.

will be, first or all, the hardening of that regime, a nowconstitution Introducing apartheid in now forms - whereastho Fearless proposals, as was pointed out yesterday,would not only prevent apartheid in any form, but wouldinvolve tho dismantling of existing measures of discriminationbased on race and colour.But 1 repeat, and we are all here thinking of thepeople of Rhodesia, that tho Tanzanian proposals would moanintensified repression and apartheid in the very near future.It is wrong to say that the people have no choice.If you rule out force, and I have said force is ruled out, then the whole consequences of theTanzanian proposal and the President&apos;s speech would be tocondemn 4 million Africans to continue to have what he hasrightly described as orroppressive regime, without allowingthose 4 million Africans to consider an alternative.I recognise Lhe doubts of many colleagues about how eff-ective the test of acceptability would be.   I will come tothat question later.I also recognise one very deep anxiety on the part ofmany Prime Ministers:   the anxiety that even if the peopleof Rhodesia express their acceptance of the FEaIujESS proposalsthen after independence any likely Rhodeaian Government wouldrat on the safeguards provided in the FEARLESS document and unilaterally breach the provisions designed to makethe Six Principles effective.   This is a possibility.But I strongly doubt, for the reasons Mr.&quot;Thomson statedyesterday, whether this would be likely.   I have my own viewson what the world could do by way of response, includingthe reimposition of sanctions.But what is, I think, a fallacy is to think that thereis a total difference between a FEARLESS solution anda NIBMR solution in terms of guarantees of its durability,hie Prime Minister of Barbados made a very serious point here.Constitutions based on majority rule, however tightly draftedtrie constitution, have not been immune from change &quot;broughtabout by extra-constitutional moans.   Ho instanced a newneighbour - Panama.   We have a number of countries represented round this table where constitutions providing^majority rule have been changed.   If it is true that the^MhLESS constitution could be changed by skulduggery, it isno less true&apos; that a constitution which gave effect to NIBIJR .could be set aside by a military coup d&apos;ctat.   Arryono is freeJudge which is the more likely - it is a matter of degree -tJ:nass?Gsing the probabilities.   What cannot bo said is thatnn??-rs a difference of kind - not degree - that a BIBMR&quot;ion is inviolable and a FEARLESS ono is not.   Thetut,i0-Y/oulcl equally react to that by the same moans as inlne other case.

First, let me say a word about sanctions.   In answer to a question yesterday I gave my assessment of the effectof sanctions on Rhodesia, and I would feel that what I saidthen has been fully borne out by the contributions of the presidents of two neighbouring countries of Rhodesia, Malawiand Zambia, who from their own knowledge confirm thats anctions are biting, biting indeed quite deeply; although they would both agree that sanctions have certainly not yetled to the political change which would bring about either achange of heart on the part of those currently exercisingoower, or their replacement by those who would be willing,o carry out what all of us regard as necessary.Whatever our differences about some aspects of theproblem (e.g. the use of force, the future of the Fearlessproposals) we are all agreed on the importance of makingsanctions as effective as possible.   This has been referredto by President Nyerere, Chief Jonathan, Prince Dlamini andothers.  We in the United Kingdom are particularly alertabout this.   We have in the Foreign and Commonwealth office a separate department whose sole purpose is to see how wecan best give effect to the United Nations Resolution in ensuring that sanctions are working and in seeking out thosewho are neglecting to enforce them.   When we learn of evasionsjwe immediately make representations to the Government concernedWe are now going to report major evasions that come to ournotice to the UN Committee set up to supervise sanctions against Rhodesia.   It would be useful if all commonwealth governments gave special attention to this task and were tofollow our practice of telling Governments concerned ofevasions and reporting major evasions to the UN Committee.I stress the urgency of making existing sanctions work.The Commonwealth Sanctions Committee exists not only to help with the enforcement of sanctions but to discuss theintensification of sanctions.   We have always been ready togo along with intensification, provided that the test ofany new methods should be their effectiveness and not perhapstheir vindictiveness.   The test is the effect they have inwiodesia not the propaganda effect they have in the worldoutside,  a number have been proposed which, howeversuperficially attractive, lend themselves to obvious and simple evasion.   On this point the British Government arefj one.with our African and other colleagues who have madeuie maintenance, and wherever possible the intensification,sanctions&quot;a key point in their proposals./President Nyerere

President Nyerere, and those who have supportedhim, has centered his proposals on sanctions.   I fully support him, if no honourable solution can bereached.   And as Mr. Thomson pointed out yesterday,there is certainly no sign of any acceptance by theSalisbury regime of the FEARLESS proposals.I agree;   and for that reason we may have to contemplate a long haul, with all that involves.The difference between us, I think, is that many whohave spoken feel that we should choose the long haulwith all that it entails.   The British government feel that, provided that preliminary agreement can bereached on an honourable solution, the&quot; people of rhodesia should be given a chance to choose between thatsolution and the long haul of sanctions with all thatlong haul would mean.It is the Rhodesian Africans who will be calledupon to bear in increasing measure the consequences of sanctions as well as the difficulties.   It means ever-increasing unemployment.   It means more and moreAfrican workers unable to find jobs in the towns,losing, their jobs in the towns and being forced against their will to return to their tribal areas.   With whatwas called yesterday the population explosion in Rhodesiait will mean progressively an almost total famine of jobs for the young African school-leavers.Yes, I repeat we may have to face this if nonegotiated settlement on terms we could accept ispossible.   What I am asking my colleagues is whether we should decide that this&quot;is to be the policy orwhether we should let the Rhodesians choose an alternativesolution if that is possible.Another consideration not only in the context of sanctions, but in the wider political setting of southern africa is the position of the South African Government.I do not believe it would be profitable for me tospeculate about this matter.   &quot;Ye had yesterday and againtoday the realistic assessments made by the President ofBotswana and the President of Malawi from their knowledgeof the situation.

I felt it right to mention some of the consequences ofcommitting ourselves, rejecting all alternatives, to tho longhaul which is involved in the Tanzania proposals.     It may wellbe-that this is what we shall have to face, with all the implications I havo mentioned - and others too.     Tho Britishalternative, while recognising this, is to soe whether anhonourable solution can &quot;be found by negotiation and givingthe final choice to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.That was the purpose of tho negotiations on boardH.M.S. Fearless.     In our view they fully implement tho SixPrinciples wo have laid down.It has boon said, and said rightly, during this mootingthat the Six Principles, and therefore Fearless, on the onehand, and NIBMR (No Independence Before Majority Rule) onthe other, arc inconsistent - indeed contradictory - to one another.    This Is right simply because the first two of thoSix Principles involve continued progress towards majority rule after independence and require guarantees that that progress be not impeded by any post-independence action.This is clearly not the same, as colleagues have rightlyargued, as no independence before majority rule.Lot me say, on this the President of Tanzania has been completely consistent through the years.    At our 1965meeting he fought the whole time against tho Six principles and in favour of NIBMR.Now I come to one of the fundamental propositions thathas boen put before us.    The suggestion that the Fearlessproposal be withdrawn, In contradistinction to our ownannouncement in Parliament, following Mr. Thomson&apos;s talks in Salisbury, that they remain on the table.Those - all of us - who look forward to sanctions having an increasing effect and ultimately leading to a politicalsolution, should recognise that, if wo were to withdraw thoproposals that have boon made, we should be weakening thohand of tho many people in Rhodesia who arc putting pressure on tho regime to change their attitude, indood some of whomEuropean, African, of all races, are organising politicallywith the Idea of replacing the present regime by democraticprocess 0/To withdraw

To withdraw Fearless now would give the racialistextremists what they are looking for, the signal toproceed to harsher measures Of repression and to a fullyracialist constitution embodying apartheid - while at thesame time to withdraw Fearless now would correspondinglyweaken, perhaps destroy, the hand of those who seek to holdthem back.Meanwhile, throughout the period that the proposalslie on the table, and indeed after that, as I will explainin a moment, sanctions remain, and our present position onNIBMR  remains.I have been asked by Mr. Burnham and by others to makequite clear how we would see the timetable af any possiblefurther developments, including the question of consultations with the Commonwealth.    At this moment of course thequestion is hypothetical because, as Mr. Thomson made plainyesterday, there is no indication at all at this moment thatthe Fearless proposals will be accepted.     If, and only if,that situation were to change, then, as I see it, the courseof events might go like this.    There would first have tobe a preliminary agreement with whoever is exercising power in Rhodesia - in the present circumstances Mr. Ian Smith -but this would be ad referendum to the Rhodesian people andsubject to the test of&quot;acceptability.    Part of the agree-raent as envisaged in Fearless would be the broadening ofthe &quot;administration&quot; (I use that word in inverted commas)including the entry of Africans to it.    The next stage would then be for the British Government to appoint a RoyalCommission to carry out a test of acceptability of theproposed terms to the people of Rhodesia as a whole.    TheCommission would consist of people of high integrity andimpartiality, and we should ensure that it would includepeople who by their experience and their qualificationswould be well fitted to judge the situation in terms of african conditions and not just in the atmosphere of theBritish Law Courts.     I think that President Nyerere hasmisunderstood this provision in his own memorandum when hesuggested that they would include, and I ^uote (,rhodesian government nominees&quot; unquote.    This is not so.    They wouldbe appointed by the British Government.The Royal Commission would then go out to Rhodesia and carry out its task, beginning by ascertaining whether theproper conditions for the test existed including the con-aitions detailed in the Fearless proposals for the freedomoi expression for all.    The President of Zambia thismorning said it would be impossible for them to do their task against-the background of the FECKLESS requirements,jjj.he is right, if the conditions for free expression do notwn?^ ^e ^Qyal Commission will so adjudicate.    And that+ x- e ttle end of ^e matter.    Again, if they were to reportuiat the people of Rhodesia as a whole find the FEARLESSwnn?SSK    &quot; or ai]^ olLher proposals - unacceptable, then that5K? re ^at.     In the words of Mr. Burnham yesterday webflail be back to first base./President Kaunda

President Kaunda this morning said that it is an insultto the people of Rhodesia to suggest that they will acceptthe FEARLESS proposals.     If they do not accept it, then thePresident has nothing to worry about.    We go back to thebeginning.    The NIBMR commitment rests where it is today.Sanctions will remain and indeed will remain throughout thewhole operation of the test of acceptability and on to the submission of the necessary legislation to Parliament, if allthe conditions for that submission  ire satisfied.If the people of Rhodesia demonstrate their acceptanceof the terms then, at that stage, as I said yesterday, wewould feel it right to consult with our Commonwealth colleaguesabout the question of the commitment to NIBMR.     I attach thegreatest importance to this consultation.As I explained yesterday in answer to Mr. Burnham and toMr. Trudeau, this would, of course, not be our first approach to the Commonwealth during this whole process.    We should remain in close consultation at every stage, as indeed we have -in the past.There will bo no question of an approach to our commonwealth colleagues about the NIBMR commitment unless- wewere satisfied, and I hope other colleagues will be satisfiedtoo, that the people of Rhodesia as a whole have made itclear, and were seen to have made it clear, that this was what they wanted.I should then have to put to each of my Commonwealthcolleagues this question.     I put it now.     If the people of rhodesia, having had the constitutional proposals put to them,having regard to the consequences of accepting them, andhaving regard also to the consequences of present conditionscontinuing, and from their point of view deteriorating, decide for acceptance.     I must ask are we, any of us outsideRhodesia, to say that they are wrong, that we know better thanthey do what is good for them - we heard phrases this morninggoing very close to saying that - that their future must bedecided by us, and not by them?    Is it that we should then beable to tell the world how clear our consciences are, while they have to pay the price.This morning President Kaunda said, and he brought thispP,ni!fself, that Britain has insisted that the people ofaiiar will no&quot;k De handed over against their will.    Hebdia that ^Britain has insisted that the people of the Falkland; SV111 ,not) De handed over against their will.    Let meSpnL;? him, that the people of Rhodesia will not have aiSnltutlon imposed upon them by legislation of the british parliament, against their will./I should like

I should like to put this to President Kaunda.   I doso in the same spirit in which he put his crtioism of me.He mentioned Gibraltar.   Since I was accused this morning of &quot;inconsistency&quot;, if not worse, I find, with great respectto some of our distinguished colleagues, a certain, in-consistency, between all they have said over these past two clays and the fact that last month in the United Nationstheir Governments, and I refer here only to a small minority of our colleagues, voted for a General Assembly resolutionpurporting to tell Britain that we should hand over,manifestly against their declared will, 23,000 citizens of Gibraltar, fellow Commonwealth citizens, to a country -to Spain - which, shall I say, would not be regarded by manyhere as noticeably liberal or democratic in the terms of thedefinitions of democracy wrii&quot;Gfe-&apos;&quot;-fiave^bedhiusedi,here this week.This vote took place even though 23,000 peoplevoted in a referendum in&apos;the presence of indrpendentCommonwealth observers, who subsequently reported about thecoronet of the referendum to the United Nations.   Of these 3,000 all but 44 in a secret ballot came out clearly infavour of maintaining their connection with Britain andrejecting transfer to Spain.   The moral principles to whichappeal has rightly been&quot;made in this Conference do not depend on the number of people affected.   What it has beenrightly said is right for 4 million in Africa is right for23 thousand in Gibraltar.I repeat, Britain is not prepared to impose apolitical solution in-Rhodesia &quot;against the will of 4 million Africans.   But the votes in the United nations have shown that there are those who are willing to imposean alien political future on fellow commonwealth citizens even against their freely determined wishes.

I end as I began by saying that whatever strong and strongly expressed disagreements there have beenin this debate, there is no difference of objective,no difference in the determination we hold to themulti-racial, the anti-racial, ideals of the Commonwealth.The difference is in methods, in policies.   And it is a difference on an issue which more than one commonwealth prime Minister this week has described as virtuallyinsoluble.   The Prime Minister of Ceylon&apos;s invocationof President Khama&apos;s celestial doodle expressed this mastgraphically,   I could quote a distinguished publicservant of world renown, known and respected by nearly all my Commonwealth colleagues, with forty years of experience in politics, in Cabinets, in high-leveldiplomacy in many parts of the world, who has told methat in those forty years he has never known a problemso complicated, so intractable or by all the standardsto which we are used, so insoluble.   I have tried togive some reasons why apparently simple solutions simplywill not work, simply will not achieve their objective no matter with what sincerity they have been urged around this table.   That applies particularly to force or to directrule, which can only be imposed by force.At the end of the day, as has been freely conceded,this is a British responsibility.   This was stated - i will not weary my colleagues with the exact quotations -in the communiques of the meetings of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in 1964, 1965, at Lagos in 1966 and again inLondon in September 1966.   Reference has been made to thefact that successive British Governments, while making itclear that ours is the responsibility, and that ours willhave to be the final decision, nevertheless recognisethat this issue drives so deep into the whole concept of the Commonwealth and all we stand for that not only at Prime Ministers&apos; meetings but by direct consultation between Prime Ministers&apos; meetings.   We have regarded itas a matter for almost continuous consultation.   just as? in the world context, we recognise this as a matter which concerns the United Nations, even though, as I have said, the ultimate responsibility must be with Britain.I hope I have put clearly this afternoon the natureof the choice - and like so many of the issues that all of us have to deal with day by day, national and international, for us it is a choice between evils, a choice as we see it of the lesser as against the greaterevil - and that is where our final judgments may oiffer.I nave said what the British Government have concluded in the discharge of our trusteeship to over four millionRhodesians.   Others have given their view.   I have said and Mr. Thomson said yesterday that the arguments we are

having maybe dealing with a hypothetical situation.Indeed that appears to be the present situation in salisbury.   But the British Government feel that we ought to put it to our colleagues to say how we feel the situation might develop and -what our course ofaction would then be.1

MEETING OP COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERSWORLD ECONOMIC. SITUATION AND TRENDSSPEECH BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERExtract from the Minutes of the Ninth Meetingheld at Marlborough House onMONDAY. 15th JANUARY 1969 at 10.00 a.a.*:      *       -*       *MR. ROY JENKINS, said that he would talk principally about international monetary matters;   questions on aid and development which featuredgreatly in this Agenda item would be dealt with by the Minister of overseas Development when he spoke later in the debate.     Nevertheless,monetary matters and development assistance were not entirely distinctsince aid depended on a sensible organisation of the world monetary system and an improvement in international liquidity.The last eighteen months had been an exceptionally difficult period, infact - as Iir. Holyoake had described it -* a momentous, perhaps too momentous,period. During that time there had boon devaluation, a gold crisis, disturbances in France and speculation concerning the franc and the doutsch mark.All these problems had provided severe tests for the stability of thointernational monetary system.     He went on to say that there was now a post-Bonn lull since everyone was waiting to see what the policies of the new United States administration would be.The year 1968 had, however, had some good points.     One was thatthe monetary system had survived the great difficulties he had mentioned:this showed the ability and detelimination of governments and bankersto deal with monetary problems in rational ways.     The most important thing to be devised since the Bretton Woods Agreement was the schemefor special drawing rights, which was important not so much in itsquantitivc aspects as in being a rational man-mado improvement in international liquidity.     He hoped that tho scheme would be activated on as siVb3tantial a scale as possible in 1969.

Turning to the Basle Agreement, he said the attitude of commonwealth countries had been most helpful and realistic.     Canadd had put upa credit and it had been possible to negotiate agreements with countriesholding sterling which had added greatly to the underlying strengthof sterling.     Where bilaterial agreements had been negotiated theyhad been generalised so that there was equality of treatment for commonwealth countries.     These arrangements represented a further stage in the evolution of the sterling area and were fully consistent with itsprinciples.     The baekgrotmd to the Bonn Conference was difficult butthe results should have convinced everyone that the deutsch mark wouldnot be revalued;   all parties in the German Government had agreed withthe maintenance of this position.     One of the beneficial results ofthe Conference was the removal of the fear of speculation.Paradoxically, 1968 was also a good year for the growth of world production and trade.     Demand in the United.States and Britain grewfaster than expected;   in the case of the United States, faster thanthe authorities would have wished.     Other industrial countries, suchas Germany and Japan, had all shown substantial growth.     It seemedas if growth in 1969 would be somewhat slower than in the past eighteen months,particularly if the new United States administration adopted an anti-inflationary policy.     Nevertheless, he was not expecting a recessionbut merely a slackening in tho growth rate.     The deficit countries,Britain and America, had had to check their imports and the surpluscountries, especially Germany and Italy, should recognise their responsibilities and play their part in helping to solve the problem by increasing their imports.     He was sure both countries were aware of their responsibilities.Outlining the progress of the British economy since devaluation,Mr. Jenkins said that there had been a steady improvement in the Britishbalance of jnynents, which of course was the crucial object of hisGovernment&apos;s policy, and which they were determined to press to a successful conclusion.     The British people had accepted, if not enthusias-tically, considerable burdens over the last fourteen months.Dr. Williams had already expressed his appreciation of the scope of the budgetary measures taken by Britain.-2-SECRET

At the tine of devaluation Britain had taken severe restrictivemeasures to cut consumption, and this had boen followed in January 1968,by severe cuts in the planned growth of public expenditure at tho expenseof many hopes for the expansion of the public services.     The defencecuts had been part of this programme and had been unwelcome to manyrepresented at the Meeting.     Tho March 1968 budget had imposed nowtaxation increases of  900 million, which was the largest peace timebudget and probably the most severe increase in monetary terns in citherwar or peace.     It had been made clear to the British people that Britainfaced two hard and difficult years before the growth in public and private consumption could be allowed to match the growth of industrial production.Britain would make all efforts, and part of this was the tough incomes policy, to put right its balance of payments and safeguard   sterlingat its new parity, which he was convinced was fully competitive.Despite these earlier measures the economy required constant management and certain adjustments from time to time and, as he had said in thoHouse of Commons, could not be left on automatic pilot.    For example,in the Autumn of 1968, he had tightened hire purchase restrictions andimposed further indirect taxation increases, both of which were necessaryin the light of the trade figures and the prevailing international monetarysituation.     At the same time, the Government had introduced the importdeposit scheme, which was only intended to be temporary, but was by far the least damaging measure to Britain&apos;s trading partners in dealing withthe high level of British imports.     Food 3tuffs, fuol3 andraw materials were excluded, so that most developing countries would find the majority of thoir exports to Britain were excluded from the operationof this Scheme;   for example, 90 per cent of Caribbean exports remainedoutside the Scheme.     Certain special measures wore taken to exclude fromthis Scheme materials, which had been included in the Scheme for importsurcharge, in order to help developing countries;   it had, however, notbeen possible within the framework of the present Scheme to make exceptionsfor developing countries as suoh without making tho schemo unacceptableinternationally.-3-SECRET

The health of the British balance of payments was crucial to thewhole sterling area, and Britain intended to continue these policiesuntil results were achieved.     Such results were now beginning to show,though more slowly than some had hoped or expected.     nevertheless,there had been a steady improvement in britain&apos;s trade position sincemid-1968, though there might still be erratic variations in certainmonths.     Britain was, however, moving towards a substantial surplus whichthey were determined to achieve and sustain.     Britain needed an export-led growth in order to repay its debts, reconstitute its reserves, andplay a full part in providing aid for developing countries.Britain entered 1969 in a state of reasonable but cautious confidence.Britain intended to press on with proposals for the activation of SpecialDrawing Rights (SDR).     There were, no doubt, other reforms in the inter-national monetary system to be urged forward, but he was sceptical ofthe value of another Bretton Woods at this time (as Dr. Williams had proposed).     If such a conference were to take place it could do more harm than good as it would encourage speculation.     Bretton Woods had takenplace at the end of the last war when foreign exchange markets had notexisted in anything like their present form.     In order to hold the BonnMeeting in November, it had been necessary to try (not wholly successfully) to close tho main foreign exchange markets of the world for throe days, and itwould no doubt require a closure of the market for several weeks if anotherBrotton Woods-type conference was to be hold, especially when one consideredthat tho former had involved only ton countries and the latter would involveover one hundred countries.     The adveneo publicity to bo expected in anotherBretton Woods Conference would, if nothing emerged from it, worsen thoposition mare than if tho Conference had never been mooted.The dilemma of holding another Bretton Woods was   that there wasa need to be confident of success before it met;   they could not afford the speculation which was bound to develop, both before and during themeeting, without closing monetary markets, which in itself would be damaging to world trade as the period required would have to be impossiblylong.-4-

The present system, had worked reasonably well during the lasttwenty years.     Improvements to it must be carried out by more cautiousmethods than a large conference with all its attendant publicity.Such a conference would only help if it were called to ratify decisionspreviously worked out by governments themselves through existing channels,such as the IMF4     Tho existing system was capable of adapting itselfto changes as tho events of the last year had shown, for example, thedevelopment of the SDR Scheme.     Commonwealth governments had played a vital rolo in this, and he pointed out that Commonwealth finance ministers at their Mooting had confirmed support for an early activationof SDR.Some Commonwealth countries had expressed disappointment that ithad not been possible to achieve some link between SDR and aid.     britain would like to see this link as part of the scheme and had taken thisview in discussion leading up to the signature of the agreement.     Butthe link had simply not boon negotiable and it would not have been possibleto bring tho Stockholm Conference to a successful conclusion if countrieslike Britain, the United States of America and Canada had insisted onthe link being included.     The choice had been between no link or no scheme.     Tho benefits to developing countries from the Scheme wore not so direct and obvious, but they were real, as anything which increasedworld liquidity and the confidence of developed countries to expandworld trade was to tho benefits of devolopizig countries,,He did not take tho view that SDR or improvements in world liquidityshould in any way obviate the responsibility of Britain to end itshistory cf deficits.     This was an essential and crucial objective and failure to achieve it would set back surplus countries in their considerationof schemes to help improve world liquidity.     Britain&apos;s measures were of very considerable importance from tho point of view of Britain playinga larger role in assisting the developing, countries;   a necessity of which britain continued to be very conscious.*      *      *      *-5-
