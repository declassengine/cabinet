THE REFORM OF INDUSTRIAL relations . There are necessarily conflicts of interest in industry. The objective of our industrial relations system should be to direct the forces producingconflict towards constructive ends. This can be done by the right kindof action by management, unions and Government itself. This white paper sets out what needs to be done.2. Our present system of industrial relations has substantial achievementsto its credit, but it also has serious defects. It has failed to prevent injustice,disruption of work and inefficient use of manpower. It perpetuates theexistence of groups of employees v/ho, as the result of the weakness of theirbargaining position fall behind in the struggle to obtain their full share ofthe benefits of an advanced industrial economy. In other cases management and employees are able unfairly to exploit the consumer and endangereconomic prosperity. It has produced a growing number of lightning strikes and contributed little to increasing efficiency. There are still areas of industrywithout any machinery for collective bargaining at all. Radical changes are needed in our system of industrial relations to meet the needs of a period of rapid technical and industrial change.3. Until action is taken to remedy these defects, conflict in British industry will often be damaging and anti-social. The Government places the following proposals before Parliament and the nation convinced that they are justified on two main grounds. First, they will help to contain the destructiveexpression of industrial conflict and to encourage a more equitable, orderedand efficient system of industrial relations, which will benefit both thoseinvolved and the community at large. Second, they are based on the belief that the efforts of employers, unions and employees to reform collective bargaining need the active support and intervention of Government.4. The reasons for the first of these propositions must emerge as theGovernments proposals are stated and explained in turn. But there isneed, at the outset, to say something about the past and future role ofGovernment in industrial relations.THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN INDUSTRIAL relations. The State has always been involved in the process of industrial relations. It has always had to provide a framework of law for dealing withthe activities of individuals and groups struggling to advance and protect their interests. The growth of employer power in the 19th Century challengedthe adequacy of the conventional doctrine of &quot; laissez faire &quot; and highlightedthe need for workers to combine in their own defence. The result was thegrowth of trade unions which led Parliament and the courts to examine howfar the law should tolerate coercive action in &quot; restraint of trade&quot; by employers or trade unions and how far it should seek to defend the widerinterests of the community. In the ensuing debate on the principles to beapplied, two conflicting philosophies emerged in reports of successive Royal
Commissions and inquiries. The first was the doctrine of &quot; collective laissezfaire &quot;. Trade unions should be accepted as lawful and given the right toorganise. The State should recognise the right to strike and the right to bargain collectively to improve wages and conditions. But so long as the&quot; rules of the game &quot; were roughly fair to both sides the State should not be concerned with its consequences. In effect the Government should provide facilities to help the parties agree, but should not interfere to impose asettlement upon them. It is worth stressing that it was never any part ofthis view that industrial relations in general or trade unions in particularshould be outside the law; it was merely felt that so far as possible the law should not interfere with the day-to-day results of collective bargaining.6. But from the very beginning of this debate there was an alternativeview: namely, while the periodic &quot; re-adjustment&quot; of bargaining powerbetween the two sides was an essential part of the Government^ role, it wasnot in itself sufficient. The State also had to act at times to contain thedisruptive consequences of the struggle for those not immediately affected especially if non-intervention was likely to result in widespread damage tothe interests of the community at large. Linked with this argument to an increasing extent was a related one: Governments should intervene still furtherif it could be shown that certain important economic or social objectives werenot sufficiently furthered or were frustrated by collective bargaining.7. Within the last hundred years, an example of Government actionto contain the effects of disruption was sections 4 and 5 of the Conspiracyand Protection of Property Act 1875. This was designed to limit the free-dom to strike where it was likely to have undue effects on essential services or life and property. The Truck Acts, the creation of Wages Councils, andthe Fair Wages Resolutions were examples of intervention to advanceobjectives which could not at the time be met by collective bargaining.8. More recently intervention has become much more necessary and pro-nounced. The State has laid down minimum periods of notice in contracts of employment in the Act of 1963. Action has been taken to secureimprovements in the quality and use of labour by creating Industrial TrainingBoards and the Redundancy Payments Scheme, both financed by com-pulsory levies on industry. The Government has increasingly had to play apart in the industrial relations of the motor industry. Far-reaching reformshave been initiated in the industrial relations system of the docks.9. As a result of these and other developments both management andtrade unions have come to accept, and in many ways positively to welcome,Government involvement in industrial relations that in practice goes far beyond the confines of the theory of non-intervention by the State. Whileoften still voicing the doctrine of non-intervention, managements and unions have entered into a positive and mutually beneficial partnership with theState to secure common objectives. Indeed in their evidence to the RoyalCommission on Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations, and in the irrepresentations to Government, bodies representing both employers andtrade unionists have urged further intervention and involvement at leastwhere they see it as advantageous to them. Demands have been made by employers for new laws to discourage strikes; requests have been put
forward on behalf of trade unions for minimum wage legislation and Govern-ment action to force employers to recognise trade unions. In short the doctrine of non-intervention is not, and never has been, consistently preached.The need for State intervention and involvement, in association with bothsides of industry, is now admitted by almost everyone. The question thatremains is, what form should it take at the present time?THE PRESENT STATE OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS10. The answer to this question is to be found in an analysis of thepresent state of industrial relations in Britain. The report of the RoyalCommission on Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations contains theessential material to enable both the Government and the country to decide what should be the shape of industrial relations in the 1970s.11. It shows that at its best our industrial relations system works well,and that many criticisms which have been made of it are largely unjustified.There are many companies, and even industries, in which industrial relations were well conducted. In general, managers who recognise and deal with union officials and shop stewards testify to their reason and good sense. Similartributes to managements are made by many union officials and shop stewards.Research for the Royal Commission revealed few signs that trade union members were dissatisfied with their unions. Most union officials said theyappreciated the work of shop stewards and the relationship between themand their stewards appeared to be good.12. It is not even true to say that the Royal Commission^ inquiries and surveys reveal a state of general complacency and disinclination to change.Managements have in recent years successfully carried through some remark-able experiments in the field of collective bargaining many of them con-nected with the growth of productivity agreements. Changes are takingplace in trade union organisation. Indeed, there has probably never been a time when more amalgamation schemes and mergers have been underdiscussion by the trade unions of this country. On both sides of industrythere is a growing awareness of the need for change, and many managers andtrade union officials are making strenuous efforts to bring this about. Themeasures proposed in this White Paper should not be interpreted as acriticism of their efforts. The Governments proposals are designed to assistthe forces of change and to direct them into the most constructive channels.13. Nevertheless our present system of industrial relations has seriousdeficiencies: both from the point of view of the community and of theindividual employee. The disparity of power between employee andemployer, though much reduced, still persists, particularly in areas wheretrade unionism is weak. Lock-outs are now almost unknown, but in their place has come the new threat of widespread redundancies as industry is re-structured and mergers multiply. New disparities of power have grownup between one group of employees and another. For example, imperfectcompetition in many industries may enable unions and employers to combineto exploit their market power at the expense of other members of thecommunity.
14. Again the growing interdependence of modern industry means thatthe use of the strike weapon in certain circumstances can inflict disproportionate-tionate harm on the rest of society. The right of an employee to withdraw his labour is one of the essential freedoms in a democracy and the existenceof this right has undoubtedly contributed to industrial progress and to thedevelopment of a more just society. But it is also true that in certainsituations today strikes by groups in key positions can damage the interestsof other people so seriously including the interests of other trade unionists that they should only be resorted to when all other alternatives have failed.15. The deficiencies of Britain&apos;s system of industrial relations are reflected in the character of our strike problem. It is true that, in comparison with many other countries, Britain&apos;s strike record, if measured by the number ofworkers directly involved and the number of working days directly lost, is relatively good. But this does not mean that the industrial effects may notbe more serious. As the Donovan report pointed out: &quot; That tally gives avery imperfect measure of the economic consequences of a strike.&quot; Corn-pared with other countries we have a large number of strikes in relation toour work force and in industries other than coalmining the number of strikeshas gone up considerably in recent years (see Appendix 2). The typicalBritish strike is unofficial and usually in breach of agreed procedure.Although it is often soon over, it comes with little warning and the dis-ruptive effect can be serious. It is commonest in a small number of industries such as motor assembly and components, the docks and ship-building. Otherindustries often have long periods without strikes, but they may sufferindirectly because of a strike at a key point of their supplies or services.This type of strike can cause far-reaching dislocation of work and at timestakes place in complete disregard of its consequencies for the community.These indirect effects are not reflected in the strike statistics.16. Finally, our organised system of collective bargaining has not got togrips with a number of economic and social problems. As the DonovanReport indicated, it has often failed to provide for effective and acceptablecollective bargaining arrangements covering matters of common concern to employees and employers. Little has been done to reform outdated and generally condemned procedural agreements such as those now existing inthe engineering industry. Too often employees have felt that major decisionsdirectly concerning them were being taken at such a high level that thedecision-makers were out of reach and unable to understand the humanconsequences of their actions. Decisions have been taken to close downplants without consultation and with inadequate fore-warning to the employees. Outdated social distinctions between hourly-paid employees and diose on staff conditions have been perpetuated. At the same time,some employers have opposed and obstructed the spread of collective bar-gaining to new sections of the work force, especially those increasing numbers employed in &quot; white-collar &quot; jobs. Unions too have often failed to involvetheir members closely enough in their work, or to tackle with sufficienturgency the problems of overlapping membership and unnecessary rivalry,which always diminish their effectiveness and sometimes their reputation.Many employers&apos; relations with unions have been greatly complicated by thelarge number of unions that may have members in a single factory.
17. The combined effect of such defects in our system of industrial relations is to increase the feeling of many employees that they have no realstake in the enterprise for which they work. There are of course other factorstoo. Britain is passing through a period of rapid technological change.New processes and methods of production are combined with changingpatterns of company ownership and management structure. Established jobsand ways of work are disappearing to be replaced by unusual and unfamiliartasks in surroundings often equally strange. This naturally reinforces feelings of insecurity among employees and even management itself and results inlack of co-operation and resistance to change, especially if systems fordealing with legitimate grievances and problems of all kinds do not adaptthemselves to the demands placed upon them. Efficiency suffers and thecommunity pays.18. Yet there can be no reversal of the forces of change. On the contrary,the Government has taken action to accelerate change. This is necessary ifBritain is to survive and prosper. But it means that we must make sure that employees have the opportunity to participate in influencing the directionof change, that we must overhaul arrangements for dealing with the conse-quences of change as they affect all who work in industry, and that we mustremedy the defects described in the preceding paragraphs. This requirespolicies to secure four objectives:(i) the reform of collective bargaining ;(ii) the extension of the role and rights of trade unions;(iii) new aids to those who are involved in collective bargaining; and(iv) new safeguards for the community and individuals.The next four sections of this White Paper explain the major measures proposed by the Government to deal with each of these questions.THE REFORM OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING19. Collective bargaining is essentially a process by which employees take part in the decisions that affect their working lives. If it is carried on byefficient management and representatives of well organised unions, negotiations-ing over a wide range of subjects, it represents the best method so far devisedof advancing industrial democracy in the interests of both employees and employers. It offers the community the best opportunity for securing wellordered progress towards higher levels of performance and the introductionof new methods of work.20. Yet as the Donovan Report has shown this is far from being thesituation in the economy as a whole. Even where collective bargaining iswell developed it has many defects. Very often there is a marked differencebetween the formal collective bargaining system and what actually happens.It is often supposed that formal industry-wide negotiations are the onlyimportant method of collective bargaining ; but in practice an increasingamount of bargaining, and an increasing proportion of the wage packet, issettled outside the &quot;formal system &quot; by informal understandings and arrange-ments between shop stewards and managers or foremen at work-place level.Yet this concentration on &quot; informality &quot;, and the network of shop floorarrangements and understandings that result from it, lead to serious problems.9
Few clear principles and standards are developed to settle shop floorgrievances. Management and unions tend to yield to immediate pressures,especially when applied by minority groups who can exploit their strategic position at the expense of their fellow trade unionists. Anomalies develop in wage payment systems. There is no stable or equitable relationship between payment and performance. Those who are dissatisfied strike in breach of agreed procedures for dealing with their grievances which areineffective and do not deal rapidly and equitably with the problems of the shop floor.21. In some industries and firms, managements and unions have made ajoint effort to keep their procedures for negodations and for handling griev-ances under review, and have made changes in them to remedy defects and tomeet today&apos;s needs. But in too many cases the procedural arrangements arestill seriously inadequate. Many were designed at a time when procedures for negotiation were needed only at industry level, while all that was necessary at company or plant level was a procedure for resolving disagreements overthe interpretation of the industry-wide agreement. Many procedures are too slow, too informal and too uncertain to be fully effective in the face of rapid technical change. The people who have to work the procedures, on both management and union sides, often have inadequate training. Whileprocedures must operate flexibly to deal with the wide variety of demands upon them, it does not follow that in modern conditions flexibility can best be achieved by informality and complete reliance on good relations. Whenemployees do not have a clear idea what procedures require in givencircumstances, they are likely to ignore them as irrelevant. Flexibility canusually be best obtained by designing formal procedures which can workflexibly.22. The lack of comprehensive, mutually agreed procedures encouragesarbitrary behaviour by managements. Indeed, many of the &quot; wildcat&quot;strikes which cause so much concern today are the result of managementsmistaken belief that it has the right to impose changes on its workpeoplewithout full and adequate consultation and then invite them to go through&quot; procedure &quot; afterwards for the remedy of any grievances. This is to showa complete misunderstanding of what good procedures should be designed todo, namely, to secure the co-operation of employees through their representa-tives in the changes that affect their working lives. Until this approach is adopted there can be no fundamental solution to the problem of unofficial strikes.23. Most important of all, perhaps, the disparity between the formalsystem and the realities of shop floor life is often not fully appreciatedor even understood by senior management in the enterprises where it occurs.As the Donovan Report said, the assumptions of the formal system stillexert a powerful influence over men&apos;s minds and prevent the developmentof effective and orderly methods of collective bargaining. Too often seniormanagement continues to regard industrial relations as a matter for employers&apos; association officials or lower levels of management, rather than as one of its primary responsibilities. On the union side many nationalleaders continue to uphold the assumptions of increasingly ineffectualindustry-wide negotiating structures.io
24. There is room for debate about how far this description of thedecay of our formal industry-wide system of collective bargaining appliesfrom industry to industry. It is obviously true of large parts of private industry. Some firms in these industries have taken action to tackle thesituation, and thus thrown into sharper relief the problems elsewhere intheir industries. In most of the public sector, including national andlocal government service and the nationalised industries, and in a fewindustries in the private - sector for example electrical contracting effective industry-wide collective bargaining still exists. There, actualwages and conditions continue to be settled by the national officials whobargain on both sides. There is no equivalent of the disordered pay structures,or the chaotic and inflationary shop floor pressure, that is so pronounceda feature of industries like engineering.25. However, it does not follow from this that collective bargaining insuch industries cannot be improved. Their procedures may not extend toall the questions that ought to be covered. For instance, there may be no adequate procedures to deal with redundancy, or the effects of introducingnew machinery and methods of work. Shop stewards may have few formalrights to represent their members. There may be no proper agreement todeal with disciplinary questions, including dismissal.26. There is therefore need for the reform of collective bargaining bothwhere industry-wide bargaining has become remote from the major issues and where it still determines actual pay and conditions. What can bedone to accelerate reform?27. The major responsibility for solving the problem lies with manage-ment. Given the right help and encouragement most unions will readilyrespond to proposals for improving the machinery of collective bargaining.The initiative must lie with employers, and notably the boards or chiefexecutives of undertakings, for they are best placed to set in train the detailed study of existing systems and their defects and to make the rightkind of positive approaches to trade unions. The best way forward willoften be the negotiation of formal, comprehensive and authoritative company or factory agreements. Negotiation at these levels is likely to secure,through a single negotiating body instead of piecemeal negotiations, theintroduction of adequate procedures for the settlement of disputes, andthe extension of collective bargaining into other matters which directlyconcern employees, such as discipline and redundancy arrangements. Inthe context of such agreements, a good management will find itself able to manage its undertaking more effectively, and good trade union representa-tives will be better placed to promote the interests of their members withoutunnecessary conflict between different groups.28. The Government welcomes the readiness expressed by the C.B.I.and the T.U.C. in their joint statement of 23rd October 1968 to askemployers&apos; associations and trade unions to examine the situation industry by industry and to ask managements in consultation with the unions to review industrial relations in their undertakings. Such re-appraisals are essential if the defects of collective bargaining are to be remedied.   They11
should be prompt and thorough. There is a special need lor them in industries where the defects described in the Donovan Report are apparent.The Government will follow closely the progress of these reviews, both atcompany and industry level. If assistance is needed, the Manpower and productivity Service of the Department of Employment and Productivity(D.E.P.) will be available to help.29. The Government urges employers, in the course of these reviews, toexamine fully and sympathetically the possibility of removing unnecessary and outdated distinctions between &quot; staff&quot; and other employees. These aresustained chiefly by tradition and inertia, and cause much unnecessaryill-feeling. Some large employers have already found it possible to abolishthem. The Government suggests that the T.U.C. and C.B.I. should jointlyencourage the abolition of these distinctions throughout industry, and make arrangements to keep the matter under review.30. The Government broadly accepts the views of the Royal Commissionconcerning the principles which should inform a satisfactory set of agree-ments. So far as possible agreements should be clear and precise. Theyshould assist the negotiation of pay structures that are comprehensive, fair, andconducive to efficiency. They should also provide a link between pay and theimprovement of performance or results within the individual plant or com-pany. The introduction of such agreements will often provide a suitable opportunity for negotiations over restrictive practices. Employers should alsodevelop, and discuss with employees&apos; representatives, clear policies on suchmatters as recruitment, promotion, training and retraining.31. It is essential to provide rules and procedures for the rapid and effective settlement of grievances and other issues. When procedures are agreed which meet these criteria, and thus avoid the danger of lengthydelays, provision should be made for previous conditions to be maintainedwhile any matter is being considered in accordance with the procedure.There should also be rules and procedures governing disciplinary matters,including dismissal, and agreed procedures for the handling of redundancies.Consideration should be given to the inclusion of provision for a quickrecourse to arbitration in grievance procedures if agreement is not reached at the early stages of the procedure. There should be provision for important matters to be raised with the highest levels of management.32. Agreements should cover the numbers and constituencies of shop stewards ; provide for facilities for them to consult their members and tonegotiate with management; include suitable arrangements for shop stewardsto have day release with pay during training, and to be paid for work done as a shop steward in working hours ; provide for reasonable access for trade union officials ; facilitate the holding of necessary union elections and, if the union wishes, the deduction of union dues from pay. Manage-ments should make available to employees&apos; representatives the informationnecessary for them to do their work.
A Commission on Industrial Relations33. The Government, too, through the work of the Department of Employ-ment and Productivity, shares the responsibility of bringing about the neces-sary changes in our system of industrial relations. This has caused it to expand and extend its existing arrangements for conciliation and to create a Manpower and Productivity Service. But as the Donovan Report pointedout, and as both the T.U.C. and the C.B.I. recognise, there remains a majorgap in the public apparatus for change. There is no institution primarily con-cerned with the reform of collective bargaining. This is why the Govern-ment proposes to establish a Commission on Industrial Relations (C.I.R.).34. The relationship between the D.E.P. and the C.I.R. will be close and continuous. The C.I.R. will however be a completely independent body and will be free to form its own views on the questions with which itdeals. It will work on references by, and report to, the Secretary of Stale,and its recommendations will be followed up by the D.E.P.&apos;s manpower and Productivity Service. In these respects (he C.I.R.&apos;s relationship withthe D.E.P. will be similar to that of the National Board for Prices and incomes (N.B.P.I.). But the C.I.R. is needed to do a different job, and itsmethods of operation and therefore its relationships with both sides ofindustry will be different from those of the N.B.P.I.35. The C.I.R. will be concerned with ways of improving and extendingprocedural arrangements, for example how to promote suitable company-wide procedures in important firms, how to develop acceptable rules governingdisciplinary practices and dismissals, how lo encourage effective and fairredundancy procedures, how to bring shop stewards within a proper frame-work of agreed rules in their firm, and how to ensure that they are provided with the right kind of facilities to do their job. To decide on the adequacy of existing arrangements for dealing with such matters, the C.I.R.will have to find out about many aspects of industrial relations in particular industries and firms for example, the arrangements for negotiation overproductivity and wages, the causes of recent strikes, and the rate of labourturnover. It will be authorised to obtain such information as is necessaryfor its work. The C.I.R., unlike the N.B.P.I., will not have the responsibilityfor applying prices and incomes criteria to particular disputes or settlements;nor will it be directly concerned to secure improvements in productivity.36. The C.I.R. will also be required, by reporting on references by theSecretary of State, to tackle other problems that are not now the direct responsibility of any public agency, so that its work will represent a novelextension of public involvement in industrial relations in this country. Forexample, it will investigate trade union demands for recognition ; encouragereforms in trade union structure and services ; examine cases where com-panies or trade unions report failure to negotiate satisfactory agreements ;and report on other questions related to its responsibilities, such as the effectiveness of existing procedures in an industry or part of an industry. Itwill be asked to give general advice to the Secretary of State from time totime on the reform of the industrial relations system, and to report periodicallyto Parliament.
37. Its contacts with trade unions, employers&apos; associations and individual firms will be regular and continuous. It will need to gain their confidence and co-operation while remaining an independent and candid critic. Itwould be handicapped if at the same time it had the responsibility ofgiving legally binding rulings on such questions as trade union recognition,inter-union disputes, whether employers and unions are bargaining in good faith, or restrictive practices. A C.I.R. with such responsibilities would havea completely different character, and its non-legal recommendations would lose weight by comparison. For this reason the Government does not propose to give the C.I.R. itself any legal sanctions, apart from authority toobtain information. It will look to the C.I.R. to be a disseminator of goodpractice and a focus for reform by example. The Government expects thatthe work of the C.I.R. will help to bring about a general move towards the reform and restructuring of collective bargaining arrangements, not leastbecause it will be able to suggest to the parties mutually beneficial improve-ments from practices which have been tried and found to work in otherindustries and undertakings.38. The C.I.R. will have a full-time chairman and several full-time or part-lime members with relevant experience. It will be establishedinitially as a Royal Commission, to enable it to begin work without delay.Provisions to put it on a statutory basis will be included in an industrial relations Bill which the Government intends to present to Parliament assoon as possible.Registration of Agreements39. The Government will also set up a register of collective agreements,which will be kept by the D.E.P. This will emphasise to managements their responsibility for the efficient conduct of industrial relations in their under-takings, and will provide information which the D.E.P. and the C.I.R.will need in implementing the policies set out in this White Paper. Registra-tion will at first be voluntary but the Government intends to include provisions in the Industrial Relations Bill to give it statutory backing.Consultations on the scope of voluntary registration are now in progress with the C.B.I., T.U.C. and nationalised industries. Voluntary registrationwill include:(I) Procedures  lor  the determination  of terms and conditions  ofemployment.(2) Procedures for the settlement of grievances and disputes.(3) Arrangements for consultation concerning matters not covered by negotiation.40. The Government will shortly invite all companies and other under-takings employing more than 5,000 to register their procedure agreements and arrangements with the D.E.P. or to inform the D.E.P. of the absenceof such agreements and arrangements. Some of the most serious problemsof industrial relations are however found in firms of smaller size. Inappropriate cases the D.E.P. will therefore ask them to give information about their procedure agreements and arrangements. The scope of the eventual statutory requirement to register, and within it the subjects for
registration, will be decided in consultation with industry in the light of experience with the voluntary system.41. The Manpower and Productivity Service of the D.E.P. will use the registered agreements to ascertain where improvements are most needed and where advice will be most helpful, and will take appropriate follow-upaction. Special attention will naturally be paid to companies making &quot; nilreturns&quot; for all or parts of their undertakings, or whose procedure agrec-ments seem seriously inadequate.Collective Agreements and the Law42. The present legal position is that an individual employer and a tradeunion can, if they so decide, make a collective agreement between themlegally binding. However, because many employers&apos; associations fall withinthe legal definition of a trade union, collective agreements between themand trade unions happen to be subject to section 4(4) of the Trade UnionAct 1871, which for other reasons precludes the direct legal enforcement of agreements between trade unions. Agreements between trade unions and such employers&apos; associations therefore cannot be made directly legally enforceable even if both parties should want this.43. There are those who argue that the besit way to reduce the numberof unofficial strikes is to make collective agreements legally enforceable.Faced with the fact that individual employers and unions who can alreadyenter into legal contracts do not do so, they maintain that the answer is to change the bias of the law so that collective agreements becomelegally binding unless the parties specifically state their intention lo thecontrary. This would not only be ineffectual; it could prove a deterrent.As the Donovan report points out, few collective agreements, even procedure agreements, today are in a form suitable for legal enforcement; the vast majority would be void in law for uncertainly. The most urgent need is to press ahead with the reform of procedure agreements but unions arenot likely to co-operate with enthusiasm in this if they feel it is merely a first step to coerce them into legal commitments they do not want. It isfor employers to convince their unions that legal enforceability is in theirown interests.44. There are those who go even further and would make all collective agreements legally binding, whatever the wishes of the parties. Here again the Government believes such a step would hinder, not help, the developmentof a more ordered system of collective bargaining. Moreover to attemptto give legal force to agreements that were never designed for that purpose is not realistic. Most of them are not in an enforceable form and even if theywere employers could not enforce them. Employers can already sue strikerswho are in breach of their individual contracts of employment. In fact theyhardly ever do so, because they think it will exacerbate their industrial relations. Similarly, there is no reason to believe that they would seek toenforce legally binding agreements either against individual union members or against unions.45. Some employers have therefore suggested, not only that collective agreements should be made legally enforceable against the parties&apos; wishes, but
that the Government or a public agency should assume the responsibility for initiating proceedings in the Courts against those striking in breach ofagreement. This is completely unacceptable to the Government. Employeesmay well be justified in striking in breach of procedure, in defence of their interests, if the procedure is slow and clumsy and protects an employer whohas taken unilateral action such as victimisation. Moreover, such (a development would mean the complete abdication of their responsibilities by trade unions and managements and devolving on Government the duty of enforcing collective agreements over the whole industrial field, regardless ofthe circumstances. It is difficult to imagine anything more calculated to weaken the whole machinery of collective bargaining.46. The Government thinks it right to ensure, however, that there is no legal impediment to the observance of collective agreements negotiatedbetween employers or employers&apos; associations and trade unions by anymethod freely decided upon by the two parlies. For this reason it will propose in the Industrial Relations Bill the modification of section 4 (4) ofthe Trade Union Act 1871, so that agreements between trade unions and employers&apos; associations will be put in the same position as those betweentrade unions and individual employers. The Bill will further propose thatagreements could be made legally binding only by an express writtenprovision in the agreement. It would thus have no effect on the legal status of existing agreements, or of future agreements if the parties did not expressly decide in writing to make them legally binding.Disclosure of Management Information to Trade Union Representatives47. If employees&apos; representatives arc to participate with management on equal terms in the extension of collective bargaining and consultation atcompany or plant level, they will need adequate information to allow themto form an independent judgment on management proposals, policies and decisions. Many managements already recognise the need to disclose such information if negotiations are to be carried on in a climate of confidence,and find no difficulty in making adequate safeguards for any information,disclosure of which might cause risk of harm to a lii m&apos;s commercial interests.But other firms take an excessively cautious view and are unwilling to disclose relevant information in the course of negotiations or consultation,even when no real risk is involved. This has been a prime cause of thefailure of works production committees and similar bodies. Similarly in negotiations it limits the scope for informed discussion between the two sides, encourages an early retreat to entrenched positions, and thus damagesindustrial relations.48. The Government proposes to go beyond the recommendations of theRoyal Commission by including in the Industrial Relations Bill a provision to enable trade unions to obtain from employers certain sorts of information that are needed for negotiations. It will have detailed consultations on thisproposal and will give full consideration to the safeguards needed to protectfirms&apos; commercial interests.Appointment of Workers&apos; Representatives to Boards of Undertakings49. There are various ways in which workers can participate in manage-ment. The most effective is through membership of a trade union which
negotiates with management on all questions unfeeling conditions of employ-ment including, for example, the introduction of new machinery, manpowerplanning and deployment, and disciplinary and dismissals procedures. Thereare other forms of participation, for example through the appointment ofworkers&apos; representatives lo the boards of undertakings. The Governmentfavours experiments in Ihis method, and will have consultations on how theymay best be facilitated. Any changes in the law which the consultations showto be desirable will be included in the Industrial Relations bill.Restrictive Labour Practices50. There can be no doubt that equipment and manpower are not alwaysused as efficiently in this country as in other comparable industrial countries.This is partly due to customs and practices which restrict the effective useof resources including manpower : for example overmanning or unnecessaryovertime. On the whole such practices are operated, not by the unions them-selves, but by groups of employees, who see them as a way of protecting theirjobs or of maintaining earnings. Because of this, any attempt to get rid of such practices without adequate compensation is seen as a threat, eitherto earnings, or lo security of employment. Their abolition therefore requiresnegotiations initiated by employers. This is often best achieved in the context of wider negotiations aimed at producing a comprehensive agreement,since such an agreement can include alternative provisions for such mailersas minimum earnings and job security, which are equally acceptable to the employees and more compatible with increasing clliciency. The overhaulof our collective bargaining system will facilitate such agreements, and will thus help to raise productivity. The Government agrees with the majorityof the Royal Commission that penal powers would be of no value in this field. In the N.B.P.I., the proposed C.I.R. and the D.E.P.&apos;s Manpower and productivity Service, this country will have three valuable instruments fortackling the problem of restrictive or protective working practices.Adult Training51. An increase in the supply of many kinds of skilled workers isessential to the development of the economy. In certain areas there are continuing shortages of some types of skilled men. Even in the less prosperousareas experience has shown how quickly the demand for skilled labour cangrow and outstrip the supply. These shortages can prevent employers from using modern equipment to the best advantage or even from buying it.Likewise they can seriously hinder attempts to set up new industries in areas with a high general level of unemployment. Both the Government andindustry already train adults to the skilled level, and the need for this willcontinue to grow. However, in the engineering industry in particular, all such trainees are normally registered as &quot; dilutees &quot; and opposition is slillfound in some areas to allowing them to exercise fully the skills they have acquired, or to have the appropriate status when they are employed onskilled work. This opposition is misguided, as it discourages workers fromcoming forward for retraining to the skilled level, and reduces the ability of industry to grow and adapt itself to technological change or may evenprevent factories from being established in development areas. Acceptanceof adult trainees is important not only in order to improve industrial
efficiency and regional development, but also to ensure to all employeesthe right to advance themselves by training.52. The Government attaches great importance to the review of dilutionagreements to ensure that they do not impede the acceptance of adultstrained to the skilled level (including Government Training Centre trainees).It believes that the least that is required now is the freer implementation ofexisting dilution agreements, but also that in the longer term these shouldbe replaced by more flexible arrangements designed to see that men andwomen are employed according to their ability to do skilled jobs. For thisreason the Government has welcomed the recent statement by the CentralTraining Council on the urgent need to develop new attitudes to training for skilled work, and is discussing with the T.U.C. and the C.B.I. the best way of making progress on the problem of adult trainees. In addition itwill be open to the Secretary of State, in consultation with the CentralTraining Council, to seek the advice of the C.I.R. on the industrial relationsaspects of training problems, including dilution agreements.THE EXTENSION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAININGThe Need for an Extension of Collective Bargaining53. Even though well ordered and effective collective negotiations and discussions are the best method so far devised for the involvement of employees in the objectives of industry and in the acceptance of the changesnecessary for economic progress, for many workers such arrangements donot exist. Major changes in the composition of the labour force have steadilyreduced the relative size of many traditional areas of trade union member-ship for example mining, the railways and the docks. At the same timethe number of employees in areas traditionally difficult to organise intounions has been increasing most notably in the field of white-collar employ-ment. The result has been that the proportion of the total labour forcebelonging to trade unions has actually declined in the last few years.54. Yet trade unionism is needed by those who have so far not beenable to develop effective organisation. This is shown by the number of recognition disputes, and the continued growth of the white-collar unions.White-collar employees have to overcome strong prejudices among manymanagements to gain recognition of their right to bargain. The Governmentwill encourage and help the extension of collective bargaining, and intends to take steps to remove unjustifiable obstacles to the growth of collective bargaining based on strong and independent trade unions. If unions hadto rely on industrial sanctions to compel employers to recognise them or ifthey engaged in unrestricted competition among themselves, the result wouldbe serious damage to the industrial relations system. With the help of theC.I.R. the Government will therefore seek to avoid this situation. It looksto unions, with the guidance of the T.U.C., to co-operate in using the new opportunities that will be created to extend their role and membership,without wasting their energies and resources in unnecessary competition.Trade Union Membership55. The Industrial Relations Bill will lay down the principle that noemployer has the right to prevent or obstruct an employee from belonging
to a trade union. This principle will become a part of all contracts ofemployment, and the Bill will provide that any stipulation contrary to itshould be void in law. The Bill will further provide that no FriendlySociety should have a rule debarring trade unionists from membership.Employees will also be given a remedy if they are dismissed on account oftrade union membership. Article 1 of the International Labour convention on the Rjght to Organise and on Collective Bargaining 1949 (No. 98), whichthe United Kingdom has ratified, requires adequate protection for workersagainst acts of anti-union discrimination, and the measures to be proposedin the Bill will give this statutory support.Recognition of Trade Unions by Employers56. Recognition disputes are of two kinds:(a) where an employer refuses to recognise any union, and(b) where he bargains with some unions but excludes others.Disputes may also arise where an employer recognises but will not negotiate with a union. In all these cases the Government will empower the C.I.R.to investigate and report on such disputes referred by the Secretary of State.It will be able to take evidence from management and unions, and to look into the facts of the situation, such as the degree of support for the union or unions involved. It will foe empowered to hold a secret foallot, if thisis thought to be desirable.57. In cases of type (a) the Government will expect the C.I.R. normallyto favour recognition, if the union is appropriate and can establish that ithas reasonable support. A ballot is one way of showing this, but thequestion cannot foe settled by ballot in every case, for a union can oftenfind little immediate support where there has hitherto. been little hope of recognition and, perhaps little opportunity for recruitment; increased support and membership follow, not precede, recognition.58. The Government expects that in such cases most employers will agree to accept an independent and unbiased recommendation by the C.I.R.It proposes, however, to provide in the Industrial Relations Bill that where,despite a C.I.R. recommendation in favour of recognition, an employer con-tinues to refuse recognition, the Secretary of State should be able to take action. One possible course would be for the Secretary of State to order the employer to bargain in good faith, subject to a penalty if he does not.But this would be an inadequate way of resolving the position, since it wouldoften be very difficult for the courts to decide whether the employer wasrefusing to bargain in good faith or simply taking a tough bargaining position. Instead, therefore, the Government proposes that where the C.I.R.recommends in cases of type (a) that a union or unions should be recognised,the Secretary of State should be empowered to require the employer byOrder to recognise and negotiate with the union. If he does not, the union will be able unilaterally to take him to arbitration before the industrial court, whose award will foe legally binding.59. The Donovan Report also points out that there may be other circumstances in which the employer already recognises a union fout refusesto bargain genuinely with it. For example, this may take the form ofexploiting the weak organisation of his employees or their reluctance to strike.   This refusal of genuine bargaining may extend over the whole field
of industrial relations in the undertaking, or it may be only in respect ofcertain matters. In either event, where, because of the employees refusal to negotiate, the unions are unable to get substantive claims properly con-sidered, the Industrial Relations Bill will further propose that, in thesecircumstances too, the Secretary of State should be able to make an Orderby which the union could unilaterally take the employer to legally bindingarbitration before the Industrial Court.60. Questions of conflict for recognition between rival unions presentgreater difficulties. As the Donovan report pointed out, multi-unionism canbe a potent source of industrial disputes and the Government looks to theT.U.C. to take positive initiatives and to strengthen its procedures fordealing with it. Detailed proposals are outlined in paragraphs 69-71. Disputesover recognition between powerful unions can cause widespread disruptionand unless peaceful methods of finding a solution can be evolved, suchdisputes will be settled on the basis of which union or group of unionscan do, or threaten to do, the greatest damage to the economy. TheGovernment believes that this is intolerable in a modern society and is confident that the T.U.C. shares its view that peaceful solutions must befound. The C.I.R. can play a useful role in bringing persuasion to bear onthe unions involved and in reinforcing the efforts of the T.U.C. If, despitethese efforts, a dispute is threatened, the Government will ask the T.U.C.to try to resolve the conflict between its constituent unions. If, however,the T.U.C. cannot persuade the parties within a reasonable time to accepta settlement, the Secretary of State will refer the dispute to the C.I.R. Insome cases the C.I.R. may only be able to produce a durable solution byrecommending the exclusion of one or more unions from recognition. Insuch a situation the Government will look to all the parties involved toaccept the recommendations of the C.I.R. If they do not, the industrial relations Bill will propose a power for the Secretary of State where necessary to give effect by Order to the C.I.R&apos;s recommendations. the employer would then be liable to a financial penalty if he refused torecognise the union or unions which the C.I.R. recommended should berecognised, or recognised one against which it had recommended. A union which used coercive action to obstruct the implementation of the C.I.R&apos;srecommendations would also be liable to a financial penalty.61. The proposal for examination of inter-union disputes by the T.U.C.and C.I.R., and for a reserve power in the last resort, is far more realisticthan the suggestion that inter-union disputes should be tackled by amend-ing the legal definition of a &quot; trade dispute &quot; to exclude disputes between&quot; workmen and workmen &quot;. People who went on strike in an inter-uniondispute might then be liable in some circumstances to be sued for damages,and.even to be prosecuted. But, as already explained in paragraph 44,employers have shown little enthusiasm for using the law in strikes, par-ticularly against their own employees. The chief objection, however, tothis suggestion is that it makes no contribution to finding a fair solution tothe point at issue between the unions. Their dispute may involve difficult questions of industrial relations which require careful examination by peoplefamiliar with the problems. If such an examination is known to be avail-able, it will often be possible to avoid a strike altogether; this is much better than changing the law to make strike action in these circumstances
liable to penalties, while leaving the basic problem untouched. In disputesover recognition, which are the most important type of inter-union dispute,the procedure proposed in the previous paragraph will permit a full examination of the dispute by the T.U.C. and if necessary the C.I.R.The Industrial Board62. A new Industrial Board will toe responsible for dealing with thesecases, as well as with the cases referred to in paragraphs 93-98 (conciliationpause and ballots), 109 (registration) and 115-16 (complaints against tradeunions by individuals) below. The Board will sit in panels, the membersof which will be drawn from the employees&apos; panel and the employers&apos; panel of the Industrial Court, under the Chairmanship of the President or one ofthe independent legal members of that Court. The precise composition of the panel will depend on the nature of the case. The Board will havepower to impose financial penalties on an employer, union or individualstriker as it found appropriate; these penalties would be recoverable only inthe appropriate County Court by attachment of earnings and other civilremedies for the collection of debts, but without liability to imprisonment indefault of payment or on account of failure to obey an order. It is to be observed in this connection that the Lord Chancellor has recently receivedthe report of his Committee on the Enforcement of Judgment Debts. Withcertain exceptions it recommends the abolition of imprisonment for failure toobey an order for the payment of a judgment debt and the substitution forimprisonment of attachment of earnings orders. This recommendation isclearly relevant to the proposals the Government has in mind.Wages Councils63. The Royal Commission pointed out that the Wages Council system has impeded the growth of voluntary collective bargaining and strong tradeunionism in many of the industries covered by it, and made recommendationsdesigned to remedy this. The Governments objective is to help employees in Wages Council industries by stimulating and strengthening voluntarycollective bargaining in these industries to the point where they can rely on it rather than on the statutory Wages Council, which will then nolonger be necessary. The Government is therefore consulting the T.U.C.,C.B.I. and Wages Councils about the Royal Commission^ recommendations.Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 195964. Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959enables a trade union to oblige an employer to observe the recognisedterms and conditions (or others not less favourable). The section doesnot apply in Wages Council industries, and the Royal Commission recom-mended that this limitation should be removed. This recommendation isbeing considered in the consultations referred to in the previous paragraph.The Royal Commission also recommended that when the Industrial Courtis comparing the terms and conditions observed by an employer with theterms and conditions recognised in the industry, it should be required to compare the two sets of terms and conditions as a whole, and not justparticular parts of them. The Government accepts this recommendation and it will be included in the Industrial Relations Bill.
AIDS TO COLLECTIVE BARGAININGThe Need for Further Aids65. When the State has intervened in industrial relations, it has oftendone so in order to assist employers and unions in the conduct of collective bargaining. The development of the Ministry of Labour&apos;s conciliationservice and of arbitration facilities and, most recently, the establishmentof the D.E.P.&apos;s Manpower and Productivity Service are all examples of this.The reforms proposed above will increase the need for further bargainingaids, particularly in the fields of trade union development and industrial relations training.Employers&apos; Associations66. Employers&apos; associations are closely linked with industry widebargaining. The changes that are made in collective bargaining in their industries will decide their future role. Amalgamations and changes in organisation will be needed. Many associations will in future find thattheir main work lies in assisting members to develop collective bargainingmachinery and to improve industrial relations in their undertakings. Associa-tions should carefully review the adequacy of their advisory services tomeet such needs. The Government will consider these questions with theC.B.I. and, where necessary, individual associations. When making generalreferences to the C.I.R. concerning an industry or a part of an industry, itwill ask the C.I.R. to consider any changes needed in employers&apos; organisa-tions.Trade Union Re-organisation67. On the trade union side the problem is different. British trade unions are undermanned and under-financed, even in relation to their presentfunctions. As the Royal Commission showed, most comparable countries have two or three times as many full-time officials in relation to the numberof members as British unions. It is true that in Britain great relianceis placed on voluntary officials, for the most part shop stewards, but the donovan Report also indicates that contacts between stewards and theirofficials are often infrequent and that they vary very much from union tounion. They are also very considerable communication problems arising from many unions&apos; defective and out-dated organisation. It would often be better for union branches to be based on the place of work.68. To take their full part in a reformed and extended system of collective bargaining, trade unions thus need to be reformed and extended.Among other things they need fewer areas of overlap, more amalgamations,additional officials, specialised services, improved constitutions, bettercommunications, and more adequate contributions and funds.69. In many undertakings the employer has to deal with a large numberof unions. This has attractions for some people who want to belong toa union that will speak exclusively for their own occupational interests ;but it greatly complicates, and can easily harm, industrial relations in theundertaking. Unions should take urgent action to remedy the disadvantages of multi-unionism.    They should aim to meet the criterion of &quot; one
union for one grade of work within one factory&quot; by the conclusion of inter-union agreements on recruiting rights and negotiating rights. They shouldalso seek to create machinery for the joint discussion of matters of common interest by all the unions in an undertaking or factory. This is a corollary of the introduction of comprehensive company or factory agreements whichwill have to be negotiated with a body representative of all the unions.At present shop stewards of different unions and their members, in orderto discuss common problems and work out a response to managementinitiatives, too often have to meet in &quot; unofficial&quot; ways which cut acrossthe formal provisions of union constitutions and which are outside the framework of the formally constituted negotiating machinery. A first step should be the establishment of ad hoc consultative committees at national level in large multi-plant companies.70. As the Royal Commission said, the initiation and encouragement oftrade union reforms are in the first place the responsibility of individualunions. The Government looks to their executives to take urgent action. a major role could be played by the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress. It should take the primary responsibility for resolving disputes between member unions. It could urge upon them the Royal Commission^proposals for the reduction of areas of competition over membership, the rationalisation of recruitment policies, the establishment of joint machinery in undertakings and factories, the recruitment and training of a greater number of officials, and the improvement of career prospects for full-timeofficers. It could also encourage unions to make better provision for dualmembership or easy re-admission where this would help job mobility. TheGovernment will pursue these questions with the T.U.C. and individualtrade unions as appropriate. In appropriate references the Government willask the C.I.R. to consider problems of trade union structure and organisation.A Trade Union Development Scheme71. But the Donovan Report does not go far enough in its recommenda-tions for modernising the trade union movement. The Industrial relations bill will therefore provide for grants and loans to be made available totrade unions by the C.I.R. These grants and loans will be made on theadvice of a committee of independent and trade union members of the C.I.R.72. The Bill will define the purposes for which assistance can beprovided ; these are expected to include assistance for trade union mergers,the expansion of training for union officials including shop stewards, thedevelopment of unions&apos; often inadequate research facilities (particularly tomeet the needs resulting from more detailed negotiations at company level),and the employment of management consultants.73. Unions will be able to apply to the C.I.R. for grants or loans. Byanalogy with the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, the C.I.R. willmake sure that what is asked for will help to improve union efficiency.Unions wanting assistance will therefore have to submit a scheme to show how they intend to use the money, and to satisfy the C.I.R. that they willbe able to carry through the scheme ; the C.I.R. will ensure that the grants or loans made are used in accordance with the scheme. The C.I.R. willtake account of a union&apos;s own financial resources and the scope for increasing
subscriptions; it will normally provide only part of the total funds required.There will be no conditions intended to influence a unioifs behaviour inday-to-day collective bargaining.74. Any union or federal ion of unions will he able to apply for develop-mentally aid. The T.U.C. itself will also be eligible. The Government will have further consultations with the T.U.O. on the details of this radical new scheme and the provision to be made for its administration by a TradeUnion Development Ollice within the C.I.R., including the ways in whichthe T.U.C. might most usefully be associated with its operation.75. Any union (hat regards all forms of slale aid as undesirable and unnecessary will of course be free not (o make use of (his scheme. Bui (heGovernment hopes that unions generally will share its belief thai suchhelp will contribute lo greater trade union effectiveness without compromisingtrade union independence,Training In Industrial Relations76. Most (raining of full-time trade union officials, and much of thetraining of shop stewards, is undertaken by the T.U.C. and the unionsthemselves. Courses for trade unionists including shop stewards are also provided by adult education organisations, technical colleges and other bodies. The Industrial Training Boards are making increasing contributions towards the cost lo employers of sending shop stewards on training courses.A reform of the collective bargaining syslem will make il even more necessarythan it is now that trade union officers at all levels, full-lime and voluntary,should be well trained. The Trade Union Development Scheme will be ableto help with the cost of new courses provided by the T.U.C. and the unions.The Government will also consider whether additional help should be given from public funds for courses provided by oilier bodies, ll attaches particular importance lo the provision of sufficient teachers for this type of course,and the development of suitable teaching methods and materials. TheGovernment will also discuss with Industrial Training Boards how their help can best be developed.77. Some employers find il useful to give their employees, lor exampleduring induction training, some guidance on (he main provisions of the collective agreements which apply to them. Such guidance, which need notbe elaborate, helps to avoid misunderstandings and lo develop a sense of participation; Other employers should consider introducing il inco-operalion with unions.78. On the management side Ihere is an equally urgent need for trainingin the techniques Of industrial and human relations. Few companies in britain have senior managers with a knowledge of the full range of optionsavailable to them as a result of recent developments in payment systems,manpower planning, industrial sociology and psychology, or ergonomics.Management at all levels and especially at the top will need more systematictraining in these matters, particularly where company and factory-widebargaining needs to be put on an orderly and equitable basis. The Govern-ment is considering urgently ways of improving (he situation, includingthe possibility of grants to institutions lo encourage more training in industrial relations.
NEW SAFEGUARDSTackling Strikes79. Strikes are inevitable in a system of free collective bargaining. Buimany strikes in contemporary Britain are avoidable. No government concerned with the economic advancement and prosperity of I ho country can afford to neglect any reasonable and practical proposal for reducing theirincidence and effect.80. The fundamental solution lies in the re-structuring of our presentsystem of collective bargaining when il is disordered or defective. Manystrikes would not take place if there were quick and effective methods of resolving the matter in dispute. Some existing disputes procedures, such asthai in engineering, are out-dated and no longer provide an adequate meansof resolving many of the disputes to which they should apply. some employers are too ready lo lake unilateral action on matters like workingmethods and dismissals, and lake the risk that this will provoke industrial action, instead of discussing and negotiating beforehand. In many circum-stances at present the use of the strike weapon is understandable, andin some il is justified.81. Reform of collective bargaining will remove many of these causes of strikes. Comprehensive and elfeclive company or plant agreements willresolve many existing difficulties. Better procedures will resolve disputesbefore (he impatience of (hose concerned leads lo a strike. The need loreduce the number of strikes through improved procedures will be animportant clement in I ho approach of (he C.I.R. Oilier proposals, such asthose on trade union recognition and negotiating rights (paragraphs 56-59),inter-union disputes (paragraph 60) and unfair dismissal (paragraphs103-104), will provide alternative remedies for mailers which al presentgive rise lo a large number of strikes.82. In addition lo these changes, I he Government proposes new develop-menls which will enable it to deploy its services more effectively, and ensurethat conciliation is given every chance to work before there is resort toharmful conflict.The Services of (lie D.E.1\83. The D.E.P. lias recently re-examined (he services it and other government-sponsored agencies provide to industry. As one aspect of thisil has considered the nature and adequacy oil its services for tackling strikes,lock-outs and other forms of industrial action. The aim of (he Departmentsconciliation service is lo help the parlies to a dispute to reach a settlement for themselves or to persuade them, where appropriate, to allow it to bereferred to arbitration. When a dispute concerns a matter substantiallyaffecting the public interest and il cannot be settled in other ways,the Secretary of Slalc may order an inquiry. The Conciliation Act 1896and the Industrial Courts Act 1919 provide the statutory framework forthese services and no major amendment of these Acts is required.84. The conciliation work of the D.E.P. very often makes a valuable contribution (o promoting good industrial relations and to settling a dispute.
No basic changes are proposed, but the following important developmentsare to be introduced:(1) In the past the Department has preferred to act only if invited byone or both parties.   In future the Department will be more readyto take the initiative and to proffer its help.(2) The Department should clearly not carry out conciliation in a way that cuts across agreed procedures, if these provide proper facilitiesfor resolving disputes. On the other hand, it has to recognise thatsome existing procedures are defective and may indeed delay asettlement. Its decision to intervene will therefore depend on thecircumstances of each case.(3) In some cases it might be an advantage to bring in an outsideindependent to chair the negotiations, and the Department willsuggest this where appropriate.(4) In some cases prompt informal investigations may avert a strike or help to promote a settlement. If possible it is preferable forthis to be done before a dispute has resulted in a dislocation ofwork. Where appropriate such informal investigations will becarried out by the Department (with employer and union representa-tives where this would help). In the light of experience the Govern-ment will consider whether further statutory powers are needed for this purpose.85. The Manpower and Productivity Service is being staffed at all levelswith officers trained and experienced in conciliation and with knowledge ofthe functions of managers and trade union officials. The developmentof the Service will make technical knowledge available when needed forexample on work study or job evaluation.Strikes and the National Interest86. The reforms the Government intends to initiate and encourage will inevitably take some time. Effective procedures cannot be introducedeverywhere overnight. Moreover, as the Royal Commission recognised, even when procedures have been reformed and accepted there will still be casesof strikes in breach of them. Britain&apos;s special problem in industrial relationsarises not from official strikes and lock-outs, but from sudden industrial action taken before adequate negotiation or discussion of the problems hastaken place. Such strikes can cause serious damage, not only to other employees in the same firm but to employees elsewhere and above all to thecountry&apos;s economic development; the question must be faced as to whethermeasures can and should be taken to deal with them.87. The problem is a complex one, involving both moral principles and practical issues. The Royal Commission made it clear that it was notin principle opposed to the use of legal sanctions for the enforcement ofagreed procedures, but believed that until new procedures had been putinto operation any attempt to make procedure agreements legally enforce-able at the present time would be bound to fail. It did, however, suggestone step that might be taken immediately to deal with the problem.
88. A majority of the RoyaJ Commission recomended tliat, to reducethe number of unofficial strikes, the protection given by section 3 of theTrade Disputes Act 1906 and by the Trade Disputes Act 1965 in relationto inducement of breach of a contract of employment should be limitedto registered trade unions and those acting on their behalf. The imple-mentation of this recommendation would mean that unofficial strike leaderscould be sued by employers for inducing strikers to break their contracts.The Government does not believe that this would improve matters. First,the great majority of employers would probably not be prepared to sueunofficial strike leaders. The change would therefore be ineffective inpractice, while, by creating uncertainty, it would worsen the generalatmosphere of industrial relations. Second, unions could declare strikes bytheir members to be official unless they decided otherwise, thus bringing the leaders of such strikes once more under the protection of section 3 asamended ; or groups of unofficial strikers might constitute themselves astrade unions, in order to obtain the law&apos;s protection. Third, if any employersdid take legal action, the strike leaders would have no defence even if theirunofficial strike was justified. Far from helping to establish greater orderin collective bargaining, the recommendation would have a seriously harm-ful effect.  The Government does not propose to implement it.89. It is because employers do not, in fact, use what legal powers theyhave against unofficial strikers that some have suggested a very far-reachingrole for the Government. They would like to see the Government, or anindependent agency such as the C.I.R., with statutory powers, taking from employers the responsibility for negotiating good procedure agreements, by imposing them if necessary on both sides and then ensuring that they areenforced. For the reasons given in paragraph 45 the Government rejectsthis approach.90. In seeking to solve this problem, it is essential to be clear as to the kinds of strikes with which we have to deal. Strikes may be official (i.e.supported by the union or unions concerned in accordance with their rules)or unofficial. They may be constitutional (i.e. called only after the procedure for dealing with disputes agreed by the union and the employer or hisassociation has been exhausted) or unconstitutional. The distinction betweenconstitutional and unconstitutional strikes may on occasion be blurred bydisagreement between the two sides about whether procedure has been exhausted or not, or whether the issue is appropriate to procedure. Some-times there may be no agreed procedure at all, and this too may be a cause of strikes. 95 per cent, of all strikes are unofficial (and of these the vast majority are unconstitutional); they are responsible for three-quarters of the working days lost because of strikes.91. For the most part strikes without the use of procedure take placesuddenly and without the permission of the body authorised under unionrules to sanction them. Most unions are not prepared to recognise orsupport strikes in breach of procedure. Yet strikes of this sort are increasingin many industries and their effect can be very serious, Similar problemsmay arise where there is no agreed procedure or where the procedure isdefective.   Society urgently needs a means of ensuring that the processes
of conciliation are followed first even if ad hoc conciliation machinery has lobe created for the purpose. Technological change and economic progressare leading, over much of industry, to an increasing interdependence betweenundertakings. This is particularly itrue within manufacturing industry,and between manufacturing industry and the services such as transport onwhich it depends. A strike by a key group in the long chain of productionand distribution can put many people out of work in other firms and evenother industries. It has a cumulative effect which can lead to disproportionatenational cost.92. Where a strike, whether official or unofficial, takes place after the exhaustion of an agreed disputes procedure it would be intolerable to denythe right to withdraw labour since employees might have no other way ofremedying a legitimate grievance. It is however quite a different matter forthe community to require that groups of employees shall not take precipitatestrike action, which may seriously damage the economy and their fellowemployees, before they have used the machinery of discussion to which they themselves have agreed or which may be made available by the Government.A Conciliation Pause93. It is for this reason that the Government will seek to reinforce,through the Industrial Relations Bill, the machinery of conciliation which already exists. The method proposed would be to give the Secretary ofState a discretionary reserve power to secure a &quot; conciliation pause &quot; inunconstitutional strikes and in strikes where, because there is no agreedprocedure or for other reasons, adequate joint discussions have not takenplace. The power would only be used when, if the strike (or lock-out)continued, the effects were likely to be serious.94. It would only be used, moreover, where the Department of Employ-ment and Productivity&apos;s normal conciliation methods had first been tried.In many strikes the employer is at fault, for example in cases of victimisation,or when the employer has introduced a change in working methods without adequate notice and discussion. An essential part, therefore, of the efforts to get the strikers to return to work would be to require management towithdraw the offending action till adequate discussion had taken place. Inmany other cases it would be desirable to preserve the status quo in order not to prejudice negotiations or an inquiry. If, despite these steps and despite the setting up by the D.E.P. of an inquiry or other appropriatemachinery, the strike went ahead, the Secretary of State would, afterwarning the two sides, be able to issue an Order requiring those involvedto return to work and to desist from industrial action for a period of twenty-eight days ; and at the same time requiring the employer to observespecified conditions or terms during the pause, the conditions normallybeing those that existed before the dispute. If either side failed to complywith this Order the Industrial Board at its discretion could impose financialpenalties. Before doing so. it would take into account the circumstancesof each particular case.95. This &quot; conciliation pause &quot; would enable every opportunity for nego-negotiation to be explored. In particular, it would allow time for any suitabledisputes procedure to be used. Under a good procedure, it should be possible
for.an urgent matter normally to be fully considered within twenty-eight days. Unless the Secretary of State was satisfied that adequate machineryfor reaching a settlement existed and would be used, a suitable inquiry wouldbe held. After the end of the pause there would be no power to delay orrestrict a strike or lock-out arising from the dispute in question.96. The Government believes that the existence of this power would encourage trade unions to intensify their efforts to see that procedureswere observed by their members. For it is not only the public and employers who are concerned about unconstitutional strikes. The trade union movementitself has expressed its concern. The Government welcomes (he recognition by the T.U.C., in its interim statement, &quot; Action On Donovan &quot;, that the tradeunion movement has a responsibility to see that the strike weapon is notabused. In particular it welcomes the T.U.C.&apos;s comment that &quot; where proce-dures are in the view of affiliated unions unsatisfactory, there is an obligation on them to seek the revisions which they believe to be necessary. If, on theother hand, an affiliated union is satisfied that the existinig procedure conformswith current requirements of relevance, speed and flexibility . . . (it) has an obligation to ensure that the procedure is adhered to.&quot; To the extent ofcourse that unions succeed in securing the observance of disputes procedures,the use of the Governments reserve powers will not be necessary. Some ofthose who gave evidence to the Royal Commission wished to place a statutoryduty on trade unions to use their &quot; best endeavours &quot; to prevent their members from taking unconstitutional action and to use disciplinary action, includingexpulsion, where necessary, against their members under threat of de-registra-tion with accompanying loss of immunity from tort liability where they failedto exercise these powers. In the Governments view the imposition of thislegal duty would not help to create a healthy relationship between a tradeunion and its members. Nonetheless the trade union movement must show itsability to discharge the obligation referred to in its statement if it rejects allother alternatives for dealing with a problem it has itself recognised.Strike Ballots97. The results of strike ballots under the American legislation illustrateone reason for rejecting, as the Royal Commission did, the suggestion thatballots should be made obligatory before official strikes. In major disputesunion members are very often more militant than their leaders, and are likelyto be less closely in touch with the progress and prospects of the negotiations.If the union leaders were always obliged to hold a ballot when using thestrike threat in negotiations, they might well find their hands tied by a voteto strike in support of a claim intended merely as a bargaining move at anearly stage of negotiation. If on the other hand the union leaders are readylo call a strike without balloting their members but there is no doubt about their support, nothing would be gained by demanding a ballot.98. It is, however, a matter for concern that at present it is possible for a major official strike to be called when the support of those involved may bein doubt. A number of unions already have provisions in their rules makinga ballot of their members obligatory before a strike. In other cases the holding of a ballot is discretionary; in others there are no provisions aboutballots in the rules.  Where a major official strike is threatened the Secretary
of State will discuss with the unions concerned the desirability of holding astrike ballot and will seek to persuade them to consult their members unless there are valid reasons why they should not. Where no agreement is reached,the Industrial Relations Bill will give the Secretary of State power at herdiscretion to require the union or unions involved to hold a ballot on thequestion of strike action. The power will be used where the Secretary of Statebelieves that the proposed strike would involve a serious threat to the economyor public interest, and there is doubt whether it commends the support ofthose concerned. The object will not be to place a prohibition on such strikes,but to help to ensure that before strikes of this importance take place theunion members themselves are convinced that they are right to go on strike.The ballot will be conducted by the union, in accordance with its own rulesas approved by the proposed Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos;Associations (sec paragraph 109), which should of course provide for the fair and efficient conduct of a poll. Apart from giving approval to the formof the question to be put to the vole, the Secretary of State will not intervene in the conduct of the ballot. If members raise any questions of procedure,including entitlement to vote, these will be resolved in the same way as similardisputes in relation to a ballot called by the union itself. Similarly, in allother respects the powers of unions under their rules to decide whether or notto strike, or to end a strike, will remain unaltered.The 1&apos;rescnt Law on Strikes99. The Government has reviewed (he law on picketing, but does not propose to make any changes in it. It believes that the present law doesnot place any unreasonable limitations on picketing, and that properlyenforced it provides sufficient safeguards against violent or inlimidatorybehaviour.100. The Government has decided to accept the recommendation of theRoyal Commission that the inducement of breach of a commercial contractin the circumstances of a trade dispute should be protected in the same way as the inducement of breach of a contract of employment. The law on thisis complicated ; sympathetic strikes and other ways of bringing indirectpressure on an employer during a dispute are regarded by the present lawas legitimate, but they face legal hazards in some circumstances. Thisanomalous situation must be resolved. The alternative is to outlaw sym-pathetic action. But trade unions have a long tradition of relying on the solidarity of union members working in different places, and it would be wrong to attach legal penalties lo the practical expression of this. It will of course be open to the Secretary of State lo require a ballot before anofficial, or a conciliation pause in an unconstitutional, sympathetic strike.The Trade Dispute Disqualification for Unemployment Benefit101. The Royal Commission recommended changes to Section 22 of theNational Insurance Act 1965, which concerns the disqualification of persons for receipt of unemployment benefit when there is a trade dispute at their place of work. If these changes were made, a claimant lor benefit would no longer have lo prove that he is not a member of a &quot; grade or class &quot; ofworkers, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interestedin the dispute ; and a claimant would not be regarded as &quot; financing&quot; a
trade dispute simply because he is a member of a trade union paying strikepay to those on strike.J02. The Government is sympathetic towards the objective of avoidingdisqualification lor unemployment benefit of people remote from an industrial dispute. But these recommendations need further consideration in the lightof comment so far made by the C.B.I., T.U.C. and nationalised industries.The Government intend lo resume Consultations on this matter as soon aspossible.Safeguards against Unfair Dismissal103. Although (he individual employee is protected in many other waysby legislation or collective agreements, he often has no elfective safeguard against arbitrary or unfair dismissal. The Government proposes lo end this anomaly. There is need for legislation to establish statutory machinery tosafeguard both unionises and non-unionists against unfair dismissal. Whileit is desirable that voluntary procedures relating to dismissal should be improved and extended, the development of such procedures is much looslow. In a period when increasing and necessary change must be acceptedby large numbers of people legislation will provide some guarantee that the inevitable uncertainties which this situation creales will not be added to byan employees high-handedness or prejudice. One effect of legislation willuncloulcdly be to encourage the development of clear rules as to the circum-stances in which employees may be dismissed and for what reasons, andthe improvement of voluntary procedures.104. The Industrial Relations Bill will make il clear that dismissal is justified only if there is a valid reason for it connected with the capacilyor conduct of the employee or based on the operational requirements of theundertaking, establishment or service ; and that in the absence of such validreasons it is unfair. Employees who consider themselves unfairly dismissedwill have a right lo complain to the present Industrial Tribunals, which willhave to be extended and equipped to deal with this additional role. Com-pensation or re-inslalcmenl may be awarded by the Tribunals. The exactform of the procedure and of the machinery lo operate it, and the extent lowhich voluntary procedures can be exempted, will be discussed in detail will)the C.B.I., T.U.C., nationalised industries and other interests.Contracts of Employment Act l%3105. While the Contracts of Employment Act 1963 has proved a usefuladvance both in laying down minimum periods of notice and in requiring the employer to give the employee a written statement of certain particulars of his contract of employment, the Government believes that the time hascome to revise the Act in the light of experience and in order to increase theprotection given lo employees. In particular it thinks that it is necessaryto increase long-service employees&apos; entitlement lo notice before dismissal ;to shorten the minimum period of service needed to benefit from the Act;and lo require employers lo give employees fuller particulars of their contracts of employment, it therefore proposes lo enter into consultations with both sides of industry to consider the amendments lo the Act whichshould be included in an Industrial Relations Bill.
Jiiirkrfidion of Industrial Tribunals106. The Industrial Tribunals have proved their worth as quick and satisfactory machinery for hearing cases under several statutes affectingindustry, for example those brought by individual employees under certain provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, In such cases thepresence of employer and employee members on the Industrial Tribunalslias proved extremely helpful. The Royal Commission recommended thatthe jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunals should be extended to coverlegal disputes (except for those about accidents al work) arising from in-dividual contracts of employment and statutory claims between employersand employees, which at present can be dealt wild only in (he ordinarycourts. The Government agrees that it-will be easier for individual employeeslo bring such cases before Industrial Tribunals which have proved thai theyare well suited to dealing with such mailers. Il therefore accepts in principlelhal their jurisdiction should be extended as proposed by the Royal Com-niission and will further consult both sides of industry on this. the continuing role of satisfactory voluntary arrangements for resolving such questions will be safeguarded.Trade Drawn Rules and Registration107. Prejudices and unfair treatment are not a management monopoly.They can arise among employees and in trade unions. The Royal Cbm-missiou found no evidence of widespread abuse of union power. But whenunion membership is accepted as desirable and actively encouraged, il isessential that unions should be able, and be seen to be able. It) conduct their business according lo clear and comprehensive rules, and lo dealfairly with any dispute between (he union or ils officers and the individual member.108. This must be done in ways that are compatible with trade unioninternal sell-government and independence. Employees musl retain theright to combine together in ways thai seem lo them lo advance their interests. Bui this must also be seen lo be compatible with generally accepted standards of tolerance and fair play. For tins reason the Govern-merit considers thai the present legal requirements relating to the rules oftrade unions are inadequate, and should be extended in the interests bothof the unions and of (heir members.109. The Industrial Relations Bill will therefore propose that trade unionsshould register with a new Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos;Associations within a prescribed period. In view of the experience gained by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in dealing with trade union matters,the new post will for the present be combined with that of Registrar of friendly Societies. Unions will be required to have rules governing certain matters (e.g. admission, discipline, disputes between the union and ilsmembers, elections, strike ballots, and the appointment and functions ofshop stewards), and lo register. Refusal will lay a trade union open to a financial penalty by (he Industrial Board. (The Royal Commissionsalternative sanction was (hat the protection of Section 3 of the TradeDisputes Act   1906 should be confined lo registered unions and those
acting on their behalf, but the Government has not accepted this recommendation (paragraph 88), and does not think that it would be an appropriate way of securing registration). Unions will be free to frame rules to meet their own requirements and the Industrial Relations Bill will not propose that there should be provision for them to be challenged except on the ground that they do not adequately cover the subjects mentioned. This right will lie with the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations, to whom unions and employers&apos; associations will submit their rules when applying for registration. If he refuses to register a union or employers&apos; association, appeal will lie to the Industrial Court. Trade union and employers&apos; associations will be allowed reasonable time to make any necessary amendments to their rules.

110. The Government agrees with the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendations that the term "trade union" should in law be used only for employees&apos; associations. It will thus be necessary to define in law the term "employers&apos; association". The Government will consult the T.U.C and C.B.I about these definitions. Employers&apos; associations will be required to register and to comply with appropriate requirements about rules.

111. The Royal Commission recommended that trade unions should be given corporate status. The T.U.C. has represented that this would be undesirable, as it would have no significant advantages and would not be appropriate to unions&apos; constitutional structure. The Government accepts these arguments and does not propose to implement the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendation.

112. The Industrial Relations Bill will further propose that all but the smallest unions should be required to employ professional auditors and that new requirements regarding superannuation funds for their members should be introduced.

113. At present trade unions are protected from actions in tort by Section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act 1906. This means, for example, that union cannot be sued for libel or negligence (although it is possible in some circumstances to sue the trustees or the officers). This restriction is unrealistic, and the Industrial Relations Bill will provide for removal of the immunity except in the circumstances of a trade dispute. The Government agrees with the T.U.C. that this change will only be acceptable if the definition of a trade dispute is watertight, and will consider carefully what changes (if any) should be made in the present definition for this purpose.

Complaints against Trade Unions

114. These reforms will provide additional safeguards for union members, and do much to enable unions themselves to escape unjustified suspicions. But for them to be seen to deal fairly with members, it is necessary that the administration of their rules should be subject to independent review. This does not imply that there is any reason to suspect frequent injustice anymore than the creation of the Parliamentary Commissioner implies that maladministration is common in Government departments. But it is right and healthy in a democracy that any powerful body should be subject to outside scrutiny where abuse of its power can most harm the individual.


115. Complaints against trade unions by individuals who have no access to, or have exhausted, the union&apos;s own appeals procedure will he considered in the first instance by the Registrar, who will have the duly of advising the complainants and trying to promote an amicable settlement. In somecases where this cannot he achieved there is already a legal remedy in theordinary courts, but in others there is no remedy at present. The industrial relations Bill will provide that complaints by individuals of unfair orarbitrary action by trade unions resulting in substantial injustice may be.referred to the Industrial Board referred lo in paragraph 62.116. In cases heard by the Board, every opportunity will be given tothe trade unions concerned to prepare their own answers to complaints. Theobject will be lo ensure fair play and*justice, rather than lo put obstacles in the way of unions. If complaints are found lo be justified, the board will have power to award damages, or admission or reinstatement in a union. In these cases the Board will consist of a legal chairman fromthe Industrial Court and two members of the employees&apos; panel of the Court,117. The Royal Commission rejected the prohibition of the closed shopand said that, under proper safeguards, it could serve a useful purpose. Aclosed shop might be needed by a union lo establish an effective and stableorganisation or in order lo deploy employees&apos; bargaining strength lo thefull. Nevertheless the Commission recognised thai the closed shop was liable from lime to lime lo cause injustice lo individuals and it therefore proposed safeguards. The Government agrees with this assessment. It has proposed above in paragraphs 115-116 measures lo protect the trade unionmember ; it is also necessary lo consider those who have conscientiousgrounds for not joining a union and who are dismissed from their employ-ment in consequence.I 18. Before agreeing lo a closed shop, employers should seek lo obtainsuitable protect ion for people who refuse (o join trade unions on con-scienlious grounds. Many unions are prepared lo accept such people in aclosed shop, if Ihey in their turn are prepared lo show good faith, forexample by contributing to charily instead of paying a union subscription.When such employees are dismissed from employment because they willnot joint a union, the Government proposes that they should have a rightof complaint lo an Industrial Tribunal as a case of alleged unjust dismissal.The Government agrees with the majority of the Royal Commission that the Tribunal should have power to award compensation to be paid bythe employer, since it is his responsibility in concluding a closed shop agree-mentally lo bear in mind the interests of existing employees who are not inI he union, and to ensure that they are adequately safeguarded. TheTribunal should also have power to award compensation to be paid by the employer if the closed shop is not a formal one established by agreementwith a union, but an informal one resulting from the unwillingness of employees to work with a non-unionist. The Tribunal will have to considerwhether the employer should in any way be liable for acquiescence in thedevelopment of such a closed shop, and (he extent to which the employershould compensate an employee whom he has dismissed because he con-sidered it to the advantage of his business lo do so in the circumstances.
A NEW OPPORTUNITY119. These are ihe major measures, initiatives and policies which I heGovernment proposes lo deal with  Ihe industrial relations problems nowlacing this country, and will further discuss with  both sides of industry,They are intended to retain the besl aspects of our traditional system-its freedom, flexibility, tolerance and general sense of reasonable compromise.Al the same time they should enable us (o grapple with  what is wrong:with  disorder, injustice, occasional near chaos and damaging disruption.They involve Ihe Governmenl more closely in Ihe processes of industrial relations, but without diminishing Ihe responsibility of management and unions for (he proper conduct of their a/fairs. On (he contrary (hey are designed to highlight and strengthen that responsibility. In effect they oilerboth management and unions an opportunity and a challenge. The Govern-mentally proposes a joint effort lo remake and improve Ihe relationships of people at work,
Appendix 1Proposals for au Industrial Relations Act-The Government intends, after further consultations, to introduce an industrial Relations Bill, including provisions:(!) To put a Commission on Industrial Relations on a statutory basis(paragraphs 33-38) ;(2) To require employers to register certain collective agreements andarrangements with the Department of Employment and Productivity(paragraphs 39-41);(3) To modify section 4 (4) of the Trade Union Act 1871, to facilitate the direct legal enforcement, where the parties wish, of agreements between trade unions and employers&apos; associations, and to provide that agreements should only be legally binding if they include anexpress written provision to that effect (paragraph 46);(4) To give trade unions the right to have certain sorts of information from employers, subject to safeguards for confidential commercialinformation (paragraph 48) ;(5) If necessary, to facilitate the appointment of trade union representa-tives to boards of undertakings (paragraph 49) ;(6) To establish the principle that no employer has the right to prevent or obstruct an employee from belonging to a trade union (paragraph55);(7) To stop Friendly Societies from having rules debarring trade unionistsfrom membership (paragraph 55);(8) To empower the Commission on Industrial Relations to look intorecognition disputes, and to arrange a secret ballot if it thinks thisdesirable (paragraph 56);(9) To enable the Secretary of State, where the Commission on industrial relations recommends that an employer shall recognise a union(or that he shall negotiate with it) but there is continuing difficulty,(a) to make an Order requiring the employer to recognise andnegotiate with the union and, in default, giving the union theright to take the employer to arbitration at the Industrial Court(paragraph 58);(b) to make an Order giving the union a similar right against an employer who is refusing negotiating rights (paragraph 59);and(c) if necessary to make an Order excluding one or more unionsfrom recognition, with penalties for breach of the Order by either the employer or a union (paragraph 60) ;(10) To establish an Industrial Board to hear certain types of case against employers, trade unions and individual employees (paragraph62);(11) To amend the law relating to Wages Councils and section 8 of theTerms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959 (paragraphs 63-64);

These will beconsidered by the Government and discussed with those concerned, with aview to possible inclusion in the Industrial Relations Bill.Appendix 2Incidence of Strikes in the United! Kiagdoia1. A country&apos;s pattern of strikes and other stoppages due to tradedisputes can be analysed in various ways, for example, according to thenumber of stoppages in relation to the number of employees, the average number of persons involved per stoppage, the average duration of stoppagesand the number of v/orking days lost in relation to the number of employees.The following table comparing the strike patterns of different countries isbased on one published in the Donovan Report, brought up-to-date as faras possible.

Because countries adopt different statisical practices, the figures are not strictly com-parable in every respect. The most important variation is in the level below which strikesare regarded as too small to be included; some other countries adopt levels lower than theUnited Kingdom, notably Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway and the United States. some countries, unlike the United Kingdom, exclude from their statistics workers laid off as aresult of stoppages at their place of work. The footnotes which follow record the moreimportant other variations.(2) Including electricity and gas.(3) Manufacturing only.(4) Figures not available.(5) Average for 1963-66 only.  Figures for 1967 not available.(6) All industries.(7) Including electricity, gas, water, sanitary services.Column (1) of this table shows that in comparison with many other countries the U.K. has a fairly large number of strikes in relation to the. size of its workforce. In this respect the U.K.has in recent years been worse off than nine of the other countries listed, but better than five(Australia, France, the. Republic of Ireland, Italy and New.Zealand).. As regards average number of employees involved per stoppage (column 2), the U.K. figure falls below thefigures for twelve of the other countries; and as regards the average duration of each stoppage(column 3) our figure falls below those for nine of the others. Judged in terms of number ofworking days lost in relation to numbers employed (column 4), the U.K.&apos;s record has been about average compared with other countries. The pattern which emerges for the U.K. istherefore one of a comparatively large number of short stoppages involving, on average, a fairly small number of employees.
-;.-!- .2;-.SFbfc- numbertof stoppages in industries other than coal-mining hasincreased steadily over the last few years, as the following table shows: UNITED KINGDOM: NUMBER OF STOPPAGES DUE TO industrial disputes, 1957-1968	Number of stoppages:		Year				Coal-mining	In the rest of the	Altogether		economy	1957	2,224	635	2,8591958	1,963	666	2,6291959	1,307	786	2,0931960	1,666	1,166	2,8321961	1,458	1,228	2,6861962	1,203	1,246	2,4491963	987	1,081	2,0681964	1,058	1,466	2,5241965	740	1,614	2,3541966	553	1,384	1,9371967	394	1,722	2,1161968	219	2,131	2,350-(Provisional figs.)			Source: Department of Employment and Productivity3. One important feature of the strike pattern in the U.K. is that thegreat majority of strikes (about 95 per cent.) are unofficial (that is, .notsanctioned or ratified by the union or unions concerned), as illustrated-by thefollowing table:  OFFICIAL, UNOFFICIAL AND OTHER STOPPAGES OF WORK DUETO INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESAverage Annual Figure for Stoppages in the Period 1964-670)Type of Stoppage	No. of Stoppages	No. of Workers Involved(2)	No. of Working Days LostOfficial Strikes (3)  ......	82	84,700	643,000Partly Official (?)   ......	2	600	6,000Unofficial   .........	2,125	663,300	1,857,000Others: i.e. lockouts or industries-kes by unorganised work-ers unclassified   ......	24	3,200	24,000All    ............	2,233	751,800	2,530,000Source: Department of Employment and Productivity.(!) Figures relate to stoppages beginning in years covered and the total number of working days lost due to them.(2) Includes workers thrown out of work at establishments where stoppages occurred,although not themselves parties to.the dispute,.but excludes workers consequentially laid off at other establishments.(3,) Figures relate to stoppages known to have been official, but there are sometimesdifficulties in classification.&apos;- (4) :i.e.., Strikes involving more than one union and recognised as. official by. at least one butnot all the unions concerned.These unofficial strikes are also nearly always unconstitutional-i.e. they take place in breach of the appropriate procedure for dealing with disputes.
4! Official strikes, although lew in number, tend to involve more em-ployees and to last longer than unofficial strikes. An official strike, becauseOf the number of employees involved, can often result in a very largenumber of working days lost. For example, the total number of working days lost through stoppages in 1968 was 4,692,000 (provisional) : of this, theone-day engineering strike in May accounted for about 11 million.5. Official strikes have not shown any consistent tendency to grow in number in recent years, the figures since 1960 being as follows:  Number of Official Strikes. 1960-!967*I960   ........	......      681961   ...      .....	......      601962   ........	......      78 *1963   ........	......      491964   ........	......      701965   ........	......      971966   ........	......      601967   ........	.......108*Thc figures include &quot; partly-official &quot; strikes, i.e. strikes involving more than one union and recognised as official by at least one but not all the unions concerned.6. By contrast, the numbers of unofficial strikes have steadily risen inrecent years. The general increase in the number of strikes in industriesother than coal-mining has been almost entirely due to an increase inunofficial strikes. Certain industries have been especially prone to unofficial strikes, as the following table shows:  AVERAGE ANNUAL FIGURES RELATING TO INDUSTRIES IN WHICHMOST UNOFFICIAL STRIKES TOOK. PLACE IN RELATION TO numbers employed, 1964-1967Industry	Number of unofficial strikes per 100,000 employees	Number of days lost in unofficial strikes per 1,000 employeesCoal-mining    ...............	127-7	416Docks (port and inland water transport)	65-6	1,766Shipbuilding,   ship-repairing   and   marine		engineering   ...	45-2	412Motor vehicle manufacturing        ......	34-3	831All industries...............	9-2	847. Statistics relating to the causes of strikes have to be used with caution ;a strike may have several causes, and the immediate cause (according towhich the strike is classified) may not be the most important one. Mostofficial strikes result from a breakdown of negotiations at industry levelabout trade union claims for improved terms and conditions of employment.8. As far as unofficial strikes are concerned, neary half of them in recentyears have been due to disputes over pay. The other most frequent causesare &quot; working arrangements, rules and discipline &quot; (about 30 per cent.) and&quot; redundancy, dismissal, suspension etc.&quot; (about 15 per cent.). Other causes,including recognition, demarcation questions, hours of work and closed shopissues account for about 8 per cent, of unofficial strikes.Printed in England by Her Majcsty&apos;s Stationery office at St. Stephen^ Parliamentary Press(323233)  Dd. 7, 100   1/69
