BI^C^AllROWOn the 21st February, the Ministerial Committee on science and Technology met under my chairmanship to consider a note by theChairman of the Official Committee setting out the main arguments forand against continuance of the national programme of space technology,known as BLACK ARROW,    Kis note was accompanied by a review ofthe programme by the Ministry of Technology which the official committee had agreed should be submitted to Ministers; and I attachthis review as an appendix to this memorandum.2.     The case for retaining BLACK ARROW rests on two main considerations.    Firstly, the programme offers the means of maintain-ing a focus of expertise about space   technology which would be of value to other Government Departments and to industry, and also in protectingour investment in international organisations.    Secondly, it is believedthat investment in such a space programme, at a rate of  3 million in1969-70 rising to  5 million by 1973-74, would in the long term bejustified by economic returns., although these cannot at present bequantified,    A national programme of space technology gives credibilityto the British space industry as suppliers of systems and components?without it our industry would be in a much weaker position in competition for international business with countries such as France, Germany, japan and Canada (all of whom have comprehensive space programmes), leaving aside the United States.3.     On the other hand the Treasury maintain that BLACK ARROWdoes net satisfy the criteria now used in assessing new projects, and thatno sound economic case has been made for continuing the programme.They believe BLACK ARROW to be a hazardous venture with an uncertaineconomic return, of a type which should not now be pursued because ofthe state of the economy.    They also doubt whether success in winningcontracts for space equipment depends on having a national programme.4..     It is argued that the decision is of crucial importance since, ifBLA,CK ARROW were cancelled, the United Kingdom would in effect beabandoning space technology; and to re-enter the field in the future andattempt to regain our position, if it seemed desirable to do so, would beprohibitively expensive.    However, the Treasury are of the opinion thatit might be feasible to resume work in the space field through licencingarrangements with the United States and others.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)Cl6.9l.20_ COPY NO.65-^CABINET

5.     With the exception of the Minister of State, Treasury, ministers were agreed that if the programme were to continue it should be at theincreased rate of spending proposed by the Minister of Technologyji. e. increasing from  3 million in 1969-70 to  5 million in 1973-74,It would be financed out of the Ministry&apos;s &quot;block budget&quot; and dueprovision for it would be made in their 1969 PESC forecasts.    It was accepted that the programme should stand or fall as a whole.    Thesame Ministers concurred with the Minister of Technology&apos;s view thatthe arguments in favour of completing and using the British launcheroutweighed those in favour of switching to a United States launcher.6.     At the meeting of the Ministerial Committee, there was strong support for the view that our space programme had real potential for development, although it was not yet possible to predict the precisedirections in which it could be exploited.    The industries based onspace technology were among the most rapidly grbwing businesses inthe world, and we might seriously underestimate the value of black arrow if we based it simply on the exports in the 1970s that could nowbe foreseen.    The prime value of the programme lay in the support itwould provide for the electronics and telecommunications industries -and this in turn had a bearing on the position which the United Kingdomstill held as a world telecommunications centre.    Our position in thelarge and profitable market for ground stations would probably be prejudiced if we abandoned BLACK ARROW, because potentialcustomers would be drawn to those countries which had a provencapability of developing complete space systems.7.     As to the other uses of BLACK ARROW, the Royal Air force would benefit from the development of the meter or ological .*nftjZlSfc?which was now included in the programme, and improved weatherforecasting would bring large economic benefits, particularly frommore efficient working in agriculture and the construction industry.The European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) is understood tohave expressed an interest in the BLACK ARROW launcher, as havethe Science Research Council on behalf of British space scientists.8.     A minor point in favour of BLACK ARROW, but one whichshould not be overlooked, is the political advantage of having ourselveslaunched an aLUBritish satellite by 1970.9.      The question is not whether the United Kingdom should or should not embark on a major space programme, as BLACK ARROWwould in any case amount to little more than an insurance policy.The point at issue is whether the programme should continue orwhether it should be cancelled in order to release resources for thedevelopment of other, potentially more profitable, technologies.    Ithas been argued that if the programme is sacrificed for this reason,it should be with a clear knowledge of the alternative uses to whichthe resources would be put.    In this connection, the Civil service department have stated that relatively few qualified men are requiredfor the programme, and manpower demands cannot therefore be saidto sway the case in either direction.

10,     I therefore invite my colleagues -(i)   to note that, with the exception of the Minister ofState, Treasury, the Ministerial Committee on science and Technology supported the case for thecontinuance of the BLACK ARROW programme;(ii)   to decide whether or not the BLACK ARROW programme should continue, as elaborated in paragraph 21 of theAppendix, in the light at the views expressed ahove^T.

APPENDIXREVIEW OF NATIONAL SPACE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMME(BLACK ARROW)introduction.    At a meeting held on 28th February 1968 Ministers agreed that the black ARROW programme should be continued for a further year from 1st April 1968, subject to the following -(a) that the Ministry of Technology would find compensating savingsfor the additional provision required in 1968-69 within Part Iof the Civil Technology public expenditure block and theDepartment&apos;s Civil Estimates for 1968-9;(b) that continuation of the programme in 1969-70 would be for subsequent decision in the light of further consideration ofthe method of making financial provision for it;(c) that the justification for the retention in the programme ofthe development of a launcher would be reviewed at official level within the next six months.The Cabinet endorsed these conclusions at its meeting on 7th March 1968.2.    With regard to (b) above, the Ministry have accepted the Treasury viewthat the BLACK ARROW programme should continue to fall within the Ministry&apos;sCategory I programme, and provision was made in the 1968 PESC forecasts forCategory I expenditure of about  3 million in each of the years from1969-70 to 1972-73.3.     In the review of the launcher element of the programme, it became increasingly evident that the interaction between it and the programme as a whole was such that it was not sensible to consider the launcherseparately.   It has therefore not been possible to put a paper on thelauncher to the Committee in advance of completion of a comprehensive review &quot;of the whole programme.-1-CONFIDENTIAL

Need for a National Space Technology. programme.     The purpose of a national space technology programme is to createand maintain a capability in this field both within Government and inBritish industry.   It is not claimed that there is in the foreseeable future a quantifiable economic case for such a programme;   equally it isimpossible to be confident at this very early stage in the historjr of space technology that the substantial body of opinion in this and othercountries* vdiich considers space technology as a key growth area ofpotentially great industrial and. economic importance, is wrong.     TheMinistry of Technology accordingly continues to believe that a modestnational programme of space technology, primarily on satellites, shouldbe pursued, in order to maintain a technical and industrial base fromwhich it would be possible to expand later, when and if the economic case for doing so becomes clear,5.     A further important argument is the need for the Government to have its own source of expert advice in order *o take soundly based decisions on space activities in which the United Kingdom already has a practicalinterest (e.g, INTELSAT, scientific research in space, defence communica-tions by satellite).     Such expertise can only be maintained on the basisof a current programme in this field,6.     Such a programme should be regarded as applied research, and like allresearch an act of faith in the prospect of economic benefits.   Until thetechniques involved are more firmly established and the economic factorscan be more reliably quantified, it is right that the programme should beheld at the minimum level which is scientifically and industriallysensible,   it would however yield ancillary benefits in the form of &quot;spinoff&quot; to industry in general and enhanced prospects of obtaining inter-national space contracts.     Although the Ministry does not base its case ondiroct short-term economic benefits, an attempt has been made in the annex to forecast the possible scale of tho market;   for what this is worth, itsuggests that in the course of the 1970&apos;s the United Kingdom might hope toobtain satellite business from overseas rising to a level of  13 million a year, in addition to significant ground station business.     These figures are largely based on simple extrapolation of existing trends, and presentlyunforeseen developments in the use of satellites may show them to be under-estimates.* Appendix B to CSC(68) 3 (Revise) gave information on other countries&apos;national space programmes.   This information is believed to be stillbroadly correct, and gives an indication of the space effort of thosecountries,

7*     The decision of Ministers, taken in the context of the November 19^8European Space Conference, that the United Kingdom should on certain conditions participate in European space applications (as well ascontinuing to do so in European space research) implies a belief in thefuture prospects of space.   It does not in anyway remove the need for anational programme;   if anything it reinforces it.     For the work coming to the United Kingdom from international programmes is not likely tocovor all the aspects of the technology which we should regard as important;   indeed it is more likely to be in those areas where we already have competence, rather than in those where we wish to acquire it.Without the backing of a reasonably comprehensive national programme,we should, in comparison with the other European countries with substantialnational programmes in this rapidly advancing field of technology, bebadly placed for international negotiations concerning space, forknowledgeable participation in the technical direction of internationalprojects, and for seeking the optimum use of the funds to which vie have contributed including a reasonable share of contracts from the various international organisations involved.   On the other hand, given a national programme, its content could be adjusted, in the light of expectedrequirements, in order to place British industry in the most advantageousposition.The BLACK ARROW Programme8.     The national space technology programme consists effectively of black ARROW, and no practicable alternative exists as a means of meetingthe needs set out in paragraphs 4--7 above.   It consists of two elementsplanned as an integrated programme -(a) The development and manufacture of a series of satellites inthe course of a programme of research into the main aspectsof satellite technology;(b) the development and construction of a small satellite launcher(based on the successful CLACK KNIGHT research launcher) inorder to prove components, sub-systems and satellites in actual space conditions,9. Against the above background of the need for and purposes of anational space technology programme, the Ministry of Technology hasreviewed(a)   the content and orientation of the satellite programme:;

(b) the level of funding required;    and(c) the question of the continuation of the launcher element.Content of the Satellite Programme10.   The content of the BLACK ARROW satellite programme has boon reviewed in the light of the purpose of the national programme discussed inparagraphs 4-7*     Hitherto a central theme of tho programme has been thedevelopment of electric propulsion.     This technique still offers promisingprospects in particular of putting large payloads into geostationary orbitmore economically than by reliance throughout upon conventional chemicalpropulsion;   it is however not of immediate relevance to current require-monts, which aro for the development to particularly demanding standards of reliability of a range of techniques and sub-systems common to mosttypes of satellite (e.g. in respect of structure, power supply, attitudesensing and control, data-handling, bearings) and the building-up of ageneral expertise in the procedures of satellite integration and check-out,which demand an unusually high quality of project management.11.   It is planned therefore to give priority in the early stages of theprogramme to the development and testing of common user items of the kinddescribed above.    At the same time, in order to provide a developmentincentive, it is considered desirable as far as possible to include themin programmes focussed on the development of experimental satellitesrelated to specific applications.     The first of these will probablybe an experimental meteorological satellite for which the meteorological office have put forward a requirement which is due to be considered again.Plans are being drawn up for using  4, tho fourth* satellite in the black arrow programme, for this purpose.     Tho application objective which wouldbost follow X4 has not yet beon determined;   it could be directed forexample towards a satellite for communications experiments or an air navigation satellite, but the development timescale does not require animmediate choice.     The programme would continue to cover the developmentof techniques and components, and in particular the work on electricpropulsion.* X1    and X2 are primarily for the purpose of determining the behaviour ofthe launcher, though they will also carry a scientific experiment.   InX3, space testing of satellite components and sub-systems proper will begin, and a complementary scientific experiment will be carried out.-4-

Scale of the Programme12.   The review has shown that at the present level of funding (some  3 million a yoar), the rate of satellite launchings would be one each 2,6 years.In such a rapidly advancing field of technology this sort of interval between successive experiments is much too long, and together with tho4^yoar satellite gestation period would make the programme technicallynon-viable as well as wasteful of resources.     Whilst the use of theAmerican Scout launcher would allow some acceleration it would only reducethe interval to 2.3 years, which is still imacceptably long.   At tho levelof  5 million a year, the interval becomes 1.4 years with BLACK ARROW and1,3 with Scout;   either of these rates.is acceptable, and it will be soonthat the use of Scout makes only a marginal difference.   (The choice oflauncher is discussed further in paragraphs 15-19 below).13.   In tho light of those considerations, the Ministry of Technology havoconcluded that regardless of the choice of launcher, the lovel of activitymust be built up gradually to a lovel of about  5 million a year;   thoprogramme should be planned on this basis forthwith, though the spend noodnot be increased immediately.     The following table shows the provision which tho Ministry of Technology is making in its 19&amp;9 PESC forecasts -1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-742.955 3.17 3.48 3.9 4.4Because of the lag between expenditure and payments, Mintech payments willnot reach  5 million till 197 4-75,14.   Tho following table shows the manpower requirements in industry ofthe programme at the  5 million lovel, compared with (a) the present leveland (b) the position when the  3 million level is reached -I,     Launcher      L    Satellites i                                        i			total         industrial:	WPG &amp; DO	Industrial	r^J Industrial &amp; DOj present programmej180         go (a) Current      j	100	50	200 J     140(b) At  3M        L20x           x lovel          j	175X	100	295 I     150 i 5M programme       j 120         60	....... 320	190	440 j     250&apos;- --.....--f--    &quot;-  -Increase for  5M I               ^Q programme           j       , v-............i.................L........................-	145	90	i 145 !   100 f(x Reduction due to completion of launcher development)-5-

CONFIDENTIAL

It will be seen that the increase is almost entirely on the satellite work; it is not possible to forecast the geographical distribution, because this will depend on which firms get contracts.

No increase would be needed in Mintech HQ or R and D establishments staff.

The Launcher Element

15. This has been regarded in the context of the BLACK ARROW programme as a means to an end, required because space conditions cannot be fully simulated in the laboratory and final validation of a satellite system requires testing in orbit. The issue is whether there would be advantages in using foreign (in practice American) launchers rather than continuing to develop a national launcher capability. It can be assumed, in the light of assurances received from the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, that United States launchers would be available to the United Kingdom for experimental programmes such as BLACK ARROW without any unacceptable formal conditions.

16. In favour of using an American launchers is the fact that there are certain technical advantages in launching from a United State range compared with Woomera. Furthermore Scout, the most probable American alternative, is well proven, and so could be expected to be more reliable than the BLACK ARROW launcher; it is impossible to make any precise estimate of the likely failure rate of the latter, but on the basis of experience with BLACK KNIGHT (from which it is developed), there is no reason to expect a rate higher than 1 in 4. One failure during the launcher development programme of three firings could probably be accepted without the need for a repeat firing. Failures later in the programme would be more serious, but their probability would become progressively less.

17. The other advantage of Scout is in cost. The rate of launching (one every 1.4 years - see paragraph 12 above) which with the British launcher would cost £5 million a year could be achieved with Scout at an annual cost of £4.8 million. Changing to Scout would also give a once for all saving in development costs but since the launcher development is largely completed this would only amount to £0.8 million net. (But it should be noted that as explained in paragraph 18 (v) below Scout is not suitable for all the tasks in the programme some of which ill require a larger launcher).



18.   In considering the choice of launcher the following points in favourof a British launcher are important -(i)   its use gives greater flexibility of planning and executing thoprogramme;(ii)   with an American launchor, it would bo difficult to preservecommercial security in relation to satellite payloads;(iii)   a switch to another launcher at this stage would delay for ayear the launch of tho X5 satellite in which space testing of satellite components and sub-systoms will begin;(iv)   the acquisition of a comprehensive systems capability and know-howcould be important both commercially and in the contoxt ofMintech&apos;s expert advisory functions - cf. paragraph 5 above;(v) some of the later tasks envisaged in tho programme (e.g. anelectric x^ropulsion satellite with large solar arrays) willrequire a larger satellite volume than is possible with Scout;the BLACK ARROW launcher design provides this.   Moreover a relatively simple uprating of tho BLACK ARROW launchor (withstrap-on boosters and longer tanks) which can be undertakenwithin the  5 million per annum programme will enablesignificantly heavier payloads to be launched.     If the black arrow launcher is not available for these purposes, Thor Deltawould have to bo used;   this is much more expensive and thecost advantage would be largely lost - unless optimum use couldbe made of the larger payload capacity.   But this in turnwould require a much higher lovel of expenditure on thesatellite than could be justified at present on a &quot;minimum&quot;capability basis;(vi) in addition to possible use by SRC and Meteorological Office thereis the possibility of foreign sales of tho BLACK ARROW launcher;an uprated version would fill a gap in the range of Americanlaunchers;(yii)   the use of a British launchor would save dollars.Some of the foregoing points can of course be advanced against the UnitedKingdom&apos;s policy towards ELDO.     The two cases arc however very different.Tho ELDO launchor is intended for operational use;   our objection is thatthe use of a launcher costing at least 100 per cent more than an Americanone will seriously penalise tho satellite projects, and is too high a price to pay for tho avoidance of the admitted disadvantages.   A research project-7-

like BLACK ARROW is not critically dependent on cost and it is worth paying a snail premium to keep complete control.     Furthermore what is at issue inthe ELDO case is a further  100 million or so of development money, plus an extra  5 million per operational launcher;   in the BLACK ARROW case, asindicated in paragraph 17, the differential is minimal both absolutely and relatively.19.   In tho considered judgment of tho Ministry of Technology, tho points inparagraph 18 conclusively outweigh tho financial and other advantages ofswitching to an American launcher.Need for early and firm decisions20.   The present BLACK ARROW contracts run out at 31st March 1969.   decisions on the continuation of the programme aro therefore needed by the beginning ofMarch.     For the programme to progress at the optimum rate, it is most desirable that firm decisions should be taken allowing normal contracts tobo placed rather than a continuation of the wasteful short-term contracts and frequent reviews under which the programme has laboured for the last four years.Conclusions21.   Ministers are accordingly invited -(i)   to approve the case for a national space technology programme set out in paragraphs 4-7*(ii)   to note the planned re-orientation of the BLACK ARROW programme(paragraphs 10-11).(iii)   to agree that for tho reasons in paragraphs 12-13 the lovel of activity should be built up from some  3 million a year to  5 million a year by 1973-74, the whole programme falling withinthe Ministry&apos;s Category I expenditure,(iv)   to agree that for the reasons sot out in paragraphs 15-19, theprogramme should continue to include the development and useof a British launcher,(v)   to approve the continuation of the BLACK ARROW programmeaccordingly.-8-

annex.     A projection has been nade of the satellite and ground station worklikely to be available to United Kingdom industry from the requirements of theinternational organisations of which the United Kingdom is a member, and from united Kingdom and other countries&quot; national requirements.     This projection isbased in part on tho trends revealed by present requirements, and is necessarily highly speculative,2.     Satellites.     The estimato of tho number of civil applicationssatellites that will be in orbit in 1980 for global use is as follows:-Purpose No. of SatellitesCommunications 30Meteorology - 15Navigation 15Earth Resources 15Total 753.     The average cost of the development and manufacture of these satelliteswith their test equipment is estimated at  6 million each (1968 prices).Tho United Kingdom might expect, if our standard of satellite technologyis competitive, to gain a share of about 10 per cent of the work necessary tothe development and construction of these satellites, and each satellite will need to bo replaced at about fivo yearly intervals.     The annual averagevalue of the business the United Kingdom could therefore expect is about  million.4.     In addition to satellites for global and regional applications, it isexpected that, by 1980, tho scientific satellite work likely to bo availableto the United Kingdom from ESRO would have an annual value of about 4 million.     The United Kingdom national space science programme would also involve expenditure on satellites of about  2 million per annum.5.     Tho, annual value of the satellite business likoly to be available to united Kingdom industry from 1980 is therefore about  15 million;    this levolbeing reached progressively during the 1970s.

6.     Earth Stations6.1    It is estimated that, up to 1975, the number of stations working to the INTELSAT system will increase by about 70.     (At present there are2*5 or so.)     Of these 70 additional stations, United Kingdom industry isexpected to bo ablo to bid for over 50 and may get 5-10, providing businessworth from  5- 15 million over the next seven years.6.2   Smaller oarth stations for other applications are expected to bonumbered in many hundreds, and United Kingdom business could be worth asmuch as  25- 30 million over tho next 10-15 years.
