DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(74) 8 COPY NO     706 February 1974CABINETRESPONSE TO A COAL MINERS1 strike memorandum by the Secretary of State for EnergyELECTRICITY ENDURANCE1,        As a result of the measures we have taken, we shall enter on a coal strike on 10 February with a capacity to maintain electricity supply untilthe end of March provided that the power workers are not prevented from entering the power stations.    This endurance can be extended to mid-Aprilby stepping up oil supplies to the Central Electricity Generating Board(CEGB) and to end-April by both increasing oil supplies and stepping upimmediately electricity savings to 25 per cent as compared with current20 per cent to 21 per cent.    To extend endurance beyond this wouldprobably require immediate electricity savings of 30 per cent and a continuation of increased oil supplies.OTHER CONSTRAINTS2.        As regards electricity supply, we can therefore withstand the miners strike until at least mid-April, without imposing further cuts on industry or commerce.    Before then, however, other constraints will have appeared.    Within 4-6 weeks, some coal- dependent industries will be in difficulties.    The most notable is steel.    Steel production will fall to50 per cent in the first week of the strike, due to shortage of coking coal.This level will work through to user industries in about 3-4 weeks and supplies will then be insufficient to maintain normal working even on a3-day week.   If the coking coal immediately obtainable from imports(equivalent to about two weeks&apos; use at 50 per cent steel production) can be moved and used, this position could be somewhat eased.    Others indifficulty will include some major industrial users (eg cement, paper,bricks) and some essential users (eg some dairies).    Individual difficulties will arise earlier.3.        The 3-day week will also have increasingly severe effects on businessconfidence, liquidity and the balance of payments.    By the end of March,industry will have had over 3 months of short-time working.    Despite theresilience shown so far, as each month passes the effect will deepen: lower1
stocks, more shortages of components, more danger of bankruptcies,unemployment as distinct from short-time working.    Loss of industrialoutput in the first quarter of 1974 is expected to be around 27 per cent.EXPORTS4.        Ministers concluded on 6 February that export licensing should beextended to coal and steel to enable exports of products useful to theUnited Kingdom to be banned, and that greater stringency would beintroduced in the granting of export licences for oil.   Appropriate action should be taken with the European Commission.USE OF TROOPS5.        The National Union of Mineworkers have said they will release coal from stock for priority users, eg coal-burning hospitals, old peopledhomes, and will permit National Coal Board management staffs to undertakesafety work.    The use of troops in these circumstances could be counter-productive.    But this situation should be kept under constant review.    Inparticular the use of troops might be considered for safety work if asubstantial number of pits were in danger; or for moving coal stocks ifwe come to the stage of considering rota cuts.OIL BURN BY CENTRAL ELECTRICITY GENERATING BOARD6.        I have authorised maximum oil burn by the CEGB, (consistent withthe maintenance this week of full power station stocks) to be reconsideredonly if the miners&apos; strike should be deferred.    I proposed to arrange tosupply the power stations with 120 per cent of last year&apos;s fuel oil and asmuch flashing up oil as can be delivered without provocation.    This oilmight come from additional spot purchases abroad, drawing on government stocks, reduced exports and a fall in industrial demand below the currentallocation level (with continuing 3-day working and falling steel production).7.        I recommend that:i. We continue the 3-day week as at present.ii. We authorise the purchase of fuel oil for the CEGB on the spot market within a price limit to be agreed by my Department.iii. As an additional precaution we should consider a cut in domestic and commercial oil use by up to half a million tons inFebruary and March.    This would involve cutting motor spiritallocations by a further 5 per cent, reducing supplies of domesticheating oil, bitumen and oil for commerce and entertainment.    Stockiof aviation turbine fuel will be drawn down.    There will need to befurther appeals to save petrol.    My Department is putting forwarddetailed proposals to the Civil Contingencies Unit which we coulddecide to put into operation after the strike begins; at the same time,secret
iv. We should be able to permit increased supplies of oil for private electricity generation in specified circumstances.Department of Energy6 February 1974
