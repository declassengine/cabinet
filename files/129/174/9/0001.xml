GENERAL ELECTION: REPLIES TO ENQUIRIESGENERAL1. At a General Election the Government of the day is expected tovindicate its policies to the electorate, and by convention the GovernmentParty is entitled to ensure that statements made on its behalf are factuallycorrect and consistent with Government policy.    The provision of rapidadvice to Government candidates is made through the medium of an election Business Committee of the Cabinet.    Government Departments,however, must not appear to engage in Party politics or be used for Partyends; and should provide consistent factual information on request to candidates of different Parties, organisations and members of the public.It is desirable that Departments should, so far as possible, follow acommon procedure in replying to enquiries and requests for information;and the Election Business Committee supervises these aspects also.2.        The circumstances of an Election demand the greatest speed indealing with enquiries; in particular, the aim should be to answer those for Parliamentary candidates within the day.FACTUAL information.        a.        Departments should provide any Parliamentary candidate,organisation or member of the public with purely factual information which -i0 Is not classified.ii.        Does not require disproportionate time or effort to produce (cf the guidelines for answering parliamentary questions).b. Local and Regional Offices should deal similarly withstraightforward enquiries to them, referring doubtful cases toHeadquarters for decision,REQUESTS FOR COMMENT OR GUIDANCE4.        a.        From Conservative Party Headquarters.    Conservativecandidates and their agents are expected to look to theConservative Research Department, who will collate requestsand prepare draft replies.    In appropriate cases the dx*afts willbe forwarded to the Secretary of the Election Business Committee,who will obtain the comments of the Ministers concerned, and willif necessary submit final drafts of replies for the Committee^approval.    The Research Department will be responsible forpassing on the necessary guidance to candidates.
CONFIDENTIALb. From Conservative candidates or their agents direct to departments.    These should be referred, through the PrivateOffice of the responsible Minister, to the Secretary of the ElectionBusiness Committee.    They should be accompanied by theMinister^ advice on whether they should be considered bythe Committee, and on the terms of a reply,c. From Opposition candidates, organisations and membersof the public.    These should be answered by the responsible minister or his Private Secretary -1 (.1i. Direct, in cases where the Government^ policyis well established and widely -known,ii. In other cases, following clearance with the ElectionBusiness Committee via the Secretariat.In either case, two copies of the eventual reply should be sent tothe Secretary of the Committee.POLICY STATEMENTS5. a.        If an enquiry addressed to a Department from any quarterappears to call for an important statement of policy, the minister concerned may decide to seek the guidance of the Election business committee; and in any case it would be advisable to inform theSecretary of the Committee of the enquiry and the terms of the response.b.        If a Minister wishes to suggest a topic, where no issueof policy is concerned, on which guidance should be given toConservative candidates, the suggestion should be sent to theConservative Research Department, who will prepare first draftsand forward them to the Secretary of the Election business committee.CONSTITUENCY CORRESPONDENCE6. During the Election period replies to constituency letters receivedfrom Members of Parliament before the Dissolution, or to similar letters from Parliamentary candidates, should take into account that they may become public knowledge and the subject of political comment.    They shouldbe handled wherever possible under Ministerial guidance.    In some caees itmay not be appropriate for Ministers to reply personally to such letters untilthe result of the Election is known; in cases where the facts do not admit of delay a reply should normally be sent by the Private Secretary.7 February 19742
