DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(74) 729 January 1974CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT FOR STRIKERS&apos; FAMILIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesli i       Following discussion by Ministers, three alternative contingentBi^Ls were prepared, for introduction if required, to amend the law relating to payment of supplementary benefit for strikers&apos; families.My colleagues will wish to consider this issue in the present situation.2. The effect of the alternative Bills is described in the Appendix tothis note.    Essentially, however, if action is required, the choice is between restricting payment for the families of those currently engagedin trade disputes (Bill (1)),   or making such payments recoverable in whole or in part from wages after the dispute is over (Bills (2) and (3)).RESTRICTION OF PAYMENT FOR STRIKERS&apos; FAMILIES3. The purpose of restricting payment while the trade disputesubsisted would be to influence the incentive to strike, and to reduce the duration of strikes, by imposing financial hardship on strikers&apos; families.When previously discussed we ruled out as too extreme complete with-holding of supplementary benefit from strikers&apos; families but as Table 1to the Appendix shows, even the limited restriction proposed in the draftBill (which would reduce existing rights by  5 a week) would fall withgreat severity on the smaller family: rents would not be paid and therewould be well publicised cases of hardship which could not be relievedsince it would be essential to extend the restriction to the supplementary benefits Commission^ discretionary power to meet urgent need.    Some,if not all, of the Supplementary Benefits Commission would possiblyresign; the legislation would be very bitterly opposed and would substantially worsen relationships with the Trades Union Congress and perhaps with more moderate opinion - although the measure might be aptin relation to the present miners1 dispute, it could be criticised in its application to other, differently motivated disputes.    While it remains the only course which could directly and immediately affect the dispute,it could further harden attitudes and mobilise financial support for theminers from other unions.   In any event, as brought out in the annex,Pay As You Earn refunds could play a significant part in sustaining astriker&apos;s income even if supplementary benefit is restricted.copy NO70
MAKING SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFITS RECOVERABLE FROMSUBSEQUENT WAGES4. The alternative Bills (2) and (3) described in the Appendixprovide for recovery of supplementary benefit respectively in whole orin part.    They would therefore not reduce payments of supplementary benefit during a strike below the present limits.    As betweenAlternatives No 2 (total recovery) and No 3(recovery of deemed strikepay), the latter was previously recommended by the Secretary of Statefor Employment and myself because it imposed less severe burdens onthe lower paid and larger families &apos;and might be regarded by moderate opinion as placing upon trade unions a reasonable financial responsibilityfor their members during official disputes.    Alternative&quot;No 2 has thepresentational advantage that payments made during strikes could berepresented as being loans instead of outright payments ofsupplementary benefit, but operationally, it is less attractive becauseemployers and the Department of Health and Social Security would be involved in lengthier periods of recovery.conclusions.        It is unlikely that Bills (2) or (3) would have any significantlyhelpful impact on the course of a miners&apos; strike and could evencomplicate and delay a settlement.   With Bill (1) we should be crossing the Rubicon but could be far from confident whether the outcome wouldbe to our advantage or not.    In this, much would depend on public reaction to the developing situation with the miners and we should be guided by it before deciding to take action.    (In any event if a strikeleads to massive unemployment we may need, in order to avoidbreakdown, to pass emergency legislation to replace present benefitprovisions by a simpler system. )Department of Health and Social Security29 January 1974
CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIXSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT FOR STRIKERS&apos; FAMILIES - proposed changes IN EXISTING arrangements.      Following discussion of proposed changes in IRPCommittee last year (IRP(73)  3rd Meeting), three contingentBills were drafted to amend the existing law about paymentof supplementary benefit for strikers&apos;  families.    The Billsare available for introduction immediately following any decision to legislate.ALTERNATIVE BILL NO 12.      This Bill provides for deemed strike pay to be takeninto account at the rate of  5 per week for any week inwhich a person involved in a trade dispute claimssupplementary benefit  for his family&apos;s requirements.    Asa consequence,  it also provides that the discretionarypowers of the Supplementary Benefits Commission to make payments under section 13 of the Supplementary BenefitAct 1966 are not to be exercised in regard to peopleinvolved in a trade dispute unless the urgent need results from circumstances other than involvement  in the dispute,eg a civil emergency or a serious  illness or accident.    Theinclusion of this latter provision which is essential  toavoid the situation in which large numbers of  strikerscould claim that they had urgent needs justifying discretionarypayments of supplementary benefit during the dispute, may prove unacceptable to some, or all, of the members of theCommission and might therefore result  in resignations.3.     The table at Annex. 1  gives some examples of the effectof this Bill at current emeg^^r^^benefit levels.
ALTERNATIVE BILL NO 24.     This Bill provides for recovery (subject to &quot;protectedearnings&quot;) by the employer,  following resumption of work,of supplementary benefit paid during a trade dispute to anyone who was involved in the dispute.    The recoveryarrangements are an extens ionl/of the existing arrangementsintroduced in the Social Security Act 1971i for recovery bythe employer of post-dispute payments to strikers.    TheBill has no effect upon the amount of supplementary benefitavailable to strikers&apos;  families during a dispute.5. The table at Annex 2 gives some examples of the effectof this Bill at illustrative levels of earnings.ALTERNATIVE BILL NO 36.      This Bill   is a variation upon Bill No 2  in that  it provides for the recovery of  5 per week (representingdeemed strike pay)  for each week in which a striker whoreceived supplementary benefit had no strike pay, or  5less the amount of strike pay received and not disregardedfor supplementary benefit purposes when strike pay was available.    Thus a trade union would be able to avoid anyrecovery of  strike pay from its members by paying atleast  5 per week during the dispute, providing there wasother income, usually a PAYE refund,  to which the disregard of  1   applied;    if there was no other income attracting adisregard, a strike payment of  6 per week would have to
be made to prevent any subsequent recovery.    While this bill could be represented as being a reasonable compromise between total recovery and total provision by trade unionsfor their members on strike,  it  involves a complicatedconcept which would need careful presentation.7.      The table at Annex 3 gives some examples of theeffect of this Bill at  illustrative levels of earnings.8.      All  the Bills have been drafted to apply to NorthernIreland.    The Schedule to Bills No 2 and 3 amends theSchedule to the Social Security Act 1971.
