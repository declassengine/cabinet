:.&apos;.a - /( :.aa -n t &apos;-a.aa^&apos;AvMr^^IPOLICYWESTERN security the North Atlantic Alliance1.     Britain&apos;s security rests upon the strength of the north atlantic Alliance.    It is therefore timely,, in this 25th anniversaryyear of the Alliance, not only to look hack on a quarter of a centuryof peace in Europe, hut also to recall the fundamental purpose ofthe Alliance.2.     The Alliance is defensive, and is designed to maintain the integrity of the participating nations.    It has sought to preservestability and peace by deploying military forces, trained and readyto operate together, in sufficient strength to deter aggression.Under the protection of the Alliance, the West has remained secure;and Western Europe has been able to develop its institutionsundisturbed.3.     Although circumstances in Europe have changed since the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 19U9, the military power of the&apos;Warsaw Pact remains massive, and is increasing.   Not only is it stilla potential instrument of war;    military superiority can also beemployed to reinforce political pressures designed to restrict thefreedom of Western governments to pursue policies of their ownchoice.   A decline in NATO&apos;s relative military strength and in itsdetermination to fight if need be could lead to a corresponding decline1-1
/      &apos;&apos; .- ; -  -----.     ; - : Vjp0iCONFIDENTIAL &quot;   1in its political self-confidence, its cohesion and its power to resist such pressures.The Military Balancek.     The Soviet Union has achieved strategic nuclear parity withthe United States, and is developing an armoury of strategic nuclear weapons designed at least to maintain it.    This makes it more than ever necessary that the West should possess strong and credibleconventional deterrent forces, as well as adequate tactical nuclearforces, so as to make clear to a potential aggressor that he cannotlaunch an attack with any certainty of being able to gain hisobjectives.5.     The Warsaw Pact has a marked superiority in conventionalweapons over the Alliance.    In Central Europe, for example, andnot taking into account forces stationed in the Soviet Union itself,the disparities are ahout 2^ to 1 in tanks and field guns;    about to 1 in aircraft;    and the Pact has some 20% more soldiers thanthe Alliance and some 3Q-kO% more soldiers in fighting units.6.     After a period of reinforcement these disparities would becomegreater.   In peacetime ,27 Soviet divisions are stationed in Poland,Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic;    and the Soviet -Union has substantial extra forces in the Western USSR which couldquickly be made ready and moved forward over secure and relatively short routes.   Formidable Warsaw Pact forces are also deployed onthe flanks of NATO.7.     Numerical comparisons alone cannot give a wholly adequatepicture:    the divisions in East and West, their equipment, and their
combat effectiveness are not in all respects comparable; thepreponderance of Warsaw Pact main battle tanks is somewhat offset by the fact that NATO has more anti-tank weapons (though thisadvantage is slowly disappearing); and NATO&apos;s tactical airforces,&apos; though fewer in number than the Warsaw Pact, are considered to be more effective.    On the other hand,Warsaw Pact forces have great geographical advantages., andhave less diverse equipments than NATO;    the basic numberson each side do not show the great strides the Warsaw Pacthave made, and are continuing to make, in modernising and re-equipping their forces, and thereby reducing such advantages in quality as NATO possesses; and an aggressor in any conflict hasthe substantial advantage of being able to choose the time and place of attack.    All these considerations are bound to affect anyjudgement about the outcome of any conventional battle in central europe.8.     The Soviet Union has also become a major maritime power witha large modern well-equipped fleet of cruisers, destroyers andescorts, some 300 operational submarines of which 100 are nuclearpowered, and a force of up to 1,000 naval aircraft.     not&apos;snaval strength is numerically greater than the Warsaw Pact butit includes a higher-proportion of older ships and substantiallyfewer seaborne missile systems.9.     The forces now deployed by the Warsaw Pact are greater than could possibly be needed for garrison duties,  or for defence
against an attack from the West, supposing such a thing to beconceivable.    So the Alliance has no cause for complacency or forslowing down the improvement and development of its defence forces.10.    The Soviet Union for its part has made important qualitativeimprovements in its military equipment and dispositions in the last twelve months.   New strategic armaments include:a. the DELTA class ballistic-missile submarine, withits k,000 mile range missile which greatly increases the geographical area from which its threat can bemaintained;b. a variable-geometry supersonic bomber (BACKFIRE)which is now entering service;and development of:-c. four new types of intercontinental ballistic missiles:d. multiple independently-targeted re-entry vehicles.New Soviet conventional armaments include the UNIFORM class nuclear-powered attack submarine; new helicopters; a wide range of lowaltitude SAM systems; and several varieties of armoured fighting vehicles and guns.East/West Relations11.    The Government&apos;s express purpose is to work for a genuine detentein Europe.    But progress is difficult so long as the Warsaw Pactmaintains forces of their present size and offensive disposition:and until there is concrete evidence that the Soviet union will work for a lasting detente rather than a temporary interludeor tactical shift in a continuing struggle.     During 197hthere will be opportunities, for example in the Conference onI - k -    &quot;   &apos; &apos;    .^r-
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and in the negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions (MBFR), for the Soviet union to demonstrate the seriousness of its desire to lower tension betweenEast and West.    Britain also continues to play an active part in negotiations for measures of arms control and disarmament.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe12.   The Wesfs aim in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is to increase mutual confidence between the 35 states(including the United States and Canada) which are taking part inthe Conference, by making practical progress, however limited this may have to be, in lowering barriers to freedom of movement of people,ideas and information throughout Eastern and Western Europe.    Onthe military side we are trying to reach agreement on measures designed to increase the confidence of European states about eachother&apos;s military intentions.Mutual and.Balanced Force Reductions13.   Following exploratory talks during the first part of 1973,substantive East-West negotiations on MBFR, foreshadowed in theStatement on the Defence Estimates 1973 (Cmnd. 5231), began in Viennaon 30 October.1h.   The general objective of the negotiations agreed by all thegovernments concerned is &quot;to contribute to a more stable relationshipand to the strengthening of peace and security in Europe&quot;.    It hasalso been agreed that &quot;specific arrangements will have to be carefullyworked out in scope and timing in such a way that they will in all respects and at every point conform to the principle of undiminishedsecurity for every party&quot;.   To achieve these objectives it will be1-5
necessary to take into account the numerical disparities which exist between the conventional forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact in thearea of Central Europe covered by the negotiations; and the advant-ages in geography, mobilisation, deployment and reinforcement enjoyed by the Warsaw Pact.   For instance, withdrawal of United States forces from Central Europe would mean a withdrawal over more than 3,000 miles of sea, whereas withdrawal of Sovieff orces to the western bordersof the USSR would be over only U00 miles of land with many goodreinforcement routes.    Force reductions on a strictly equal orproportionate basis would not offset these disparities.    In pursuit of the agreed objectives Allied negotiators in Vienna have proposedthat the eventual outcome of the MBFR negotiations should be toestablish approximate parity between the two sides, in the form ofa common ceiling for overall ground force manpower on each side inthe area in which reductions would take place, taking into accountcombat capability; and that as a first phase towards achieving thisgoal there should be reductions of United States and Soviet ground forces in the area.15.    At the Ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council on10 and 11 December 1973, the Ministers concerned reaffirmed theirresolve, on the basis of the agreed Allied approach,  &quot;to strive foran outcome which was both balanced and equitable,  and which would ensure undiminished security for all parties&quot;.    The negotiations arelikely to be long and complex.   Throughout them it will be vitally important to maintain Allied unity.
CONFIDENTIALUS/USSR Bilateral Negotiations16.    The Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War between theSoviet Union and the United States was signed in Washington on22 June 1973.   The Agreement commits the parties to behave in sucha way as to remove the danger of nuclear war.    But the Agreementdoes not require the renunciation of nuclear weapons or therenunciation of the first use of such weapons.   Nor does it affectthe commitments of the two parties to their allies. &quot; The Agreementthus does not weaken in any way the American commitment to thedefence of Europe.17.   Negotiations between the United States and the Soviet union in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks are continuing.    Alliedinterests are safeguarded through regular consultations with theUnited States in the North Atlantic Council.Developments in the Alliance18.   These developments in East/West relations have taken place_&apos;/ ,against a background of changing international relationships inother areas, including those involved in the enlargement of theEuropean Community.   The American call for the revitalisation ofthe transatlantic partnership has provided the occasion for a re-examination of relationships within the Alliance.    substantial progress has already been made towards agreement on a joint declara-tion on Atlantic relations.    At the Ministerial Meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council on 10 and 11 December 1973 ministers agreed that this important work should be pursued to a successful conclusion.
19.   There has &quot;been a generally sympathetic response from theEuropean members to requests from the United States administration to look at ways of helping with the cost of maintaining United states forces in Europe.   The British position is a special one in that,like the United States, we maintain, in pursuance of our treaty obligations, substantial forces based forward in the Federal republic of Germany in the common defence;    indeed, proportionate to ourgross national product, our net foreign exchange&apos;deficit on thedefence account is double that of the United States.   We also haveextensive procurement arrangements with the United States.   Anyfurther British help towards relieving the United States&apos; share ofthe burden of common defence could be made only at the expense of3ritain&apos;s direct contribution to the Alliance&apos;s capability.   TheBritish Government has therefore concluded that it must continue togive the highest priority to maintaining the effectiveness ofBritish forces within the Alliance.   Moreover, the full extent ofthe European contribution to the military strength of the Allianceshould be more widely acknowledged;   for example, the european allies provide some 90% of not&apos;s ground forces and 75% of air forcesin the European theatre, and 80% of naval forces in the European area.20.    Meetings of the NATO Defence Planning Committee in Ministerial  ,session were held in June and December, 1973.   Significant progress was made in implementing measures to strengthen not*s defensivecapability along lines recommended in the report on Alliance defence in the 1970s,   The Defence Planning Committee is studying means of improving the flexibility and effectiveness of the tactical air forcesin the Central Region, and giving continued Ministerial guidance to1-confidential
the NATO military authorities on the framework for NATO&apos;s integrateddefence planning. The Committee is also examining the possibilities for greater specialisation of defence roles among the Central Regionnations.21.   Britain is a regular member of the NATO Nuclear Planning group which is responsible both for general policy in the nuclear defencefield, and for specific aspects of planning, programmes and procedures governing the role of nuclear weapons in NATO&apos;s defence.The 13th and 1h.th of the regular half-yearly meetings of the Groupwere held during 1973* in Ankara in May and in The Hague in November,when further consideration was given, among other things, to theprogramme initiated in 1969 for the study of the political andmilitary implications of possible defensive use of nuclear weapons in various circumstances.22.   The recent Middle East conflict drew attention to two particular areas which merit further consideration by NATO.   First, thedeclaration by the United States Government of a military alertdrew attention to the need for some review of the NATO consultativemachinery, which is now in hand.   Second, we and our Allies arestudying the military lessons to be learnt from the war.23.   The British Government welcomes the interim settlement of the fisheries dispute with Iceland which offers the prospect of a new and happier chapter in our relationship with a NATO ally, and has brought to an end a demanding task for the Royal Navy and theRoyal Air Force.I - 9        ,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEuropean Defence Co-operation2k.   The Government attaches great importance to the developmentof closer European defence co-operation.   This would benefit the alliance as well as the European countries themselves.    Collabora-tion with our European^allies on equipment procurement is alreadygoing well, and there are a number of promising projects includingthe Anglo/French Jaguar aircraft and the Multi-Role Combat aircraft in which we are collaborating with the Germans and the Italians.The Government believes that the Europeans should do more for their own defence, adapting old institutions or devisingnew ones for the purpose, and that this will serve the common interests of the Alliance.25.    1973 was a year of consolidation in the work of the Eurogroup.Defence Ministers of the ten European countries represented continueto find the Eurogroup a valuable forum in which to discuss majordefence issues facing the Alliance in a European context.26.    Solid progress continues In implementing the billion dollarEuropean Defence Improvement Programme;&apos; and in the communiquefollowing their meeting last December the Eurogroup Ministers were able for the third time in succession to point to an impressivelist of new equipments to be introduced into their forces duringthe coming year.27.    The Eurogroup has continued to promote collaborative developmentof equipment among its members in accordance with the. joint declara-tion of principle referred to in the Statement on the defence estimates 1973 (Cmnd. 5231).   This is normally done on the basis ofinitial bilateral or trilateral arrangements such as those developed
for the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft or the,towed gun and self-propelled howitzer.   The Eurogroup also arranged the purchase ofthe Lance surface-to-surface missile system from the United States&quot;by three of its members, Belgium, Britain and the Federal republic of Germany.   These countries, together with Italy which had already arranged to acquire Lance, are now working on collaborative logisticand support arrangements.1-11
BRITAIN&apos;S FORCESForce Improvements28. A number of improvements have been made to British forces during the past year, and others are planned for the coming yeThey include:-a.       Royal navy the seventh nuclear-powered Fleet submarine,i II&apos;&apos;- .HMS Swiftsure. entered service in 1973, and the eighth is due to do so in 197U.Three Amazon class Type 21 frigates are planned to enter service in 197^-75.The Tiger Fish and Mark U6 anti-submarinetorpedoes and Ikara anti-submarine missile system are entering service.Three nuclear-powered Fleet submarines, sixType U2 guided-mlssile destroyers and five Amazonclass Type 21 frigates are being built,b.     ArmyArmoured regiments have now completed their re-equipment with the Chieftain tank and the Swingfireanti-tank missile system;    the latter is now being issued also to mechanised infantry battalions.Tracked and wheeled versions of the new combatreconnaissance vehicles are coming into service.Production of the new 105 mm light gun will beginthis year.As stated earlier the Lance tactical nuclear missile
has been ordered from the United&apos; States.   The low-level air defence missile capability will be improved by the introduction of Rapier, and later of theman-portable Blowpipe.Royal Air ForceRe-equipment of front-line squadrons is continuingsatisfactorily.In the attack role Jaguars will enter operationalservice in Strike Command this year, an additionalBuccaneer squadron will start to form and theAnglo-French Martel air-to-surface guided weaponwill enter operational service.   Our air defencecapabilities will be enhanced by the progressivetransfer of Phantom figures to this role, the completionlast year of the Shackleton force of airborne early warning aircraft, initial deliveries of the Rapierlow-level surface-to-air missile system and thecompletion of the Air Defence Data Centre atWest Drayton.In the strategic reconnaissance role the Vulcan SR2will replace the Victor.In the training field a new pattern of pilottraining is being introduced;    the Jetstream andthe Anglo-French Gazelle helicopter are in service;and Argosy aircraft are to be converted for crewtraining.
Future Equipment29.   The Exocet surface-to-surface missile will carry out shipbornefiring trials this year prior to fitting in frigates and largerships.   The keel of HMS Invincible, the first of the new class of cruisers, was laid in July 1973.   The cruisers will provide ITleetcommand and control facilities and area defence missile protection and carry Sea King anti-submarine warfare helicopters.   Among the wide range of future equipment projects the most important for theRoyal Air Force is the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, which is expectedto form about half the planned combat front line in the 1980s.   good progress has been maintained in its development in conjunction withour German and Italian partners and the possibility of jointtraining is being discussed with them.       Developmentof the Lynx helicopter in its various Service versions is at an advanced stage.   The Hawk, the replacement for the Gnat and Hunteras a pilot training aircraft, will make its first flight this year.Among guided-weapons projects, development continues of the ship-borne surface-to-air guided-weapon systems, Sea Wolf and Sea Dart.Collaborative development continues on a new towed gun and self-propelled howitzers.    The electronics projects under developmentinclude the Ptarmigan tactical trunk communication system for theArray and Royal Air Force in Central Europe.Commitments to NATO30.    In accordance with strategic priorities laid down in the supplementary Statement of Defence Policy 1970 (Cmnd, i+521) andsuccessive Defence White Papers, the maintenance and improvementof our military contribution to NATO remains the first priority of United Kingdom defence policy.I - -Hi
31.   All major ships and amphibious forces are earmarked forassignment to NATO in war; in peacetime they are deployedworld wide as NATO, other allied or national interests require.The Polaris submarine missile force provides the independentBritish contribution to the Western strategic nuclear deterrent.Britain continues to allocate ships to NATO&apos;s Standing and On CallNaval Forces, including the newly formed Standing Naval Force Channel.32,   The great bulk of the Army is either directly committed to NATO or effectively in support of it.   The primary forcecontribution   (the. British Army of the Rhine (BAOR))    is stationedon the Continent.    In the past year BAOR has received an additionalengineer squadron and extra Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve(TAVR) units have been earmarked for NATO tasks.   Most of the major formations and units in the United Kingdom - both regular andTAVR - are earmarked as reinforcements for NATO; and there areextensive plans for the reinforcement of BAOR units and of variousNATO headquarters by individuals drawn from units and Reserves in theUnited Kingdom.33.   The Royal Air Force contributes substantial and variedforces to NATO by way of assignment in peace or earmarking forassignment in an emergency.     (Further details are at Annex F).These forces come from all the operational Commandsand comprise aircraft in every combat role.   Tactical transport aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters, and surface-to-air missilesquadrons are also included.    Other forces, which are not formallyassigned or earmarked, remain under national control; but theycontribute to the security of NATO and may be made available forNATO tasks in an emergency.   These forces include, for example,strategic transport aircraft, tanker aircraft and airborne early1-15CONFIDENTIAL
warning aircraft.   Proposals are under discussion in NATO forcertain changes to he made in the NATO command structure which willenable many of these aircraft to he assigned to NATO at an earlyalert stage.Exercises3k.   Throughout the year the Armed Forces have played a full and important part in NATO exercises.   The Royal Navy and the Royal AirForce have participated in several large scale and in a number of smaller scale exercises throughout the NATO sea area.   A distinguishegathering of Ministers of NATO nations, of senior officials of the alliance led by the Secretary General and of members of the NATOMilitary Committee gained a first hand appreciation of british naval and air power at the demonstration SALLY FORTH in July, inwhich a large number of ships of the Fleet, Royal Naval aircraft and aircraft of Royal Air Force Strike Command took part.35.    Britain&apos;s land and air components of the Allied Command   EuropeMobile Force were deployed in three major exercises on the flanks.In September the United Kingdom Joint Airborne Task Force, less one battalion, took part in DEEP FURROW, a combined NATO exercise in turkish Thrace.   The Army element of the Force carried out a parachute assault together with Turkish arid United States parachuteunits as part of a NATO combined parachute force.Commitments outside the NATO Area36.    It remains Government-policy that Britain will continue withinher resources to safeguard her world-wide political and trading interests and to play her part in countering threats to stabilityoutside Europe.    She will honour her obligations for the protectionof British territories and those to whom... she, owes special duty by treaty or otherwise.
For the most part it is planned to meet these commitments outsidethe NATO area from forces whose primary tasks relate to NATO.37.   In South East Asia, new attitudes towards defence aredeveloping.   Less emphasis is &quot;being placed on collective defenceorganisations; and nations in the area are now seeking greaterself-sufficiency in defence matters, ii While the possibility of external attack cannot be discounted, nations recognise a primeneed to co-ordinate economic, social and security measuresthrough regional groupings in order to counter Insurgency andsubversion.   This was recognised by member nations of SEATO when,at their Council meeting in September 1973, they agreed that infuture the Treaty Organisation should concentrate on assistingregional members in discharging the responsibility, which theyalone can carry, for defeating insurgency, rather than upon formalplanning against the contingency of a massive external threat.38.   Britain welcomes these developments.   British force contribu-tions in the Far East and Indian Ocean areas help to maintainstability there.    They are also available to provide training and assistance to local forces as required.   The arrangements for thedefence of Singapore and Malaysia continue to be supported by allFive Powers.    Britain, like New Zealand, will continue to contributeland, naval and air forces.     Australia has decided to withdraw her armycontribution from the ANZUK Force, but her air defence and naval contri-butions will continue.    Some consequential changes will be made in the
command and co-ordination of the forces remaining in Singapore,and in their administrative and logistic support.   Britain willcontinue her membership of 8EAT0, and will maintain her commitments to Hong Kong and Brunei.39.   Ships should operate as far as possible in self-sufficientgroups for efficiency and economy and in order to enable them to train together.   Some single ship deployments will continue tobe made, but for the most part destroyers and frigates will infuture operate in groups of ships.   East of the Cape the groupswill be of five to six ships, and in this way one group will be inthe area for up to ten months of the year.   A small number of ships,including frigates based in Hong Kong and Singapore, will be permanently maintained in the area.hO.   Recent events have confirmed the vital importance to the west of stability in the Middle East and the Gulf.    Within the termsof her strategic priorities Britain seeks to encourage stabilityby way of assistance to friendly states in the development and train-ing of their defence forces, by providing seconded personnel andequipment and by visits and operational exercises.    Britain willcontinue her membership of CENTO.Oil) ihi,   The Services are playing their part, with the civilian population as a whole, in reducing oil consumption.   But adequate ,war reserves are being retained and essential operations andtraining continued, both by Britain and by the Alliance as a whole.NORTHERN IRELANDU2.    Throughout 1973 the Armed Forces have continued to be heavily
committed in Northern Ireland in helping the civil power to upholdlaw and order and to combat terrorism.ii3.    It has always been the Government&apos; s aim to obtain a political solu-tion and to put an end to unrest and violence; and the Armed Forces&apos;operations against the terrorists have continued to be conducted to make this possible.   The major programme of constitutional measures has been designed to create new political institutions which will command a wide measure of support from all sections of the population, andwill thereby help to overcome the mutual fear and mistrust whichare the root cause of the troubles.   If this programme is to succeed in achieving peace and co-operation between the communities,the people must be free from the constant fear of violence, intimidationand subversion.idi.   The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)has continued to be the main threat to peace in 1973.It has directed its campaign of violence particularly at the security forces, but with a callous disregard for civilian casualties.   There have also been continuing acts of violence, thoughon a smaller scale, by extremists from the majority community;    andthe major risk has remained one of sectarian strife.   The Armed forces have pursued a steady campaign against terrorism from whatever source.They have conducted it with the utmost care to avoid unnecessaryinconvenience to law-abiding citizens.us.   By their rigorous work throughout the year to frustratelawlessness the security forces have greatly undermined the strengthof, and support in the community for, the terrorist organisations;the level of violence has been significantly reduced;   and therehas been a period of steady progress in restoring law and order.
Public confidence in the processes of law and order has been increased; the border poll, and subsequently the local governmentand Assembly elections, were able to take place peacefully.Extremist organisations have been roundly rejected by the electorate.These improvements in the situation can be attributed to the effectiveness and manifest impartiality of the security forces.   they made possible towards the end of 1973 a small reduction in theRegular force level in the Province to 16 major&quot;units in the infantrjrole, plus armoured reconnaissance, Royal Engineers and supportunits, amounting to about 15,500 men and women.U6.   Agreement was reached in November 1973 to form a power sharingexecutive, which fully satisfies the requirement of the NorthernIreland Constitution Act that it is likely to be widely acceptedthroughout the Community.   At a conference in December 1973 betweenthe British Government, the Irish Government and the parties involvedin the Northern Ireland Executive (designate) It was agreed to register at the United Nations the declarations of the British and irish Governments on the status of Northern Ireland, to set up a council of Ireland and to take various measures relating to the main-tenance of law and order in any part of Ireland.hi.   The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act came into forcein August, and has greatly helped the forces of law and order by introducing procedures recommended by the Diplock Commission to overcome difficulties in bringing terrorists to justice.   The Actalso provides the Armed Forces with essential emergency powers ofsearch, entry and arrest.U8.    in the past year 1,1+09 people have been arrested and charged
with terrorist offences,  of which 147 relate to murder or attemptedmurder.    392 people were given Detention Orders under the NorthernIreland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 (or the preceding Order inCouncil).    1,595 firearms, 187,399 rounds of ammunition and almost32 tons of explosives have &quot;been recovered.   These successes arereflected in the gradual but significant reduction in violentincidents and the increasing use by the Provisional IRA of youths andwomen to conduct their operations.   There have been 76 rocketattacks by the IRA during which 119 rockets have been fired.    110mortar bombs have been fired on 23 occasions, often in conjunctionwith rockets and concentrated small arms fire.   The level of bombing,averaging 81 explosions a month, was lower than in the previous year,when there was an average of 115 a month.    This general level included a steep rise in November when, during the 11 days leading up to the beginning ofthe Ulster Volunteer Force ceasefire on 18 November, 58 bombs were plantedby Protestant extremists, of which 1+2 exploded.   The number ofshooting incidents, averaging 418 a month, of which about two-thirdsinvolved the security forces, was less than half the number theprevious year; and the number in the last few months of the year-o &quot;b -was less than half the number during the first few months.k10.   The weakening of the terrorist forces in Belfast in particular,and the arrest of many of their leaders, has forced them to redirecttheir activities to the border and rural areas, using bombs andbooby-traps, mainly against security forces.    In recent months anumber of unapproved crossing points have been effectively closed.Service casualties, particularly those caused by ambushes and bombs,were relatively high in the early part of the year, but have sinceshown a marked reduction.-1-21CONFIDENTIAL

Much of the Armed Forces&apos; success has heen due to the carefulgathering of intelligence as the co-operation of the public hasbeen encouraged and increasingly gained by the overcoming ofintimidation.   Close surveillance has been maintained on areas where terrorists or their munitions are likely to be, and suspectedsupply routes intercepted.   The special task force of theRoyal Ulster Constabulary and the Royal Military Police which was set up in December 1972 has achieved success in countering therise in sectarian murders.   The Royal Military Police areproviding assistance to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in restoringnormal policing where the situation permits, and a second RoyalMilitary Police regiment has been formed in the last year.51.    Invaluable support continues to be given to the Army by theother Services in Northern Ireland.   Royal Marines Commando Groupshave been undertaking peace-keeping duties in the infantry role. Sapof the Fleet together with Royal Air Force long-range rescue craftmaintain anti-gun running patrols.   A squadron of the Royal Air ForceRegiment is responsible for the protection of Aldergrove Airport andin the last year another Squadron has served on emergency tour inthe infantry role.   Naval accommodation ships have continued toprovide quartering for troops.52.   The Royal Air Force transports troops and equipment to andfrom Northern Ireland, and their helicopters give valuable support in operational situations.53.   The Ulster Defence Regiment has continued to provide an efficient force and an invaluable aid to the Regular Forces.5k.

continue to mount an unrelenting and severe campaign against terrorism, from whatever quarter it may arise.MANPOWERThe Services.55.   As we had foreseen, the Services had to contend with considerablerecruiting problems during the year;   we expect that only about/&quot;25,000^ Servicemen will be recruited, compared with 39,000 in1972-73.   Although all the Services have been affected, the reductionhas been especially marked in the case of the Army.   But mainly because of the good recruiting results in the period 1970-72 therehas as yet been no serious reduction in the strengths of trained personnel.56.   The raising of the school-leaving age to 1.6 inevitably reduced the recruiting pool, and this was bound, even if only temporarily, tohave a marked effect upon the number of recruits.    Other causes ofthe sudden decline in recruiting are more difficult to isolate andassess.   Primarily because of the raising of the school-leaving age,it is extremely difficult to forecast future recruiting trends withany confidence;   but it seems unlikely that there will be an immediatereturn to the high recruiting levels of recent years.Civilian Staff57.   The total number of civilian staff employed by the Ministryof Defence on 1 April 197h is expected to be about /&quot;315,000j7.The     expected   reduction of /&quot;&quot;10,000^7 between 1 April 1973 and1 April 197h, is a result largely of a shortfall in recruitment.
The total number includes some ^&quot;&quot;19,000^7 employed in the royal ordnance Factories whose salary costs will, subject to the making &apos;of the necessary Order under the Government Trading Funds Act, 1973,be met from a Trading Fund instead of from Defence Votes.DEFENCE ORGANISATION58.   A start has been made in implementing the first stage of theplan for the rationalisation of Research and Development Establishmentsdescribed in the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1973 (Cmnd. 5231).Work is continuing on plans for the second stage.59.   Following the recommendation of the Report on government organisation for Defence Procurement and Civil Aerospace (Cmnd. 4641)the Controllerate of Guided Weapons and Electronics was disbanded on1 August 1973 and its functions absorbed by other controllerateswithin the Procurement Executive.DEFENCE BUDGET60.   The Defence Budget Estimates for 1974-75 total /&quot;       mJ7 andrepresent approximately      %J of the Gross National Product;details are shown in Annex A.61.   A Defence Budget target for 1974-75 was contained in Cmnd. 5519(Public Expenditure to 1977-78).    The target was subsequently reducedby  178m. at 1973 Survey Prices, to take into account the Defenceshare of the reductions in public expenditure announced on 17 December1973.   As a result the target for 1974-75 is now  3,257m. at Survey1973 Prices.   Defence Estimates, 1974-75, are in line with the target,taking into account the adjustments set out in Annex A, Table 1.62.   The reduction of  178m. (1973 Survey Prices) comprises reductions of 20% ( 16m.) on the planned capital expenditure element, excluding
married quarters, of the Department of the Environments DefenceWorks Vote,  and 10$ ( 162m.) on Defence expenditure on goods and services (less wages and salaries); and has been allowed for in preparing the Estimates.63.   In accordance with the undertaking given in Cmnd. 52h5 in response to a recommendation by the Expenditure Committee,  expendi-ture on medical services, education and married-accommodation includedin the Defence Budget has been identified (Annex A, Table 1 (Note 2)).This expenditure of ^f       nw/ represents about  &quot;    %Jf of total defence expenditure or  &quot;    %J of GNP.61*.   Because Defence Estimates were fundamentally recast in 1970and further changed on the creation of the Procurement executive in 1972,  it has been agreed that the form of Ministry of DefenceVotes should not be changed at this stage to conform with revisionsmade in Civil Estimates.    Some changes in style and coverage have however been made to ensure compatibility.   These are reflected inthe Tables in Annex A.65.   Pending Parliamentary approval of an Order introducing a tradingfund for the Royal Ordnance Factories in accordance with Section 1of the Government Trading Funds Act, 1973, Class 1 includes anestimate for this organisation (Defence Vote 12).    When the tradingfund is introduced consequential changes in Defence Estimates willbe made.   Further reorganisation of the Procurement Executive hasresulted in the distribution of the guided weapons and electronicsVote (formerly Vote 12) among the sea,  land and air systems Votes.Finally,  in order to align Estimates more closely with the Public
Expenditure Survey classification, Defence expenditure of theDepartment of the Environment (Property Services Agency) is nowincluded as Defence Vote 11.

CONFIDENTIALEQUIPMENT30.   Major equipment changes during 197U-75 are as follows:a. JaguarsDeliveries to the Royal Air Force of both the single-seatGR1 and the two-seater T2 training version of theJaguar have begun.   The GR1 will initially replacePhantom figures in the attack role in Strike Command.The planned build-up rate of the Jaguar force is high.By the end of the period the Operational Conversion Unitat Lossiemouth will have reached virtually its full permanentstrength, and the first two operational squadronswill be well advanced towards taking over from theStrike Command Phantom FGR2 squadrons.b. PhantomsPhantom figures replaced by Jaguars will be transferred to theair defence role where they will provide an improved capability.c. BuccaneersAn additional Buccaneer squadron will begin to formin Strike Command.   Further aircraft are on order.d. NimrodsPreparations for the communications refit programme are continuing.   Additional Nimrods are on order.e. Vulcan SR2sThe Vulcan SR2 will replace the Victor in the strategicreconnaissance role in the course of the year.f. Victor Mark 2sConversion of Victor Mark 2s to the tanker role isprogressing well.   The first aircraft to be convertedwill enter service this year.
ShackletonsThe build-up of Shackletons converted to provideairborne early-warning radar cover has been completed,and the force has proved its value in the role.HarriersA number of the earlier aircraft have been re-equipped with more powerful marks of the Pegasus engine, and theimprovement programme is continuing.   Additional$Harriers were ordered last year.HS125sAdditional HS 125s, in an improved version, have been added to the communications fleet in Strike Command.The HS 12$ has been particularly useful in providingrapid travel at short notice between London andNorthern Ireland and to the Continent.JetstreamJetstreams are now being delivered to Training Commandto replace the Varsity as a multi-engine pilottraining aircraft.BulldogThe Bulldog continues to replace the Chipmunk in theUniversity Air Squadrons.CartelThis Anglo-French air-to-surface guided-weapon isentering service with the Royal Air Force to provideBuccaneer aircraft with a stand-off capabilityagainst surface targets on land and sea.
m.     RapierThe Royal Air Force Regiment has received its first. deliveries of this low-level surface-to-air weaponsystem.   The first operational squadrons will form inRAF Germany later in the year,  iin.     United Kingdom Air Defence Ground environment the L1 building at West Drayton, which forms thefinal part of the Linesman project, has been handed/&apos;    over to the Royal Air Force in preparation for fulloperational service.   It will be known as the air defence Data Centre.   The Sector Operations/Controland Reporting Centres which are being developedat two former Master Radar Stations will tcome into service this year. They will be able to operate independently from other elements in the -air defence ground environment, and this will add to the ability of the system to withstand attack.A specialist team has been set up to plan further improvements in the system,o.     Laser rangingLaser ranger/marked target seeker will come into service in Jaguar aircraft during the year.OPERATIONS AND EXERCISESNORTHERN IRELAND31.   An account of operations by the security forces in NorthernIreland in 1973 is given in Chapter I.
&apos;    : W: IICELAND32.   On 19 May 1973, Royal Naval ships and aircraft of the RoyalAir Force, which had been available in case of need since Iceland Iunilaterally extended her fishing limits in September 1972,- wereIordered to help protect British trawlers fishing on the high seas 1off Iceland from interference by Icelandic coast guard patrol vessels.   A squadron of three frigates, supported by Royal Fleet   !Auxiliary ships, tugs chartered for the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and Royal Air Force reconnaissance aircraft, opeIin the disputed area until 3 October and were stood down on 13 Noviwhen an interim settlement of the dispute was reached.   The operatjjenabled fishing to continue . at a high level and was carried out wildetermination and forbearance in difficult political circumstances,jTHE NATO AREAOPERATIONSSurveillance and Interception33.   Royal Naval vessels and Royal Air Force Nimrod long-rangepatrol aircraft have continued to monitor the movements of Russiannaval forces operating in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic.Royal Air Force air defence aircraft continued to intercept numbersof Russian aircraft around the coast of the United Kingdom.   Theuse of air-to-air refuelling tankers for this type of operationhas increased the average range from the United Kingdom of suchinterceptions; the additional use of Shackleton airborne early warning aircraft has improved the interception rate for targets atilow level or at extreme range.Hydrography&apos;5h.    Survey vessels of the Royal Navy have continued their surveyinand charting operations, providing essential navigational informatifor defence purposes and commercial shipping interests.II - 18CONFIDENTIAL    .
MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY35.   The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have carried outnumerous search, rescue and medical evacuation flights.    In May thRoyal Navy won, for the third year in succession, the Henri DutiantTrophy in the International Search and Rescue Competition.36.   Royal Naval mine countermeasures vessels, a fast patrol boat,helicopters and aircraft have maintained fishery protection patrolin home waters.   Aircraft and surface vessels of the Royal Navyhave given increasing assistance to the Department of Trade andIndustry in surveillance of the traffic separation scheme in theDover Straits, in which the French Navy also particpates.37.   Royal Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams and helicoptersassisted in the recovery and disposal of large quantities of.ammunition washed ashore in the West Country from the vessel Galil38.    In October 1973 a Royal Naval destroyer and f-rigate went tothe aid of the burning freighter Barrad Crest off Portland Bill,extinguished the fire and towed her to Devonport.39.   Help was provided by Royal Naval ships and helicoptersin the rescue of the miniature submarine Pisces off the coast ofIreland in August.kO.   Men of all the three Armed Services won widespread admirationfor the assistance they gave in maintaining essentialfire    cover     in Glasgow ih October and November 1973.   Theyanswered more than hOO emergency calls and dealt with a number of major outbreaks of fire under the guidance of officers of the glasgow Fire Brigade.    The operation was a model of co-operationbetween the Services.

3V/IPT MOVE in the NATO Eastern Atlantic and Allied Forces northern europe areas.    In addition our maritime, air, amphibious and airborneforces participated in an Allied Forces Southern Europe Field3&apos;raining Exercise, DEEP FURROW 73:.    Each of these exercises demon-!demonstrated the flexibility of our. forces and 1 our ability to supportthe Alliance over a wide area.t6.   The&apos;&apos;&apos;Royal Navy have again contributed to numerous NATOexercises designed to practise specific activities such as mine:ountermeasures and operations against fast patrol boats.    There has alsbeen a full programme of national exercises.   Participation in theactivities of the larger national and NATO maritime headquarters has provided valuable experience for the Naval Reserves, whom we rely on tomgment headquarters personnel.    A squadron of Royal Naval Reservednesweepers also deployed to Canada for Exercise MAPLE HAUL.   The?oyal Navy has continued to provide many of the submarines for NATOexercises.   NATO naval and air forces from several nations havejarticipated in our Joint Maritime Courses in northern waters andLn the work-up training provided at Portland.    Bilateral maritimeexercises have been carried out with several nations includingPrance and the United States.[7.   Despite operational commitments in Northern Ireland, Armymite in the United Kingdom and BAOR have continued a full programme11 rf training.    Seven reduced battle groups carried out successfulLive firing exercises for armour, artillery,  infantry and engineers*t Suffield in Canada; a series of full battle group exercises is
due to start in May 197U.   Units have also exercised in Denmark,Germany, Italy, Norway and the United States.h8.    Royal Air Force aircraft of Strike Command, Near East AirForce and RAF Germany participated in a wide range of national andEATO exercises and competitions throughout;ithe year.    The UnitedKingdom Joint Airborne Task Force was deployed to Turkey as partof the NATO Exercise DEEP FURROW 73, airlifted by the tactical air transport squadrons of Strike Command.   The Royal Air Force has played a full part in the bilateral squadron exchange programme,and several squadrons have conducted their armament practice campsat the NATO Weapons Training Centre in Sardinia.    Royal Air Forceaircraft have also competed in international weapons and reconnais-sance competitions,  and won the Day/Night section of the allied forces Central Europe Tactical Reconnaissance Competition, ROYALFLUSH 73.SALLY FORTHUS.    In July 1973 in the Firth of Forth, some 26 ships of the Fleettogether with aircraft of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force strike command provided a demonstration of British maritime capabilitywhich was watched by Ministers and senior military and civilianofficials from many allied countries.   Fleet units present included the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal,   together with thecommando ship HMS Bulwark and the assault ship HMS Intrepid both withRoyal Marines Commandos embarked.    Other vessels taking part included a nuclear submarine and several guided-missile destroyers,  frigates and mine countermeasures vessels.
THE REST OF THE WORLDOPERATIONSUnited Nations Emergency Force in Egypt50.   In response to urgent requests from the United Nations on25 October, aircraft of the Royal Air Force deployed to Cairofrom Cyprus the initial Austrian, Finnish, Irish and Swedishcontingents of the Middle East Emergency Force.    In an airliftcommencing 26 and finishing 31 October kk sorties were flown,carrying a total of 753 personnel,    56 vehicles and trailers andU28,000 lbs of other freight.   Later the Royal Air Force was oncall to assist if necessary   in the exchange of prisoners of war.The Army made available essential stores to enable the Force tobe deployed to Egypt.    Subsequently1h days1 rations were providedfor the initial deployment of the entire Emergency Force of 7,000men, together with camp equipment.   Warm expressions of appreciationwere received from the United Nations Secretary General and fromthe International Committee of the Red Cross.Oman51.   The Sultan of Oman&apos;s Armed Forces, which include loan personnel from the three Services, continued with the operations in Dhofar,the south-west province of Oman.   British Army and Royal Air ForceRegiment personnel are deployed in support of the Royal Air Forcedetachment at Salalah in the defence of the airfield against rebelattacks.   A party of Royal Engineers has been assisting in militaryand civil development projects in Dhofar.Beira Patrol132.   The patrol off Beira to enforce the United Nations resolution was maintained.
The West Indies53.    Ships of the Fleet have continued to maintain a presence in the West Indies.The Gulf5u.    KM Ships made regular visits to the Gulf area during theyear.   Royal Air Force aircraft have made extensive use of theCENTO air route over Turkey, Iran and the Gulf to the Far East.Some of our aircraft have staged through Iranian and other Gulfairfields.Hong Kong55.    The garrison, comprising a Land Force Headquarters and two infantry brigades supported by Royal Air Force helicopters, was available to assist the civil authorities in assuring the securityof the Colony.   A detachment of the Royal Air Force Regiment was maintained at Kai Tak.   HM Ships have carried but guardship andpatrol duties in the Colony throughout the year.   Royal Air Forceoperational aircraft have frequently been deployed to the Colonyduring the year.Far East Visits56.    The first of the visits East of Suez by larger ships announced in the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1972 (Cmnd. /+891 ) was madeby the cruiser HMS Tiger and HM Submarine Dreadnought withaccompanying frigates and support ships.   A series of ship visits to.friendly countries and exercises with friendly navies were carriedout on route.    Ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy were in company for parts of the deployment.   Numerous Royal Air Force operationalflights have been made to Singapore during the year.Hydrography57.   An Ocean Survey ship, HMS Hydra, completed surveys in the&apos; &apos;   II - 2hCONFIDENTIAL
Solomon Islands to facilitate the passage of large ships throughft^rtHnflBip^&apos;&apos;1&apos;&apos;&apos;- &apos;,&apos;&apos;^)&apos;&quot;^ &apos; &quot;previously inadequately charted channels.   Coastal survey vesselsHMS Fox and HMS Fawn carried out surveys in the Leeward Islands.The Ice Patrol ship HMS Endurance continues her surveys in Graham land and the South Shetland and Falkland Islands;   she also supported the Joint Services Expedition to Patagonia.Aerial Surveys li58.   During the past year the Royal Air Force have undertakenaerial surveys of the Fiji Island Group, the Chagos Archipelago and parts of Kenya and Norway.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY59.   The Royal Navy has carried out numerous salvage, search andrescue operations around the world, including,the assistanceafforded by HMS Tiger and HM Submarine Dreadnought to freightersin the Malacca Straits in July 1973, and that provided by the coastal survey vessels in the refloating of the grounded Swedishbulk carrier Ariadne near Antigua.60. ,, A squadron of Royal Engineers undertook a three month road construction project in Kenya at the beginning of 1973.61.   A Gurkha company deployed from Hong Kong for training gaveimmediate relief assistance in Fiji after Hurricane Bebe in June 1973.62.   Army assault boats and outboard motors were made available aspart of the British Government&apos;s contribution to the pakistan government&apos;3 flood relief operations in September 1973.63.   Many Royal Air Force flights were made during the year tobring assistance to distressed people.   These included large scale operations in Nepal and West Africa.    In the former, codenamed
KHANA CASCADE, four Royal Air Force Hercules with Royal Corps ofTransport air dispatchers operated out of Nepalese airfields, andunder increasingly difficult climatic conditions they delivered1,957 tons of relief food supplies to ten isolated dropping zonesin 28 days.    In the latter operation, codenaraed Sahel CASCADE,Hercules aircraft airlifted 2,1+15 tons of food to various places in Mali as part of international famine relief operations in West AflucIn February and May of 1973 Royal Air,Force Hercules aircraft were engaged in relief work in the southern Sudan, carrying 230 tonsof supplies to Juba and Malakal;   Royal Air Force aircraft were used to airlift flood relief supplies to Lahore in August.   RoyalAir Force Britannia aircraft have played a substantial part inOperation LUCAN, the re-settling of Pakistan and Bangladesh citizensthrough the United Nations High Commission for Refugees;    and bythe end of 1973 they had airlifted over 16,000 refugees between thetwo countries.EXERCISES6h.    British forces have again taken part in annual CENTO and SEATOexercises, and in those mounted under the Five Power defence arrangements by the Commander of the Malaysian Integrated Air defence system and the Commander of the ANZUK Force.65.   Army units have exercised during the year in Australia, Brunei,the British Solomon Islands, Belize, Canada, Cyprus, Fiji,The Gambia, Guyana, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, &quot;New Zealand,Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.
II - 27CONFIDENTIAL66;   Royal Air Force aircraft from home and overseas stationspractised regular deployments to the Mediterranean, the Gulf andthe Far East including New Zealand and Australia.   Within CENTO,Royal Air Force aircraft participated in the major Exercises8HAHBAZ (air defence), MIDLINK (naval/air exercise in the Gulf)and ARYA (a bilateral Anglo-Iranian naval/air exercise).   TheRoyal Air Force also staged a fire-power demonstration in Cyprusfor the senior representatives of CENTO.   The Royal Air Force ,Paraclurte Mountain Rescue team based in Cyprus took part in theanrifial CENTO Search and Rescue Exercise NEJAT.   combat aircraft from Strike Command on detachment to Singapore took   !part in exercises with the ANZUK Brigade and with the FivePower Integrated Air Defence System.67.   Royal Marines Commandos have trained in the United States,the Caribbean, Cyprus, the Gulf and Western Malaysia.68.   The annual competition among some of the Commonwealth nations for the Fincastle Trophy for maritime surveillance, which took placin $9f3 under Australian auspices, was won by No, 203 SquadronRoyal Air Force.
IIIRESERVE AND AUXILIARYFORCES1.    The Reserve and Auxiliary Forces are an integral part of the armed Services:    they supplement the Regular Forces in times ofwar and emergency by providing individual reinforcements and formedunits.   They consist of volunteers (most of whom undertake trainingthroughout the year), and of former officers and Servicemen who havea reserve liability following their period of regular or nat ionaL service.2.    The estimated cost   of the Reserve and Cadet Forces and the ulster Defence Regiment is shown in-Annex B.ARMY RESERVES3.    The Army Reserves comprise the individual Reserves and theTerritorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).   The former providea pool of men who are used as reinforcements; the latter,in themain, provides formed units.k.    The primary category of individual Reserves consists ofofficers and men who have served in the Regular Army.   The others are members of the Army General Reserve, which consists mainly of formerNational Servicemen and numbers approximately 179,000 men.   The ArmyGeneral Reserve will cease to exist on 30 June 1974 when the relevantlegislation lapses.   However the individual Reserves of ex-Regularswill, together with the TAVR, provide sufficient reservists to meetthe Army&apos;s NATO and United Kingdom commitments on mobilisation.5.    On mobilisation the formed units of the TAVR would   fillessential roles in either BAOR or the United Kingdom Land Forces.They are trained to a high standard of skill and readiness; this
training includes periods of duty with the regular units with whom they would serve upon mobilisation.    In addition to their training in the United Kingdom, all TAVR units earmarked to NATOwhich have an overseas operational role, continue to train overseasfor a period of 15 days,  once in every three years.    170 units totalling about 10,000 men trained overseas during the last year.6.     The TAVR is at present being reviewed by HeadquartersUnited Kingdom Land Forces to ascertain, within itscurrently defined roles and resources^ the scope for improvements in its organisation and functioning.7.        Two additional infantry battalions or the equivalent, and anadditional engineer squadron, all manned by the TAVR, are to be earraarlto NATO.   The Commander-in-Chief, United Kingdom Land Forces will advise on the choice of infantry units for this task, in the context!of his recommendations following the general review of the TAVR.8.     The TAVR reached a record strength of 59,900 during 1972.This subsequently fell to J on 1 January 1974 (comparedwith 59,300 on 1 January 1973).    It is hoped that the forthcomingrecruiting campaign will lead to an improvement in its manningsituation.THE ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT9. The Ulster Defence Regiment continued to play an importantrole as an integral part of the security forces in Northern IrelandUnder the terms of the Ulster Defence Regiment Act 1973, women haverecruited to the Regiment from August 1973.10. The Regiments duties include guarding key installations, mannicheckpoints and providing mobile patrols; the last is being integralto a greater degree with Regular Army operations and is becoming an
increasingly important task.    The primary tasks of the women membersof the Regiment are searching women for explosives or weapons and undertaking administrative work.   Over 3,000 members of the regiment were called out for full-time duty during the localgovernment and Assembly elections and at the time of the border poll.11.   The overall strength of the Regiment on 1 January 197h was/&quot; J7, including f J7 women.   During 1973 C J7members of the Regiment were killed, as a direct result of terroristactivity, making a total of  &quot;    J since its formation in 1970.ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINESRESERVE FORCES12.   The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Reserve Forces consist of theregular Reserves and the volunteer Reserves.13.   The regular Reserves are ex-regular Royal Navy and Royal Marinesofficers and men, including some 5,000 ratings in the Royal FleetReserve, who have had recent experience of active service;members of the regular Reserves are not required to undertakeperiodic training.   However, most of those in the volunteer Reserves -consisting of the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve andthe Women1s Royal Naval Reserve, whose total strength is some,700 officers and h,h00 Servicemen and Servicewomen - attend eveninginstruction and undertake 1h days annual training.1h.    A review of the role of the Royal Naval Reserve and the Women&apos;royal Naval Reserve is to be undertaken.15.   The Royal Naval Reserve Divisions are based on a number of SeaTraining Centres, Communications Training Centres and HeadquartersUnits in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar.    In wartime, they would assist the Royal Navy by performing tasks such as manning and operating minesweepers, and the support of maritime and other-   Ill - confidential
headquarters in communication and other duties.    In peacetime, their activities include training at sea in eleven coastal minesweepers and assistance in manning Naval headquarters during exercises.   In 1973the Royal Naval Reserve&apos;,minesweepers took part in a NATO exercise,and several of them carried out or helped in rescue operations at sea,16.   The primary task of the Royal Marines! Reserve is to reinforce the regular Corps, and in particular the Royal Marines Commandos.In 1973, some 200 members of this Reserve took part in majoroverseas training with Royal Marines Commando units.   The strengthof the Royal Marines Reserve, at present some 800, is being built up to a planned strength of 1,350.ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE FORCES17.   The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of the regular andvolunteer Reserves and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.   There is no need for a large paid reserve in the Royal Air Force, because onlya few specialist and associated personnel are required to make upthe difference between war and peace establishments.   Regularreservists do not undertake training, because they have acquiredsufficient qualifications during their full-time service.18.   Apart from the officers of the Training Branch (who are theofficers of the Air Training Corps and Royal Air Force sections ofthe Combined Cadet Force), volunteer Reserves of the Royal. Air Forceconsist of a number of specialist members and those members of university Air Squadrons who are not committed to full-time RoyalAir Force service.   Specialist and university members of the volunteer reserve undertake annual camp and weekend training.19.   The Royal Auxiliary Air Force, which will, celebrateits 50th anniversary this year, consists of three Maritime
Headquarters units whose task,  in an,emergency,  is to support No.18(Maritime) Group&apos;s operational control organisation.   Members ofthe Royal Auxiliary Air Force normally attend their units oneevening a week and participate in annual camp and weekend training.They also take part in major defence exercises:    in 1973 units were involved in two such exercises.CADET FORCES20.   The Cadet Forces consist of the Sea Cadet Corps, the ArmyCadet Force and the Air Training Corps, together with the CombinedCadet Force.   Their total strength on 1 January 197h was /&quot;l3h,000j7.In addition to the significant contribution which these forces make to recruitment into the Regular Forces, they constitute a valuablesocial organisation for young people in many localities.21.   The role of the Sea Cadet Corps will be reviewed during 197h.
rvMANPOWER AND CONDITIONSOF service.    As forecast in the 1973 Statement on the Defence Estimates(Cmnd. 5231),  the Services have faced particular difficulties in meeting their recruiting targets, in part because the raising of the minimum school-leaving age has resulted in a sharp, buttemporary, reduction in the number of school-leavers available for employment.   This reduction has been accompanied bvj a greatlyincreased demand for labour in the economy generally, and it hasnot been possible to maintain a satisfactory level of recruitmentinto any of/ the Services.    It is expected that some / 25,000j7Servicemen will be recruited in 1973-74, compared with 39,000 in1972-73.2.     This fall in recruiting has not yet eaused any seriousreduction in the trained strengths of the Services.    It is hopedthat such a reduction can be avoided and that recruiting will againimprove during the coming year, when the number of boys leaving schoolreturns to normal.   Nevertheless, some shortage of manpower is expected in the Army in 1974.    It is clear that the task facing the Services in meeting their manpower targets in the longer term could become increasingly difficult.3.     In addition to the figures in this Chapter, detailed manpowerstatistics are given in Annex G.RECRUITMENT AND RE-ENGAGEMENTDURING 1973-74Mule Officersk.     Royal Navy and Royal Marines.   Officer entries into the Seaman,
Engineering and Supply Branches of the Royal Navy and into theRoyal Marines in the first nine months of 1973-7U continued attheir 1972-73   improved level, with /&quot;229J recruits undertakingfull career commissions compared with 227 in the same period lastyear.    More entrants would have been welcome in the EngineeringBranch, but even so officers on full career commissionswere recruited as against 80 in 1972-73.   The recruitment of graduates and undergraduates to both full career and short servicecommissions remained at about last year&apos;s level.5.     Recruitment of specialist officers into the Royal Navy is satisfactory.   Although there was an increase in the number of qualified doctors recruited, and entry into the medical cadetshipscheme has been satisfactory, it is clear that the current andexpected shortages of doctors will take time to remedy.6.     Despite some improvement full career entries into the royal marines still fell short of target, but once again Increased entriesof short service commission officers helped t(b bridge the gap.Many of these short service officers are proving suitable for transfer later to full career commissions.7. The numbers of Royal Navy and Royal Marines officers recruited from civilian life are given in the following table.Ifi:-	1 April-31 December (9 months)		Percentage difference 1973 over; 1972 (+ or -)	1972	1973	Officer Cadets	219		University Cadets	8h		Direct Graduate Entry Scheme	66		Other Schemes	67		Total	436   &apos;		.

The quality of candidates coming forward for commissions has improved, and this hasbeen reflected in the higher pass rate at the Regular Commissions Board.There have been   record application lists for Army scholarships andentry to Welbeck College.   Again, the quality appears high.9. .   The recruitment of qualified doctors has fallen and is now well,below target.   The number of recruits to the medical cadetship schemeis also below target, but is improving slightly.   Efforts are being madeto recruit more male and female doctors through an advertising campaign.10.   Royal Air Force.    In most branches there has been no shortageof acceptable applicants and officer recruiting targets in 1973-7hare lower than in recent years.    There is a shortage of peoplevdshing to make a full career in some specialist branches, notablymedical and legal.   Graduates form an increasing proportion of the intake,and the recruitment of University Cadets continues to be satisfactory.8.    Army.    The number of regular officers recruited this year is close to the target figure.    The main shortfall still lies in the specialregulaicommission and, to a lesser.extent, the short service commission[categories.   Overall recruiting results are given in the following table:&apos;

/12.    Royal Navy and Royal Marines.    In.the nine months from april to December 1973, ^ 4,000J men were recruited into the Royal navy and /&quot;1,000J7 men into the Royal Marines, compared with 6,467 and1,192 respectively in the corresponding period last year.Recruitment to the Royal Navy was particularly affected by the raising of the school-leaving age.   This eliminated the Royal Navy15-year-old entry which in the nine months April to December 1972had produced some 30^ of the total entry.   Moreover, recruitingfrom the other age groups has not been as good as lastyear.   The manpower shortages in some branches of the Royal Navyhave therefore persisted, and have been aggravated by currentrecruiting difficulties.13.   While retention remains a problem, prolongation rates in theRoyal Navy and Royal Marines have remained fairly constant.   Atthe nine-year point some  &quot;5^%J of Royal Navy and  hl%J of royal Marines personnel prolong their engagements.14.   Army.   The decline in adult recruiting which started in 1972has continued, and the level in the nine months April to December 1973was generally  &quot;       %J below that of the same period in 1972.    the junior entry, however, has been at a higher level than expected, althouseverely limited as a result of the raising of the s chool-leaving age.15.    There has been a steady rise in the proportion of recruits choosinthe 3-year engagement, and a decline in prolongation rates.    Wastage ofboth recruits and trained soldiers continues to give cause for concern.Research has been undertaken into the causes of this wastage;    in thelight of the results of this research a number of /&quot;administrative^measures are being taken to improve the situation.16.   Royal Air Force.   The planned reduction in trained manpowermentioned in Chapter V of the 1973 Statement on the Defence Estimates(Cmnd. 523.1 ) is being achieved by normal wastage and a voluntary
redundancy scheme.    The rate of prolongation to non-pensionableengagements is, as in recent years, entirely satisfactory.    Thenumber of pensionable engagements continues to be subject to control to meet long-term manpower requirements.    In some trades recruitmentfrom civilian life has been disappointing, falling short even of the,year&apos;s unusually modest targets.    There was also a slight shortfall in the number of apprentices recruited.Women&apos;s Services17.   Recruitment to both commissioned and non-commissioned service in the Women&apos;s Services and the Nursing Services continues to be satisfactory.    A study is being undertaken into the future purpose and structure of the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service.ENGAGEMENTSThe Notice Engagement18.   Towards the end of 1973, the first men enlisted on notice engage-ments in 1972 (a system of flexible engagement fully described in chapter TV of the 1972 Statement on the Defence Estimates - Cmnd. h891)became eligible to exercise their option to give 18 months&apos; noticeof their intention to leave.    However as this option can be exercised by a Serviceman at any time after it becomes open to him, meaningfulstatistics on the number who opt to give notice, and the stage atwhich they do so, will not be available for some time.19.    In the period April to December 1973 the proportion of recruitseligible to enlist on notice engagements (or in the case of the Armya 3-year notice engagement) who did so was:PercentageRoyal Navy and Royal MarinesArmyRoyal Air ForceAll Services-   iv - confidential

Whether this tendency will, in the longer term, have an adverse effect on trainedstrengths cannot be determined until a more accurate forecast canbe made of the numbers likely to exercise their optionunder the terms of the notice engagement. 7Young Entrants&apos; Option20.    During the last nine months of 1973 some / 8,600J young entrantsreached the age of 18 and became entitled to shorten or vary theirengagement.   The proportion that did so is shown in thefollowing table.
CONFIDENTIALPAY AND PENSIONS21.   In its second report, in June 1973, the Review Body on armed forces Pay took into account Stage II of the Government&apos;s programme for controlling inflation.   The Review Body was satisfied that increases in Service pay of the maximum: amount permitted by the pay code were fully justified, and consequently recommended increases in the Military Salary averaging about 6 $.    The new rates were introduced with effect from 1 April 1973.   The Armed Forces PayReview Body is now engaged on a further review of Service pay inthe context of Stage III of the Government&apos;s counter-inflationprogramme.22.    A further step towards equality of pay was made by increasingthe Servicewomen&apos;s pay rate to 91-?$ (taking into account the differ-,ence in the &apos;X&apos; factor) of the men&apos;s rate.   A start was also made onsimplifying pay rates for young entrants.23.   A new rent rebate system for the Services was introduced.    Thisprovides Servicemen with benefits similar to those available to civilians under the terms of the Housing Finance Act 1972.2k.    The review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme has continued;the second stage, effective from April 1973, resulted in substantial improvements in the provision for invaliding and death benefits formen and women serving in the Armed Forces on or after 31 March 1973or to their widows or dependants.    The third and final stage of the review will be concerned mainly with the effect on the Armed ForcesPensions Scheme of the policies and principles embodied in the social security Act 1973.    This will mainly affect those who do not servelong enough to qualify for an immediate pension on leaving the Service.
CONFIDENTIALCONDITIONS OF SERVICE -Housing for Servicemen and their Families25.   The problems which some Servicemen face in obtaining suitablehousing for themselves and for their families, either in preparation for or immediately after their discharge, are a source of increasingconcern.   Proposals are being considered to alleviate these problems.The Royal Navy has recently introduced a scheme to help certainmarried Royal Navy and Royal Marines officers to buy a house during their service;    this complements the scheme which already exists forcertain married Naval ratings.    The Ministry of Defence is alsoreviewing, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, theadvice given to local authorities on the provision of councilhousing for ex-Servicemen..Family Welfare26.   The report of the Naval Welfare Committee under Lord Seebohmrecommends changes in the welfare arrangements for Naval personnel andtheir wives and families.    It has also made some proposals for improviconditions of service.   Many of the Committee&apos;s recommendations arebeing implemented.    Others are being considered.27.     It is hoped that an Army Welfare Committee, comparable to theNaval Welfare Committee, will shortly be established to review the welfare provision for Army personnel and their families, in relation tthe services provided by local authorities;    to consider ways of preventing or ameliorating social and domestic difficulties;    and-tomake recommendations^28.   The Ministry of Defence is considering extending the HousingCommandant Organisation, which has proved very successful in theUnited Kingdom, to Germany and other overseas Commands.
ffurvther Improvements in Conditions for Troops in Northern Ireland29.   Soldiers on emergency tours in Northern Ireland now qualify for four days&apos; rest and recuperation leave, and are no longer required tomake any contribution towards the cost of their leave travel toGreat Britain or Germany.

The purpose of the Inquiry was &quot;to review the arrangements for providing medical, dental and nursing services for the Armed Services at home and abroad for peace and warin the light of developments in Defence Policy&quot;.^/32.   /&quot;The Committee recommends against the amalgamation of the threemedical services, but proposes improved machinery within the Ministry ofDefence for co-ordinating and rationalising medical and dental services.It makes specific recommendations, particularly in regard to hospitalfacilities, the concentration of specialised services, and the trainingof medical and dental auxiliary staffs.   The Committee recommendsreducing both the number of hospital beds and the number of Servicehospitals to be provided in the United Kingdom.    Because of the wide range of recommendations, examination of the Report will take some time.However, decisions on a number of the recommendations in the Reporthave already been reached.    In particular, it has been accepted thatthere should be no amalgamation of the three separate medical services,and the new co-ordinating machinery recommended in the Report has been set up.   As recommended by the Committee,, an immediate review of the
justification for the new Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital at woolwich has been carried out.   This has confirmed the need forthis military hospital and construction is continuing^.  NOTE:    This passage may require updating in the lightof developments during the next montlu/
8UPP0RTHIGHER DEFENCE STUDIES1.i   The close liaison that the Ministry1 of Defence maintains withthe universities and other academic institutions has continued.Seven Defence Lecturers, whose costs11 are borne on Defence votes,are in post at Aberdeen University, All Souls-College Oxford,Edinburgh University (two), King&apos;s College London (two) and southampton University.    Service officers and Ministry of Defenceofficials have taken part in many other seminars and discussions with the academic world.    Study conferences sponsored by theMinistry of Defence were held at Greenwich (in conjunction with king&apos;s College London) in February 1973 on the themes of low-levelconfrontation and regulation at sea and in September 1973 on1 Britain and the Sea&apos;; at Southampton in April 1973 on Europeanintegration and defence; and in September 1973 at St. Antony&apos;sCollege Oxford on future European security.   Five serving officers have been granted Defence Fellowships for the current year, atBrunei University, King&apos;s College London, Glasgow University and southampton University (two).2.        The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces keep in close touch with the work of organisations outside government whichpromote study and informed discussion on issues of defence interest.
INITIAL AND SPECIALIST training royal NAVY AND ROYAL MARINESSpecial Duties Officer Candidate Training3.     Special Duties candidates courses are provided for non-technicalratings selected for commissions on the Special Duties list.    In thepast,  the courses lasted two terms and were held in HMS St.Georgeat Portsmouth.    In January 1974 they were reduced to a single term and moved to Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, where special duties candidates now train alongside Direct Entry Officers.Seaman Officer Branch Structure and Training4.     The 1972 Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 1+891)referred to the progressive introduction of the Principal WarfareOfficer trained both to &quot;fight the ship&quot; and give the Captainco-ordinated advice on operational matters covering all aspects of warfare.   The consequential changes in structure are now beingreflected in schemes of complement throughout the Fleet.Training courses started in 1972 and are running well.   Thequestion of further training at a later stage is being considered;it ha8 already been decided that some officers should receive more advanced training in navigation.Introduction of an Operations Branch5.     Following the introduction of the Principal Warfare Officerconcept, the structure of the Seaman rating branch has been reviewedto take account of the consequential increase in the importance ofthe Seaman&apos;s weapon and sensor operating skill, the greaterresponsibility delegated to Seaman ratings in the Operations Room,
and the growing area of common ground between the tasks of Seamanratings of the Communications Branch within the Operations Room.As a result, the present Seaman and Communications Branches will/pearly in 1975^7 be combined into a single Branch, which will be known as the Operations Branch, and will involve important structuralchanges in the Seaman Branch.   These will include the abolition of specialist Qualifications, which now/ exist side by side with the substantive rate, and the creation from them of a number of specialist sub-branches - for example, Missile, Sonar, Radar - eachof which will have its own separate roster for advancement.    This,together with the relation of training to a man&apos;s rate, will bringSeamen more into line with the rest of the Service in terms ofBranch   structure, training and advancement.National Recognition of Royal Naval Technical Training6.     Good progress has been made in the negotiations toensure that all Artificers and Mechanicians achieve anationally recognized qualification on;completion of naval training.These awards embrace Ordinary National Certificates in engineering and various City and Guilds of London Institute Certificates inMechanical and Electrical Engineering at Part 2 level.    Ratings ofother specialisations are also able to qualify for awards of city and Guilds Craft Certificates in appropriate subjects.    the engineers    Registration Board of the Council of EngineeringInstitutions (CEl) has recognised:a.     all Special Duties List officers in the EngineeringBranch and all Artificer and Mechanician Chief Petty
Officers in the Submarine Service who have successfullycompleted the Long Nuclear Training Course, and whohave four years1 experience in the First Class rate,as being eligible for registration as TechnicianEngineers (CEI);b.      all Artificers and Mechanicians with one year&apos;experience following the successful completion of their training as eligible for registration&quot;as technicians (CEI).ARMYDegree Training7.      170 serving officers and 13 University Cadets are readingfor degrees in Engineering and Applied Science at the Royal Military-College of Science.    In addition 79 serving officers and 101University Cadets are at universities.Officer Training Review8.        The Committee on Army Regular Officer Training is in theprocess of completing its fact-finding phase and is expected to make its recommendations to the Army Board late in 197h.Training of Juniors9.     In the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1969 (Cmnd. 3927)it was announced that the Army was examining the arrangements for.training the junior entry.    This study has been completed with thefollowing results:a.     the Junior Tradesmens&apos; Regiments located at Rhyl andTroon will close by 1 April 197^;
ilb. the training of Junior Infantrymen is to he completed at Divisional Depots, enabling the purpose-builtfacilities at Shorncliffe to be used for the InfantryJunior Leaders Battalion.   This change will allow theArmy to close the hutted camp at Oswestry by 1 April 1975;c. the Junior Leaders Regiment of the Royal Corps of transport i       &quot;7/------. - I \     -:. &apos; &apos; // ?. -    - &apos;       ; -will join its Royal Artillery counterpart at Bramcotesometime after September 1976.    The&quot; camp at Taunton willbe retained as a reserve;d. the Junior Leaders Regiment Royal Engineers is to move from Dover to join the Army Apprentice College atChepstow some time after January 1975.   This will enablean adult unit to be located in the well provisionedbarracks at Dover.10.   These changes will lead to a substantial reduction in both military and civilian posts, with a significant saving in expenditure.ROYAL AIR FORCEGround Training11.   A revised pattern of command and staff training is being introduced in the Royal Air Force by stages.   Details of this -organisation were given in the Statement on the Defence Estimates1973 (cmnd.. 5231).
12. An officer may expect to undertake a series of training courses sprefthroughout his career on the following pattern:-Initial OfficerTraining(1h weeks)RAF HenlowRAF College,Cranwell.Initial SpecialistTrainingas appropriatefollowed byappointment astrained officer.Officers CommandCourse&quot;I (U weeks)taken by Flt/Ltswho have between3 and 6 years service in pre-paration forjunior Commandposts.RAF Tern Hill.-AIndividualStudies Ccl(conducted [correspondelover 18 morjto improveoff icer&apos;disability.Basic StaffCourse(h weeks)attended bySqn/Ldrs toprepare forinitial -command and Staff    -appointments. .RAF Staff College,Bracknell.&quot;7Advanced StaffCourse(6-g- months)attended bysenior Sqn/Ldrs andjunior Wg/Cdrs: toprepare for highgrade Command and staff appointments.RAF Staff College,Bracknell.4Air WarfareCourse &apos;(17 weeks)attended byselected Wg/Cdrsand junior Gp/CaptsTo train in plannirand executing air operations.RAF College,Cranwell.Each course is designed to prepare an officer for increasedresponsibility associated with the appointments he may expect to take upas he becomes more senior.
13.   The organisation of, and resources available to, TrainingCommand have been reviewed as part of the continued search foreconomies in training.   The Headquarters, 2k Group, at Rudloe Manor -responsible for ground training - has been closed and its taskstransferred to the Headquarters of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Training Command, at Brampton, with a saving in staff.Concurrently training tasks have been reviewed; in order to make better use of resources a number of redeploym-ents are taking placeallowing the closure of Royal Air Force Stations Spitalgate, Manby,Debden and Upwood. \FLYING training royal AIR FORCE AND ROYAL NAVY    ..1k.   A new pattern of pilot training is being introduced this year.It will enable training time to be reduced without lowering standards;and it will permit selection for specialist advanced flying training to be made at an earlier stage; both will result in economies.    coupled with the new system, pilot training tasks will be redeployed within theRoyal Air Force Training Command:    this too will lead to sxibstantxaleconomies / partly because the number of stations in active use can bereduced; Royal Air Force ..... will be closed J,   Operationalflying training is being studied in the hope of achieving further economies, particularly in the use of high-performance aircraft.This new pattern of training will not affect the arrangements whereby the Royal Air Force provides elementary flying training for Royal Naval helicopter pilots; Royal Naval flying trainingbeyond the elementary stage is already confined to the air stations at Yeovilton, Portland and Culdrose.
15.   The Jet Provosts, Gnats and Hunters continue to fulfil anessential role in flying training.   Recent changes in flying training include the following:a. the training of pilots on multi-engined aircraft will begin   shortly    on the Jetstream, which willprogressively replace the Varsity in this role;;   &apos; .&apos;.&apos;\ &quot;:   IIb. the Gazelle helicopter, now in service, will eventually be used for Royal Navy and Royal Air *Force helicopterpilot training;c. the Jaguar Conversion Team started its work-up atRAF Lossiemouth in September 1973; it will shortlycomplete conversion training of pilots for thefirst two operational squadrons, before expandingto full Operational Conversion Unit status to handle conversion training for the subsequentsquadrons and post-graduate Jaguar operational training;d. Jaguar flight simulators will be brought into service in Germany and in this country during the year;e. .  Argosy aircraft are being converted for the trainingof navigators, air electronics operators and airengineers;f. re-equipment of the University Air Squadrons withthe Bulldog, replacing the Chipmunk, is well advanced.
twrnatlon of. a Royal Naval Rating Aircrewman Branch16.  The existing system whereby Naval ratings from various brancheshave been loaned for aircrew duties will be terminated with the estab-lishment of a Rating Aircrewman Branch in the Royal Navy on 1 April 197h.The new Branch will provide a career with an advancement structurebased on the development of aircrew skills, and will supply theexpertise and numbers required for the/&apos;sophisticated helicoptersof the future.ADVENTUROUS TRAINING17,   It is now two years since the trl-Service Adventurous training programme was instituted, and much has&quot; been achieved in this time.Joint Service Training Centres have been set up to give instruction in mountain training, ski-ing and off-shore sailing.   Temporaryarrangements for training in gliding, free-fall parachuting, and&apos;sub-aqua diving will continue until permanent centres for these activities can be established.COMMONWEALTH AND FOREIGN TRAINING18,   The Services assisted other nations last year by receivingmore than 6,000 officers and men from overseas on training courseswithin the United Kingdom, and by providing personnel to othercountries to help with local training.
PRODUCTION, REPAIR AND SUPPLY organisation in THE UNITED KINGDOMHM DOCKYARDS AND THE ROYAL NAVAL SUPPLY ORGANISATIONTlProgramme of Work19.    The Royal Dockyards have experienced for some time difficultlyin recruiting and retaining labour: manning and productivity must be intensified if they are to meet their heavy workload during1974-75.20. Details of work in the Royal Dockyards in the coming year aregiven below:a. at Chatham and Rosyth refitting and refuelling of nuclear submarines will be the major task; Rosythwill continue to specialise in Polaris submarines.This year will see the introduction of a system of nuclear submarine refits at Chatham whereby twoboats can be repaired at once (dual streaming).Both Yards will also undertake refits of surface ships;b. the programme for Portsmouth includes one long refitand two normal refits of guided-missile destroyers,frigate refits, and a three-stream programme ofconventional submarine refits, as well as thecompletion of the normal refit of the assault ship,HMS Intrepid:
c.     Devonport will undertake the refit of the commandoship HMS Bulwark, and will have the major share ofthe Leander plass frigate refits as well as conven-tional submarine refits and nuclear submarinedockings.All these Dockyards, together with HM Dockyard Gibraltar, will undertake work on a variety of other vessels and craft.II21.   Improvements to management systems include new procedures forDockyard resources allocation, refit planning and production control.Work continues on the elaboration of operating accounts, which,among other uses, would be a pre-requisite for the introduction ofa trading fund system of financing for Dockyards.22.   The Royal Dockyard Policy Board, which was formed in 1971,continues to provide a useful means of gaining the views of commerce and industry on Dockyard management policy.    It examines the best use of the financial, material and human resources available to theRoyal Dockyards for the performance of their task.The Royal Naval Supply Organisation23.   To provide support for the sophisticated weapons now enteringservice, multi-purpose workshops are being built at Portsmouth andDevonport.   Each complex is wholly self-contained and able tomaintain a variety of weapons, with an improved standard ofprotection for personnel and equipment should a mishap occurduring assembly and testing.   ;/ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESIntroduction of a Trading Fund2h.   To improve the system for financing the activities of royal ordnance Factories (ROF), a Trading Fund will be introducedV - 11CONFIDENTIAL
subject to the making of an Order under the Government TradingFunds Act 1973.   The ROF Organisation has been preparing steadilyfor its new role, and has operated notional Trading Fund arrange-ments in 1973-7U.   The disciplines and responsibilities of thenew financial regime, coupled with the greater autonomy which the trading Fund will bring, should provide the opportunity and means to improve upon the high standards maintained in the past,Programme of Work25.   Planned production in 1974-75 includes large quantities ofammunition, varying from large shells to small arms ammunition;explosives;    air-dropped weapons;    heavy armoured vehicles andcombat reconnaissance vehicles;     guns of various calibres,including the new light field gun;    cannon and general purposemachine guns;    and contributions to the guided-weapons programme.The ROFs co-operate with the Ministry of Defence1s Research andDevelopment Establishments in development work on, among other things, armoured vehicles, guns and ammunition.   The organisationeleven factories and two agency factories - is expected to produce an output worth about  / I07,ym;    some / kO^fo of this will befor export, including guns and ammunition for our European allies.Capital Investment26.   Capital investment in buildings, plant and machine toolscontinues at a level which will enable factories to meet futureprogrammes efficiently.   Computer facilities are being extendedto be used as aids in the management of production and controlof costs.
ROYAL ARMY ORDNANCE CORPSSUPPORT ORGANISATION27.   The Statement on the Defence Estimates 1971  (Cmnd. h592)outlined plans for a computerised Central Inventory Control Point(GICP) at Bicester, to improve the management of Ordnance materiel.The CICP was opened in April 1972, and the transfer to it of theRoyal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) commodity range is nearly complete.The system is now being extended to overseas-theatres.,   Controlof RAOC stocks in BAOR has been taken over by an Inventory ControlPoint (ICP) at Viersen, directly linked with CICP. II Similar ICPsare planned to begin operating in Berlin and Hong Kong in 1974 andin Cyprus in 1976.   A trial is to be carried out on the use ofsmall mobile computers as inventory points within brigades.28.   A computer-based system is under development to provide a comprehensive spares service in support of equipment sales.ROYAL AIR FORCE ADMINISTRATION and supply ORGANISATIONEconomy in Support Costs29.   Good progress continues to be made with the major review of royal Air Force manpower and support requirements mentioned in chapter V of the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1973 (Cmnd. 5231).This has already resulted in reduction of some / 5,500posts,and should lead to further reductions over the next few years.Reductions have already been made in the quantity of storesordered and reserve stocks already held.     A replacement computersystem for the Supply Organisation will become operational duringV - 13CONFIDENTIAL
1 97U.     Local stock records will be dispensed with and data willbe held centrally, enabling many of the supply processes to beautomated.   As a result many of the clerical tasks at presentundertaken at units and depots will be eliminated.30.   A new Controllerate of Engineering and Supply was set up on1 November 1973, integrating the Royal Air Force Engineering and supply staffs at Ministry of Defence Headquarters under oneController.   This provides a more efficient organisation and will achieve some staff savings.   A further study is examining theextent to which Engineering and Supply staffs should be integratedat Command Headquarters and Royal Air Force stations.Logistic Support Arrangements31. The Command structure has been Improved by the formation on1 September 1973 of Support Command from a merger of MaintenanceCommand and No. 90 (Signals) Group.CO-ORDINATION OF SUPPORT32.   The rationalisation of supply and engineering support hasmade progress.   For example, since March 1)973 the Royal Air force has been responsible for supplying aircraft spares to all three services.   The scheme for rationalising the support of newequipments to be used by more than one Service has gone well.33.   As a result of rationalisation there is a significant and increasing amount of inter-Service supply and other supportactivity.    In order to deal with this more effectively, progressV - 1k
is being made with a four-year project aimed at achievingcompatibility in the late 1970s between the various supportAutomatic Data Processing systems.   This involves the standard-ization of methods, terminology and data in areas where thesesystems overlap.   Eventually it should enable routine inter-Service transactions to be carried out automatically, thusincreasing effectiveness and economising in manpower.3k.   The retrospective codification of all defence materielaccording to the NATO system has been substantially completed.This process has resulted in the elimination of duplicate stocks(estimated at 15%);   moreover the system prevents furtherduplication with new items.   Discussions continue with our NATOallies on possible extensions of the NATO codification system,which would facilitate the international exchange of detailed .information about items of defence equipment, and would be helpful in the support of collaborative projects.MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND TECHNIQUESComputer Bureau35.   Work has begun on the building to house a large Defencecomputer bureau, to be sited at Devizes, and completion isexpected in January 1975.Forms Design and Control36. Controls have been set up to stop proliferation of forms and help reduce paperwork.   For the Department as a whole no form can
V -.16CONFIDENTIALbe introduced,  or reprinted with amendments, - without approval of aicentral authority;    this authority is also responsible for introducingcommon forms to meet similar requirements throughout the Ministryof Defence.LANDS37.   The Report of the Defence Lands Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Nugent of Guildford appeared in July 1973 together with an explanatory memorandum (Cmnd. 536k).   The Committee reviewed k65sites covering 629,000 acres out of the total of 757,000 acres inthe Defence estate, and recommended the release of some 31,000 acres.Since publication of the Report there has been a period for publiccomment and discussion of the recommendations.   Examination of theNugent proposals and of the public reaction to them has been carriedout,  and the Government hope to announce their decision shortly.WORKS SERVICES38.   Work continues on the redevelopment of the Naval Bases atDevonport, Portsmouth and Rosyth; in particular, work is underwayon nuclear submarine and frigate refit facilities at Devonport and improved refitting facilities at Portsmouth.39.    Projects will improve working conditions and promote economy   iin Army logistic installations in the United Kingdom.   Work willalso begin on installations for new weapons in BAOR.I4.C   Work will continue to meet the requirements for the introductionof the Jaguar and for operational facilities at Brawdy, Leucharsand Lossiemouth.    The modernisation of storage accommodation atStafford and Carlisle will continue, as will the redevelopment of
Innsworth.   Work will begin on test houses to reduce the noise oftesting aircraft engines.Irt.   All three Services continue to give priority to improvingliving accommodation for single men and women and providingquarters for the increasing proportion of married men.    In theUnited Kingdom about 3,000 new married quarters will be built,  and h //      &apos; &apos; K &apos;((  :the programme of improvements to older married quarters will continuAt the same time every effort will be made to release quarters nolonger required for Service purposes to alleviate the nationalhousing shortage.Ii2.   A great deal of effort is being devoted to improving theemergency accommodation and general amenities for troops in NorthernIreland.   The increasing number of Service dependants in Germanyimposes a large financial burden, especially because of the need tocreate new school places and build NAAFI families&apos; shops.HIRINGSk3;   Hiring married quarters for all the Services will cost about 29.65m.  in 1974-75.   Most of this expenditure takes place, inGermany, where good progress is being made in acquiring more hiringsthe number is expected to reach 24,900 by the end of 1974-75, compare with 19,200 at the start of 1973-74.MOVEMENTSkh.   The movement    of units with their vehicles and equipment toand from Northern Ireland by military and civil shipping and RoyalAir Force aircraft continues to be a major task.
1+5.   The movement by Royal Air Force aircraft of Gurkha soldiers andtheir families to and from Nepal has now operated successfully for more than a year; it has become possible, with the agreement of theIndian and Nepalese Governments, to start moving unaccompaniedbaggage by air as well.1+6.    There has been an increase in the movement of TAVR units and individuals for their overseas training, and in the sea movementof cargo to the training area at Suffield in Canada.1+7.    Winter maintenance of troops oh St Kilda,  off Scotland,  is nowcarried out by helicopter, which provides a better and cheaperwinter service than the sea route. jjMETEOROLOGY1+8.   The demand for meteorological services continues to increase.In 1973 inquiries from industry, commerce and the general public toWeather Centres and other forecast offices were up by 3% (annual&apos;total about 1.7 million) and requests for climatological data and advice also showed a similar percentage increase (annual totalabout 17,000).1+9.   Progress has been made in developing mathematical models of the earth&apos;s atmosphere, and encouraging results are being obtained bytheir use in the study of climatic problems.50.   A small scientific team has been studying the possibility thatthe exhaust gases from supersonic aircraft in the stratosphere might affect the environment.    So far the results of these researches donot suggest any significant effect.51.    The Convention establishing the European Centre for MediumRange Weather Forecasts was signed in Brussels in October 1973; the nucleus of the Centre will be temporarily housed in Bracknell,
pending the design and construction of a permanent building next to the Meteorological Office College at Shinfield Park nearReading.   The Centre, which is supported by 15 European nations,will produce weather forecasts for four to ten days ahead.52.   An internationally sponsored large scale experiment to investigate the atmospheric systems and motions in the Tropics isto take place in the Eastern Atlantic during the period June -September 197k.   The British contribution will include two speciallychartered ships to make surface observations; and also the use ofthe Meteorological Research Flight, whose newly converted C-130Hercules aircraft is ideally suited for the type of aerial observa-tions required in the research programme.COMBINATION OF POSTS IN GERMANY53.   A recommendation of the Select Committee on Expenditure, thatthe posts of Command Secretary of BAOR   and Financial Adviser   to RAFGermany should be combined, has been accepted, and took effect on1 January 197k; the title of this new post is Civil Secretary,British Forces, Germany.    The audit function of the post has been assumed by the Director General of Internal Audit.SALES5k.   Exports of defence equipment continue to make a valuable contribution to national exports.    Overseas sales of defence   equip-ment cover a wide range of items produced both by the private sector of industry and the Royal Ordnance Factories.   The DefenceSales organisation has continued to provide support, assistance
and advice to industry, and exports are expected to reach a value of &amp; &quot;    J7m. in 1974-75.COST AND MANPOWER55.    The cost of support functions, and the Service and civilianmanpower strengths engaged In them, are shown at Annex B.
CONFIDENTIALVIRESEARCH AND development cost OF RESEARCH AND development .     In 1974-75 the total cost of research and development isexpected to he /&quot;:3500m. J.    In the functional analysis of defence expenditure at Annex B, development&quot;costs have, for the first time,been attributed as far as possible to the various categories ofcombat forces which will benefit from the expenditure.   Researchcosts, together with development costs not so attributed, are estimated to be /&quot; 250m.J7 in 1974-75.2.     A supplementary analysis of the total research and development programme sub-divided into six categories is also provided in annex B.    The forecast out-turns for expenditure on research anddevelopment in 1972-73 and 1973-74 on a comparable price basis are &quot; 400m. J and /&quot; 450m.J7 respectively.   The 1974-75 total of/&quot; 500m. J (of which /&quot;&quot;seme 25%J will be spent intramurally)represents of the annual Defence Budget compared withfigures of/&quot;12J% respectively for 1972-73 and 1973-74. /&quot;&quot;the strong upward trend of expenditure due to the recent build up ineffort and the increasing development costs of advanced equipmenthas levelled off.J7&apos;\ RESEARCH3.     The research programme, under the responsibility of the Controllcof Research and Development Establishments and Research,  covers thewhole field of future equipment needs.    Much of it leads directly to specific development programmes, and all of it contributes to the effectiveness of our forces.    Examples Of current programmes are:
the ship and submarine research programme aims toimprove ship design, procurement-and operation.   Workon the development of computer-aided ship design has reached the stage when preliminary programmes for major design items, such as hull form and stability,are now complete;undersea warfare research has made it possible to begin development of new sonar systems and improvements to torpedoes.   New sonar concepts are being studied toextend the range at which enemy submarines can bedetected;    and new computer techniques are being developed to enable more information to be extracted from acoustic signals;in the guided-weapons field, &apos;building blocks&apos;suitable for incorporation into new weapon systemsare being developed to reduce technical risks and costs;    for example, guidance and fuze sub-units from the research programme are being incorporatedinto the new British modification of the United StatesSparrow medium-range air-to-air missiles;research into the use of composite materials in aircraftstructures promises marked weight savings in futureaircraft.   For conventional aircraft structures a newalloy has been developed which is stronger, tougherand less liable to corrosion than those being usednow.

Collaborative procurement of defence equipment offers theUliance the best prospect of reducing the high cost of developingcomplex, modern armaments and achieving standardisation of weapons.Standardisation paves the way for common logistic and trainingarrangements.    The British Armed Services and, industry can fairly:laim to be in the forefront of this movement.    Current collaborative:rojects include the Anglo-German-Italian Multi-Role Combat aircraft and a family of artillery weapons on which the three countries are alsocollaborating; and the various Anglo-French military aircraft and mis-sile projects.   These and other co-operative ventures will account for about 20$ of the money to be spent on research and development in 197U-75.y.    Collaborative development is possible only when the needsof two or more nations are,  or can be made, similar andsufficiently close in date.     The aim in the longer termis to identify the needs so far in advance that national planning can evolve on a collaborative basis.     To that endBritain is an active member of all the Allied organisations whichseek to promote equipment collaboration,  and maintains numerous directbilateral and multilateral equipment relationships with our NATO and
Commonwealth friends.   The effort to reconcile different military,economic and industrial requirements is substantial, and for themost part tangible results are more likely to appear in the 1980sand 1990s than in this decade.DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES 197U-757.     The management of the development programmes is the responsibilit,of the appropriate systems Controller in the Procurement Executive -the Controller of the Navy, the Master-General of the Ordnance, orthe Controller of Aircraft.    The principal projects now in progressare as follows: ,      / ia.     Aircraft and Aircraft Weapons(1)    The Multi-Role Combat Aircraft. . The strike/attack/reconnaissance version of MRCA, which is being developed in collaboration with the Federal republic of Germany and Italy, continues to receive high priority in the aircraft programme.    The swing-wingdesign will give the aircraft great flexibility,and its sophisticated electronic equipment will improve its ability to deliver weapons accuratelyand will permit operations.to be conducted in bad weather, at night and at the altitudes whichwill minimise its vulnerability to defensive systems.Since the beginning of the first phase of full development was authorised in July 1970, good progress has been made with all aspects of the design of theaircraft.    Detailed reviews, completed in July 1971
and March 1973,  of the performance, timescaleand cost confirmed that the aircraft is acceptable to the three Governments.    A further review is planned prior to entering the next stage ofdevelopment.    Initial production planning and. sometooling have been authorised.    Following completionof feasibility studies by the United Kingdom, projectdefinition has now begun on an air defence variantfor the Royal Air Force equipped with an advancednew radar and air-to-air guided-weappns.Lynx.   The Lynx helicopter is at an advanced stage ofdevelopment, and initial production work has begun.Twin-engined, it is notable for its speed and range.It will be an important weapons system for the Navy&apos;snew classes of frigates and destroyers,  enabling themto attack submarines and patrol vessels by means of light-weight torpedoes and the Skua missile (see b.(3)).In peacetime it will also enhance the patrol capability of these ships by carrying out surveillance and recon-naissance.    A utility version is being developed forthe Army for attacking tanks with stand-off guided-weapons and for moving men and supplies rapidly.Hawk.    The HS 1182, now named the Hawk,  is being developed, and is expected to make its first flightthis summer. This aircraft will replace the Gnat
and the Hunter for training pilots to fly fastjet aircraft,  and will thereby help the Royal AirForce to reduce the number of types needed forpilot training.    It will be the first British-designed military aircraft to be built to metricstandards, and will be powered by a non re-heatversion of the Adour engine used in the Jaguar.(k)    Maritime Harrier.    The Project Defini-tion Study of a maritime version of the Harrier has been completed;the question whether or not to enterfull development is still underconsideration.(5)   Nimrod.    Definition studies of a major modificationprogramme for the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft&apos;savionic systems are in progress.   The modificationsare designed to accommodate equipment capable of improved methods of detecting,  shadowing and attackingsubmarines and surface vessels.(6)   New Airborne Early Warning System.    The provision ofa new airborne early warning system in the longer term is being studied; this task is at presentundertaken on an interim basis by the Shackletonforce.(7)    Sea King and Wessex 5 Replacements.    Studies have begun on a replacement for the current types ofhelicopter used in the anti-submarine and commandoassault roles.
(8)    Improved conventional weapons for increasing our air-to-ground attack capabilities in the 1980sare being studied.Guided-V/weapons(1)    Sea Wolf,  a short-range point defence surface-to-air guided-weapon system,  is being developedprimarily to provide s;hips with a defence againstfast low-flying missiles.    Parts of the system havebeen installed in HMS Penelope for sea trials,  andits capability to intercept incoming missiles hasalready been demonstrated.    Sea Wolf will come into service with the Type 22 frigates and certain other ships later in the decade.(.2)   Development continues on an anti-tank guided-weaponfor use from helicopters, to replace the French nsl 1missile.      v(3)    Project definition continues on an all-weather,  sea-skimming,  anti-ship missile for Lynx helicopters,known as Skua.    Skua is designed to be launchedagainst missile carrying patrol craft from beyondthe range of the defensive armament of the target.(h)    Studies are being made of an underwater-launched air-flight anti-surface ship guided-weapon system for use as the main anti-surface ship armament of the submarinefleet from the early 1980s. &quot;(5)   Development has started on a short-range air-to-airmissile for air defence aircraft.J(6)    In 1973 a project definition study was completedVI - confidential
and full development begun on a new Britishhoming head and fuze for the American Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missile already in service withthe Royal Air Farce.(.7)    Sea Dart, a ship-launched1 medium range guided-weaponsystem for area air defence, has been installed inHMS Bristol and is currently undergoing acceptance triaFurther equipments are on order for the Type l\2destroyers now being built, and,for the new cruiser.ElectronicsThe electronics field includes a wide range of projectsdesigned to meet the needs of all three Services.    Projectsvary in size from small night-vision equipments to acomplex communications system for the Army.    The programmeincludes work on navigation, detection, electronic counter-measures,  communications, data-handling and simulation,both in the development of new equipments and in theimprovement of existing ones.n Among current projects are:(1)    Defence Communications Satellites, with improvedperformance and reliability, to maintain a high quality world-wide strategic communications system.They will also provide tactical links to ships at sea and commanders in the field.    Satellites makethe system freer from interference, and allow securespeech communication over long distances.   The firstreplacement for Skynet is to be launched shortlyand /&quot;studies are in hand/work has started^on a follow-on satellite;
radar equipment and avionics for the MRCA,  enablingit to operate in all weathers by day and night;the Ptarmigan tactical trunk communications system for the Army and Royal Air Force in Central Europe;this has a secure automatic digital system with anetwork of computer-controlled switches,  capable of operating to mobile units in the field.    A particularfeature of this system will be a computerised mainswitch for the automatic routing of messages.Together with some of our European allies we are try-ing to identify items of equipment which are of common interest and for which procurement responsibilitiescan be shared on the basis of mutual dependence.;maritime search radars for Nimrod and Lynx capableof detecting ships and submarines in unfavourablesea conditions;a portable tactical instrument approach aid for use attemporary landing sites.    It will be used by STOLcombat aircraft, tactical transport aircraft andhelicopters.    It will also be carried on some warships:a laser ranger/marked target seeker for Harrieraircraft and a laser target marker for forward aircontrollers which will improve their ability to designate targets for battlefield., aircraft;new sonars, with improved detection and classificationcapability for use in frigates;new sonars, for use in submarines, to increase theireffectiveness against the quieter submarines of the next decade; a complementary study into a submarine detection.VI - confidential
CONFIDENTIALequipment system for Royal Naval helicopters isin progress;(9)    electronic warfare equipment for the Royal Air Forceand Royal Navy;(10)    a variety of night vision aids for use on weapons and in vehicles,  improving the Services&apos;  ability tomove and fight by night; .(11)    the DN 181 all-weather tracking radar for use withthe Rapier low-level surface-to-air guided-weaponsystem, which will provide that system with a blindfire capability at night and in poor weather.    Thisradar is in the final stage of development;(12)    An infantry company radar is being developed,d.      Ships and Equipment(1)    Ship Propulsion.    Considerable effort is beingdevoted to research into and development of propulsionunits for the future Fleet.    For surface ships theRoyal Navy has made much, use of gas-turbine enginesderived from aircraft engines, employing the rolls royce Tyne and Olympus.    By the end of the 1970smost new surface units of the Fleet will be poweredby marine gas-turbine engines.    Development work isin hand on both Olympus and Tyne.to increase theirlife between overhauls.    Work is also going aheadto up-rate the Tyne, and feasibility studies of the rolls Royce Spey in marine form are nearing completion.(2)    Submarines.    Design and development work relevant to future miclear submarines and their nuclear propulsionunits continues.VI - 10CONFIDENTIAL

The programme of developmentof non-magnetic machinery for the new class of minecountermeasures vessel has gone well, and the proto-type main propulsion and ships&apos; services dieselengines are now undergoing trials.(k)   Torpedoes.    An advanced lightweight torpedo isheing developed to he launched from helicopters,aircraft and surface ships as a counter to the high-performance submarines expected in the 1980s.    Work   1on improvements to the Mark 2k submarine-launchedtorpedo is also proceeding.(5)   Waste Disposal.    Effort is being devoted to findingbetter ways of dealing with the problem of disposalof all types of waste from HM Ships in a further effort to improve environmental and operationalconditions.(6) Hovercraft and Other Unconventional Craft. studies are continuing of possible uses for hovercraft and .other unconventional craft within the Fleet.Ordnance and Other Army Equipment(1)    Development of two major artillery systems, the155 mm towed FH70 gun and the self-propelled SP70howitzer, continues in co-operation with the federal republic of Germany and with Italy.   When these weaponsare introduced, 155 mm will be the standard calibrefor close and general support guns.   The SP70 will
replace the 105 mm Abbot SP gun, the 155 mm M109 andpossibly the 175 mm M107 equipments.   The FH70 will replace the 5.5 inch medium gun.    Project definition:studies are in progress on a general support rocketsystem with a view to full development in co-operationwith the Federal Republic of Germany and with Italy.(2)   Project definition studies are continuing on thenew mechanised infantry combat vehicle.(3)   Concept studies on the future main battle tank,intended to lead to a programme of co-operativedevelopment, are continuing in co-operation withthe Federal Republic of Germany.    The studies coveran unconventional design without a turret as wellas more conventional designs.    Eventually it is planned to select an agreed design, which will thenbe jointly developed.(4)   Development of a wheeled air-portable armouredliaison vehicle (Vixen) is now well advanced.Development of other light tracked combat vehiclesof the Scorpion family continues.(5)   Prototypes of the combat engineer tractor areundergoing trials.    This equipment will enable theRoyal Engineers to perform many of their tasksprotected by armour; it will dig, bull-doze andwinch, lay trackway, handle pallets; and launch pontoons.It is amphibious,  and it has a rocket-propelledanchor, allowing it to winch itself up steep banks:it should provide considerable help to mechanised
units in river-crossing operations.(6)   The new range of logistic vehicles for battlefieldsupport  is   still -under development.(7)   The development of improvements for Chieftain,including an improved;fire-control system,continues.VI - 13CONFIDENTIAL
