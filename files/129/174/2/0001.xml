bflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(74)   28 January 1974PARLIAMENTARY HOURSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council.        We need to decide urgently whetheror not to change the hours of sitting of Parliament during the present emergency.    The grounds for doing so would be:-*a. to save fuel;b. to ease the staff problems; andc. to reflect in Parliamentary life the seriousness of thepresent situation.In assessing these we would need also to take into account:-d. the implications for the machinery of Government of anychange; ande. the possibility that any change would be perpetuatedbeyond the present emergency in response to pressure that parliament, in particular the Commons, should adjust to amore normal working day.2.        There are two ways of changing the hours.    First, we couldrestrict the Parliamentary week.    In practice we could not, however, get through essential business in 3 days without jeopardising future recesses.A reduction to 4 could be achieved by some trimming of the time on private Members&apos; business.    If this were done, and the facilities of theHouse were not available at all save for essential business on Fridays,there should obviously be a saving in fuel.3. The second course - which might operate in conjunction with sittings a week - is to adjust the Commons working day so that more ofit falls during daylight.    In my view this, if desired, should be done withthe minimum of disturbance to the routines of the House and I would,therefore, envisage no more than a simple shift of sitting times so thatbusiness started at 11. 00 am, instead of 2. 30 pm, proceeded as usualand ended normally at 7. 00 pm, although provision would have to be madefor business that would otherwise be done &quot;after 10&quot;.    Standing CommitteesCOPY NO      tl $CABINET
could meet at their convenience other than during question hour.    Itwould follow, of course, that when the House rose at 7. 00 pm members would have to vacate the Palace of Westminster, and its amenities wouldshut down, otherwise the fuel and staffing objectives would be frustrated.I assess below the significance of a change on these lines by reference tothe 5 factors in paragraph 1 above.4. Fuel. Adjusting the times, but not the duration, of sittings saveslittle fuel on heating: the only savings can come from more use of naturallight.    Much of the Palace of Westminster must, however, always be lit byartificial light.    The House authorities and the Department of the environment state that it is not possible to quantify in any useful way theextent of the savings that would be achieved by sitting normally from11. 00 am to 7. 00 pm.    They estimate that.lighting expenditure has alreadybeen reduced by about 35 per cent since the emergency began.    any additional saving would, therefore, have to be found from an already much reduced consumption.5. Staffing.    There would be an obvious benefit during the currenttransport difficulties to the extent that staff could leave earlier.    the travel problems for staff are, however, most acute for catering staff andthis particular problem has been eased by the curtailment of post-10. 00 pmcatering facilities.6. Presentational.  The question we have to decide is whether itsupports the Governments handling of the emergency better by alteringParliaments way of life in a way which reflects at least in part the disturbance being endured by so many of the public or by maintaining asmuch normality as possible.    Given that we should be hard pressed tojustify a change wholly on grounds of fuel economy and staff convenience,this really becomes the crucial factor;7.        Machinery of Government.    An earlier Parliamentary day would create problems in three areas :-a. Unless changes were made in the periods  of noticerequired, answers to some Parliamentary Questions and private Notice Questions would have to be prepared in lessavailable time.b. Ministers acting collectively would have to fit more of their meetings in at times when the House was sitting, and some ministers would have to field more substitutes either for meetingsor in the House.    Cabinet itself would probably need to meetearlier or later (and there could be a difficult clash with PrimeMinisters Question Time).c. There would be risk of clashes between times of maindebates and of Standing Committees.2
None of these need present insuperable difficulties but it would be wrong to overlook them, especially when, because of the emergency, ministers and Departments are hard pressed.8. Possibility of a permanent change.    Some Members on both sides(but more on the Opposition) would favour a change in Parliamentary hourson these lines as a permanency, and there is a risk of pressure for thisgrowing during an emergency adjustment.    This would be a majorconstitutional step because of its implications for the nature of the membership.    If, however, the terms of the necessary resolution were linked to the duration of the appropriate &quot;3-day week&quot; emergency order,then the House would in due course revert to normal sitting times withoutneed of a further resolution and debate.    At the same time we shouldhave acquired working experience both in the House and in Government ofall that is entailed in a change in hours.    This, in my view, would be ofconsiderable value in calculating our response to what will, I suspect,be a growing body of opinion in favour of a permanent change.9. I have discussed this problem with the Lord Privy Seal who seesno difficulty, over and above those indicated above, in the House ofLords making appropriate adjustments to its working day to match as necessary what is decided for the Commons.    Fuel savings would be even less in the House of Lords because the House rises at an earlier hour inany event.10.       I invite my colleagues to consider -a. whether Parliament should continue to sit for 4 or 5 sittingsa week during the emergency; and/orb. whether there are advantages in adjusting the Parliamentaryday to make more use of daylight hours.JPPrivy Council Office8 January 1974
