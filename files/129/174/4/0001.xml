GENERAL OBSERVATIONSIn the &quot;white Papers&quot;Better Homes - The Next Priorities&quot;/cmnd. 5339j7and &quot;Towards Better Homes: Proposals for dealingwith Scotland&apos;s Older Housing&quot; /Ginnd 5338^published in June,1973? the Government proposed radical measures to ensure themore effective improvement of housing conditions in GreatBritain, but emphasised that final decisions would not be taken until it had consulted with the local authorities and others;and most particularly until it had studied in detail the Reportof the Expenditure Committee on house improvement grantsTheGovernment is very grateful to the Committee for the carefulanalysis contained in its Tenth Report, and for its constructiverecommendations,The Government has now completed the consultations on its orig-original proposals and has today introduced the.Housing and planning bill which gives effect to them, mollified as necessary to reflect the later advice it .hes received.This White Paper gives the Government1s observations on therecommendations made by the Committee.    The following generalpoints should, however, be emphasised at the outset:-(i). the main objective of the proposed legislation is to redirectresources more positively for the benefit of those people living in the worst housing conditions and to provide more effective powers and incentives in areas of housing stress.    Greater selec-tivity is the keynote *(ii) the proposed, criteria governing the declaration of housing action areas in England and Wales are now in a more flexibleform than that originally envisaged.    This will ensure that hous-ing deprivation is attacked on the broadest possible front.,(iii) the conditions/proposed to be attached to improvement grants throughout Great Britain have been strengthened to rule out possible abuses.    Other restrictions have been adopted toprevent improvement grants being made in circumstances where itwould be reasonable to assume either that there was no priorityrequirement for rehabilltiatlon or that owners could readily pay for necessary work without assistance from public funds,    m&apos;oro-
over, the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Y/aloaand for Scotland have already issued&apos; Circulars (DOS circular99/73&apos;, Welsh Office circular 186/73 and SOD circular 89/1 973)emphasising the existing discretion of local authorities not to award improvement grants in cases where the circumstances dos-cribed above exist; this meets the view expressed in paragraph&apos;1  of the Committee&apos;s Report,OBSERVATIONS OK INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS&quot;Social factors such as overcrowding should be included in the criteria for selection of housing action areas in Scotland aswell as in England and &apos;V/alea,&quot;Stress conditions involving, for example, a combination of sub-standard houses and very high demand for those houses have notemerged in Scotland,    The priority objective in terras of olderhousing in Scotland is the upgrading of physically sub-standarddwellings - those below the statutory tolerable;standard of the1969 Act and those which, though above that minimum standard,cannot be regarded as offering acceptable housing for much longer,The Government is clear that it is right to concentrate in thelegislation on selecting housing action areas in Scotland pre-domliiantiy by reference to physical housing conditions.   Socialconsiderations will, however, be referred to in the guidanceissued to Scottish local authorities to assist them in selectingand implementing housing action areas,]i Pii^IIlSIl^.L!-.2.?L-1.2.).&quot;The criteria for the selection of housing action areas should include consideration oftenumber of dwellings below the &quot;12 pointstandard&quot;  in England and Wales, as   well as in Scotland,&quot;Following consultations with local authorities and others, theGovernment has come to the conclusion that the &quot;12 point standard&quot;is not after all the best standard for declaration of housing action areas in Scotland, mainly because it is insufficientlyobjective and is pitched too high for this purpose ,v-It is pro-posed that, for declaration.of Scottish housing action areas forCONFIDENTIAL
improvement, the standard v/ill be the availability of thestandard amenities.    For declaration of Scottish housing action   1areas for demolition, a lower standard is needed; in this casethe standard v/ill he the &quot;tolerable standard&quot; of the Housing(Scotland) Act 1-96:9.The Government considers that the criteria for selecting housing action areas, in England and Wales should also be flexible: butthat their main purpose should be to secure that authoritiesdirect their attention to the worst areas.    So far as condition of dwellings is concerned, the signficant factor in the governments view is the number of dwellings in the area which lack the standardamenities, rather than the number which.fall below the much higher12 point standard. This has therefore been chosen as one of the physical criteria.    It has the advantage that it can be more readily established, as a basis for quick action.This v/ill. not lessen the scope for improving dwellings in housing .action areas, and elsewhere, to as high a standard as is practic-able.Recommendation     )&quot;In Scotland, power to acquire an unimproved property campulsorilyshould relate only to tenement dwellings, and local authoritiesshould be given powers to undertake Improvement;works coropul compulsorily&apos;similar to those proposed for England and Wales.&quot;In considering this recommendation the Government has had regardto the fact that the proposed housing action area procedure inScotland is, to a considerable extent, a development of thehousing treatment procedure introduced by the Scottish 19&amp;9.Act.Under the procedure Scottish local authorities already have a power to secure the improvement of houses, and to acquire housescompulsorily for improvement, whether or not they are in tenements- though a special procedural step is required in- the case of non-tenemental houses.Though the great majority of sub-standard houses in Scotland likelyto be dealt with by housing action areas procedures will by in/tenements, others may be in smaller towns and rural areas and&apos;would be suitable for action uuaer the proposed housing actionarea procedure.    To adopt the - Committee&apos;s recommendation wouldbe to take away from Scottish&quot;local&quot;authorities a power of aoqutsi-tion they have at present, and&apos;reversion to improvement by thelocal authority in default of the owner would introdu^o, into&apos; the
CuKEEIHTnSC&quot;procedure a new constraint not present in the existing procedure.In view of the urgent need to deal with sub-standard houses inScotland as quickly as possible, the Government does not feel that either of these results is desirable.&apos;  The new housing action areaprocedure (unlike the present housing treatment area procedure)will, however, have specific provision enabling owners to make representations against the proposals of the local authority andto carry out the work themselves if they wish to do so.Recommendation (h)&quot;Powers over tenanted property to carry out improvement works indefault should be given to local authorities in English and Welsh      ^general improvement areas.&quot;The Government accepts this recommendation and has made appropriateprovision in the Housing and Planning Bill.Recommendation (5)&quot;The standard for compulsory improvement of owner-occupied dwellingsshould only relate to external works and should exclude internalamenities.&quot;In principle, the Government fully accepts the reasons underlying the Committee&apos;s recommendation.    Important issues of personal libertyare involved v/hen owner occupiers are forced to carry out internalimprovements which they consider unnecessary.    But circumstances canarisq, especially in tenement buildings or terraced flats, where itis physically impossible to give the tenant of a dwelling the benefitof improvement measures without internal improvement of an adjacentowner-occupied dwelling.In these circumstances, the Government consider it justified, with proper safeguards, to permit the compulsory improvement of an owner-occupied dwelling in bousing action areas in-England and Wales.The use of this pwoer would be strictly limited to circumstances where it is not practicable, in the opinion of a local authority,for an adjoining dwelling to be improved to the required standardwithout also effecting the improvement of that owner-cccupied home.Appropriate grounds of appeal against the service of such a noticeare also proposed in the Bill.It is relevant to mention that the existing provisions for securingaction on unfit houses or the serving of repairs notices do not di3-distlnguish between houses which are owner-occupied and those whichare-not; nor does the existing Scottish procedure for dealing with housing treatment areas by securing the imnrovement of houses belowthe tolerable standard.
For the reasons mentioned above, it is not necessary inScotland to make any distinction in this regard betweenowner-occupied houses and others.Rccomjuendatt on r..(6)&quot;The &apos;minimum standard&apos; for compulsorily improved tenantedproperties should be more comprehensive&apos;than the &apos;5-point standard1and, if practicable in individual cases, should be the &apos;12--pointstandard1.&quot;The maximum standard for compulsory improvement proposed in theHousing and Planning Bill in the case of dwellings in Englandand Wales is that of the intermediate grant; ie that not onlymust the dwelling in all respects be made fit for human habitationwithin the meaning of the Housing Act, 1957 (and this includesfreedom from damp) but that it must be in good &quot;repair and pro-vided with all standard amenities,    In the case of houses inScotland, the maximum standard will be that the house should atleast meet the tolerable standard of the Housing (Scotland) Act1969? that it should be in good repair having regard to its age,character and locality, and that it should be provided with allthe standard amenities,The long-term objective of the Government&apos;s house improvementpolicy is to ensure that all dwellings are of a -decent standard,and the various proposals in the Housing and Planning Bill,especially the preferential rates of grant to be made availablein housing action areas and, in England&apos; and Wales, in general improvement areas, will accelerate this process.    But the Govern-&apos;ment believes that it is right to concentrate help and scarceresc roes upon those people living in the worst conditions, ratherthan to-dissipate effort by bringing within the scope of compul-soi&apos;y improvement some additional million homes in England andV/ales which, are currently above the intermediate grant standardbut which are still below the &apos; 12-pcini;&apos;  standard,   &apos;-s-&apos; &quot;nfiMFincftiTiAi
Furthermore, the Government believes that it would be unreasonable,to compel owners, including some owner-cccupiers, to undertake work which could involve very considerable expenditure and whichwould, at the higher standard, depend very largely upon the localauthority1 s subjective assessment of what scale and quality ofimprovement was necessary or justified in any particular case.The number of appeals against improvement notices and reprcsenta-tions against.proposals for Scottish housing action areas couldbe expected to increase significantly in-such circumstances,thus delaying progress in dealing with the areas of bad housing,&quot;Any repayment of grant under any of the conditions proposed should be the full original sum involved.&quot;The Government agrees with this recommendation and has made suit-able provision for this in the Housing and Planning Bill,&quot;The Secretary of State for Scotland should consider empoweringlocal authorities to require landlords selling properties inIIAAs to offer first refusal to a housing association or localauthority,- as proposed for England and V/ales.&quot;  -The urgent need in Scotland is to have sub-standard houses improved by the existing owners, whether owner--occupiers or landlords.Conditions have not emerged which would make it desirable tohave a statutory requirement that a landlord wishing to sell his property should offer first refusal to a Housing Association&quot;or a local authority.    It has, however, emerged as a result of consultation that the original concept of the &quot;first refusaloption&quot; envisaged for England and V/ales would be administrativelyunwieldy and would moreover be difficult to make sufficiently,proof against abuse.    The Housing and Planning Bill contains,therefore, different proposals with the same broad objective.allied to a power of direction vested in the Secretary of State.,   -Taken together, these provisions will make it possible to ensurethat houses acquired in housing action areas in England and V/alesv/ill normally pass into the ownership of a housing associationwhere there is an approved association ready and willing to take them over. The Government believes that this modified approach,together with- the various other housing action area powers, willprovide local authorities with keener weapons
with which to attack adverse housing- conditions -- of both a social and physical character - whilst at the same time guarantee-ing that housing associations will acouire a progressively larger share -of the houses within these difficult areas.    ,Recoragieiadat ion..-;(. Sj)&quot;A landlord should have the right to serve a purchase notice onthe local authority in lieu of accepting tenants compulsorily.&quot;&apos; &apos;//,   A     &apos;- i\       - &apos;The Government has now accepted, after consultations, that theproposals to allow local authorities to nominate tenants, compul-compulsorily to properties needlessly kept empty would not be practicable,Most local authorities would be reluctant to impose tenants onunwilling landlords, thus exposing tenants to possible discomfortand social stress of the kind which the Committee no doubt hadin mind when they referred to the need for great care and clrcum-spection on the part of the local authority in using this proposedpower.    It is, therefore, now proposed that, as an alternative,local authorities should rely as lar as possible on voluntarynomination agreements with landlords, but the proposed compulsoryimprovement procedure will enable local authorities to negotiate with owners and tenants on this point as part of any housingarrangements which it may be necessary to make in consequenceof the improvement,    In addition, however, local authorities wouldbe expected to make use of their proposed special powers&apos; .&apos; &apos;-.   in housing action areas to deal with needlesslyernpty dwellings.Finally the Government proposes that in any case where a compul-sbry improvement notice is served on a landlord, the localauthority may be required by the landlord to purchase his inter-est in the property,   This proposal adheres to the principleadvanced in the Cor;:mittee1 s recommendation, within the framework of the revised approach to the-problem that the Government hasnow adopted,&quot;A derailed monitoring and survey of the applications of the newpowers should be carried out twelve months after the implement a-ticn of - the new legislation,&quot;&apos;The Government accepts this recommendation and will make thenecessary arrangements for monitoring the effect of the no&apos;./ Jovis--iMok- -7- CONFIDENTIAL -
ENT1AL ; &apos;;&apos;Biifi^ESMSjy.\SIL..(jLl).&quot;Properties in general improvement areas should not receive separately of grant higher than normal.&quot; . &apos;The Government believes that it is important to give extraencouragement to the growth of general improvement areas inEngland and Wales,    Experience indicates that this stimulusis best provided by a preferential.rate of grant, and grants at60 per cent of eligible expense are proposed in the Housing and planning Bill,    There are very many areas of older housingthroughout England and Wales, happily free from stress conditions,where there is every reason to expect that, given sufficientencouragement, voluntary improvement will take place more readilyand successfully than hitherto.   A further incentive of the kind proposed is necessary to prevent such areas, often characterisedby agreeable old dwellings, from gradually - and sometimes not so gradually - declining into a condition of desuetude and neglectwhich leaves the local authority with no alternative but todemolish them.   The lack of progress in many general improvementareas since 1969 indicates that present policies are frequently- especially in the bigger towns and cities - not quite sufficientto promote rehabilitation on the scale required.   The localauthority associations have argued that a preferential rate of grant,., allied with powers to compel the improvement of tenanteddwellings, would turn the tide.    The Government accepts this view.RpcpjjAf^ncIa tion (12)&quot;Environmental grant in general improvement areas should be avail-able -for necessary external improvement of houses whether or not they qualify for discretionary grant.&quot; fThe general powers exercisable by local authorities ingeneral improvement areas enable them to assist financially withworks on land in the ownership of others, including repair of fences, provision of shrubberies and so forth.    TheGovernment will, however, give further consideration to what additional kinds of external work it would be reasonable,on a voluntary :basis, to include within the scope of theenvironmental grant.
In Scotland, environmental grant is already available for improvir,the amenities of any predominantly res identic], area, whether ornot the area has been declared to be a housing treatment area under the Scottish 1969 Act; similarly-, it is proposed that theenvironmental grant in Scotland should rot be restricted to housing action.areas under the proposed new legislation,Recommendation -.-(Iff-).;&quot;Local authorities   should have discretion to extend the deadlinefor the current preferential grant in bona fide eases where thegrant has been applied for in plenty of time and the builderhas started work, but where the builder fails to complete thework before the deadline,&quot;The Government has given this recommendation the most carefulconsideration but has decided that it would not be advisable, toaccept it.    The responsible exercise of the discretion proposedby the Committee would in practice prove very difficult, if not impossible, for local authorities,    There would probably be alarge number of applications, and the proposal would certainly involve substantial additional public expenditure.    The Govern-men-t believes that expenditure would produce more -beneficialresults if directed towards the specific area of concern set outin the Housing and Planning Bill,    Circulars have, therefore,been, issued (DOE circular 1.17/73 and BUD circular 92/1973) making it quite clear that the Government has no intention of extending the conditions governing the avilability of 75&apos;/&quot; grants beyond those already set out in the Housing Act, 1971, as amended bythe Housing (Amendment) Act, 1973; and alerting local authoritiesin the development and intermediate areas to the need to be par-ticularly careful in. the exercise of their discretion to award75% improvement grants in the period up to June 197*1-.   The num-ber of those owners who receive 75^ grant approvals and who arerelying critically upon builders to complete the work before23 June 1974, should, be reduced in consequence of these warnings,The Government relies on local authorities to take all reasonablesteps to avoid unnecessary disappoint::!out and possible hardshipsby administering the grant system with due -sensitivity duringthe next few months.    It must also be remembered that grants willnot ce&amp;se to be available after 23 June, 197*1-, but will merelyrevert, in the normal case, to 50%,-   CONFIDENTIAL   &apos;
CONrRecommendation (1 h.)&quot;Areas of greatest improvement potential should be defined on agrant to deal with areas of low housing demand and deprivation,&quot;The Government has given this recommendation careful considerationbut has decided that the concept,of &quot;areas of greatest improvementpotential&quot; on the basis suggested would be insufficiently dis-criminating and would be bound to share those defects of theHousing Act, 1971, commented upon unfavourably by the Committeein paragraph.63 of its Tenth Report,    The Government believes that the combination of housing action areas and general improve-ment areas treatment will be a more effective and economical wayof concentrating resources upon those localities where housingdeprivation is most prevalent and where the scope for worthwhilerehabi1i tatien i s greatest.Re commendation (l1 %)&quot;The limits of rateable gross value for discretionary grant&apos;toowner-occupiers should&apos; be higher than the figures of  lj.00 in greater London and  200 elsewhere proposed by the Secretaries of .State for the Environment and for Wales,&quot;The Government accepts that the rateable value limits for owner-occupiers suggested in the White Paper should be re-examined.Further detailed consideration is being given to this provision,Recpjmrien datl-oiv    &amp;)&quot;Discretionary grants, as well as standard grants, should not be payable for the improvement of houses built after 2 October, 1961,which is the date currently used for the limitation of standardgrants,&quot; -    &apos;&quot;-1The Government accepts this recommendation in its application toEngland and Wales and has made appropriate provision in theHousing and Planning Bill.    The principle- has also been accepted for 0hotlanvi, but in this case the relevant date will be1,5 June 1 S6k, the date when the Scottish Building StandardsRegulations crime into operation.&quot;It should be open .to local authorities to declare ILAAs whereverdistrict or sub-regional basis and given a preferential rate of
there is severe housing need.&quot;The Government has carefully considered this recommendation,along with recommendation (ih), but has concluded that for-similar reasons it cannot be accepted.   Decisions on what constituted&quot;severe housing need&quot; would be extremely difficult to make inthe absence of specific criteria to which authorities could refer.The Government attaches the greatest importance to housing actionareas as places where speedy and effective action will be takento deal with housing stress.    Given the inevitable limitationsto what can be achieved quickly, it believes that concentration of resources is essential.    The criteria by reference to whichauthorities will be able to declare housing action areas will,whilst being reasonably flexible, enable them to select manageableareas of housing need in their district with these ends in view.Eir-SSSSS?! -bl 1.L9IL. 1.15)&quot;The Secretaries of State should be obliged to issue detailedguide-lines on improvement; which would have statutory authority.&quot;The Government accepts that there may be circumstances in whichit would be helpful to local authorities to receive specificdirections from the Secretaries of State on the type of work tobe grant-aided,    Provision is therefore being made in the housing and Planning Bill to enable the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for V/ales to give directionsgenerally requiring that any application for grant relating to a specified description of improvement shall not be approved with-out their consent.    The Secretary of State for Scotland alreadylias a power to this effect,It is, however, important to recognise that the reorganisation of local government will reduce the scope for local variations in the treatment of grant applications,     The case, therefore,&apos;for more positive Government intervention is less strong.   More-over, while it may be annoying for one householder to receivedifferent treatment from that meted out to another in a neigh-bouring local authority district, it may be that this results from out to different housing circumstances in the two districts.-,and that the variation in treatment is entirely justified,Consideration is, however, being given to  the point as to whetherDepartmental guidance, as distinct from direction, to localauthorities might not be. more specific,
&quot;The normal proportion of approved, expense covered by the di.s-cretionary and standard grants should remain at 50/S.&quot;The Government accepts this recommendation and has made appro.-priate provision in the Housing and Planning Bill,Recommendation (20) ,an.a..(g1)&quot;Urgent action should be taken to complete the collection of statistics below the &apos;l2-point standard&apos;i&quot;H&quot;The Department should carry out a review of housing statisticsin order that a factual background should exist for the properevaluation of the housing programme,&quot;The estimates produced by the English local authorities in res-;ponse to the DOE circular 70/72 indicated that, excluding houses which wore unfit, the total number of dwellings in need of attention and capable of being improved to the &apos; 12-po&apos;int1 standardwas of the order of 2.3. million,    Returns from Scottish local, II&apos;-&apos;. &apos; &apos;ivauthorities and other survey information indicates that the num-ber of houses in Scotland which are below the statutory tolerablestandard of the 1 S&apos;b9 Act is of the order of 180,000        to whichmight be added a further  451000    houses which although meeting ;the tolerable standard are sub-standard by not having all thestandard amenities.   The Government is, however, regarding thesefigures as only a very broad indication of the quantity of housing-which would justify long-term rehabilitation; there is no doubtthat standards adopted by individual local authorities vary markedlyfrom one part of the country to another,    The Government accepts,therefore, the recommendabion that a review of house conditionstatistics should be undertaken and is currently considering theform and content of the next English and Welsh House ConditionSurvey and the in tor-relationship between this survey and materialavailable from the census and from the general household survey,/ &apos;.   .. iRecommendst? on J.22.) !&quot;The Departments should give close attention to monitoring thesocial effects of alterations in housing policies and should attemptto develop criteria for judging the relative merits of renewalCONFIDENTIAL
and improvement (or the appropriate mix within a programme)taking into account both social and economic factors.&quot;The Government accepts this recommendation and plans to under-take new work in this area while developing studies already inprogress,   The Committee was provided last year with interimfindings of a DOM study of the social consequences of improve-ment grant policy in Inner London, and the final results willbe published as soon as possible,   Work is already in handaimed at providing advice to local authorities on how theymight draw up strategies to co-ordinate new building and improve-ment projects to enable gradual, economic and co-ordinated renewal of areas to take place in ways that minimise social disruptionan d d i s 1 o c a t i on,PUBLIC EXPENDITUREWhen the White Papers Command 533$ and Command 5339 were issuedit was not possible for the Government to attempt a realisticestimate of the cost of house improvement grant policies as thiswould be determined very largely by the grant percentages applic-ablei generally and in the two types of special area.    The white papers contained no proposals for these percentages; the Govern-ment considered it desirable to await the Committee&apos;s recommend-ations on this point and to seek the views of local authoritiesand others,*At the same time the Government was reviewing the public expend-iture programmes generally and assessing overall priorities inthe light of prevailing economic clrcumstances,    The resultsof this reviewed^ have now been published in Command 5519- and show that planned expenditure on housing improvements will beas follows:-13-
197V 7g    d 7f5ZZ6    1S76ZI2    JJ77/Z8 109.0m  116.0m 161 .0m      157.0m/Z-1 973 Survey Prices-as:mentioned earlier, an important aim of the policies of theWhite Papers and of the Housing and Planning Bill is the con-centration of resources on areas of real need. This aim is reflected in both the public and private sectors, and in both England and wales and Scotland.In England and Wales, the effect of the Bill&apos;s proposals on grants to private owners is almost neutral in terms of total expenditure in thefirst year, with a steady increase in the later years as the impact ofthe new policies is fully felt.   These totals, however,-disguise amarked redistribution of grants in favour of low-income owners and towards priority housing areas.    As far as local authority investment in the improvement of their own housing is concerned, the level of spending will as expected decline with the termination of the pre-ferential arrangements for the development and intermediate areasunder the Housing Act, 1971- and a great deal of older councilhousing has already been improved.Broadly similar considerations apply in Scotland in relation to house improvements grants to private owners.   Local authorityinvestment in the improvement of their houses is expected, as-inEngland and Wales, to decline after the ending of the preferentialarrangements of the 1971 Act.Both in England and Wales and Scotland the planned&apos;&apos; level of council-house improvement programmes will continue at twice that achieved in 1970.   Indeed, the progress made since 1970 towards achieving the Governments target of providing all families with a decent homehas been dramatic as the following figures for total grant approvalsdemonstrate:-1970 1971 1972 1973 (estimate)180,000      233,000      368,000      440,000   *Grants to Private Owners    123.8m      101.8mLocal Authority  298.2m      188.8mimprovement investment
But much remains to be done, particularly in the sectors where badconditions are most prevalent.   In order- to ensure that resources are released to tackle the worse and more urgent housing conditionsin the private sector, and to finance other essential housing programmes, especially the expansion of the voluntary housingmovement, the Government proposes in the Housing and Planning Billto take powers for England and Wales similar to those already existing in Scotland to control local authority improvement activity.The Committee will have noted that Cmnd 5519 indicates that inthe years up to 1977 total public expenditure on housing inGreat Britain is planned to increase very significantly abovethe levels previously forecast, largely as a consequence of themeasures proposed in the Housing and Planning Bill.15-
