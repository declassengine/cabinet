Report from the Select Committee on the parliamentary commissioner for AdministrationSession 1972-73Observations by the GovernmentINTRODUCTORY1. In their Report for the 1972-73 Session, the Select Committee makea number of recommendations, to which this White Paper contains theGovernments response.EXTENSION OF THE SELECT COMMITTEES TERMS OFREFERENCE2. In paragraph 46 of their Report the Select Committee express the hopethat they should be able to consider the activities and reports of the health Service Commissioners. The Government have already indicated thatthey support this proposal and the Committee has now been re-appointed with extended terms of reference which enable them to consider the activities and the reports of the Health Service Commissioners which are laid beforeParliament.DELAY IN REPAYMENTS OF TAX3. In paragraph 7 of their Report, the Select Committee comment further on the payment of interest on delayed repayments of income tax. on two previous occasions (Cmnd. 4729 in July 1971 and Cmnd. 5227 inFebruary 1973), the Government have outlined the difficulties in the wayof such proposals. The Government have, however, noted the re-statement by the Committee of their views and have also noted their views in para-graph 6 of the Report on payment of interest on estate duty overpayments.They will give further consideration to these matters in the light of theviews expressed by the Committee.INVESTIGATIONS UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT4. In paragraph 38 of their Report the Committee have acknowledged that,under the law as it now stands, the exercise of powers under section 165 of theCompanies Act 1948 is a matter of fine judgment. They have expressed thehope that any changes that may be necessary to strengthen these and other powers in order to safeguard the public interest in present circumstances should be expedited in the Department of Trade and Industry&apos;s review of company law. The Government are introducing new legislation in thepresent session of Parliament; this will include some useful amendments to the law on inspection and on the filing of company accounts with the registrar.LIMITATIONS OF DEPARTMENTS&apos; POWERS UNDER THEEDUCATION ACT 19445. Paragraph 41 of the Report mentions a number of features which, in theCommittee&apos;s view, should characterise the handling of choice-of-school appeals from parents. All these are matters over which the Department of Education
and Science already takes considerable pains. Requests from parents arehandled with full appreciation of the anxiety and uncertainty which parentsmay feel while their representations are being looked into, and care istaken to explain the basis of the decision. It is, however, the case that local education authorities are also involved, and that until the facts are established and assessed the Department of Education and Science cannotdepart from a neutral position with regard to the merits of the parenfscase. The necessary enquiries are conducted as efficiently and expeditiouslyas possible, but reasonable time must be allowed for communication (notonly between Department and authority but in many cases between theauthority&apos;s headquarters and their divisional officers and/or schools), forthe information so received to be considered and where necessary discussed.In the circumstances it is not always possible to deal with every such case as quickly as parents, and indeed the Government, would wish.6. So far as the specific recommendations in paragraph 41 are concerned,it is already the standard practice of the Education Departments to make clear to parents, from the beginning of a case, the limited extent of their statutory powers. The Government accept that in letters to parents a clear distinction should be made -between information for which they havedepended wholly on the local education authority and any facts whichhave been independently verified. Departments have inevitably to rely on information given by a public authority subject of course to scrutinywith normal care to detect omissions or inconsistencies and with the normalresources of a Government Department it would hardly be possible to check every item of information independently as a matter of course, evenif this were desirable in principle.iPrinted in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office at St Stephen&apos;s Parliamentary Press309443 Dd 158761 K32 1/74
