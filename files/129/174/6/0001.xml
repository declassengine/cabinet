5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(74) 6 COPY NO      7029 January 1974CABINETHOME OWNERSHIP AND HOUSEBUILDINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. As foreshadowed in my oral report to Cabinet on 10 January(CM(74) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 7) I have now had a second meeting withthe Governor of the Bank of England to explore further the possibility of arranging for institutional investors to make funds directly available tothe building societies.SHORT TERM2. The Governor has advised that there is no immediate prospect of attracting funds from the banks or other institutions at rates which wouldbe acceptable to the building societies.    In the short term the flow of funds for lending for house purchase will only be improved if building societiesincrease their investment and mortgage rates or if they receiveGovernment subventions, unless competing levels of market rates ofinterest fall quickly and sharply.    Furthermore, even if the building societies Association does recommend an increase in rates in the next month or two - which is possible - an increased flow of funds is unlikely to result in a substantial increase in the rate of lending until the early summer as societies may well tend first to build up their liquidity as .a precautionary measure.    I consider that in the circumstances we must recognise that acute mortgage rationing is likely to continue for the next three months or so with a consequent further fall in the rate of private sector housing completions and starts,LONGER term.        In the slightly longer term there are a number of possibilities.Extension of lending on conventional terms by other&apos;institutions4,        A persistent demand for house purchase finance which was not beingmet by building societies might in theory encourage other financial institutions to enter the private housing market on a larger scale.    But we doubt whether, given other investment opportunities, they would think it worth their while to organise themselves to handle a large number of smallhouse purchaser transactions,1
Leaving the building societies free to compete for investment5,        Building societies might be given as much freedom from Governmentpressure as other private commercial institutions to vary their rates in response to the market.    However, it is possible that the amount of smallsavings on which building societies traditionally rely will be too limited tomeet all the demands made on it.T) InEquity and index-linked mortgages        1&apos;6.        Building societies and other institutions might develop equity orindex-linked mortgages as sources of new finance for house purchase.    Anequity mortgage would involve a lender accepting a lower rate of interestthan would otherwise be the case in return for a share of any capitalappreciation in the value of a house.   An index-linked mortgage wouldinvolve the periodic revaluation of a loan made for house purchase - andconsequently of the interest payable on it - by reference to the movementof an agreed index such as the Retail Price Index,    Whilst the developmentof such mortgages should be supported - and possibly encouraged - it is unlikely that they would do a great deal to solve the problem,A Mortgage Corporation7. The Governor believes it is worth exploring the practicability of setting up an entirely new institution - a Mortgage Corporation - with capitalsubscribed by the building societies and perhaps other City institutions.    its purpose would be to lend to building societies, on the collateral ofmortgages, funds raised from Institutional investors.    This would be aprivate institution, not dependent in any way on the Exchequer.    If itsucceeded in borrowing additional funds from institutional investors thecost to building societies would be higher than the rates of interest theywould pay to individual small investors.    But the cost of such marginalfunds to the societies would be less than raising the same amount by ageneral increase in their interest rate for all savings deposited with them,8.        I believe the next step should be to explore this last possibility asa matter of urgency.    WJth my agreement, therefore, the Governor has undertaken to consult the building societies on this proposition,    I shall of course keep the Cabinet in touch with developments.    We certainlycannot be certain in advance that the scheme will prove practicable.G r department of the Environment29 January 19742
