THE RATE SUPPORT GRANT 1974-751. This White Paper sets out the Governments decisions on the rate supportgrants to be made to local authorities in England and Wales in 1974-75 underthe provisions of the Local Government Bill, now before Parliament. these decisions will he included in an Order to be made by the Secretary of Slate forthe Environment subject to approval by resolution of tfie House of Commonsunder the Bill, provided the Bill is duly enacted.2. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Secretary of State is required to deter-mine the aggregate amount of Exchequer Grant to be paid to local authorities inrespect of their relevant expenditure for the year. The estimated amounts of specific grant for the year in aid of revenue expenditure and of supplementarygrant for National Parks are deducted from the aggregate amount of exchequer grants, and the resulting balance is the amount of rate support grant. Inmaking his decisions, the Secretary of State is required to consult with,the localauthority associations and to take into account the relevant expenditure of localauthorities, likely fluctuation in the demand for services, the need to developservices and the extent to which, having regard to general&apos;economic conditions, itis reasonable to develop those services.3. As in previous years, rate support grant is divided into thr e.parts knownas the needs element, the resources element and the domestic element. Theresources element will be paid to most rating authorities outside London andwill therefore take a larger share of the total than in previous years. The needselement will be paid to non-Metropolitan Counties, Metropolitan Districts and london Boroughs.- The domestic element is payable to all rating authorities,who are required by the Secretary of State to reduce the rate level on dwelling,houses by amounts corresponding with their share of the domestic element.The Economic Background &quot;Ihj.of 21 May 197?,/included  81 million. in local government current expenditure in 1974/75. Local authorities were then-formally told that there would have to be restraint in the growth of local authority.expenditure, and that this year&apos;s rate support grant negotiations would proceed&apos;OR&apos;the- basis that thes-reductions would be achieved.
6. Stages 1 and 2 of the Counter-inflation Programme succeeded in restrainingthe domestic causes of inflation. Stage 3 has a similar objective. Local authorities by containing the growth of their expenditure and therefore the increase in theirrate demands have an essential part to play in achieving the Governments aims.The Content of Relevant expenditure. Reorganisation of local services and changes proposed in the LocalGovernment Bill currently before Parliament will lead to alterations in the content of relevant expenditure, on which grant is payable. The responsibilityfor certain services-local health, the greater part of the school health service,sewerage and sewage disposal, and certain expenditure met by precepts of riverauthorities and water boards will be transferred to other bodies, and excludedfrom the definition of relevant expenditure. The payment of mandatory studentawards and grants for teacher training students for which 90 per cent specific grants are provided in the Local Government Bill will also be excluded. the saving to local authorities resulting from no longer having to bear the burden oflocal health services and 90 per cent of the cost of mandatory awards to studentswill reduce their expenditure by some ^S^g million (at November 1973 prices).Since sewerage services will be financed for the next year by a charge collectedfor the Regional Water Authority by the local authorities, this charge on theratepayer has been taken into account in the Governments grant settlement byan appropriate upward adjustment. On the other hand, general rate fundcontributions to housing revenue accounts, passenger transport executives and trading will now form part of relevant expenditure as will losses on slum clearance operations, expenditure on granting rent allowances in excess of thestandard, concessionary fares and certain police, probation and MagistratesCourts&apos; expenditure not formerly relevant. Annex A sets out the details here.Estimates of Relevant Expenditure 1974-75 ;&apos;8. In arriving at their forecasts of relevant expenditure for 1974-75, theGovernment have given careful consideration to the reports of joint WorkingGroups of officials of local authorities and Government departments. TheseWorking Groups were invited to prepare detailed forecasts of the expenditurethat might be incurred by local authorities as a whole on individual services,bearing in mind past trends in expenditure and on the basis that existing policieswould continue uninterrupted. They were also asked to consider what changes would be feasible in order to obtain the required reductions in the rate of growth of expenditure to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred in his statement of 21 May. The Working Group forecasts were based on the level ofprices, costs and remuneration current at November 1972 and take into accountdemographic and other factors not under the control of local authorities. In-;addition the forecasts include allowances, as appropriate, for changes in expenditure expected to arise in the first year of local government reorganisation and for improvements in services under relevant legislation and in accordancewith announced policies.9. The Government , -hook. note of.the views expressed by Hie WorkingGroups about the difficulties of achieving the required reductions in expenditure,and have accepted as estimates of relevant expenditure the figures set out in ,
Annex B. These revised forecasts produce a total of.cW2.mil! ion below theWorking. Groups&apos; forecasts for 1974-75 (figures at November 1972 prices),this\ill require local authorities to make the specific savings identified in theWorking Group discussions together with a further  10 million of unspecifiedsavings representing in part the continuing effect of the efficiency reductions which the Government included in its forecasts for the current year.^The basis for the forecasts for individual services is given in Annex B.10. The Government will therefore be basing the rate support grant for1974-75 on a relevant expenditure figure on the new definition, and at November1972 prices, of $ 14-8 million. .. Adjusted to November 1973 prices the figure of relevant expenditure becomes  SS7( million. Nothing is included for possible future increases, but in the event of an unforeseen increase taking place in thelevel of prices, costs and remuneration which has a substantial effect on the relevant expenditure of local authorities, the Secretary of State may by orderincrease the amount of rate support grants.11. The Government attach the greatest importance to expenditure being kept within the total stated above. To that end they will be issuing a circular to all local authorities in England and Wales spelling out      *h uh qJ riuiAmount of Grant12. The Government have decided, subject to Parliamentary approval, on agrant of^otfper cent of relevant expenditure under the new definition. Theaggregate iixchequer grant is therefore  343/ million as set out in Annex C.This is intended to ensure that the percent, rise in domestic rate burdens, taking account of the new domestic element and the variable domestic relief as described in the following sections, should be fa^ir-fa a&apos;**qU f^&apos;00&quot;/ ^&quot;&quot;-yeirtuM^-fant^. . The Government, in deciding on a grant percentage of this rate,have taken  into account the likely rise of local authority costs, given their highman-power element.Distribution of Grant13. The Government have thought it right to accompany the reorganisation oflocal government with a review of the manner in which rate support grant is distributed. The Local Government Bill now before Parliament will make, it possible for the Government, in consultation with the local authority associations,to vary the distribution of grant in accordance with changing circumstances.Proposals on ways in which these powers might be used were set out in the green paper on local government finance published in 1971 and have been underdiscussion with the local authority associations since then. In the light of these discussions, the Government now propose the following changes in the grantsystem: . 114.  Needs element: The aim of the needs clement is to subsidise the expenditureof local authorities in proportion to the differing costs they have to incur in providing a standard level of service. No formula can hope to represent these,differences in need perfectly. But it is clear that the present system needs
updating in the light of changes over the years in the pattern oflccal governmentactivity and of the future changes that reorganisation will briny.  For the.present, the Government consider that the best available indicator of spendingneed-is the pattern of recent past expenditure. This does not mean that cach:aiithority&apos;s grant should be directly related to its own expenditure. But authori-.ties with similar population and other characteristics will have the need to spend the same amount per head. From the statistical analysis which the Departmentof the Environment has carried out, it is clear that the basic determinant of local expenditure is population. It also appears that variations in actual expenditure,per head from the national average may be substantially (but not entirely)related to: (i) above or below national average number of education units per head-;(ii) above or below national average number of personal social services units;per head (based on numbers of persons in accommodation for the elderly,mentally ill etc.; children in care; day care places; meals served; home,helps; and social work staff; o.*-6.        owlU(iii) declining population measured over 10 years (if applicable);(iv) low density of population&quot;(v) additions to allow for higher costs of providing services in London.the.inner South Eastern counties, the outer South Eastern counties and the outer West Midlands.15. The sum available for the needs element will therefore be distributed to non-Metropolitan Counties, Metropolitan Districts and London Boroughs inaccordance with the formula set out in Annex D. The figures in this formula arederived from a weighted multiple regression analysis of local authority expendirturein 1972-73 adjusted for the changes which will apply in 1974 in local authorityboundaries and functions.16. Resources element: The resources element has been used to supplement therate income of authorities with a below average rateable base. The government consider however that the majority of rating authorities should qualify for theresources element next year. Under the Local Government Bill therefore the qualifying level is to be a National standard rateable value per head&apos;. The .national standard for 1974-75 will be  /  -per head. This would result in theresources element accounting for some^y^per cent of the sum of the needs and resources elements.17.   The Domestic element: Under the Local Government Bill, the Secretary ofState will have power to prescribe differing amounts in the   as domestic mdvf-    ,  ,for different rating authorities. The Government intend to use this power to/      nt*^protect domestic ratepayers against exceptional increases in rates arising fromchanges in grants and from exceptional increases in charges for water and sewer-,age services arising from the reorganisation of those services. The domesticfcdtef     will be increased from the present level of 6p to a minimum of Tjxwith greater amounts in areas where domestic ratepayers would otherwise be \ j^Ui^f;liable to exceptional increases in rates for these reasons. The total amount of *       1grant for this purpose will be  4-^4 million of which the variable proportion willaccount for some  ^/imillioiwThe amount payable to each rating authority willbe calculated to correspond as closely as possible to the cost of the domestic
r*Vv-*.-f- . The level of domestic vali^- applicable in each rating authority will be determined by the Secretary of State and will be included in the rate support Grant Order.Specific Grants18. The aggregate, of rate support grant to be distributed on the basis described above is arrived at by subtracting from the aggregate of Exchequer assistance tolocal authorities the estimated amounts of specific grants for that year in aid ofrevenue expenditure. Details of these are set out in Annex E.19. The National Parks Supplementary Grants are payable from 1 April 1974to County Councils whose area includes the whole or part of a National Parkin respect of so much &quot;^Us. estimated expenditure on national parks for theyear 1974-75 as the Secretary of State considers appropriate. Expenditure on long distance routes and information centres will not rank for supplementarygrants since it will be assisted directly by the Countryside Commission.20. The Government has decided that/The appropriate total estimated expenditure for 1974-75 is an amount of f.. million and is giving grant on this, atthe rate of .75 per cent amounting to  1. million. This will be dealt with in thesame way as specific grants to local authorities, and so has to be deducted fromthe aggregate of Exchequer assistance.

Development of services.. . In considering forecasts of expenditure, account has been taken of the needfor developing services, of the relative priorities attaching to them, and of theneed for continuing restraint.Education2. The forecast expenditure for education takes account of expected increases in numbers of &apos;(u*(Mji/ittcU*h a*4 ko.tU*ft ,; and the development of the service in accordance with the strategy set out in the White Panrr, Education: A Frame-,work for Expansion&apos;, (Cmnd 51741Personal Social services . Thescservices have developed substantially since 1971, and the actual ratesof growth of expenditure have been faster than expected from forecasts. Provi-sion has been made4,. The Government attaches great importance to continuing to increase police ;strengths. The increase provided for is that which is considered likely to be :achieved in the coming year, having regard to recent trends in the rate of - . &apos;recruitment. If the estimate is exceeded, specific grant will be paid on the :additional expenditure within agreed establishments.
