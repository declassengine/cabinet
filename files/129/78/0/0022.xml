MEMORANDUM BY THE MIDDLE EAST OIL COMMITTEEOn 18th October the Cabinet decided that a Working Party should be set up with the following terms of reference:  &quot; With a view to safeguarding the free flow of oil supplies from theMiddle East, to consider urgently (a) what further action Her Majesty&apos;s Government should take; includingaction which involves increased expenditure;(b) what action the oil companies should be urged to take;and to make early recommendations, if necessary in the form of interimreports.&quot;The Working Party&apos;s first Interim Report has been considered by the middle east Oil Committee and is attached.2. In considering this report, Ministers will no doubt wish to see it inperspective against the background of recent events in the Middle East. The recentRussian diplomatic offensive there, with the threat which it implies not only toour oil supplies but also to the peace of the area, raises issues of high politicalstrategy which are outside the province of the Committee and are in any casebeing urgently considered elsewhere. This offensive has also prompted proposalsfor the supply of arms to certain countries, which are also being considered separately.3. In due course it will be necessary to consider our longer term policy towards securing our essential supplies of oil from the Middle East. It is recommended that this study should be undertaken in the first instance by theWorking Party; consultation will be necessary with the British oil companies, andwith the State Department.4. In the meantime it is necessary to initiate new measures designed tomaintain and increase our influence in the Middle East. The value of these measures depends, of course, upon our real strength, both economic and military.They cannot be expected to secure our oil supplies by themselves. Although thefull impact of such measures would not develop for two or three years, the evidence which they would give of increased British activity and self-conlidence would have some impact upon the immediate situation. It is with measures of this kind thatthe Working Party&apos;s Interim Report is concerned.5. The Working Party&apos;s Report recommends in the main an intensification of our present efforts in the Middle East. It has not been able in the time available,to go into every proposal in detail, but those proposals ((a) to (/) below) forwhich it asks specific approval have all been the subject of detailed examination in the past with H.M. Missions overseas, and with the home Departmentsconcerned.6.   The Working Party&apos;s recommendations can be summarised as follows:  (a) An increase in technical assistance    ...      ...      ...  26,000 a year(b) A gift of lorries to the Ruler of Muscat to enable himto ensure the security of oil operations there    ...  25,000(c) The establishment of a British boys&apos; school in the lebanon,  120,000 (capital)............  10,000 a year(d) Improvements in the conditions of service of her majesty&apos;s Foreign Service in the Middle East and  26,000in the equipment and buildings of H.M. Missions, 225,000 (capital over 3 years)     .........  45,000(recurrent ex-penditure)(e) A substantial increase in our information effort, 75,000 (capital expenditure)       .........  54,000 a year(/) An increase in the activities of the British Council(including  175,000 capital spread over the first3 years)       ..................  300,000 a year in addition there are other proposals requiring further study includingincreased trade promotion activity, assistance to medical work, help in technical
education and the possibility of adding an additional Labour Attache and an OnAttache to the Middle East establishment.The total cost of all the above proposals would be of the order of  700,000 ayear of which about  200,000 a year would be capital expenditure.7. For budgetary purposes, the expenditure on the above proposals would fall in the main under the heading of ordinary Foreign Office expenditure, exceptfor (e) and (/), which come under &quot; Overseas Information &quot; expenditure. The lattercovers work by the Information Services of the three overseas Departments, theB.B.C., and the British Council. The present world-wide expenditure under this heading is just under  10J,- millions, and the Departments had been discussing withthe Treasury, before the Middle East Oil Working Party was set up, increases for next year covering the whole world. The Treasury consider that the allocation of any additional funds for overseas information work should be looked at as awhole and that the Middle East should not be considered in isolation. Thenecessary study of the Working Party&apos;s proposals in the wider setting of overseas expenditure on information work generally need not involve serious delay, sincedecisions on the general scale of overseas information expenditure in 1956-57must in any case be reached in the next few weeks. The Committee wish, however,to draw the attention of Ministers to the fact that, unless some overall increasein information expenditure above what was previously contemplated is authorised,such study can only result in the sacrifice either of an important part of the working party&apos;s proposals, or of other activities elsewhere in the world. The Committeealso wish to point out that, of the British Councils projects, approximately two-thirds of the expenditure proposed relate to the establishment and strengthening of schools run under British Council auspices, the subsidisation ofBritish teachers in schools and universities, and the bringing of influentialindividuals to this country.8. A further point to which the Middle East Oil Committee wish to draw the attention of Ministers is the statement by the British Council that, if they areto undertake the expansion of work proposed in the Working Party&apos;s report, theywill have to close down in some ten to fifteen other countries where they nowoperate unless they are authorised to offer permanent employment in order to recruit new staff. This raises the whole question of the future of the british council.9. The Committee submit that Ministers should approve the Working Party&apos;srecommendations summarised in paragraph 6 above on the understanding that:  (i) items (a), (b) and (c) be put in hand forthwith ( 36,000 per annum plus 145,000 capital expenditure);(ii) item (d) be proceeded with forthwith subject to day-to-day details being settled between the Department concerned and the Treasury in theusual way ( 71,000 per annum plus  225,000 capital expenditure over three years);(iii) items (e) and (/), which are of equal urgency, should also be put intoeffect without delay, subject to the decision of Ministers on the points mentioned in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, namely, (1) whether there isto be an increase specifically devoted to the Middle East in the totaloverseas information expenditure, and (2) the future of the british council ( 380,000 per annum including  250,000 capital expenditurespread over the first three years).
SECRETINTERIM REPORT OF AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL  working party ON MIDDLE EAST oil the Working Party has taken as its geographical area Iran and the arab world, including (a) Libya, since this country lies on the flank of Egypt and isthe only country where the Armoured Division which is intended for the defenceof our oil-fields can train in desert warfare, and (b) (for the limited purposes specified in paragraph 12 (v)), Pakistan and Aden, because of their close contact with the Middle East, in the case of Pakistan through the Bagdad Pact.2. The Working Party believes that, within the limits imposed by finance,the general direction of our efforts in the Middle East has been right. They maybe briefly described as the traditional methods of diplomatic and commercialrepresentation which are of particular effect in a society where the personalityof the individual is of decisive importance, supported by cultural relations and information work, by an active policy of military co-operation, and by encourage-ment to the local governments to develop their countries on modern lines andto spend their oil revenues for the benefit of their peoples as a whole. It mustbe stated, however, that we cannot expect to obtain the wholehearted goodwill of the Arabs so long as they remain dissatisfied with our policy on the Israelquestion, and that overt diplomatic activity, particularly in the field of information,can do no more than mitigate the hostility which they feel towards us on this account.3. So as to make proposals for action at the earliest possible moment, theWorking Party has so far conlined itself to recommendations on measures whichhave already received sufficient study in the departments concerned to be putinto effect at once, and has examined only some of the wider problems which require further study. Their recommendations, which cover the principalcategories for which expenditure by Her Majesty&apos;s Government is likely to benecessary are listed in the annexes to this report, to which paragraphs 7 to 19below refer.4. Some of the recommendations are designed as a direct and immediatecounter to the present Russian diplomatic offensive in the area, and will be sointerpreted by its inhabitants. But it is important not to give any impression of panic, and not to allow the Arabs to think that the way to gain favours fromthe West is to accept them from the East. Moreover, much of the action proposed would lose its value to Her Majesty&apos;s Government if it were directly relatedin local minds to the preservation of our oil interests. The majority of therecommendations are therefore designed as an unobtrusive extension of our presentactivities.5. It has not been possible in the time available to consult H.M. Missionsoverseas, or to attempt any detailed co-ordination with the oil companies or withthe United States Government. The recommendations for immediate actionhave, however, all been studied in the past with the Missions concerned. the heads of the major British oil companies have, moreover, been consulted andhave indicated that they agree with Her Majesty&apos;s Governments analysis of thesituation as set out in the Cabinet paper, and that they are willing to help, bothby reviewing their own policies in the field of local relations, and, where appropriate, by supporting financially some of the projects recommended in thisreport. An opportunity for co-ordination with the United States Government willbe provided by the next series of regular bi-annual discussions on Middle Eastoil. The question of co-ordination of policy between the British and Americanoil companies can also be raised at these meetings. We might also renew our efforts to see whether the United States Administration can find any administrativemeans by which the deterrent effect of the United States anti-trust laws on all forms of co-operation can be reduced. In the meantime a general approach tothe United States Government will be necessary.
6. The Working Party&apos;s recommendations are summarised in the following paragraphs and described in detail in the Appendices. They cover the followingpoints:  (a) An increase in technical assistance. 26,000 a year.(b) A gift of lorries to the Ruler of muscat to enable him to ensurethe security of oil operations there. 25,000 (capital).(c) The establishment of a British boys&apos;school in the Lebanon. 120,000 capital and  10,000 ayear.(d) Improvements in the conditions ofservice of H.M. Foreign Service inthe Middle East 26,000 a yearand in the equipment and buildings of H.M. Missions. 225,000 capital over 3 yearsand  45,000 a year recurrent expenditure.(e) An increase in the activities of theBritish Council. 300,000 a year.(/) A   substantial    increase    in    our information effort. 75,000 capital expenditure and 54,000 a year.(g) Other proposals requiring further study, including increased Tradepromotion activity, assistance to medical work, help in technical education, and the possibility of adding an additional labourattache and an oil attache to theMiddle East establishment.7. Technical Assistance. Since the war, Her Majesty&apos;s Government has followed a policy of providing unobtrusive and modest assistance to Middle Eastcountries in their efforts to improve their standards of living or to spend theiroil revenues for the benefit of their populations. This policy has paid gooddividends in results and in goodwill. The possibilities of expansion lie in anincrease in the Middle East Development Division, the establishment of a sizeablefund for the provision, free, of ad hoc advisers and consultants; the subsidisingof the salaries paid by local governments to British employees; and increasedhelp with technical training and an increase in the development grant for theTrucial Coast, including Buraimi. Details of the Working Party&apos;s proposals arein Appendix A. Proposals for immediate action amount to  26,000 a year. Theproposals for technical training cannot yet be costed. But these are modest sumscompared with the size of the interests at stake, or with the proposals for expenditure under other headings. This is because any expansion in technical assistance must be done very discreetly. Mass offers in this field defeat their ownends, as has been seen in the case of the American Point IV and the United NationsTechnical Assistance Programme. But it is recommended that the possibility ofa further increase in expenditure in a few years&apos; time should not be excluded.A limiting factor is the shortage of qualified technical experts in the UnitedKingdom, but the Commonwealth Relations Office are prepared to seek the help of Dominion Governments, especially Canada, Australia and New Zealand.8. Arms and Equipment. The Working Party consider that the general question of arms policy for the Middle East lies outside their terms of reference.There is, however, the case of Muscat, which is of direct importance to our oilinterests, and where a small gift of equipment would have political effects out ofall proportion to the financial outlay. Rapid exploration and development bythe Iraq Petroleum Company in this country may provide a major source of oilon the fringe of the Arab world, with direct access to the Indian Ocean. Thegift of  25,000 worth of motor transport to the Ruler would enable him greatly to improve the security of these operations.
9. The Lebanon School. An opportunity occurs here to do somethingspectacular for the &quot; have-not &quot; Levant countries which are now wavering betweenthe East and the West. Four years ago, a plan was elaborated by H.M. embassy in Beirut, in conjunction with the present President of the Lebanon (now half way through his term of office) and representatives of the local Lebanese and Britishcommunities to found a boys&apos; public school there on the lines of Victoria College.This would serve the whole area. The total capital cost of the school, including anendowment fund to found a number of scholarships, would be  250,000. But ifHer Majesty&apos;s Government would announce an initial contribution of Leb, 1,000,000 ( 120,000) the remainder would be raised from Lebanese athome and abroad and from the oil companies. Once the school was established, itwould be self-supporting but for the first ten years an annual maintenance grant of 10,000 would be needed. An early announcement of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^support of the plan would have an immediate impact on the area as a gesture of goodwill and of confidence in our own future position. The school could startwork in under three years; its pupils would begin to influence public affairs withinten years and, through the goodwill of their parents, even earlier. The working party recommend most strongly the immediate adoption of this proposal.10. H.M. Missions. No general increase in staff is proposed but this is a region where the choice of the right man is all-important. Specialists are needed inthe Arabic language and in the cultural, social, internal political, economic andmilitary problems of the region. These are not at present forthcoming as willingvolunteers. Arabic is by far the most unpopular of the &quot; hard &quot; languages, not because it is the hardest but because specialisation in it entails long service in a region where the climate is unpleasant and usually unhealthy, and where the need to live in constant personal contact with intractable and often hostile peopleimposes considerable strain. As inducements to encourage men to specialise andto increase the efficiency of H.M. Missions and consular posts in the region, it isproposed that conditions of service, accommodation and amenities in the regionshould be improved. Leave in the United Kingdom at public expense should beallowed annually in certain cases instead of every eighteen months as at present;the grading of certain posts in H.M. Missions and consular posts in the regionshould be raised to provide a better avenue of promotion for Arabic specialists;and language allowances should be substantially increased. In order to attract morestudents from outside Government service to the Middle East Centre of ArabStudies and to increase its efficiency, provision should be made for the improvement and repair of the buildings at the Middle East Centre of Arab Studies and for theimprovement of living conditions and amenities there. Air conditioning shouldbe installed on an extensive scale in offices and dwellings in the region; launches, for both prestige and recreational purposes, should be provided for the three posts inthe Persian Gulf which at present need them; the Political Resident in the Gulfshould have a personal aircraft both to facilitate his travel in the area and to increasehis prestige. Finally, a start should be made on the most urgent and important ofthe many building projects in the region the construction of a new combinedEmbassy residence and office on the site already owned in Damascus.Details are in Appendix B. The cost of measures proposed for immediateapproval would be approximately  130,000 in the first year, and  190,000 in thethird year, over half on capital account.1 i. British Council and associated activities. We are not at present satisfying the active demand in the area for knowledge of the English language and of Britishachievements in professional, technical and other fields, or for help in education.We are losing old friends by default, and not making enough new ones. TheWorking Party consider that the most effective way of maintaining our position inthe area over the next 20 years is to ask the British Council to plan for thegreatest possible impact upon it, and give all possible help to those who arespontaneously asking for our assistance in education. Detailed proposals by theBritish Council are given in paragraph 12 below.12. (i) Proposals by the British Council provide for an increased annual expenditure of approximately  285,000. The first and second year include capitalexpenditure. By 1958-59 capital expenditure should have been completed, butrecurrent expenditure will by then have risen to  320,000 (at present costs), at whichfigure it should level off for subsequent years. Of the figures for each of the first three years, the proposals for which immediate approval is recommended account
\D2-Pfor approximately three-quarters of the total; and suggestions for further studyabout one-quarter.  (For summary of proposed expenditure see Appendix C.)In this field more than any other continuity is essential. It would be better to do nothing than to start schemes which later have to be abandoned. In thisconnection the Working Party strongly endorse the statement by the British council that they cannot undertake the recruitment necessary for this expanded programmeunless they are able to offer permanent employment. This depends on a Ministerialdecision about the status of the British Council, i.e., whether it is or is not apermanent service. The Working Party draw attention to the importance of anearly decision on this question.  (See Appendix ^3.)The Working Party also consider that the scheme for expanding the CounciFsfacilities for looking after the welfare of overseas students in this country (including some 3,000 Middle Easterners) is of the first importance and urgency. This scheme has already been approved in principle by Ministers. It depends on the provisionof suitable premises in Central London. If the scheme is to have an early impactit should be in operation by the beginning of the next academic year (September1956). The Working Party notes that this problem is under consideration by theTreasury and Ministry of Works and hopes that as speedy a decision as possiblecan be taken.  (See Appendix E.)(ii) Visitors to the United KingdomThe British Council has already proved the value of (a) brief visits of a few weeks by key individuals;(b) post-graduate scholarships at universities;(c) bursaries for a few months&apos; study of professional and technical subjects;and(d) study tours and courses in public administration and other practicalsubjects for parties of ten to twenty.We now recommend an increase in the total numbers invited under each ofthese heads, experience of this work having shown that to bring to this countryinfluential individuals and groups of administrators, &amp;c, and to maintain contact with them after their return is a rewarding activity particularly in backwardcountries. An increase in this activity has recently been strongly urged by a numberof H.M. Ambassadors. The number now proposed for visits annually has been restricted to the number expected to be sufficiently important and well-qualified tobe worth bringing and which can be absorbed in this country in any one year.Many of them would be of direct interest to the Board of Trade.  (See Appendix F.)(iii) Subsidisation of British University Staff, School-teachers and EducationalAdvisersIn the Middle East a British teacher placed in a local university, teachers&apos;training college, military or police training establishment, or school, can exert avery great influence. There is a strong demand from many of these institutions forBritish staff. To secure the right men it will in many cases be necessary for theCouncil (a) to recruit and in some cases make emoluments more attractive by subsidies, (b) to guarantee the terms offered by the overseas employer and (c) tosecure some assurance of re-employment on return to the United Kingdom.Financial provision is recommended for (a) and (b). For (c) the Ministry ofEducation has agreed to co-operate: the cost will be small and can be met under existing regulations. Similar arrangements are recommended for cadet schools run by the fighting Services in Pakistan (See Appendix G).(iv) British Schools(a) British Ambassadors in the Middle East have been emphasising for years the value there of British schools which, because of their character-buildingreputation, tend to attract the children of important families and to build upunderstanding of Britain both by their impact on the pupils and by their contact with the parents. The British schools in Egypt and Iraq are existing examples ofthis. It is recommended that a British secondary school should be started in iraq to take the output from the existing British primary school, a portion cf the capital cost being raised locally, and that further consideration should be given to increasing the subsidies to the principal British schools in Egypt so as to put theseon a sounder financial footing.   (See Appendix H.)
(b) The proposal to start a British school in the Lebanon is dealt with separately (see paragraph 9 above).(c) A proposal to start a British school in Libya is being given further study(see Appendix I).(v) Extension of British Councils General Work OverseasIt is recommended that the following activities should be reinforced and extended: (a) English teaching based on British Institutes. The fighting Services, police and native teachers of English are specially important targets;(b) Tours, for which there is a constant demand overseas, by leading men invarious professions, &amp;c, from the United Kingdom to give talks and advice. This activity is limited by the number of really first-class peoplelikely to be available;(c) Supply of books and periodicals to British Council libraries; films forspecialist audiences, e.g., medical films; translation of British booksinto Arabic;(d) The question of an occasional drama tour to the more sophisticated citiesfor which Ambassadors constantly ask is receiving further study;(e) Geographical expansion. The following proposals are receiving further study:  (i) Libya. The Libyan Government have asked that the british council should start work there and we believe it would have great scope. The establishment of a British Council Centre inTripoli, and the setting up of a British School at Benghazi are proposed;(ii) The Persian Gulf. It is proposed that the work recently begun in kuwait should be expanded and extended to Bahrain andpossibly elsewhere.(iii) Aden. The Councils Institute in Aden was closed some years agoas an economy measure. The Government of Aden havesuggested that they would be prepared to find half the cost ofreopening it if the Council would find the other half. Thisproposal should be examined on the spot by a representativeof the British Council.  (See Appendix I.)13. Information. The possibilities of expanding direct information activities are limited by the resistance within the Middle East to propaganda obviouslyoriginating from official Western sources. For this reason propaganda is oftenmore effective if it can be put out from unattributable sources, and much of our information work in the area is already done in this way. Ways and means ofstepping up this activity are under examination.No major expansion in the staff or activities of the Information Offices ofH.M. Missions in the area is recommended; but the list of projects mainly for improving or expanding broadcasting, film services and publications is given incx^wjii f&apos; Aiiae-x-^i-G.&quot;   The list also includes services to help local national broadcasting and televisions services.Estimates of probable cost are given in most, but not all, cases; they willrequire discussion with the agencies concerned (British Broadcasting corporation and the Central Office of Information). The list is divided into (A) &quot; Projects forwhich immediate approval is sought,&quot; and (B) &quot; Projects requiring further study &quot;;projects of the second category require further discussion with the agenciesconcerned not only as regards their precise cost but also as to the form whichthey might finally take. So far as they can be at present costed, these projectsinvolve an annual recurring cost of  54,000 a year and a capital sum (on a medium-wave relay station for the B.B.C.) of  76,000 taking probably eighteen months tocomplete from date of authorisation of expenditure.Further projects will doubtless be suggested by H.M. Missions and the RegionalInformation Office, Middle East, when the time comes to consult them.14. Trade. The Board of Trade consider, and the Working Party agree,that measures to improve our commercial position in the area will also contribute to the maintenance of our political influence and the flow of oil. There ismoreover some advantage in expenditure which, while producing political returns,
also helps our trading position. The Board of Trade consider that the proposals made in other paragraphs by the British Council and the Information Services toextend the programme of visits to the United Kingdom are of this nature and theywould be glad to help in suggesting suitable people whose visits could result inthe placing of orders in this country. Also in this category are the proposals by theForeign Office to increase the Technical Assistance programme and to investigateurgently the possibility of providing more facilities for the Technical Training of middle Eastern nationals. The measures suggested for improving the terms andconditions of service of Foreign Service Officers in the Middle East are also considered by the Board of Trade to be an important means of furtheringthese aims.In addition, the Working Party wish to recommend that further study begiven to a suggestion that the British Ambassador in Beirut should be provided with a fund to enable him to subscribe up to  1,000 a year for five years to theBritish Chamber of Commerce which is about to be established there. ThisChamber of Commerce could serve as an information centre and reception point for businessmen visiting the whole of the Middle East. At a later date thethe possibility of establishing a trade centre in connexion with it might be examined. The possibility of a similar subscription by H.M. Ambassador inBagdad to the British Commercial Society there should also be investigated.In the longer term, consideration should be given to whether any action is open to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage United Kingdom firms toestablish local organisations or companies in association with local businessmen, a development which would carry obvious political advantages while providing much needed channels for increased trade.15. Medicine. British teachers and doctors are already making a valuable contribution to the health of the area and to our own influence. In addition, theOrder of St. John and the London Ophthalmological Institute are about to startresearch into the greatest scourge of the region, the eye disease trachoma, fromwhich 50 per cent, of the total population and 90 per cent, of the Arab refugeesare suffering. Consideration should be given to giving some financial assistance tothis work.16. Technical Education. A questionnaire has been put to all Middle EastMissions to obtain facts about the demand in the Middle East for technical education, the facilities at present provided, and the ways in which this country can help. A full report will be submitted as soon as replies have been analysed.In the meantime there are two institutions already being run on British lines or with British equipment. These are the Technical College at Bagdad, and theEngineering Faculty of the American University at Beirut. It is proposed thatthe British Council should subsidise one or two professorships at the former (seeparagraph 7 (iii) above) and that a gift of equipment not exceeding  20,000 shouldbe made. The latter is already being equipped with British machinery at therequest of the American Dean of the Faculty. Some  50,000 worth of equipmenthas already been presented by British industry. A gift by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment of a similar value would establish the practice of equipping thisfaculty with British equipment, with considerable advantage to our prestige andto our trade. Engineers trained on British machinery will prefer and specify itlater on.17. Nuclear Energy will not be an economic proposition in the Middle Eastfor many years. But its emotional appeal is great, and the Arabs will not accept our word for the technical and economic difficulties. If we do not help them theywill turn elsewhere. Further consideration should be given to an offer to train inthe United Kingdom research teams from selected countries.18. Labour affairs are a subject which requires increasing attention in theMiddle East. Up to date it has been possible for the Labour Counsellor at theBritish Embassy, Cairo, who also serves as a member of the Middle EastDevelopment Division, to cover labour questions throughout the Arab world withthe help of our assistant. Now, however, the labour relations of the Oil companies are becoming increasingly difficult, and there is at the same time a development oftrade unionism in the Levant States, and a tendency for these trade unions todrift to the Left. The Working Party recommend that the possibility of attachinga Labour Attache to the staff of the British Ambassador in Beirut, who wouldalso cover Syria and Jordan, should be further considered.
APPENDIX A(see paragraph 7)TECHNICAL ASSISTANCEBritish political and commercial influence in the Middle East can be enhanced by technical assistance in at least four ways:  (a) to increase the Middle East Development Divisions;(b) to establish a sizeable fund for the provision, free of ad hoc advisers andconsultants;(c) to subsidise the salaries paid by local Governments to certain Britishemployees;(,d) to improve the British contribution to the technical training of Middle Eastnationals either in their own countries or in the United Kingdom.Immediate action can be taken in the first three cases.Development Division2. At present the Division has a Head of wide administrative and generalexperience and specialist advisers on agriculture, co-operatives, animal husbandry,forestry, labour, and statistics and economics. All are fully occupied and considerably raise our prestige in the relevant Departments of Middle EastGovernments. Odious comparisons are drawn against the United Nations andPoint IV advisers. The co-operative adviser is so overburdened that it will benecessary to re-engage on a part-time basis a former Development Division adviser(Mr. Cheesman) to deal particularly with Egypt and Libya. The cost should notbe more than  1,000 a year.3. The Division^ usefulness can, however, be increased by adding to thepresent largely agricultural staff an industrial engineer who might be an expert in,say, mechanical engineering and familiar with electrical and chemical engineering.Such a man might cost  5,000 a year, or more according to the amount of travellinghe does. He would not only advise local Governments at their request but would serve as a point of quick reference, for technical advice, by the CommercialSecretaries in the area. He should enable us to introduce a number of useful ad hocadvisers into the region: see below.4. No provision is now requested for increasing the accommodation of theDevelopment Division at Beirut. It is assumed that the Embassy can continue to house it for the present.Ad Hoc Advisers&apos; Fund5. The Foreign Office already disposes of a very small fund ( 2,700) whichis used for planting short-term advisers to supplement the expertise available inthe Development Division. It is considered now that a much larger fund shouldbe provided for the same purpose. It would be administered in the same way, onthe basis of recommendations submitted by H.M. Missions, on which the19. The Working Party consider similarly that a proposal to attach a regional Oil Adviser either to the Middle East Embassies or to the Middle EastDevelopment Division should be examined. He would serve as a link betweenH.M. Missions and the Oil Companies, and might be able to do useful work ineducating local Governments in the commercial realities of the oil business.20. The Working Party consider that the above proposals would substantiallyimprove our influence in the area and the security of the flow of oil. the approximate additional expenditure involved if these interim proposals are approved would be of the order of  700,000 a year: including between  100,000and  200,0000 of capital expenditure.November 10, 1955.

The Working Party consider that the above proposals would substantiallyimprove our influence in the area and the security of the flow of oil. the approximate additional expenditure involved if these interim proposals are approved would be of the order of  700,000 a year: including between  100,000and  200,0000 of capital expenditure.November 10, 1955.APPENDIX A(see paragraph 7)TECHNICAL ASSISTANCEBritish political and commercial influence in the Middle East can be enhanced by technical assistance in at least four ways:  (a) to increase the Middle East Development Divisions;(b) to establish a sizeable fund for the provision, free of ad hoc advisers andconsultants;(c) to subsidise the salaries paid by local Governments to certain Britishemployees;(d) to improve the British contribution to the technical training of Middle Eastnationals either in their own countries or in the United Kingdom.Immediate action can be taken in the first three cases.Development Division2. At present the Division has a Head of wide administrative and generalexperience and specialist advisers on agriculture, co-operatives, animal husbandry,forestry, labour, and statistics and economics. All are fully occupied and considerably raise our prestige in the relevant Departments of Middle EastGovernments. Odious comparisons are drawn against the United Nations andPoint IV advisers. The co-operative adviser is so overburdened that it will benecessary to re-engage on a part-time basis a former Development Division adviser(Mr. Cheesman) to deal particularly with Egypt and Libya. The cost should notbe more than  1,000 a year.3. The Division^ usefulness can, however, be increased by adding to thepresent largely agricultural staff an industrial engineer who might be an expert in,say, mechanical engineering and familiar with electrical and chemical engineering.Such a man might cost  5,000 a year, or more according to the amount of travellinghe does. He would not only advise local Governments at their request but would serve as a point of quick reference, for technical advice, by the CommercialSecretaries in the area. He should enable us to introduce a number of useful ad hocadvisers into the region: see below.4. No provision is now requested for increasing the accommodation of theDevelopment Division at Beirut. It is assumed that the Embassy can continue to house it for the present.Ad Hoc Advisers&apos; Fund5. The Foreign Office already disposes of a very small fund ( 2,700) whichis used for planting short-term advisers to supplement the expertise available inthe Development Division. It is considered now that a much larger fund shouldbe provided for the same purpose. It would be administered in the same way, onthe basis of recommendations submitted by H.M. Missions, on which the
102./3Development Division offer their comments. The enlarged fund would enable usto step in with an offer of an expert whenever it suited us politically or commerciallyto do so and also when the local Government was either chary of undertaking any expenditure or was turning to the wrong source of advice. In particular, theDevelopment Division and H.M. Missions (working on advice obtained from theBoard of Trade) would try to arrange &quot; introductory&quot; missions for Britishconsultants at our expense, in the hope that the local Government possessing a sound preliminary report, would themselves engage the consultant on a long-term basis.6. The best prospects for the provision of ad hoc advisers seem at the moment to lie in Persia, in Iraq (where new fields such as land settlement have to be tackled),in Kuwait, and possibly in Saudi Arabia.Provision:  10,000 a YearSubsidies7. United Kingdom subsidies to employees of Middle East governments must obviously be used with great caution. They should in any case not be spreadthin but applied with reasonable liberality so as to provide the right incentive in selected quarters. A very few key jobs may require big money, e.g., the  4,000 ayear now being paid as a subsidy to the British member of the Iraq development board. In other cases, our strategic interests may require the payment of subsidies to a number of people in one country: Libya. In general, however, it will bepossible to insert suitable British employees in chosen jobs by the expenditure ofsmall annual amounts or possibly installation grants or terminal gratuities. cases in point are the four or five foresters required by the Persian Government whowould, if appointed, practically run the Department and could make it a success which would redound to our credit. All told, it is estimated that about  10,000 ayear should be allocated for subsidies for non-educational posts. In the field ofeducation, including medical education, it seems appropriate that the british council should administer any subsidies required. There would be close liaison with the Levant Department of the Foreign Office as regards general principles and practice in particular countries.Provision:  10,000 a YearTechnical Training8. No immediate measures can be proposed, but a full report will be submitted in consultation with the Board of Trade, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of education and the British Council when the facts are known about the demand for technical training, the existing facilities, and the ways in which this country can help.Economic Assistance9. The question of economic aid to the Middle East countries has not beenconsidered by the Working Party, except for the development grants to the TrucialStates. The Development Division will be instructed to explore the possibilities of expanding the present grant of some  25,000 a year to the Trucial States, whoseimportance will grow if oil is found, and where we must in any case show ourbeneficent power to consolidate the Buraimi move. Our present assistance toJordan is reviewed annually, and any alterations can then be made in the light ofexisting circumstances.Provision for the Trucial Coast  6,000 a YearFurther Possibilities10. It is certain that the recruitment of British experts to advise, or beemployed by, Middle East Governments would be facilitated if candidates were offered the security of employment in a permanent Crown Service or if they weregiven substantial relief from United Kingdom taxation. Immediate results cannotbe expected in either field hence the present need for subsidies but bothproblems should be examined as a matter of urgency.Total Provision:  26,000
(OZ-kAPPENDIX B(See paragraph 10)HER MAJESTVS MISSIONSCategory A. Recommended for Immediate ApprovalReduction of Tours of Duty for Members of the Foreign Service in Posts in theMiddle East Scheduled as Unhealthy [Including Khartoum) from eighteen months to One Year1.   This proposal would do much to mitigate the unpleasant effects of climateparticularly in the Persian Gulf and therefore to make specialisation in the middle east more attractive.   It is particularly important that no officer or his familyshould be obliged to serve for two consecutive summers in the area without a break.The Working Party recommends that no formal change should be made inthe present leave regulations, but that the Foreign Office should be authorised tobring Foreign Service officers home on leave by air at public expense at convenienttimes after the completion of each year&apos;s service in these posts.Maximum Estimated Cost  10,000 p.a.Upgrading of Posts at Her Majesty&apos;s Missions and Consular Posts in the Area2. To provide a real incentive for the able and ambitious young officer tobecome an &quot; Arabist,&apos;&quot; it is essential to improve the promotion prospects for ArabicSpecialists who feel themselves at a disadvantage with other specialists because,owing to the extent of the Arab world they must at present expect to serve for upto two-thirds of their career in that particular area. To achieve this, the grading of some Head of Mission posts should be raised; there should be correspondingupgradings at medium levels (i.e., the post of Counsellor at Bagdad should beraised to Minister and about seven First Secretary posts should be raised toCounsellor status, i.e., the No. 2 at Beirut, Damascus, Amman, Jedda, Charged&apos;Affaires to the Yemen, the Commercial post at Bahrain and the information postat Cairo). In addition, it is important to provide some fairly senior posts in thepleasanter cities to which Arab specialists can look forward as a break from themore arduous conditions in the greater part of the area. This need could be met by upgrading the posts of Consul-General at Tunis and Algiers from Grade A6 to5, a step which the increasing importance of these posts will probably justify in anycase.The Working Party agreed that the Treasury should be asked to givesympathetic consideration to the upgrading of these posts. The changes would notbe made at once and the Foreign Office would consult the Treasury in each case.Estimated Cost  11/12,000 a Yearincreased Language Allowances3. The present Arabic language allowances are not as high as those for someother languages. An increase in the Arabic allowances to the highest existing level would provide a direct financial incentive to potential Arabists which, with theother measures proposed by the Working Party, should greatly increase theattractiveness of long service in the Middle East.There are three classes of Arabic allowances in force, and the Working Partyrecommends that each should be raised by 60 per cent, to  300 a year (Branch AHigher Allowance),  150 a year (Branch A Lower Allowance), and  90 a year(Branch B Allowance).Estimated Cost  4,000 p.a.
IOZ-Middle East Centre of Arab Studies (Shemlan)4. The premises of the Centre are in need of repair and re-equipment; thereare very few amenities or opportunities for recreation for the students; much ofthe accommodation is primitive. These conditions do not encourage attendanceby fee-paying outside students, e.g., from the banks and oil companies, whoseinfluence for good in the Middle East would be much enhanced if they had passed through the Centre. If conditions were improved, the Centre would be likelynot only to attract more students but would improve its efficiency and turn outbetter Arabists.The Working Party therefore recommends that the Treasury should givesympathetic consideration to any proposals made by the Foreign Office for the repair, maintenance and improvement of the Centre&apos;s buildings and for theprovision of better living conditions up to an initial cost of  15,000 and up to 5,000 a year thereafter.A ir-Conditioning5. Living and working conditions in the Middle East could be greatly improved by the extensive installation of air-conditioning in offices, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment houses and hiring. Although a certain amount of air-conditioninghas already been installed there are insufficient funds available to do more thancater for the worst places. Without making an extensive survey of all propertiesand hirings it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of what is required. TheWorking Party agrees, however, that  30,000 could well be spent in the first year.During the following two years further expenditure also would be required, butat this stage it is not possible to give more than an approximate estimate of another 30,000 in each of the two years.A ir craft6. Better means of air travel are required for the Political Resident, persian gulf. At present he has either to rely on a wing of decrepit Ansons which are stationed at Bahrain, or use scheduled aircraft or charter. In view of the importanceof the area, the distances involved and the time factor, the Working Party considersthat he should have an aircraft at his disposal mainly for efficiency but also forprestige. The means to effect this remain to be investigated in detail but thepresent estimated cost is  35,000 annually.Launches7. For official requirements, prestige and recreation, the Working Party agrees that posts in the Persian Gulf area should all have launches. At present thosewithout launches are Khorramshahr, Doha and Abu Dhabi. The Working Partyagreed in principle to the provision of proper launches. The provisional estimate is  20,000 capital cost and  5,000 a year running costs.Buildings8. A considerable amount of building could be done in the Middle East area in order to provide better offices, better residences and staff houses. The provisionof up-to-date offices would greatly improve our prestige and the efficiency of thestaff. Bettor residences would ease the task of the Ambassador and the provisionof staff houses would enable the staff to live in better and more attractive conditions.Any building scheme, however, takes a long time to develop and little money couldbe spent in the first eighteen months. Thereafter, with a carefully phasedprogramme, a considerable amount of money could be well spent each year. Sincebuilding is very expensive and long term, only the most important project amongmany (that at Damascus) is included here.In view of the importance of Syria, the unsuitability and insecurity of tenure of the present offices and residence in Damascus, it is recommended that a newcombined Embassy residence and offices should be built on the site which her majesty&apos;s Government now own there.Estimated Cost is  100,000The cost of this project would be nothing in the first year, about  20,000 inthe second year, and  80,000 in the third year.

APPENDIX the BRITISH COUNCILProposals for Expansion in Middle East 1956-59Note by British Council on Recruitment of staff the British Council cannot undertake additional activities on this scalewithout some permanent additions to staff. If the proposals are accepted in full,the Council would need to expand its own establishment by some thirty newLondon-appointed posts above the clerical grade over the next three years. (Thesefigures do not include subsidised posts in universities, schools, &amp;c.)2. This raises a recruitment problem which may be summarised as follows.Immediately after the war, at the request of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, theBritish Council was greatly expanded. From 1951 on it was sharply contracted.The resulting dismissals of staff have naturally undermined its credit withUniversity Appointments Boards. There has been no cadet recruitment to theBritish Council for six years. Before cadet recruitment to the British Councilcan be resumed it will be necessary for Ministers to approve proposals designedto enable the British Council to state unequivocally that it is a permanent service.Proposals to this end were contained in a letter from the. Foreign Secretary tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer dated 6th July, 1955.3. Temporary recruitment would not produce the kind of candidates whowould be good representatives of this country overseas, and the British council would be unwilling to take on additional work on this basis.4. The only other method of producing the necessary staff would be to close down in a considerable number of other countries. Experience has shownthat to withdraw the British Council after it has started in a country does serious damage to good will. The Foreign Office is unable to recommend countries tobe eliminated.5. In practice therefore the only solution to the problem of staff is to enablethe British Council to undertake permanent recruitment. It is accordingly recommended that an early decision should be given on the proposals containedin the Foreign Secretary&apos;s letter of 6th July, 1955.APPENDIX ETHE BRITISH COUNCILProposals for Reception and Care of Students from Middle Eastin United kingdom plan for extending the Councils welfare work for Commonwealth andforeign (including Middle Eastern) students in the United Kingdom has beenapproved in principle. It includes the purchase of a building for a new studentcentre in London for  107,000 non-recurrent and an annual cost of the whole scheme of  23,000 recurrent. The only really suitable building which has so far been found turns out to cost about  160,000 non-recurrent and to raise the annual cost of the whole scheme to  28,000 recurrent; the project is hanging fire partly because of the increase in costs but mainly because of the objection to layin^ outthe large capital sum involved in repairing the particular building in view. Thereis a possibility that another, less suitable, building may become available at anannual rent of about  20,000.

It is thoughtthat this activity could be considerably increased immediately if the Council were able to offer fullexpenses, including fares. The figures assume that the fares of one-third of the increased numberswill be paid either by themselves or by their Governments.APPENDIX part 11THE BRITISH COUNCILProposals for Subsidising British University Staff, Teachers and EducationalAdvisers for Service with Foreign Governments and institutions in the Middle EastSerial                                   Project Cost(Item numbers in main report) 1st year 2nd year       3rd year                    (iii) (a)       Middle East (1) Subsidies      ............ 18,000 38,000         63,000(2) Guarantees of contracts   ...... 2,000 4,000          7,000(iii) (6)      Pakistan-Subsidies and guarantees for British staffin cadet colleges in Pakistan......      5,500 5,500 5,500(iii) (c)      Total ...............     25,500        47,500 75,500Note.

(Appendix F, Part 2).APPENDIX FTHE BRITISH COUNCILProposals for More Visitors to the United KingdomProject
\0Z-APPENDIX part 2Recruitment of TeachersNote by Ministry of EducationThere are four main requirements if teachers of the right quality are to be recruited for service in the Middle East in sufficient numbers. These are salaries,security of contracts, the assurance of suitable employment on return to the UnitedKingdom and the safeguarding of pension rights.It is assumed that the responsibility for making financial conditions more attractive and for security of contracts would rest with the British Council, whichis responsible for recruiting teachers. The Ministry of Education does not itselfemploy teachers in England and Wales nor does it pay their salaries and legislation would probably be needed to enable the Ministry to pay or supplement the salaries of teachers going overseas.The British Council have stated that a major obstacle to recruitment at present is the fear that there may be difficulty in securing suitable employment in thiscountry on return. It is not possible to deal with this problem as it is dealt within a country like France where teachers are civil servants but there is much that can be done and the Ministry is very willing to help as far as it properly can.Local education authorities and other employing bodies have already been urged to help by agreeing to the secondment of teachers seeking overseas service(Circular 170 of May, 1948, which was replaced by Circular 277 of July, 1954).Schools and institutions for which the British Council recruit staff are specifically mentioned in those circulars. On the whole the response by local educationauthorities to those circulars has been satisfactory and the majority are willingto take teachers back into their service after periods of service overseas, normallyvarying between two and four years. Some authorities, however, are unwilling to agree to secondment; in certain cases it is not practicable, e.g., where the teacherholds one of a very small number of specialists posts, or where the initial periodof service is a long one. In addition teachers often do not desire secondment.There is also difficulty in arranging secondment where the employer is an individualschool and not an authority.It will be necessary to secure the co-operation and goodwill of therepresentatives of the employing bodies and teachers&apos; organisations both in encouraging the fullest possible use of existing secondment arrangements and indevising supplementary machinery to help teachers who have not been secondedto find appropriate posts on their return to this country. The Ministry is readyto take the necessary steps in consultation with other Government Departmentsconcerned, e.g., the Colonial Office and the Scottish Education Department. a useful analogy is the Joint Appointments Board of Teachers run by the NationalUnion of Teachers and the Association of Education Committees which has been extremely effective in placing teachers who find difficulty in securing posts. Thecost of a similar organisation with one full-time officer, which would be sufficientat any rate in the early stages, would be small and could be met by the Ministryunder existing grant regulations.Arrangements already exist for safeguarding pension rights of teachers goingabroad after some contributory service in Great Britain. (The new TeachersSuperannuation Bill will also cover those without previous contributory service in this country.) The normal maximum period of service abroad is five years but in appropriate cases this can be extended by the Ministry on an annual basis.These arrangements would cover the large majority of teachers and difficulty will only arise in the few cases where a teacher&apos;s service abroad extends substantiallybeyond five years.

Initiallythe sum of  20,000 might be set aside for making two or three films specially forshowing in the Middle East. If they prove successful more could be allocated in following years. A twenty-minute documentary costs about  4,000 to  5,000: ifmaterial were &quot; shot &quot; in the Middle East for inclusion the cost would increase toabout  6,000 to  7,000.Cost ............       20,0008. TelevisionThe acquisition by the Iraq Government of a transmitting station and thepossibility that the Egyptians may emulate this step means that we should beready to exploit this medium, though numbers reached will at first be small, andthe region is really hardly ready for a large-scale development of television. Thequestion of advice for the Iraqis in programming is being currently explored with .M. Embassy in Bagdad. Production from B.B.C./I.T.A. material of atelevision newsreel might be investigated.9. Tours and Visits(a) Information Policy Department run an annual programme of tours of theUnited Kingdom by journalists, trade unionists and, with Treasury agreement,other persons &quot; capable of influencing public opinion.&quot; An increase in the number3. Damascus Trade FairThe importance of participation has been urged in past years on political grounds by Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Damascus. The Board of Trade andIndustry have hitherto regarded this event as of little trade promotional value, butthe Federation of British Industries are understood to be reviewing this judgment.They could probably be persuaded to arrange for the erection of a British Pavilionand to encourage British firms to rent space if  10,000 could be provided towardsthe cost of an official stand. The next fair is not due until 1956, but preparation for it should be begun as soon as possible.Cost ............       10,0004. &quot; Al&apos;Aalam &quot;The circulation of this popular illustrated magazine (Picture Post type)produced in Arabic by the Central Office of Information could be increased, andif air freight could be used instead of slower means of transport, for despatch of copies when printed to Middle East posts for distribution, up-to-date comments on topical events could be included.Cost will require investigation with the Central Office of Information.5. Arabic Pamphlets and PublicationsAn increase in the amount of material produced by the Regional InformationOffice in Beirut should be discussed as soon as possible with that office and theCentral Office of Information.
IOZ Tof tours from the Middle East should be considered (at present six or seven parties of four each are possible): but previous experience indicates that (i) no dividend is likely to be got from bringing here large numbers of Arabjournalists;(ii) the general and industrial &quot; sight-seeing &quot; tour of the type which thepresent machinery of the Central Office of Information is geared to runis of little interest to Middle-Easterners.To be worth while the guests invited should be senior officials and perhapspoliticians, and the programme for them here should include interviews with andhospitality offered by senior British officials: and the guests will often expect to bereceived by Ministers and other leading political figures. The extent to which thenumber of tours should be increased therefore depends not so much on money ason the time which those concerned here will be able to give to them. If the guestsare of high calibre and are treated here as V.I.P.s the tour is very valuable:otherwise it may be money wasted. (See also paragraph 8 (ii): close liaison withthe British Council and the Board of Trade will be necessary.)(b) Sponsorship of lecture tours of the Middle East by prominent Britishpersonalities or experts should be considered: but language may limit the choice.10. &quot; Arab Listener &quot;The revival of the &quot; Arab Listener,&quot; formerly published by the british broadcasting Corporation should be considered   The cost would be about  10,000.
