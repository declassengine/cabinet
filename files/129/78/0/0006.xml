(55) 15618th October, 1955CABINETCAPITAL EXPENDITURE: MESSAGE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIESNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the final text of the message on capital expenditure to local authorities which I circulated to the Cabinet as annex A to CP. (55) 132, as revised after discussion with the Ministers concerned.The message will be signed, for authorities in England and Wales, by theMinister of Housing and Local Government and myself; and for authorities inScotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself. The aim is for the message to arrive at each local authority&apos;s office on the day following the statements which we are to make to Parliament on its reassembly.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,17th October, 1955.MESSAGE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES ON CAPITAL expenditure . This message is to explain the action that the Government ask all localauthorities to take as part of the series of measures announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer to reduce the demands upon the nation&apos;s resources. [Englandand Wales only. A further communication explaining the Government^ housingsubsidy proposals will be issued shortly by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment.]2. We are writing to you, and to all other local authorities, on behalf of theGovernment to ask you to undertake an immediate review of your capitalexpenditure for the period from now to 31st March [Scotland, 15th May] 1957. we also ask you to review your current expenditure in order to secure economieswherever possible, and to refrain, save in cases of exceptional need, fromundertaking new services which wiil involve additional expenditure either from government grants or from the rates.3. The reason for this request is that in recent months it has become clearthat the productive resources of the nation&apos; are carrying too heavy a load. the consequence of this is seen in the upward movement of costs and prices at home,jrasKwel^asriin^thevpressure^^terJiing abrqad.,^    ,:,;,0;;;- wmmh pauoa -soTC)
20 For county district councils in England and Wales and for all Scottish authorities exceptCounty Councils, add here a parenthesis &quot; (excluding for this purpose expenditure on housing) &quot;.(2) For the authorities covered by note (*) of paragraph 5, add &quot; as here defined &quot;. -; -&apos;4. The Government&apos;s policy is designed to bring the total demand within the capacity of the nation&apos;s productive resources. It has always been recognised, fromthe Full Employment White Paper of 1944 (Cmd. 6527) onwards, that themaintenance of full employment involves a continuing process of adjustment,particularly in the capital expenditure plans of public authorities, in order to keepthe economic affairs of the country on an even keel.5. The aims of your review should be to ensure first, that your authority&apos;s total capital expenditure!1) in the year 1956-57 does not exceed that of 1954-55, and secondly, that no new works, even those already authorised, are undertaken unlessyour authority are satisfied that those works are urgently necessary to meet theneeds of the area.6. Some authorities, it is hoped, will be able to reduce their capitalexpenditure!2) below the level of 1954-55. We appreciate, however, that someauthorities have special problems which may prevent them from fully carrying outthe first of the aims of the review. This may apply particularly to those authorities with rapidly expanding populations and to those whose capital projects are concentrated on one service in which they are already committed to expansion.7. Questions of the priority to be given to different projects should normally be decided in the light of local circumstances in your area. Where it is appropriate,for example in the execution of the road programme which involves co-operationbetween authorities, the Department concerned will be ready to give guidance onthe relative urgency of projects in its field.8. We appreciate that to give effect to the request in this message may resultin the postponement of improvements which local authorities would like to makein the standards of their services. But the essential condition for all future progress is to ensure the nation&apos;s internal and external economic stability. Failure to takethe necessary action for this purpose would involve later a much more serioussetback to employment and the standard of living.
