Printed for the Cabinet. December 1955SECRET . Copy No.   67CP. (55) 20216th December, 1955CABINETCAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs in response to the invitation of the Cabinet on 22nd November (CM. (55)42nd Conclusions, Minute 4) I have set out in this paper the arguments for and against capital punishment. The paper does not attempt to discuss moralconsiderations or the belief, sincerely held by many, that it is wrong in any circumstances to take life.RECENT HISTORY2. The Criminal Justice Bill, as introduced by the Labour Government in1948, proposed no substantial change in the law about capital punishment, buton a free vote in the House of Commons on an amendment moved by a private member (Mr. Silverman) it was amended by 245 votes to 222 so as to suspend the death penalty for five years. This amendment was rejected by the House ofLords. The Government then proposed a compromise clause by which murderswould be graded, with capital punishment only for the worst. This compromisewas accepted by the House of Commons but rejected by the House of Lords.3. In 1949 the Labour Government appointed a Royal Commission toconsider whether liability to suffer capital punishment for murder should belimited or modified. The Commission^ chief recommendations were that theM&apos;Naghten Rules should be abrogated, and, by a majority of 1, that the age-limitbelow which a person may not be sentenced to death should be raised from18 to 21. They suggested somewhat tentatively that the jury should be givendiscretion to substitute a lesser sentence for the sentence of death.4. In a debate in the House of Commons in February, 1955, on a motion totake note of the Royal Commission^ report (Cmd. 8932), I announced the Govern-ment&apos;s provisional conclusion that the main recommendations were unacceptable.On a free vote, an amendment providing for the suspension of capital punishment for five years was rejected by 245 votes to 214.5. In this Session I have announced that the Government have confirmedtheir provisional conclusion that the Commission^ main recommendations areunacceptable; that a number of minor recommendations have been carried outadministratively; and that the remaining recommendations, many of which arecontroversial or raise difficult issues, have been noted for consideration when anopportunity for legislation arises.6. Mr. S. Silverman, M.P., has been given leave to introduce, under theTen-Minute Rule, a Bill providing for the abolition or suspension of the death penalty. It is unlikely to make progress in the normal way, but over 200 members have put their names to a motion asking for an opportunity to debate the SecondReading of the Bill.
7. The Prime Minister has announced that the Government will considerproviding time for a debate on capital punishment, but that time cannot be foundin the immediate future.A. The Arguments in Favour of the Abolition of Capital PunishmentThe Absence of Clear Proof that Capital Punishment is an Effective Deterrent8. The main argument in favour of the abolition of capital punishment isthat the taking of life by the State can be justified only if it is an effective deterrent,that there is no reliable evidence that it is an effective deterrent, and that theexperience of those countries that have abolished capital punishment shows thatabolition does not lead to an increase in murder. The Royal Commission considered in great detail whether there was evidence that capital punishment was an effectivedeterrent, and they were careful to emphasise that differences in law, custom andstatistical method made strict comparison between one country and anotherimpossible.  The Royal Commission said that:  (a) &quot; There is no clear evidence .... that the abolition of capital punishmenthas led to an increase in the homicide rate, or that its reintroductionhas led to a fall.&quot;   (Paragraph 65.)(b) Comparing States in the United States of America which have abolishedcapital punishment with those that have not &quot; The only conclusion which can be drawn from the figures is thatthere is no clear evidence of any influence of the death penalty on thehomicide rates of these States.&quot; . (Paragraph 64.)(c) &quot; The negative conclusion we draw from the figures (of foreign countries)does not imply a conclusion that the deterrent effect of capital punish-ment cannot be greater than that of any other punishment. It meansonly that the figures afford no reliable evidence one way or the other.&quot;(Paragraph 67.)(d) &quot; We recognise that it is impossible to arrive confidently at firm conclusionsabout the deterrent effect of the death penalty, or indeed of any formof punishment. The general conclusion which we reach, after careful review of all the evidence we have been able to obtain as to the deterrent effect of capital punishment, may be stated as follows: prima facie the penalty of death is likely to have a stronger effect as a deterrent to normal human beings than any other form of punishment, and thereis some evidence (though no convincing statistical evidence) that this isin fact so. But this effect does not operate universally or uniformlyand there are many offenders on whom it is limited and may often be negligible. It is accordingly important to view this question in a justperspective and not to base a penal policy in relation to murder onexaggerated estimates of the uniquely deterrent force of the death penalty.&quot;   (Paragraph 68.)There is a Risk that an Innocent Person may be Hanged9. There is no evidence that this has happened in modern times. It is nearly a hundred years since an innocent person (Plabron) is known to have been convictedin England or Wales of murder, and he had been reprieved before his innocencecame to light. If there is even a scintilla of doubt at the time, a reprieve is recom-mended, and the risk that an innocent person might be executed is in practiceextremely slight. As Sir David Maxwell Fyfe stated in the debate on the criminla justice Bill in 1948, &quot; There is no practical possibility (of an innocent man beinghanged).....   Of course, a jury might be wrong, as might the House of lords and the Home Secretary; they might all be stricken mad and go wrong. But thatis not a possibility which anyone can consider likely.&quot; (Official Report, 14th April,1948, Col. 1077.) It cannot, however, be said to be impossible in theory that new-information might come to light after execution which would have thrown sufficientdoubt to justify reprieve.That Juries would be more ready to Convict if there were no Death Penalty10. There is no reason to believe that this is true, and juries show no reluctance to convict when the case is properly proved. It is sometimes said that juries show
1* ioB. The Arguments Against Abolition of Capital PunishmentThe Presumed Deterrent Effect15. The main argument for retaining capital punishment turns also on itsdeterrent effect. Even if statistical proof is lacking, common sense suggests thatthe fear of death must be a forceful deterrent, at least in certain cases. It is knownwhere the deterrent is not effective but can never be known how many persons werein fact deterred. The Royal Commission^ conclusions are not inconsistent withthis. They said:  &quot; Capital punishment has obviously failed as a deterrent when a murderis committed. We can number its failures. But we cannot number itssuccesses. No one can ever tell how many people have refrained from murderbecause of the fear of being hanged.....  We think it reasonable to suppose that the deterrent force of capital punishment operates not only by affectingthe conscious thoughts of individuals tempted to commit murder, but also by building up in the community, over a long period of time, a deep feeling ofpeculiar abhorrence for the crime of murder..... This widely diffused effecton the moral consciousness of society is impossible to assess, but it must be atleast as important as any direct part which the death penalty may play as a deterrent in the calculations of potential murderers. It is likely to be speciallypotent in this country, where the punishment for lesser offences is much morelenient than in many other countries, and the death penalty stands out insharper contrast &quot; (paragraph 59).a lenient attitude by bringing in verdicts of &quot; guilty but insane &quot; when not strictlywarranted by the evidence, but the proportion of such verdicts has shown no significant trend in this century. The reluctance of juries to convict in the days when theft was a capital crime is well known, and it was evidence that the law had fallen behind public opinion, but no such conclusion can be drawn from the currentconduct of juries.That Hanging is a Cruel and Barbaric Survival11. The Royal Commission concluded that hanging was quick and painless,and at present the best available method of execution. But although hanging itself is painless the anticipation of it or of any form of capital punishment may causesevere suffering.That Capital Punishment Inflicts Severe Suffering on Innocent Persons12. It is said that capital punishment punishes the innocent as well as theguilty in that it inflicts severe suffering on the parents, wives or children of thecondemned men. This would be true to some extent of life imprisonment, but it istrue that the suffering of near relatives must be severe and is no doubt enhanced by the sensational publicity which attends these cases.That Hanging is Bad for the Health and Morale of Prison Staffs and OtherPrisoners13. The Royal Commission found that some officials, particularly chaplains,were occasionally affected in health. The Commission thought that generally the strain was short-lived and had no lasting adverse effect on health. They thoughtthat duty in the condemned cell tended to bring out the best in the officers concerned (paragraph 781). They were satisfied that though a certain strain among other prisoners was inevitable it did not last long. Executions now take place at atime when the prisoners are at work; the bell is no longer tolled, and the sound ofthe trap is deadened (paragraphs 783 and 785).Capital Punishment Leads to Morbid Sensationalism14. It is true that certain newspapers encourage an unhealthy appetite for themorbid details of capital cases and the condemned cell. But if there were nocapital punishment these papers would still foster the same kind of interest inmurder. They live by sensation, and murder will still remain sensational even if itdoes not lead to the death cell.
It is sometimes argued that since only about one murderer in ten is executedthe risk of being hanged is too small to act as a deterrent. But a high proportion ofthose hot executed are abnormal, and either commit suicide or are found insane onarraignment or guilty but insane. Abnormal people are less likely to be affected byany deterrent. For those murderers who exhibit no gross abnormality, and are capable of being deterred, the risk of hanging is high. Of the 131 persons convicted of murder during the five years 1950-54, 49 were reprieved and 82 (about60 per cent.) executed.The Need to Deter Criminals, from Carrying Arms16. The Royal Commission were impressed (paragraph 61) by the virtuallyunanimous evidence of the police and prison service that they were convinced ofthe uniquely deterrent value of capital punishment in its effect on professionalcriminals. These witnesses had no doubt that the existence of the death penalty-was the main reason why criminals in this country do not usually carry firearms orother weapons; and that if capital punishment were abolished criminals would take to using violence and carrying weapons, and the police, who are now unarmed,might have to retaliate. The Commission pointed out that abolition in othercountries had not led to the results feared here, but emphasised that comparisonsbetween Great Britain and most other countries were vitiated by differences in social and industrial conditions and in density of population.The Need to Protect Prison Officers and Prisoners against Murderous Assaultsin Prison ;17. If there were no capital punishment there might not be an effectivedeterrent to prevent a violent man already undergoing life imprisonment frommurdering prison officers or other prisoners. Reprieved murderers are normallywell-behaved, and few of those now executed show any general tendency toviolence; moreover the prisoner serving a life sentence is conscious that the periodof his detention will depend on his conduct to a much greater extent than is a prisoner who is sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment by a court.Nevertheless if capital punishment were abolished and as a result more professionalcriminals committed murder the number of violent and ill-disciplined men servinglife sentences would increase.The Continuing Increase in Crimes of Violence. 18. Prima facie a steady increase in crimes of violence does not indicate the sort of settled state of society in which abolition can safely be introduced. In1954 the number of indictable crimes of violence known to the police was 7,500as compared with 2,700 in 1938, and there has been a continuing increase in recentyears. There has been the same trend in sexual crimes, which have increased from5,000 in 1938 to 16,000 in 1954. Too much should not be read into these figures,as part of the increase may be due to changes in enforcement policy, or to atendency to charge offences in more serious categories. - There has, for example,been a decrease in the number of cases of common and aggravated assault dealtwith summarily over the same period, and it may be that incidents once treated asassaults are now dealt with more severely. But despite the limitations of the statistics, it is likely that there has been some genuine increase in crimes of violence and sexual crimes.. 19. I attach, at Appendix A, a statement showing for the last 25 years thenumber of murders known to the police, the number of persons arrested and whatbecame of them. The annual total of murders is not greater than in the years before the War, but this is true only if murders of children under one year of ageare included. After a bad period during the War, the number of murders of suchchildren has now resumed the pre-War downward trend. If these murders of young children are excluded, the position is that over the period 1900-39 the annualtotal of murders, remained fairly steadily at about 100; and that it is now about130. There seems to be no current tendency for an increase in this figure (seeAppendix B).THE ALTERNATIVE TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, 20, Any alter native, to capital punishment must be an effective deterrent andacceptable to public opinion. Imprisonment for life is the only possible alternative.This does hot mean that all reprieved murderers would be detained for the rest of
PUBLIC OPINION25. So far as particular murders are concerned public opinion is inclined to sympathise with the victim and his relatives up to conviction, and with themurderer thereafter; though much depends on the particular case. So far as theprinciple of capital punishment is concerned, it is difficult to say what the stateof public opinion is. In 1947 a Gallup Poll showed 69 per cent, in favour of the death penalty, 25 per cent, against and 6 per cent, undecided. Another poll twoyears later produced almost identical results. A similar poll in October 1953, justafter the Christie and Merrifield cases, showed 73 per cent, in favour of the death penalty, 15 per cent, against and 12 per cent, undecided. A further poll in July1955, shortly after the execution of Ruth Ellis, showed 50 per cent, in favour ofthe death penalty, 37 per cent: against and 13 per cent, undecided. It is likely that so long as capital punishment is maintained it will be chiefly the abolitioniststheir lives, but that of those of the kind now executed some would be detainedprobably for up to 20 years, and a smaller number of the type of Heath, Haighand Christie would have to be detained for the rest of their lives, or at any rateuntil they were sufficiently old for there to be no risk in freeing them.21. At present reprieved murderers are detained for about nine years if thereare no special features in their case. Since 1907 no life sentence prisoner has reserved more than 20 years, and only 10 have served so long. Qf those releasedsince the last war only 1 has served so long as 15 years. Of those now in prisononly 2 have served more than 10 years; 1 has served 11 years and one 18years. The latter, now 64, was recently described as &quot; crushed and broken underthe burden of his sentence . . . morose, dispirited a man without hope.&quot;22. If capital punishment were abolished prisoners of the type now executedwould have to serve substantially longer terms than 9 years, and judging from thepractice of countries which have abolished capital punishment it is likely that most of them would have to be detained for periods of 15 to 20 years. The RoyalCommission agreed w;th the Prison Commissioners that the risk of deterioration,in the sense that it would be impossible for the prisoner to resume life outside,was not such as to preclude &quot; an occasional prisoner serving a term of15 to-20 years,&quot; though they thought that the lesser deterioration known asinstitutionaiisation would have to be accepted (paragraph 656).23. Neither the Royal Commission, nor the Prison Commissioners in givingevidence to them, had to consider the problems that would arise if capital punishment were completely abolished, in that there would then be a numberof prisoners who would have to be detained for the rest of their lives, or at anyrate until they were so enfeebled as no longer to present a risk. A scrutiny hasbeen made of the cases^of the 86 murderers who were executed during the five-year period 1949-53, and a tentative conclusion is that if there had been no capital punishment about 60 of them could probably have been released after servingterms of up to 20 years; that about 10 would probably have had to be detained forthe rest of their lives or until they were so aged as to present no risk, and that theremainder might have fallen in either of the above categories, depending on their development while in prison. It is of interest that of those who could probably have been released after terms of up to 20 years, some 25 would have been aged45 or under on release even if they had served the full 20 years. It appears from these necessarily tentative figures that if capital punishment were abolishedthere would probably be a substantial number of prisoners who would have to bekept for life, and kept in close confinement because of the danger that they would commit further offences if they escaped. The problems presented by deteriorationwould be severe in these cases, but it is doubtful if the inhumanity of keeping menof this type in detention would weigh with those who consider hanging a greaterinhumanity. The problem of the management of a substantial number of prisonersserving very long sentences in close confinement would be novel and would haveto be solved on novel lines.24. It is unlikely that there would be any appreciable risk to the public inreleasing, after a long period of detention, reprieved murderers in the class forwhich perpetual detention was not considered necessary. There is only oneinstance in recent times of a reprieved murderer (Rowlands) committing a furthermurder after release; he was released during the war.
who will be vocal, and that those who support the death penalty will remain silentunless and until they think that there are signs of the abolitionists getting their way. Public opinion fluctuates according to the nature of the crimes which arein the public eye at the time: the Gallup polls indicate the reaction to the casesof Christie and Mrs. Merrifield on the one hand and Ruth Ellis on the other.There have been cases for example that of William Joyce in which it wouldhave been almost impossible to have recommended a reprieve even had some ground for clemency been found. Public&apos; opinion is, in my view, an unreliablebasis for a policy. It is a factor which we should take into account, but it isdecisive only in the negative sense that we ought not to abolish capital punishmentunless there is overwhelming public sentiment in favour of the change. TheSecretary of State has a duty to keep the Queen&apos;s Peace and must have regard to public safety as well as to public opinion.26. Experience abroad tends to support the view that it is after abolition that public opinion in favour of capital punishment makes itself felt, and that a fewbrutal crimes can easily persuade the public to press for the re-introduction ofcapital punishment. For example among the arguments for the re-introduction ofthe death penalty in New Zealand in 1950 were the. number of notorious sexualmurders during the period of abolition and the increase in murders by professionalcriminals. Restoration in some American States has similarly been attributed to public reaction to particular crimes. Abolition at a time of fluctuating crimerates may lead public opinion to ascribe an upward fluctuation in the number of crimes to abolition, even though the fluctuation is equally present in countries that have not abolished capital punishment.SUSPENSION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR A PERIOD27. It is often argued that since there is no evidence of the deterrent effectof capital punishment we should suspend the death penalty for five or ten yearsso that we can obtain evidence. I do not think that this would be satisfactory.The criminal statistics are subject to fluctuations for reasons beyond our knowledge and a period of five or ten years would be far too short to provide any reliableevidence of the effect of abolition or to throw light on the problem of keepingmen in detention for very long periods. It would be impossible to allow capital punishment to be resumed merely by efflux of time. Either legislation or aresolution of both Houses would be necessary on such an important matter anda decision might have to be taken in a hurry, with public opinion excited and liableto be greatly influenced by current crimes. This would be most unsatisfactory,and I do not think that we ought to adopt this expedient. We should insist that parliament, and the country, face the issue squarely and do not take refuge inthis superficially attractive half-way house.28. I have considered whether any compromise is possible. The RoyalCommission^ suggestion that the jury should be empowered to substitute a lessersentence for the sentence of death had not attracted support, and indeed was severely criticised in the House of Lords. We have rejected for what seemed tome sufficient reasons their recommendations in favour of abrogating the M&apos;Naghten.Rules and raising the age limit to 21. I should see no point and considerableembarrassment in attempting to restrict the scope of murders as suggested by theRoyal Commission, by altering the law on constructive malice, provocation bywords and suicide pacts. The introduction of degrees of murder has somewhatgreater appeal, but it has been attempted on several occasions, the last in 1948,and all attempts have failed. The Royal Commission said &quot; There are strong reasons for believing that it must inevitably be found impracticable to define a class of murders in which alone the infliction of the death penalty is appropriate.The crux of the matter is that any legal definition must be expressed in terms ofobjective characteristics of the offence, whereas the: choice. of the appropriatepenalty must be based on a much wider range of considerations, which cannot be defined but are essentially a matter for the exercise of discretion &quot; (paragraph 498).The Prerogative of Mercy enables discretion to be exercised, and it is sufficientlyflexible to take into account not only all mitigating circumstances, but, for example,changes in our views of the degree of responsibility which can be attributed to the mentally abnormal. My experience, like that of my predecessors, is that the HomeOffice advisers always approach a capital case with the earnest desire to findsufficient mitigating circumstances to justify the exercise of the Prerogative.
OTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS29. If we reject abolition, as I think we should, it seems to me that the mosthopeful line of advance is to make more extensive use of the Prerogative by a slightreassessment of what constitute sufficient mitigating circumstances. If there were a strong sentiment in the House of Commons in favour of abolition or in favour ofexacting the extreme penalty only in the most heinous cases I think that that is a factor which a Secretary of State would be justified in taking into account in considering, in a particular case, whether to recommend the exercise of the prerogative. This would probably not in practice result in a very marked decreasein the number of executions. In the last 12 months only 13 persons havebeen executed, and there is not, therefore, a great deal of scope for reduction.Nevertheless we might effect some readjustment of our estimate of what constitutemitigating circumstances sufficient to justify a reprieve, for example, by givinggreater weight to the emotional stress under which the offender laboured and topoints on which the Royal Commission recommended amendment of the law,namely, the youth of the offender where he is under 21, provocation by words alone,and the question whether the crime was committed in the course, or in furtherance,of some other offence. I think that it would be right to seek in this way to extend the field in which the Prerogative is exercised and to give some indication in theHouse that it was the intention to do so. It should be possible without offendingagainst constitutional propriety to give some such an indication in general terms.THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DEBATE30. I suggest that we should consider at this stage the nature of the motion on which the promised Debate is to take place. The ideal arrangement from our point of view would be to have it on the Motion for the Adjournment, but it islikely that the Opposition and others who oppose capital punishment will&apos;press foran opportunity to test the weight of opinion by a division. We must therefore consider the terms of a Motion.CONCLUSION31. There are, in my view, three courses open to us to abolish capital punishment, to leave both law and practice as they are, or leave the law as it is andmodify practice by making more extensive use of the Royal Prerogative. The lastcourse seems to me the best, and I suggest that we should agree not to amend thelaw and that I should, in considering in individual cases whether to recommend the exercise of the Prerogative, endeavour to give rather greater weight to the considerations indicated in paragraph 29 above with a view to extending the prerogative to certain cases in which it would not on present practice have been exercised. I further suggest that, if this is agreed, the Government should put down a motion which avoids the direct issue of abolition.G. LL.-G.Home Office, S.W.1,13 th December, 1955.
