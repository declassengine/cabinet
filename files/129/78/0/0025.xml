November&apos;1955&quot; JwiiU oil- :K- .;. - - .        ;di-  driver f-! ;-!.*A .\;CABINETTHE TEACHING OF ENGLISH OVERSEASMemorandum by the Minister of education the Working Party of the Middle East Oil Committee ask (CP. (55) 172)that the teaching of English in the Middle East shall be subsidised. Thisrecommendation applies, with little change of emphasis, to all countries and territories where-there is a demand to learn English.2. English could become the first truly world-language; that is, the secondlanguage in every school.and university in the world where&apos;a language otherthan the native tongue is taught. This will happen only if we catch the tide thatfor the moment runs in our favour. The young nations are asking for Englishbecause their own languages are too weak to be the vehicles of the new sciencesand know-how they wish to learn. This could change: either their own languagesand scholarship could be built up (e.g., Hindi in India; Egyptian universities asthe cultural centre of the Arab world) or the sciences and technics may be offered to the non-English speaking races through the medium of Russian. We have, onemay guess, no more than a generation in which to establish English as the universalinstrument of agricultural, industrial and scientific progress.3. At present all that is done to promote the teaching of English overseasis done by the British Council and the Colonial Office. The Education ministers have no powers. The Secretary of State for Scotland and I are like manufacturerswho have covenanted not to sell their goods abroad. The British Council mustact as a free-lance merchant pushing our teachers overseas with no security ofsupply and quite inadequate resources.4. Proposals to improve this situation must start from a recognition thatto teach English to foreigners requires special training. This training can be givenin this country to British and foreign students, or in colleges overseas staffed atany rate at first by British teachers, e.g., Allahabad. Having offered training inthe United Kingdom it is then necessary to make service overseas as widelyattractive as possible. Apart from salaries and reinstatement it must be worthconsideration how to link up English teaching in the Commonwealth, the colonies and foreign countries in order to improve the prospects of promotion and to afford the widest opportunities for sharing experience both while training and in the field.5. The following are lines of action which need to be drawn into a singlepolicy. The references to Ministers and others are to those who are, or who should be, responsible:  (a) Teacher-training in the United Kingdom.

It is essential to remove from all aspects of this work the suspicion thatour real intention is propaganda for the British way of life. The foreigner, likethe Welsh at home, prefers his own culture; what he wants from us is straighteducation with a practical end in view. Here the British Council, and still more the United States Foreign Information Agency, are handicapped. Education isnot information.. 7. Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Schools have been looking at what is being done in the same field by Commonwealth nations and the United States. Researchis going on, and we are in touch with it. But in practical teaching we can buildon what the British Council has done under such difficulties and very soon be far ahead of anyone else. Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors suggest that the best way to getthe Americans and the Commonwealth to join us in this work would be to tell them what we intend to do, to do it, and to let them see the results, hoping to encourage them to help us.8. This paper is very much of a first thought on a large problem which theMinisters concerned may think needs further consideration.&apos;    : ; D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1.15th November, 1955.
