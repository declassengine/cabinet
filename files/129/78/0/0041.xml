(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P,(55) 191 COPY NO.5th December, 1955CABINETPALESTINIANS IN THE CANAL ZONEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs there are some 700 Palestinian employees (plus their dependants)who have served with the British forces in the Canal Zone for varying periodsand who lack the necessary documents for continued residence in Egypt.    as our forces leave the Canal Zone they are being discharged.    The egyptian government regard them as being illegally present in Egypt, but are preparedto allow any who can be employed elsewhere to leave without hindrance.     the egyptians intend to deport the remainder to the refugee camps in the GazaStrip.2.        Various proposals for finding employment for these Palestinianshave been examined but, although seven have been taken on by the Arab Legionand a small number who were &quot;compromised&quot; and whose lives might havebeen in danger, if they had been allowed to fall into the hands of the egyptians, have been accepted by Cyprus, it has not so far been possible toarrange anything for the majority.     The Government of Cyprus have beenasked whether they could agree to take more than they have already done andtheir final reply is still awaited.     Officials of the Foreign Office, HomeOffice and Ministry of Labour have also discussed whether 114 of them, whohave more than four years&apos; service, could be brought to the United Kingdom.It appears, however, that most of them do not want to come to this country,3. These Palestinians are in the first instance the responsibility of theWar Office who do not consider that they are under any obligation to do morethan to pay them gratuities.     But to abandon these men who have givenBritain long and loyal service, sometimes in difficult conditions,  to themiseries of a refugee camp, will prejudice our reputation in the Arab world.It may also lead to criticism by other United Nations countries on the groundthat we are aggravating the refugee problem at a time when we are stressingin the Assembly the importance of providing the existing refugees with work.4.        The problem is becoming very urgent, since the period is nowapproaching when dismissals will attain their maximum frequency.    I think we should therefore take a very early decision on this matter.    In my view the only practicable solution is that all those who have more than four years&apos;service and are willing to sign on again, and as many as possible of theremainder who have less than four years&apos; service, should be re-engaged bythe Service Departments for service in Cyprus, and eventually elsewhere inthe Middle East if that is practicable.    I recommend that my colleagues should endorse this view.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd December, 1955.
