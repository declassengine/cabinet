(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government secret. (55) 178 COPY NO.     ,//J19th November, 1955CABINETANTARCTICAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in July the Cabinet approved the five-year plan in C. P. (55) 79 forthe expansion of our activities in the Antarctic (C. M. (55) 25th Conclusions,Minute 7).2.      A further decision is now required on our attitude towardsArgentina and Chile in the Antarctic since we have failed to persuade themto accept arbitration over their claim.    Public interest in the Antarcticis increasing, the southern winter is ending and a new season of activityis ahead of us.    We are already being asked in Parliament what we intend to do about these trespassers.3.     The dispute with Argentina and Chile can no longer be treated in isolation.    The International Geophysical Year has brought both theUnited States and Russia into the Antarctic in a large way, and that means that we must look at our problems there in rather a different light.4.      It seems clear that wc shall lose more than we gain by trying toevict the trespassers by force.    H. M. Ambassadors at Buenos Aires andSantiago consider that we could not do so without provoking a major upsetin our relations with Argendna and Chile with a risk of serious retaliationfrom the Argentine navy.    H. M. Ambassador at Washington considers thatthe use of force would provoke a hostile reaction in the United States.The Chiefs of Staff are also strongly opposed to it.     They say that weshould need to divert ships from other stations in order to protect ourbases from reprisals and that this would not be justified by any strategic considerations.5.     I have considered an appeal to the Security Council as a possible alternative.    But we cannot count on American support over such an issue,and there is little chance of obtaining any acceptable resolution in theCouncil without it.6.     My conclusion is mat we must accept the fact that Argentina andChile have come to stay in the Antarctic and do our best to limit theirencroachments in our sector until the time is ripe for the whole inter-national position in the Antarctic to be considered afresh by the powers concerned.    This means that we push ahead with our programme of expansion, and continue to serve protests on the Argentines and Chileansif they set up new bases, but take no further action against them unless they establish themselves within close range of our own bases or are otherwise deliberately provocative, or interfere with our activities.    At
(3Uthe same time we would be ready to respond to any indication that the new regime in Argentina was disposed to negotiate a settlement.    (There hasbeen none so far, but the new men need our goodwill and may become less stubborn if they survive their internal difficulties.)7.      It is true that such a policy may cause us difficulties in Parliament,but it presents the only chance of holding our position in the Antarcticwithout a disproportionate diversion of effort from more importantobjectives.    It is also a policy which we can sell to the Americans andthat is an important point,    With Russia now coming into the picture, itis time for us to get together with the Americans and try to draw them out and concert future plans.    The Australian and New Zealand Govern-ments would also welcome-co-operation between the Commonwealth andthe United States in Antarctica.8.      Meanwhile I have arranged as in past years for the renewal of the tripartite Naval Declarations with Argentina and Chile which preserve the naval status quo in the Antarctic and give us local superiority overArgentina..9.      I propose therefore -that we should proceed on the lines described in paragraph 6;that we should inform the United States Govern-ment of our intentions, seek their co-operation and try to obtain a better understanding from them of our ownAntarctic policy;that we should do this in close accord with australia and New Zealand.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.18th November, 1955.(a)(b)(c)
