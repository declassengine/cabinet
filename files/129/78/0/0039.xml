THE SCHOOL MEALS service memorandum by the Minister of EducationCOPY no cabinet the school meals service is a subsidised service.     The 9d, charge is roughly equal to the cost of the food;  it covers less than half the totalcost of a school dinner.    The Exchequer bears almost the whole of thenett cost of the service - estimated at over  30 millions in the current financial year.    If we can reasonably reduce this burden on the Exchequer,we ought to do so.2.      The school meals service has long been accepted as playing animportant part in the national policy for the health and well-being ofchildren and as closely linked with the family allowance (see the Appendix).Children who have to travel long distances to school, those whose mothersgo out to work and many others get a far better meal at school than theywould otherwise.    There can be no doubt that the school meal has been an important factor in the improvement in childrenls health and physiqueover the last 10 years.    It also provides a particularly good opportunityfor teaching good manners and forming sound dietetic habits.    I am a firmbeliever in the school meal and it is certainly popular.3.    How then can the cost to the Exchequer be reduced?    We cannotsecure any substantial saving within the existing framework without areduction in standards.     The costs of the service in each area are alreadyscrutinised closely and pruned as necessary,4,      The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked me to consider an immediate increase of 3d. in the charge made to parents.     This might bring a saving of between  24 millions and  3-1 millions a year.    (There would inevitably be some reduction in the number of children taking dinners and an increasein the number for whom the meal would be provided free).5.      I told the Chancellor that I could not agree to his proposal without consulting my colleagues about possible repercussions on family allowances,wages, etc. and that I could not myself recommend any increase in thecharge (other than one justified by a rise in food costs) until we had re-considered the whole policy underlying the school meals service.    Animmediate increase of 3d, would involve a new departure in policy;  forthe first time the charge would exceed the cost of the food.6.     If we are to consider a fundamentally new policy, as I think weshould, we need to examine the principle of indiscriminate subsidy involvedin the present arrangements and to ask whether the link between the schoolmeal and the family allowance should not be broken.    If it were agreed thatthe Exchequer subsidy should go only to those who need it, we should haveto renounce the intention of ultimately providing free meals for all childrenSECRETC.P. (55) 1895th rjecember, 1955
and ask parents who can afford it to pay the full cost of the meal (at present about l/9d.).7.      This would obviously bring a much greater saving for the Exchequerthan raising the present charge to l/-, even though it would have to be accompanied by a generous scale for reducing the charge to avoid hardship.It might, or might not, arouse more public criticism but it would pii thesystem on a sound basis of principle;  an increase in the charge would mean a break with the policy of the last 10 years, but would still leave theimportant questions unsolved.8.     I already have in hand, as a first step to thinking out a new policy,an inquiry designed to find out who takes school dinners, and why, in anumber of sample areas;  the preliminary findings should be available bythe end of the year, the complete results by the middle of March.9.      I think it would be a good thing if the Ministers more directly concerned were to consider the possibility of adopting a new policy and, inparticular, of divorcing the school meal from the family allowance.D.E.Ministry of Education, W,l,3rd December, 1955,APPENDIX1.    In 1944, following the war-time expansion of the service, the coalition Government decided to make school dinners and school milkfree as a supplement to the proposed family allowance;  this was held tojustify fixing the allowance at 5/- instead of the 8/- recommended in the beveridge Report.2.     In 1946, the Government of the day announced that school milkwould become free when cash family allowances began and that schooldinners would be made free as soon as possible.    They implied that this could not be done till pretty well all children had the opportunity of havingdinner at school if their parents wished them to do so;  that for the timebeing payments by parents must continue but would not exceed the cost ofthe food supplied.    Even in these conditions the school dinners would &quot;forma substantial contribution to the national policy for assistance to families1&apos;,and therefore the whole reasonable cost of the service, though administered by local education authorities, wouldin future be met by the Exchequer.Up till then the cost had been shared by local authorities and the exchequer as part of the whole education service.3.    Local authorities continued to expand facilities on the basis that, on average, some 75 per cent of a school&apos;s pupils might be expected to takethe school dinner when it was made free;  and by October, 1949* 52.7 percent of school children were taking the school dinner, compared with about35 per cent in 1944.    But the financial crisis of 1949 brought to an end theexpansion of the service at existing schools.    Although the policy of freeschool meals has never been disclaimed, it has been accepted for someyears now that it will not be implemented within the foreseeable future.Since 1949, also, there have been three increases in the charge to parents
on account of rises in food costs (increase from 5d. to 6d. in 1950, to7d. in 1951 and to 9d. in 1953), and the percentage of children talcingthe school dinner has not again reached the peak figure of that year.4.      Tb-dayimid-day meals are available to the children attending allbut 700 of the 30, 000 maintained schools in England and Wales and theyare taken by about 46 per cent of the children - by about 42 per cent on payment and 4 per cent free of charge.    Arrangements for the remission of the charge of 9d. in cases of hardship are made by the local educationauthorities, who draw up their own income scales.
