THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1955SECRETCP. (55) 170 Copy No. g  3rd November, 1955CABINETDEFENCE TALKS WITH SOUTH africa memorandum by Minister of DefenceMy colleagues may like to have a short report on discussions with Mr. Erasmus,the South African Minister of Defence, during his further visit to London on24th-26th October.2. The Lord Privy Seal, the First Lord of the Admiralty and theParliamentary Under-Secretary for Commonwealth Relations took part with mein the talks, which mainly concerned details arising from the agreements negotiatedin June (Command 9520) and action following on these agreements. The main points covered were as follows.(1) The South African Naval ProgrammeWe took Mr. Erasmus to task about the deletion from this eight-year programme of two frigates. The undertaking by South Africa to place orders fora number of new ships, including six frigates, had been part of the bargain published in the June White Paper and a considerable justification in our eyes for transferringSimonstown to them. Mr. Erasmus explained that he was limited to expenditureof  18 millions on the programme. Rising costs and the need to allow for adequatestores and spares made it impossible at present for him to order all the ships. Buthe agreed to reconsider this in a year or two, when it was seen how costs were working out.(2) Extension of Naval Agreement to Include Other countries the agreement concerning defence of the sea routes round southern africa and the command arrangements contained provision for other countries to accede.Mr. Erasmus was anxious to extend invitations to France, Portugal and Belgium.We persuaded him that it would be wise for the two founder-members first to settlebetween themselves the broad shape of the organisation. On this understandingwe agreed that the Joint Maritime Planning Committee should meet as quickly as possible and tackle an agenda, which we agreed. It was decided that, provided the work of the Committee revealed a satisfactory identity of view, we should aim at the issue of joint invitations in January. If the other countries wereagreeable, a conference between Governments might follow in Capetown.(3) African Defence Facilities ConferenceMr. Erasmus appeared to be in no hurry for the conference referred to inthe Memorandum printed in Section I of Command 9520. It was agreed that information should be exchanged with a view to the possibility that the conference should be held some time in the late summer of 1956. London was mentionedas the possible venue.(4) Staff TalksStaff talks were agreed upon in an exchange of secret letters in June.Mr. Erasmus expressed a fear that the precise agenda proposed by us for the talks implied the commitment of South African forces to the Middle East.  We49017
told him that there was no intention of using the talks to manoeuvre South Africainto a position she did not want to be in. But we were most anxious that the talks should take place and that there should be frank discussion without commit-ment. Mr. Erasmus finally agreed that informal talks, without any set agenda,should begin in London with the South African service liaison staff which hasbeen strengthened for the purpose.(&apos; *\ (5) Radar Early Warning SystemSouth Africa is establishing an elaborate radar warning system. The followingpoints arose:  (a) We agreed on the terms of an announcement, confirming the Common-wealth Secretary&apos;s undertaking in June that there should be joint survey of sites to be used by the Union (in the event of war) in Bechuanalandand Swaziland, and also in Basutoland if no suitable sites could befound outside that territory.(b) Mr. Erasmus said he wanted to approach us and other countries to thenorth about expansion of the radar warning system and a link-up with the Union system.  We said we would consider this.(c) I asked him not to ignore British industry in his purchases of radarequipment. He said he was going to America to see what they hadto offer; price would be the governing factor.3. The discussions were friendly and Mr. Erasmus appeared well satisfied.I think that he genuinely tried to meet our wishes. For our part we felt therewas advantage in being as helpful to him as possible. The fields in which wecan be co-operative with South Africa are limited and it may help over moredifficult issues, e.g., the future relationship of the Gold Coast with theCommonwealth, if we accumulate what goodwill we can over less controversialsubjects now.S. L.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1955.
