(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 209 COPY NO.19th December, 1955CABINETLEGISLATION ON RESTRICTIVE PRACTICESMemorandum by the Lord chancellor in accordance with the conclusion of the Cabinet at their meeting on 14th 3December (C0Mo(55) 46th Conclusions, Minute 5), theCommittee of Ministers under my chairmanship, with the assistance ofthe Minister of Labour, have considered further how the justiciable issue(that is, the criteria by which restrictive practices should be judged by whatever tribunal is established) should be defined.We are now all agreed that the definition should be on the linesof that contained in the Annex to this paper.    We shall try to improveverbally on this definition (particularly in relation to the passages in square brackets in the Annex), but we recommend it in principle to theCabinet as being sufficiently precise, while at the same time givingindustry an opportunity of putting forward in defence of a restrictive .practice any of the arguments which they could publicly advance tosupport it.If the Cabinet accept this definition, in order that thepreparation of legislation on restrictive practices can go forv/ard, afinal decision is also required on the form of tribunal which would havejurisdiction to examine restrictive practices,    The definition in the-Annex would be satisfactory if the choice were to be an independentjudicial tribunal, on the lines of that described in Annex III of C.P.(55) 196,This is the choice which the majority of the Committee favour, but towhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer sees objection on the grounds thatthe Government ought not to relinquish the responsibility for taking decisions in restrictive practices cases.K.House of Lords, S0Wol.19th December, 1955.
