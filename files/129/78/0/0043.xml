(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret .P. (.55) 193.6thDeoember. 1955ROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALS bill memorandum &quot;by the Lord chancellor at their meeting on 1st December (C.M.(55) hkth Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet invited a Committee of Ministers under my chairmanship to consider what steps should &quot;be taken to allay the anxiety which had developed over the Government!s decision thatthe forthcoming Road Haulage Disposals Bill would contain a pro-vision to permit the British Transport Commission to retain the,750 vehicles needed for the trunk road services,,2.     The misgivings to which the Government&apos;s proposals havegiven rise come mainly from two sources.    First, in the field of road transport Itself, the Road Haulage Association (R.H.A.) areexercised over the decision to preserve the trunk road service as a transport entity, for they feel that the small operatorwill Toe unable to compete with such a large and powerful opponentSecond, among Government supporters generally there is a wide-spread feeling of disappointment that the Government have failed to achieve the complete denationalisation of road transport and it is felt that the decision to retain such a large transportentity under the control of the State is contrary to theprinciples of the Conservative Party.3* We have considered what substance there might be in these views and whether it would &quot;be possible and justifiable to makeany modifications in the Governments proposals with regard tothe trunk services which would make these proposals more acceptable in those quarters which had expressed anxiety about them,ko     We have examined three possible modifications which might bemade in the Government&apos;s proposals(i)   The possibility of again testing the desire of thetransport industry to take over the Road Services &quot;by putting the vehicles and equipment of these servicesonce more up for sale,,    When this equipment was offered for sale in the spring (on the basis ofList S.Lf.) only about 500 vehicles were sold out of atotal of approximately 6,000, and it could be argued that this unsatisfactory result was attributable, atleast in part, to the atmosphere of uncertainty in aperiod of a General Election.    Nevertheless, we do notthink it would help to repeat the offer for sale.There was no pressure for the offer to be repeatedimmediately the Government returned to power.    More-over, the members of the R,H.A. are concerned not somuch to acquire the equipment and property of the trunk road services as to secure the effective dismantlementof this large and powerful transport entity in a manner which would leave the field open for thesmaller operator.    The Cabinet will recall that,precisely in order to avoid the fragmentation of apublic service which had grown to &quot;be important, itwas decided that the equipment of the undertaking shouK,&quot;be put up for sale in medium sized units.    When itCOPY NO. &amp;?QCABINET
proved impossible to sell the equipment under theseconditions the Cabinet decided that the trunk road services should be preserved as a transport entity.This view had the support of the Federation ofBritish Industries and the Association of BritishChambers of Commerce, who were anxious that theservices should be preserved intact.    We do nottnink it would be justifiable,  either on economic oron political grounds, to arrange now for the disposalof the equipment of the trunk services in such smallunits as would ensure the effective dismantlement ofthe entity.    To this extent there is nothing we can do to satisfy the real preferences of the R.H.A.We considered also whether, short of puttingList Sok up for sale again in its entirety, thoseoperators who might now be prepared to acquire some part of this equipment in medium sized units shouldbe given a further opportunity to do so.   We see no special advantage in this course, which might require legislation&apos;and which, if conducted as a semi-privatenegotiation, might be difficult to handle.    Moreover,sales of road transport vehicles and equipment arestill going on and for those operators who wish toobtain surplus vehicles, including heavy lorries,supplies are still available.(ii)   We considered the possibility of transforming the trunk road services into a public company which would beseparate from the British Transport Commission andin which the private investor would &quot;be able toparticipate0    While nothing in this would meet the aims of the R.H.A. it might, at first glance, help to satisfy the doctrinal critics.    But the trunk road services would have to be capitalised at a figure in the region of  25 millions and whether all its shares were made available to the public, or only about half of them (leaving control with theCommission with 51 per cent of shares, or withdrawingit by selling 51 per cent or more of shares, as might be decided) a prolonged and difficult marketingoperation would be involved.    While it is thoughtthat the Opposition may find little to object to inthe Road Haulage Disposals Bill as at presentdrafted, any proposal on these lines wouldprecipitate violent controversy in which the determination to renationalise road transport would almost certainly be expressed.    The marketing ofthe company&apos;s shares, a formidable operation initself, would therefore take place under threat of early renationalisation.    Moreover, the formationand disposal of a Company would give rise to serious problems of management and re-equipment during a prolonged interim period, and, by involving thepayment of increased compensation to the Commission,make it impossible to terminate the transport levyat the end of 1956 as has been decided.    We aresatisfied that, on all counts this proposal shouldnot be pursued.
(iii)    There remains the possibility of imposing, in a manner which would help to protect&quot; the smalloperator for a certain period against the competitive power of the large State undertaking,  somelimitation on the licences which the commission would be allowed to hold.    It would not be practicable to require the Commission to justifyde novo before the Licensing Authorities the numberof vehicles for which licences are needed out of the,750 they will be allowed to retain.   This wouldsimply swamp the licensing machinery.   I\Tor would itserve any useful purpose, or specially impresscritics, if the Commission were required to justifybefore the Licensing Authorities the need for licences for, say, the last 1,000 vehicles to beretained.   In either event the Commission wouldprobably be able to satisfy the Licensing authorities that licences were needed to operate the entirefleet retained.But a case could be established on two grounds for restricting the Commission from obtaining for aperiod any additional licences enabling them to expand their business: the Commission have theresources to present before the Licensing Authoritiestheir case for any such licences much more powerfullythan the private haulier; and, through orders alreadyplaced, they have obtained much more of a grip on the delivery of new heavy lorries.   These two advantagesplace the Commission in a powerful position fromwhich it would be reasonable to give the small ormedium private haulier protection.   This protectionmight reasonably be given for the period of fiveyears, during which the private haulier would have anopportunity of establishing himself, and it would bejustified on the grounds that since the special &apos;A&apos;licences given to the Commission in respect ofretained vehicles have a five year life, it would belogical, having protected the Commission againstloss of licences during that period, to prevent them also from gaining any.   The limitation would have toapply to the whole of the Commission&apos;s road haulageenterprise and would need to be provided for in theforthcoming Bill.conclusion.     We are agreed that the proposal summarised inparagraph U(iii) above - a restriction to be imposed on additional licences - has merit, and that it might well beadopted,.   But this relatively minor modification, while it will no doubt be welcomed by the private road haulier, does not initself go far enough to satisfy either the R.H.A. or thedoctrinal critics.   We see no way in which it would be practicable or justifiable to effect any major recasting or modification of the decision in regard to the trunk servicevehicles that has already been taken.   It will be necessarytherefore to convince Government supporters that, apart fromthe slight modification which has been referred to, there wasno alternative method of dealing with the problem with whichthe Government were faced.    The fact stands out that the transpo.industry showed no inclination to take over the assets of the trunk road services when they were offered in a manner designedto prevent the complete fragmentation of this service and, in
deciding that the service should be preserved as an entity,the Government may be assured of support from the bodiesrepresenting the using industries.   As the facts of thesituation may be imperfectly known to Government supporters,the Minister of Transport has prepared a memorandum^orcirculation to them and, in order to make it clear that thedecisions regarding the trunk services have been taken with theapproval of the Cabinet, it has been agreed that I shallaccompany the Minister of Transport to the meeting which hasbeen arranged for 8th December.*KoHouse of Lords, S.W.1.5th December, 1955.
