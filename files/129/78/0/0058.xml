Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1955SECRET Copy No. 56CP. (55) 20819th December, 1955CABINETSUBMISSION OF BUSINESS TO CABINETNote by the Prime minister on certain occasions recently a decision taken without reference to the cabinet or a Cabinet Committee has had to be reconsidered soon after it has been made public because of the weight of criticism which it has provoked. This is damaging to the Government^ credit, and we must do all we can to avoid it. I hope,therefore, that Departmental Ministers will remember that, while the reaction to any particular decision cannot always be forecast with certainty, this is a matter in which they can often be helped by the collective wisdom of their colleagues.2. Apart from the major issues of policy, Departmental Ministers shouldnot hesitate to bring to the Cabinet, or to the appropriate Cabinet Committee,any questions which are likely to occasion public controversy or criticism or may need to be carefully explained to the Government^ supporters in Parliament.3. If a Minister is in doubt about this, he can always seek my view or thatof the Chairman of the appropriate Cabinet Committee preferably by sending a minute in a form in which it could be circulated to other Ministers.A. E.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,16th December, 1955.
