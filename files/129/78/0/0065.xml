(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(55) 215 COPY NO.    DO31st December, 1955CABINET20 M.P.Ha SPEED LIMITMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil AviationMy predecessor obtained Cabinet approval to announce an increasein the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles from 20 to 30 miles per hour(C.M. (55) 47th Conclusions, Minute 6).2. Since then Mr. Jock Tiffin, the General Secretary of the transport and General Workers Union, has died and his probable successor,Mr. Arthur Cousins, is the man whom I would have to ask to support me in what will be, inevitably, a very difficult decision from his point of view,3, As he will now be actively campaigning for the general secretary-ship of the Union it is, I am sure, asking too much of him at this stage tosupport this change. To do so might well result in his leading his Unioninto active opposition against it as a means of swinging them behind him.4. I have mentioned this to the Prime Minister and he has agreedthat this announcement should be deferred until Mr, Cousins or some othernew general secretary is appointed.H.W..!ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W.1,30th December, 1955.
