COPY NO. (53CABINETHEROINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet authorised me to maintain the decision not to renewlicences for the manufacture of heroin after the end of this year and, in announcing this, to make it clear that we would keep its working under constant review in the light of experience gained (C.Mi (55) 44thConclusions, Minute 4).2.        Lord Jowitt told the Lord Chancellor that, in the course of the speech he intended to make on 13th December, he was going to raise thequestion of the vires of our action in prohibiting the manufacture, import and export of heroin after the end of this year.3.        This issue was considered by a meeting of Ministers over whichthe Lord Chancellor presided on 12th December, when the Law Officersadvised that Section 9 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951, for the purposeof preventing the improper use of the drug, confers a power to provideby Regulations for controlling, as opposed to totally prohibiting, themanufacture, etc. of the drug.4,        In the light of that opinion, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster made a statement in the House of Lords and I made a similar statement in the House of Commons indicating that the Government would seriously consider the legal issue which Lord Jowitt had raised and,while the matter was under examination, the renewal of licences to manufacture would not be refused.5.        The Law Officers are satisfied that the Secretary of State has power under Section 8 of the Dangerous Drugs Act to refuse licences to import and export.6.        The question now arises:   &quot;What happens to the ban if the HomeSecretary&apos;s powers are not fully adequate to enforce it?&quot;  The NarcoticsCommission of the United Nations have already been informed of theintention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to prohibit the manufacture,import and export of heroin as from the end of this year.     The UnitedKingdom has played a leading part in the campaign against the illicittraffic, and I am sure that I may expect to be questioned in the House asto what we now propose to do.    It would, I feel sure, be wrong to throwSECRETCP. (55) 20616th December, 1955
ZtfSoverboard the advice we have received that heroin is not indispensablein medicine, or to withdraw from the position that we co-operate to thefull in all international measures to combat the illicit drug traffic.    Ishould be glad to have the agreement of my colleagues to saying at theappropriate moment (e.g. either in the White Paper or during a debate on the White Paper) that we have no intention of withdrawing from theposition we have taken and that, if it should be found that furtherlegislative authority was required to enable Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto put their policy into effect, we shall certainly consider seeking it from Parliament.G. LL. -G.Home Office, S.W.I.16th December, 1955.
