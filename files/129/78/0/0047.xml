ANNEX AStatements by Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev in India and Burma, and united Kingdom Official CommentsNote. There are no authoritative texts of these statements. British and soviet versions of each statement have therefore been included. In caseswhere these differ substantially * Indian or Burmese versions have alsobeen included.1. Speech by Mr. Bulganin to the Indian Parliament on 21st November at DelhiBritish VersionReuter&apos;s report as quoted in the Manchester Guardian, 22nd November.&quot; The Soviet Union repudiated war as a way of settling international problems.She was against military blocs and attempts to interfere in other countries&apos; affairs;she stood for peaceful negotiations and the right of each country to develop as its people wished. ... As to the German problem, a settlement was primarily one for the Germans themselves; the task of the Great Powers was &apos; to help them tocarry out unification of Germany along the: road to peaceful and democraticdevelopment&apos;.&quot;Soviet VersionPublished in Soviet News in London on 24th November:  &quot; The foreign policy of the Soviet Union is a policy of peace and friendshipbetween peoples, a policy of active and constant struggle for peace, against warand against any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other countries(Applause). Following behests of our great teacher Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, webuild our policy on the principles of respect for all nations on the basis of all peopleshaving the right to independent national development, in accordance with, theirown desires and interests. ... In our opinion the solution of the German problem is, above all, the concern of the German people themselves, and it is the task of theGreat Powers to help them effect the unification of Germany along the road topeaceful and democratic development.&quot;United Kingdom comment on 22nd November the Foreign Office spokesman commented:  &quot; Mr. Bulganin said that Soviet policy was based on non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. He also said that the solution of. the German problem would be quite easy if the matter was left to theGermans themselves. The fact that there is a disunited Germany to-day is exclusively due to Soviet interference in the affairs of Germany, without which the East German regime would not have been set up nor continueto exist to-day. If Mr. Bulganin were sincere in believing that the problemof German reunification could be solved by leaving the settlement to theGerman people themselves, then we would be in entire agreement withhim. What Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept is that a body ofmen in Pankow^ with no mandate from the people of Eastern Germany,should be allowed to veto the reunification of Germany. soviet propaganda has sought to represent that the obstacle to Germanreunification is the adherence of the Federal Republic to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation and Western European Union; but mr. Molotov has made it plain that, in the Soviet view, Germanreunification can only be achieved provided that what Mr. Macmillancalled the &apos; odious system&apos; in Eastern Germany was maintained and provided that an all-German Government was peace-loving; as is wellknown, the Soviet Government only considers Communist regimes to be fully entitled to be regarded as peace loving.&quot;In reply to a.supplementary question the spokesman said, withreference to German reunification, that the point of view of Mr. Bulganinseemed thoroughly hypocritical.49214
Soviet ReactionThe Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires called on the Permanent Under-Secretary on 29th November, and left a note with him, of which thefollowing is the text:&quot; According to the British press, on the 22nd of November, aspokesman of the British Foreign Office made a statement on behalf ofthe British Government in connection with the speech made byN. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, at ajoint session of the two Houses of the Indian Parliament.&quot; I have been instructed to draw the attention of the Foreign Office ofGreat Britain to the fact that in the said statement the spokesman of theForeign Office used expressions which are inconsistent with the nature of relations existing between our two countries.&quot;2. Speech by Mr. Khrushchev on 24th November at BombayBritish VersionReuter&apos;s report: datelined Bombay 24th November:  &quot; The English came to our country, the French landed in Odessa, the americans followed the English example, and the Japanese followed suit. what happened everybody knows. All these troops were thrown out of our countryin the same way as a housewife throws out garbage from the house. But (he said)this was not enough. All these gentlemen-they started the Second World War,they sent new troops against our country and these troops were the tribes ofHitlerite Germany.&quot;Soviet VersionPublished in Soviet News in London on 29th November:  &quot; And they not only said it, but hurled their forces against the young SovietState. The French invaders landed at Odessa, the British at Archangel, the americans at Vladivostok; the Japanese soon followed them there.&quot; What came of it is well known. The invaders were swept out by the Sovietpeople as a good housewife sweeps out her house. But this was not enough forsome of the gentry. They wanted to stage a comeback and organised the second world War. They hurled against the USSR the huge armed forces of HitlerGermany.&quot;Indian VersionAgency report published in Indian newspapers on 26th November:  &quot; For instance, the English came to our country, the French landed in Odessa,the Americans followed the English example and the Japanese followed suit.&quot; What happened everybody knows. All these troops were thrown out ofour country the same way as a housewife throws out garbage from the house.&quot; But this was not enough for these gentlemen. They started World War Two.They sent new troops against our country. And these troops were the troops ofHitlerite Germany.  They invaded our country.&quot;Further Indian version carried in the Times of India on 1st December;datelined Calcutta, 30th November:  &quot; They not only said so but threw their armies against the young Soviet State.French interventionists landed at Odessa, the English at Archangel, the Americansat Vladivostok and the Japanese followed them. What came out of this? It iswell known to everyone. The invading forces were swept out by the Soviet people as a good housewife sweeps the rubbish out of her house.&quot; But this was enough for some States. They wanted to repeat this and organised the Second World War. They threw against the USSR the enormousarmed forces Of Hitlerite Germany.&quot;
The Times of India report added the following explanation:  &quot; The Aides (Lei, the Soviet leaders&apos; aides) explained that what Mr. Khrushchevmeant was that the Western Powers had for several years pampered Hitler in thehope that he would attack Russia. Their plans misfired temporarily when Hitlerattacked Britain and France instead.&quot;&apos; It was like a foolish son turning upon a foolish mother who had spoiledhim during infancy&apos; a Russian spokesman commented, quoting Lloyd Georgewith approval.&quot; The plans of Western Powers finally matured, it is claimed, when Hitlerattacked the Soviet Union.&quot;United Kingdom comment on 25th November the Foreign Office spokesman commented,&quot; British and. world opinion will be able to form its own judgment ofMr. Khrushchev&apos;s remark.&quot;On 29th November when the Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires called to read the Soviet Government^ statement about the Foreign Office spokesman&apos;suse of the word &quot; hypocritical,&quot; the Permanent Under-Secretary at theForeign Office said that he wished to take the occasion to make a littlestatement himself. He said that, according to the press, Mr. Khrushchev,speaking in India, had made a statement accusing a British Government,of which the present Prime Minister was a leading member, of havinglaunched the German attack on Russia. The Soviet Charge d&apos;Affairesreplied that he would communicate this statement to the SovietGovernment.3. Speech by Mr. Khrushchev on 2nd December at the Shwe Dagon Pagodain RangoonBritish VersionDaily Telegraph, December 3:  &quot; In the course of a conversation which ensued with U Ohn, the BurmeseAmbassador to Moscow, Mr. Khrushchev commented favourably on thearchitecture of the Shwe Dagon. He then observed &apos; England did not exist as a country before William the Conqueror. The Burmese temples are 2,000 years old.   They have nothing more than 1,000 years old, yet the English call yousavages and barbarians.....   We Russians are the only ones who are alwaysfighting against colonialism.&apos;&quot;Soviet VersionDespatch to Pravda by its deputy editor, Zhukov, from Rangoon, datelined3rd December:  &quot; Pointing to the majestic spire of the Pagoda sparkling in gold, one of the burmese diplomats says: &apos; When we were struggling for our independence weoften said When William the Conqueror landed on the coast of England, ourPagoda was already here. England did not exist as a nation, while our people were highly civilised. This memory inspired our people to struggle.&apos; &apos; Quiteright,&apos; Khrushchev noted, &apos; the heritage of one&apos;s ancestors must be honoured.&apos;&quot;&apos; The Shwe Dagon&apos; the Burmese diplomat continued, &apos; expresses not onlythe culture of Burma, but also the culture of South-East Asia, including that ofIndia. When India was a great State, England as a State did not exist. To-dayIndia is becoming again a great Power.&apos;&quot; &apos; Such is the course of history,&apos; Khrushchev said. &apos; Now we are changinghistory,&apos; remarked one of the Burmese. &apos; Quite, history changes,&apos; said Khrushchev.&apos; It is a difficult and all-embracing process. First, a people fight for their freedomand independence with arms in hand. Then, when freedom and independencehave already been won, the form of struggle changes. The people have to develop their economy and culture, and at the same time they must be ready to defendtheir independence.   I think that the Burmese people, taught by the bitter
experience of their history, will be able to defend themselves. Experience willtell them who are new friends and enemies. I am not going to explain this. Ihave already been accused of engaging in propaganda.&apos; &apos; We have learned to tellpropaganda from real facts,&apos; the Burmese diplomat noted. &apos; When Soviet peopletell the truth,&apos; Khrushchev continued, &apos; someone says it is propaganda. some people would like us to say that colonisers are good people; how much good theyhave done for all those they have oppressed. This would certainly please thecoloniser.&apos;&quot;Note. Rude Pravo, central organ of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia,did not follow the Soviet version, but carried on 4th December a despatch from their special correspondent at Rangoon which was substantially thesame as the British version.Burmese VersionThe Nation (Rangoon English language daily) 3rd December:  &quot; By now Mr. Khrushchev was nicely launched on his tirade. From architectural-tecture he went on to colonialism. He received his cue from Ambassador U Ohnwho told him the Shwe Dagon was 2,000 years old. &apos; Fancy,&apos; Mr. Khrushchevsaid,&apos; the English did not exist as a race up to the time of William the Conqueror.Yet they consider you to be savages and barbarians. We do not believe in the exploitation of common peoples as the colonialists do.&apos; Mr. Khrushchev wenton &apos; but when the Soviet speak the truth it is termed propaganda. I suppose some people, would like us to say what splendid people colonialists are.&apos;&quot; U Ohn agreed and said there was much common ground between theRussians and the Burmese. He remarked that the Burmese knew what colonialismwas because they had experienced it. &apos; We are fighting to free other people still under the yoke of colonialism,&apos; he stated.&quot;United Kingdom comment the Foreign Office spokesman on 2nd December commented, asregards Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s historical references &quot; on this history can speakfor itself,&quot; adding &quot; It is of course ludicrous to say we call the Burmesesavages.&quot; He then quoted part of a speech made by Sir John Kotelawalaat the Bandung Conference; when he spoke of the Soviet Satellite Statesand asked whether they were not colonies as much as any of the colonial territories in Africa or Asia.Soviet ReactionThe Soviet press and radio, including Pravda, have subsequentlycriticised the Foreign Office spokesman for making the comment&quot; ludicrous &quot; on the basis of an inaccurate report. They have furthercriticised the British and other Western correspondents for the inventionof every kind of fantasy and untruth. Pravda alleges that they areirritated and indignant at the fact that the Soviet leaders advocate theestablishment of completely new relations between States, based onco-operation between peoples.4. Speech by Mr. Khrushchev on 3rd December at Taunggyi in the Shan StatesBritish VersionDaily Telegraph; 5th December:  &quot; They did not like what I said here on Friday and they are not going to likewhat I am going to say to-night. Why are they not satisfied with my speech? Itis because I am going to say that the English were sitting here on your necks andwere robbing your people. This was not done to raise the standards of civilisationof your people. They say they were sitting in their colonies bringing theircivilisation to the backward countries. But we say differently. We say they weresitting in their colonies to rob the people of their last piece of bread, people whowere toiling to get it. That is.what they do not like. The truth is against them.&quot;
Soviet VersionPublished in Soviet News in London on 6th December:  &quot; Certain bourgeois papers have a grudge against me for my statements inIndia and Burma. But I am not speaking here in order to please them. Why arethey dissatisfied? Because I cannot speak with approval about the colonialists.For many decades the foreign colonialists oppressed you and robbed your country.They say that this was done to civilise the Burmese people. We say, however: thecolonialists stayed in your country in order to rob your people, to take the last piece of bread away from them. This is why the papers of certain countries dislike suchstatements. The truth hurts.&quot;Burmese VersionThe Nation (Rangoon English-language daily), 4th December:  &quot; There are some correspondents here who are not quite satisfied with what Ihad to say yesterday. (He was obviously referring to his outburst at the ShweDagon Pagoda.) Why are they not satisfied? Because I am going to say that theEnglish were sitting here on your necks and were robbing your people, and because it was done not for your benefit or raising your standard of living, but in order tobring their civilisation into backward countries. But we say differently. They aresitting in these countries to rob the last piece of bread from the people, and that is what they (the correspondents) do not like, because the truth hurts.&quot;United Kingdom CommentWhen asked about this speech at the Foreign Office press conferenceon 5th December the Foreign Office spokesman said that:  &quot; The pattern of these speeches seems to be becoming pretty clear andI do not think they call for day-to-day comment from me.&quot;On 5th December, in a speech -to the Pilgrims in New York,Mr. Nutting said:  &quot;Both in the Far East, South-East Asia and the Middle East the communists are mounting an offensive in the grand manner. Frustratedin Europe they turn to less well held parts of the world. Repelled at thefront door they go round to the back. They tell the Asian world of theblessings of neutrality &apos; You stay neutral and we&apos;ll be on your side. west and for non-interference in other people&apos;s affairs, but you would likesome Soviet technicians to show you how to do things like we do, wouldn&apos;t &apos;tyou? Iron Curtains could be done away with if only everybody would accept our democratic way of life. There&apos;s no Iron Curtain for instancebetween Russia and ROumania: we&apos;re all one happy family and our onlywish is that you should join the family too.&apos; All these blandishments areof course accompanied by abuse Of the Western Powers. ^Britain andFrance started the last war: America will start the next: Britain regardsyou as savages: get rid Of the colonialist, imperialist warmongers.&apos; Tosay the least of it this kind of childish nonsense is not very flattering tothe intelligence of their Asian audience. Happily I believe that the worldis in the long run more interested in performance than propaganda. Andwhen it comes to measuring performance it is the Western world that hashelped and the Soviets who have merely offered specious and urifulfiiledpromises.&quot;5. Speech by Mr. Khrushchev on 6th December at RangoonBritish VersionRetiter message from Rangoon, -6th December:  &quot;Mr. Khrushchev said certain persons strongly disliked our visit to Indiaand Burma, and they did not like our sincere, frank statements ... . that is thereason why certain organs of the English press responded with irritation to myspeeches and to speeches made by Comrade Bulganin in India.  They especially
did not like that item in one of my speeches in which I said certain circles untiedHitler&apos;s hands to launch the war against the Soviet Union. But this is an historicalfact. Could Hitler have started the war if he had been confronted with the unitedforces of England, France, the Soviet Union and other countries? If the rulingcircles of England and France of that time had wished to hold Hitler back and toprevent war, they would have prevented the occupation of Austria by Hitler and could not have agreed to the shameful Munich agreements.&quot; Towards the end of his speech, Mr. Khrushchev referred to the wartimeco-operation between the allies. He said: The struggle was hard, but our unitedallied armies, fighting for the bright future of humanity, for its freedom and independence against bloody Hitlerism, won their greatest victory. this experience of our common fight for a mutual cause had a tremendous significance.The Second World War proved that the British, French, American and Sovietpeoples can be the best of friends not only during good times, but during a timeof most severe and hard ordeal.&quot; Mr. Khrushchev also said that he would ask British journalists why theywere offended when the &apos; facts of the past&apos; were recalled.&quot;&apos; Russia has never waged wars against England,&apos; he declared, &apos; But theEnglish have attacked our country in the past as well as in the Soviet era. Itwould be enough to refer to the war of Sebastopol (the Crimea War of 1854-56).At that time we Russians did not invite the English to the Crimea so that theycould destroy our Russian people on Russian soil. We can also recall Britishintervention against our Motherland during the Civil War (after the BolshevikRevolution in 1917). At that time when our Soviet Republic was beingstrengthened, British troops occupied Archangel.&apos;&quot;Daily Telegraph report, 7th December:  &quot; He repeated the charge that the Allies started the last war. He embellishedit by adding that the &apos; bloodhound &apos; (Nazi Germany) which the ruling circles in britain, France and the United States were feeding up to set free against theSoviet Union, broke loose and attacked them instead. &apos; Are not the same countriesusing the same methods to try to push Western Germany on the path to war andnew adventure? &apos; he asked.&quot;Soviet VersionB.B.C. Monitor of Moscow Radio transmitting a Tass report in Russian forabroad,- 6th December:  &quot; The colonisers cannot reconcile themselves to the loss of their position inSouth-East Asia and in the Pacific and refuse to recognise the changes which havetaken place in the lives of the peoples of the former colonies and subject States,who have embarked on the path of independent development. Their interference in the domestic affairs of Korea and Indo-China was marked by bloody wars whichhave made of this part of the world a cockpit for a new war. Thanks to the collective efforts of the peace-loving States, upheld by world public opinion, it waspossible to end hostilities in Korea and China. ...&quot; A gang of Chiang Kai-shek bandits has entrenched itself on your territoryperpetrating all kinds of acts of banditry. I think that it is unlikely that this gangwould have held out so long had it not been helped by certain of Burma&apos;s foes.But whatever the colonisers may do they will not hold on to places whence theyhave been driven by the people who have rallied under the banner of nationalindependence.....&quot; Some people, however, have taken a strong exception to our visit to Indiaand Burma; they did not like our speeches and frank statements. But we have always spoken, and now speak, the truth. And truth is frequently not to everyone&apos;s liking. There is a national saying: &apos; Truth stings the eyes.&apos; That is why certain organs of the British Press have reacted with irritation to my statements and those of Comrade Bulganin in India. They took particular exception to that part in one of my speeches in which I said that certain circles untied Hitler&apos;s handsin the war against the Soviet Union. That, however, is an historical fact. CouldHitler have started a war if he had been faced by the united forces of Britain,France, the Soviet Union and other countries?   If the then ruling circles of
Britain and France had had the inclination to restrain Hitler and to prevent theunleashing of war they would have prevented Hitler from seizing Austria; theywould not have concluded the shameful Munich Pacts.&quot; It is known that France had a mutual aid treaty with Czechoslovakia. Atthe moment, however, when Hitler undertook the seizure of Czechoslovakia, theFrench Government refused to come to her aid, although it knew well that theSoviet Union was ready to give immediate aid in the matter of curbing Hitler&apos;saggression. It is after all no secret that the Soviet armed forces were then in astate of military preparedness so as to repel, jointly with French troops, Hitler&apos;saggression against Czechoslovakia. The French Government, however, refusedto do this. The history of the pre-war years convincingly testifies to the fact thatthe Western Powers made one concession after another to Hitler, pushing him tothe East, towards our country. But things turned out in such a way that the onewhom the then ruling circles of Britain, France and the United States were feedingup like their chained dog, intending to unleash it against the Soviet Union, slippedhis chain and attacked those who were feeding him. In this connection weinvoluntarily ask ourselves: do we not see some analogy with the pre-war periodif we look at some of the steps that are being taken with regard to western germany?&quot; Are not the very same countries to-day proceeding by the very same means in an endeavour to push Western Germany along the road of aggression and newadventures?&quot; They have involved Western Germany in NATO; they supply the funds for the rearmament of Western Germany, supply her with arms. Many of theleading lights of the Western countries do not even consider it necessary to hidethe fact that they are training the West German Army against the Soviet Union.&quot; Then why do you gentlemen, British journalists, take offence when we recalla few things from the past?&quot; I want to speak also about the following: Russia never made war againstBritain but Britain has attacked our country, both in the past and in our Soviettimes. It is sufficient to quote such an example as the Crimean war. After all,the Russians had not then invited the English to the Crimea to destroy Russianpeople on our Russian soil. One can also recall the British intervention against our Motherland during the Civil war. When the Soviet Republic was only justbeginning to get stronger, the British troops occupied Archangel; they came to usnot as friends but as foes to shed the blood of our Soviet people on our Soviet landuntil they were thrown out of it. All this is also historical fact from which one cannot get away.&quot; Remember, finally, the famous directive which Mr. Churchill issued at theend of the second World War to his Commander-in-Chief in the European theatre of war operations. Churchill had then issued orders to lock up and store the weapons which the Hitler troops abandoned when they were surrendering, and tokeep these troops in readiness as they might come in useful in action against theSoviet Union, though the Soviet Union was Britain&apos;s ally.&quot; We are used to telling the truth always and to look truth in the face, eventhough it might be unpleasant. All our actions proclaim the fact that we do not want dissensions with the Western Powers; we stand for a true friendship with britain, France, the United States and other countries. We want to be friendlywith all the countries of the world.....&quot; I want to return again to the events of the second World War. It is known that when Hitler&apos;s Germany treacherously attacked the Soviet Union and we foundourselves to be the allies of France, Britain and the United States in the struggle against her, our country fulfilled its duties as an ally honestly and conscientiously.The Soviet Union has shed much more blood in this war than all our Allies taken together, but we respect and give praise to the British, French, American and othertroops who fought against Hitler&apos;s Germany and her satellites.....   The strugglewas stiff. But our joint armies, fighting for the happy future of mankind, for its freedom and independence, against bloody Hitlerism, gained the proudest ofvictories. This experience of joint struggle for a common cause was of great significance. The second World War has shown that British, French, american and Soviet people can be the best of friends not only in good times, but also inthe years of the hardest and direst of trials. If we were Allies in the war, thenwhat can prevent us being just as good friends in the struggle for maintaining and consolidating peace? &quot;
United Kingdom CommentAt the Foreign Office press conference on 7th December the spokesman said:  &quot; Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s theme, on the origins of the war, seems to bemuch the same as the one put forward by Mr. Molotov at the Conferenceof Berlin. It was dealt with at the time both by Mr. Eden, as he then was,and by Mr. Dulles. I don&apos;t think I have anything to add to what they said then.&quot; Perhaps I could remind you of what it was.&quot; Mr. Eden said, on 3rd February, 1954: &apos; I must say, in relation tohistorical research, that it is really fantastic to suppose thatMr. Chamberlain was in any way responsible for Hitler&apos;s attack on poland, to which country Britain had given a guarantee. The Governmentof which Mr. Chamberlain was the head gave the guarantee which resultedin the declaration of war by Great Britain and by France on September 3,1939.&apos;&quot; Mr. Dulles said, the day before: &apos; I have in my hands a speech which the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs made in Moscow onOctober 31, 1939. . . .&apos; Mr. Dulles quoted from it various passages,including the following sentence, &apos; It is not only senseless but criminalto wage such a war a war for the destruction of Hitlerism camouflagedas a fight for democracy.&apos; &quot;
ANNEX BSelection of Critical Statements about the Soviet System and Leadersmade by British Statesmen since 1945Speech by Mr. Ernest Bevin (Foreign Secretary) House of Commons,7th November, 1945&quot; .... If I may refer to Russia, I think the right honourable gentleman(Mr Churchill) will agree that we have met almost every demand that we everthought we should be asked for. ....... I must say that, having conceded all this and not taken one inch of territory, or asked for it, one cannot help being a little bit suspicious if a great power wants to come right across, shall I say, the throat of the BritishCommonwealth, which, has done no harm to anybody but fought this war. . . . &quot;Mr. Churchill (in Opposition) At Fulton, Missouri, 5th March, 1946From Stettin, in the Baltic, to Trieste, in the Adriatic, an iron curtainhas descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of theancient States of Central and Eastern Europe Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna,Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia. All these famous cities, and the populations around them, lie in the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one formor another, not only to Soviet influence, but to a very high and increasing measureof control from Moscow. Athens alone, with its immortal glories, is free to decideits future at an election under British, American and French observation. TheRussian-dominated Polish Government has been encouraged to make enormousand wrongful inroads upon Germany, and mass expulsions of millions of Germanson a scale grievous and undreamed of are now taking place. The Communistparties, which were very small in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to pre-eminence and power far beyond their numbers, and are seekingeverywhere to obtain totalitarian control. Police Governments are prevailing in nearly every case, and so far, except in Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy.Turkey and Persia are both profoundly alarmed and disturbed at the claims whichare made upon them and at the pressure being exerted by the Moscow Government.An attempt is being made by the Russians in Berlin to build up a quasi-CommunistParty in their zone of occupied Germany by showing special favours to groups of Left-wing German leaders.At the end of the fighting last June the American and British armies withdrewwestwards, in accordance with an earlier agreement, to a depth at some points of150 miles on a front of nearly 400 miles, to allow the Russians to occupy this vastexpanse of territory which the Western democracies had conquered. If, now, theSoviet Government tries, by separate action, to build up a pro-CommunistGermany in their areas, this will cause new serious difficulties in the British and american zones, and will give the defeated Germans the power of puttingthemselves up to auction between the Soviets and the Western democracies.Whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts and facts they are thisis certainly not the liberated Europe we fought to build up. Nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace. ...&quot;&quot; .... I do not believe that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desireis the fruits of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrinesMr. Churchill (in Opposition) House of Commons, 5th June, 1946&quot; . . . . There had been and there still was an earnest desire to dwell infriendly co-operation with the Soviet Government and the Russian people. Onthe other hand, the Foreign Secretary received the approval of the vast majority ofthe people when he protested against the prolonged systematic campaign ofvilification which had been and was being daily pumped out upon us by the Soviet
Mr. Attlee (Prime Minister) Speech at the Mansion House, 10th November, 1947&quot; It is surely strange that in face of these facts Russian statesmen andjournalists still accuse Britain of imperialism. If there is imperialism in the world to-day, by which I mean the subjection of other peoples by the political andeconomic domination of a powerful nation, it is certainly not to be found in theBritish Commonwealth.&quot;Mr. Bevin (Foreign Secretary) House of Commons, 18th December, 1947&quot; . . . . Then came the Marshall speech at Harvard. We welcomed thatspeech and we tried to turn it to the advantage of Europe as a whole, but, to ourgreat grief, instead of every country taking advantage of that plan, the SovietGovernment stepped in and used tremendous pressure on their immediateneighbours, and, in fact, ordered them not to participate. I feel that this action was violating the free choice of these States, and really interfering with their independence and sovereignty. A campaign was then started by the Soviet Unionagainst this attempt to help Europe as a whole, applying epithets to it which I have always felt were totally unjustified.&quot;Mr. Attlee (Prime Minister)-Broadcast, 3rd January, 1948&quot;. . . . Soviet Communism pursues a policy which threatens with a new form of imperialism-ideological, economic and strategic-the welfare and wayof life of the other nations of Europe .... In Communist Russia privilege forthe few is a growing phenomenon and the gap between the lowest and highestincomes is constantly widening. . . .&quot;Mr. Morrison (Lord President of the Council) At Leicester, 11th January, 1948&quot;. . . . There is nothing we would like better than active co-operation withthe Soviet Union for protecting the peace and promoting the social well-being of mankind; but we cannot be expected at all times to lie down to the untruthfuland malicious attacks which are made upon our country and our Government bythe reckless propaganda machines of the Russian Communists and of theCommunist Parties of the world, which conduct themselves as the servile automaticoutposts of the Soviet Foreign Office.&quot; We cannot be expected to be happy when country after country in eastern and south-eastern Europe finds itself subject to undemocratic and unrepresentativeCommunist Government, coupled with the suppression of other political partiespropaganda machine. Apart from the Communists and the &apos; Cryptos &apos; the communists without the pluck to call themselves by their proper names very few people were shocked by the homely language he chose to employ at the london conference in January. . . .&quot; . . . . However, there is no use in concealing the fact that the soviet propaganda and their general attitude have made a profound impression upon thiscountry since the war and people are wondering very much whether the SovietGovernment really wish to be friends with Britain and to work wholeheartedly fora speedy re-establishment of peace, freedom and plenty throughout the world.Across the ocean, in Canada and the United States, the unfriendly soviet propaganda has also been very effective in the reverse direction to what was intended. The handful of very able men who hold the 180 million of Sovietcitizens in their grasp ought to be able to get better advice about the Westerndemocracies.&quot; For instance, it cannot be in the interest of Russia to go on irritating theUnited States. There is no people in the world which is so slow to develop hostilefeelings against a foreign country as are the Americans, and there is no peoplewhich once estranged are more difficult to win back. The American eagle sits onhis perch, a large strong bird with formidable beak and claws. There he sitsmotionless, and Mr. Gromyko is sent day after day to prod him with a sharp pointedstick -now in his neck, now under his wings, now his tail feathers.&quot;
and freedom of the Press, wholesale witch-hunting, and even the very unjudicialexecution of non-Communist political leaders. We are bound not only to deploreit but to feel a rising indignation because of our belief in democracy and humanfreedom. It adds to our sorrow and indignation that this process should sountruthfully and noisily be proclaimed as promoting democracy, freedom and anti-Fascism.&quot; Nobody is seeking to upset the internal security of the USSR. Can theynot begin to reverse engines, and to discard provocative policies by which theyare not only running the risk of war at some time but which are impeding theeconomic recovery and progress of mankind? . . . .&quot;Mr. Attlee (Prime Minister) House of Commons. 24th January, 1948In the field of human rights to-day, Russia and Eastern Europe areat the back of the queue. ...&quot;Mr. Bevin (Foreign Secretary) United Nations General Assembly,28th September, 1948&quot;. . . . I notice in the speech that Mr. Vyshinsky claimed that the contactsexisting between friendly nations of the West were all part of a cold war againstthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This is utter nonsense. There has beena war of nerves, but it has not been instituted by us. It began immediately thewar ended. May I ask: what about the war of nerves on Turkey that kept hermobilised so long? Why the perpetual war of nerves, involving, in this case,actual fighting, against the lawfully elected Greek Government and the valiantand sorely tried Greek people?&quot; We know the reason. It is that the Soviet spider wants Greece within itsweb. . . .&quot;Mr. McNeil (Minister of State) United Nations Political Committee,7th October, 1948&quot;. . . . Russia has enriched herself territorially to an extent beyond parallelin modern times. Outside her borders she has pursued a policy of daring andaggressive political warfare.&quot; Inside her borders visitors are few, newspapers are controlled, and evendiplomatic personnel are now formally denied the courtesies of travel.....&quot;Mr. Churchill (in Opposition) Speech at Boston, 1st April, 1949&quot;. . . . Thirteen men in the Kremlin, holding down hundreds of millions of people and aiming at the rule of the world, feel that at all costs they must keep up the barriers. Self-preservation, not for Russia but for themselves, lies atthe root and is the explanation of their sinister and malignant policy. . . .&quot;&quot;. . . . Behind this stands the largest army in the world, in the hands of aGovernment pursuing Imperialist expansion as no Tsar or Kaiser has everdone. . . .&quot;Mr. Bevin (Foreign Secretary) House of Commons, 12th May, 1949&quot;. . . . When we tried to handle the problem of the Danube by means ofa conference, a conference in which the Soviet bloc had a majority, notwithstandingour rights our historical rights-in that river, we were treated in a most shamefulmanner. ...&quot;. . . . The policy that has been followed by the Soviet Union seems to beto talk of peace and accuse others of being war-mongers, but at the same timeto carry on a policy of promoting unsettlement all round. . . .&quot;
Mr. McNeil (Minister of State) Political Committee of United Nations,16th November, 1949&quot; . . . . Most of the world has no appetite for the Soviet peace; it is a peacethat destroys and does not create. Mr. Vyshinsky should return to Moscow andtell his Government that they alone are cutting off the Russian people from the sympathy of the world, the conscience of which is revolted by the mechanicalcynicism of the Soviet regime. . . .&quot; . . . . The reason is that the Soviet continent is walled off in darkness. Iappeal to the Soviet Government to pull up the blinds in Russia, however slowly,and to think over this barren, reactionary attempt to extend the scope of Statesovereignty. ...&quot;Mr. Bevin (Foreign Secretary) United Nations General Assembly,25th September, 1950We soon discovered, when we began discussions on the five peace treaties, that the Soviet Government were simultaneously carrying out policies in Poland, Roumania, Hungary and Bulgaria which seemed to us to be a clear indication of their intention to dominate those countries; to convert them intosatellites; to destroy all prospects of free elections; to stage purges and politicaltrials; and to get rid of any free political expression.&quot; In so doing, the Soviet Government were disregarding agreements arrived at between the Allied Powers before the end of the war.&quot; It soon became quite clear to us that nothing would satisfy Soviet policyexcept Peace Treaties designed to ensure that the countries of Eastern europe should be under Communist regimes which were subservient to Moscow.&quot; I do not believe that the Soviet Government ever had any sincere intention ofacting in accordance with the spirit of the agreements which had been entered intoduring the war. . . .&quot;We had to meet the terrible decision of the Soviet Government to try to starve Berlin.&quot;Mf- Bevin (Foreign Secretary) At the Labour Party Conference, 5th October, 1950&quot; . . . . With the support of every member of the Cabinet I tried from the day took office until 1947 to be friends with Russia. There is not a speaker who hasbeen on that platform this morning and urged the adoption of this resolution whowould stand more insults, more abuse and put up with more than I have put up with from Molotov and Vyshinsky.....&quot;Mr. Eden (in Opposition) Press Conference, 25th October, 1950&quot; . . . . Soviet aims are furthered by the interplay of ideological appeal,political manoeuvre, economic sabotage, and armed aggression, even if only byproxy. Defence measures taken by the free world must have regard to all these aspects of Soviet policy. . . .&quot;Mr. Ernest Davies (Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Foreign Affairs) in a written reply House of Commons, 7th December, 1950&quot; .... It is not clear what prompted the Soviet Government to procure the escape of a man charged with a sordid crime (Eugen Stefanowics: a warrant for hisarrest on a charge of murder had been issued in this country), or what advantagethey expected to reap by so doing. Nevertheless, their action was clearly contraryto accepted standards of international behaviour and demonstrates once more theirdisregard for the practice of civilised nations, even in matters devoid of political significance. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it useless to pursue the matter further and can only regret that the Soviet Government should have gone to suchlengths to defeat the ends of justice.&quot;
Mr. Attlee (Prime Minister) Speech at Forest Hill, 26th January, 1951&quot;. . . . But there was one Power in the great alliance that overthrew Hitlerwhich took another course. It did not turn back to the paths of peace; it went down the roads of conquest and of imperialism. Soviet Russia kept in being a vastmilitary machine spread out over its neighbours&apos; territories as well as its own. . . .&quot;.... In the United Nations, again and again, every effort to solve theworld&apos;s problem has been blocked by the Soviet &apos; No.&apos; Inevitably, then, we havebeen forced to the conclusion that Soviet Russia does not want the world to solveits problem, does not want things to settle down. Its policy seems rather to be tofoment trouble.&quot; The present rulers of Russia are the inheritors of Russian imperialism. . . .Stalin has been more successful in his imperialism than the Tsars ever dreamed ofbeing. But there has been added to this old-style imperialism an ideologicalimperialism which seeks to impose on the whole world the system of RussianCommunism. . . .The doctrines of Marx-Leninism seem to most of us to offer an arid,unattractive creed about as far from true Socialism as can be. They preach slavery,and the negation of human happiness. The trouble is that they are the acceptedcreed of the Rulers of Russia. ...&quot;Mr. Gaitskell (Chancellor of the Exchequer) At Birmingham,27th January, 1951 (press report)We had no desire to force our way of life upon other countries. Butit was part of the tragedy of the situation and part of its difficulty that Russia wasnot a democracy. However much the people of Russia might desire peace, wehad no chance to talk to them.....&quot; . . . . Why did Russia seek to build up an intense national hatred againstthe West? It can have no place in the peaceful and stable world at which itsdiplomats sometimes said they were aiming. It can have meaning only if in the judgment of the handful of men who ruled Russia the future relationship between their country and the West was to be one of implacable and permanenthostility.....&quot;Mr. Morrison (Foreign Secretary) To Press Association, 13th June, 1951&quot; . . . . Nowadays, if one makes a friendly speech, if one tries to point outhow we wish for peace and co-operation with the Russian people, the speech maywell be reported everywhere except behind the Iron Curtain.&quot; Peoples living behind the Iron Curtain, are denied their right to take partin international discussion of questions involving millions of lives. . . . .&quot;Mr. Eden (Foreign Secretary) United Nations General Assembly,11th November, 1952&quot; . . . . The year has been marked by an increase in propaganda designed to arouse and intensify hatred between the nations. Far from seeking to enlightenand clarify, Communist publicity has surpassed itself in its attempts to blackenand abuse the free peoples of the world.&quot; Monstrous allegations have been made on all manner of subjects. Germwarfare is one example. This columny has been primarily directed against theUnited States, which country carries the main burden in Korea. It is in vain thatthe charges have been denied. It is in vain that we have offered to have themexamined by impartial investigators.   That is always rejected.&quot; It is hard to understand how anyone can sincerely believe these charges.But if they do, how can they refuse a serious investigation of them?&quot; Nor is it only this alleged germ warfare, Communist propaganda has beeneven more extravagant. Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and many of your Govern-ments also, are frequently described as &apos; cannibals.&apos; Nobody, of course, believes that grisly accusation, not even those who use the term.   But it is just an example
Mr. Selwyn Lloyd (Minister of State) United Nations General Assembly24th September, 1953&quot; . . . . On the other side of the Iron Curtain there has been the belief in the suppression of human liberties in the interests of the State, in monolithic unity athome to use the phrase we heard on Monday and in the forcible overthrow ofexisting systems of society in the rest of the world; or to put it shortly, in the classicCommunist aim of the world revolution.....&quot;Mr. Eden (Foreign Secretary) To the National Union of Conservative andUnionist Associations, 18th March, 1954&quot; . . . . Soviet Russia has, of course, no bases in foreign lands. They merelyoccupy those lands and lay on them the dread tyranny of Soviet rule.....&quot;Mr. Selwyn Lloyd (Minister of State) United Nations General Assembly,5th October, 1954&quot; . . . . The Soviet attitude to German rearmament is quite cynical. Underthe guise of police there is an East German army consisting of 90,000 men. Inaddition, there is a navy 6,000 strong, and an air force, called the &apos; people&apos;s airforce,&apos; training on Soviet aircraft. In view of these facts the Russian campaign to deny Western Germany the opportunity to have any military forces at all is just cynical.....&quot;Sir Winston Churchill (Prime Minister)-At Woodford, 23rd November, 1954&quot; . . . . This vast reversal of British, American and European opinionconcerning the role of Germany in the West was brought about only by the policyof Soviet Russia itself and above all by Stalin, the dictator, who was carried awayby the triumphs of victory and acted as if he thought he could secure for Russiaand Communism the domination of the world.....&quot;of that abuse of language which makes all Communist statements so suspect. TheRussian people, who, like other people of the world, would no doubt prefer to thinkwell of other nations, are. told of &apos; pitiful slums and stuffy workshops &apos; in London,Paris and New York,&apos; where seven- and eight-year-old children toil day and night,their faces emaciated and weakened.&apos; The Red Fleet alleges that&apos; in 1951 Britishservicemen, and in particular British marines, were engaged in what do you think? engaged in spreading leprosy in the northern areas of Korea.....
