1/ ISVy(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 177 COPY NO16th November, 1955CABINET. QVEST LOTHIAN; UNEMPLOYMENT PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i feel bound to bring to my colleagues&apos; attention the very serious situation that is threatening in the area of West Lothian which is dependenton the shale oil industry.2.     Scottish Oils, Limited, a subsidiary of the British petroleum company, produces fuel oils (and seme by-products) from shale mines inthe north-east corner of Vest Lothian.    It employs 4, 000 men in the pitsand the works which produce the oils and by-products.    This part of WestLothian is a &quot;one-industry&quot; area, and its employment depends almost wholly on shale oil.3.     In ordex- to enable the home production of oils to compete in selling price with imported oils, the former pay a lower duty to the Exchequer.The preference was 9d. a gallon in 1950 but was increased to Is. 3d. a gallonin 1953 to allow the industry to meet rising costs of production unaccompaniedby a rise in selling price.    Even with this preference, however, home produced light oils still pay a duty of Is. 3d. a gallon.4.     Over a year ago the trade union represented to me that a further reduction of the duty was essential if the industry were to be re-organised and put on an economic basis;  and since then the Company have urged thesame point on the Minister of Fuel and Power.    They claim, I understand,that the industry is running at a loss of about  200, 000 a year and that,unless further relief is given, they will have to close down.    &quot;The rate at which the industry wculd run down if no further assistance were given isnot yet known.    It may be that the Company would agree to spread itsclosures over three or four years and so allow an opportunity for other employment to be considered.    There can be no certainty however that theCompany will not decide to cut their losses and close down immediately.One group of pits and works employing some 600 workers will in any caserequire to be closed very scon but by a happy combination of circumstances,which is unlikely to recur, the prospects are that most of the men will beable to be absorbed in the other parts of the industry and in other develop-ments at Grangemouth as they become redundant.    But if the rest of theindustry is to close, absorption in it will provide only temporary employ -ment.5.      The whole case for further assistance to the industry has beendiscussed with the Treasury by the Departments concerned, but the treasury have now taken the line that the Company should be informed that the
Government are unable to extend further relief to them, while it is preparedto do all it can to assist in finding other work for those whom the industry can no longer employ.6.     I am very much afraid of the consequences of action on these lines.It will certainly be represented that by making a tax concession the Govern-ment would keep an important industry in existence and 4, 000 men inemployment.    The prospects of finding alternative employment on any considerable scale are not bright unless we are prepared to contemplatesome quite exceptional measures.    The area is already within the .Development Area but has not shown itself attractive to industry;  only one new factory has been set up there since the war.7.     I understand that the Chancellor feels that assistance to this industry would lead to similar requests for tax relief from other industries or individual firms which happen to be in difficulties;  and that as ScottishOils arc the most uneconomic unit in the domestic oil industry further assistance would probably be swallowed up by rising costs like the reliefgranted in 1953.    The Chancellor also stresses the added difficulty thatfiscal measures would require legislation through a Finance Bill - whichcould not be the current one;  and he feels that legislation on this subject would throw open to discussion the whole question of our policy on the oilduties and stimulate pressure for tax remissions which would be extremelycostly.    I fully appreciate these difficulties - other than the last, as towhich I am not in a position to judge. - I would have hoped that thecircumstances of this case were so unique in the oil industry that a concession would not have opened the door to tax remissions to other sections of the industry which do not need them.8.     In all the circumstances, and after the most careful consideration,I am so disturbed at the prospect of severe unemployment in this area,which we shall be accused of creating, that I feel bound to ask the Cabinetto agree in principle that the industry should be enabled, by a further reduction of duty, to maintain a reasonable level of employment.    I shouldbe glad to discuss further with the Chancellor and the Minister of Fuel and power the amount of the reduction that would be necessary.J.S.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.16th November, 1955.
