secret.P. (55) 214 COPY NO.30th December, 1955CABINETMAJOR GERMAN WAR criminals memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsFive major war criminals sentenced by the International MilitaryTribunal at Nuremberg remain in Spandau prison under quadripartite control,Their particulars are as follows:-Name Sentence Date for ReleaseHess LifeFunk LifeSpeer 20 years 1st October, 1966Schirach 20 years 1st October, 1966Doenitz 10 years 1st October, 19562. The sentences run from 1st October, 1946, the date of conviction.There is no remission for good conduct or allowance for pre-trial custody,We have, however, already released Neurath and Raeder because they wereold and sick and might have died in prison.3. I suggest that there would now be advantage in setting up a four-Power judicial board to review these sentences.    Its terms of reference might be to make recommendations to Governments,- without calling inquestion the validity of the convictions, for the termination or reductionof sentences or for parole.4. The arguments in favour of this proposal are as followsj-(i)       The sentences of the remaining seven Japanese major war criminals have been reduced to ten years, which means that all are nowbeing released.(ii)       We have agreed to review the cases of the lesser war criminalsin Germany, as a result of which all but 16 of those in British hands havebeen released.(iii)       In equity, there is clearly a strong case for dealing with theSpandau prisoners in the same way as the Japanese or the other Germanoffenders.    It is increasingly difficult to justify to opinion in western germany and other countries the absence of any arrangements for clemencyin respect of the Spandau prisoners, especially as it is contrary to Westerntheory to leave prisoners without any hope of mitigation or (in the case jptHess and Funk) of release.

1 lb(iv)       In addition, our holding of these prisoners is likely to be a continuing cause of resentment in Germany as a reminder of former four-Power control,(v)       There is a risk that the Russians might take the initiative in suggesting re-consideration of the Spandau sentences in an effort to influence German opinion.5. Against the proposal are the following considerations:-(i) There is still considerable public feeling in this country againstthe major German war criminals.(ii) Doenitz (alone of the five) may prove dangerous on release as heis fit and active and an unrepentant nationalist.    But, as he is due out on1st October, 1956 in any case, I do not attach great importance to this.recommendations. I consider that the advantages of setting up a board of reviewoutweigh the disadvantages.    I propose therefore:-(a)   that H.M. Ambassador at Bonn be instructed todiscuss with his French and American colleagues the constitution of a board of review and, if they agree, the terms of an approach to the soviet authorities!that the Federal German Chancellor should beinformed confidentially before any approach ismade to the Soviet authorities.    He is unlikely to object in principle, but should be given anopportunity of commenting in advance on anyproposal which might expedite the release ofDoenitz.S.L.Foreign Office, S.Vvr.l.30th December, 1955.(b)\
