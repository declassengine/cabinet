IS 4C. P, (55) 184 COPY NO.29th November, 1955CABINETOVERSEAS expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in a paper which I circulated recently to the Defence Committee(D. C. (55) 48), I gave some information about the trends of government expenditure not only on defence but in other fields.2.     In recent weeks I have been perturbed at the large number of proposals put to me for additional expenditure overseas.    All government expenditure, whether at home or overseas, has of course to be met from our own resources.    But external expenditure imposes an even greaterstrain than expenditure at home;  for, while both make increased demands on output, external expenditure requires that the increase in output should takethe form of an expansion of exports.     The purpose of the present paper is toput before my colleagues the position as I see it in regard to our overseas expenditure.The I resent I osition3.     How do we stand at the present time?   What resources have we whichcould be devoted to additional overseas expenditure?    To answer this wemust look first at our balance of trade - and, of course, not only imports and exports but invisible transactions as well.    Clearly, unless we have afavourable balance of visibles and invisibles together we have no resources which we can devote to expenditure overseas except to the extent that wecan meet the cost of overseas expenditure by borrowing overseas or running down our reserves.4.      When we make up our external accounts, we then bring in items ofexpenditure overseas which are of a current nature.     The chief items ofexpenditure directly attributable to the Government are:-(i)    External military expenditure,   150 millions a year (which will be increased by over 70 millions a year if and when we have tomeet the full cost of our forces in Germany).(ii)    Grants for Colonial development and assistance, 27 millions a year,(iii)    Other political expenditure,  20 millions a year.(iv)    The interest on the United States and Canadian   .Loans,  40 millions a year, which we canonly escape if we can secure the waiver.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..
5.      Including these items in the reckoning we have, for the last fewmonths, been running only about level in our external accounts.    It is clearthat we are not earning enough to meet our commitments of a capital nature(set out in paragraph 7 below) let alone to incur new overseas commitments,whether current or capital.    At home there has been an excessive demand on our resources and, as a result, continuing inflation.    We have taken a succession of measures, including a supplementary Budget, to hold and improve the situation.    We cannot as yet say how successful those measures will be.6.      My colleagues will remember that not long ago we stated publicly that if we were not to run into further debt we should need a surplus of 300 millions a year on current account, year in year out, if we were tomeet our capital commitments on external account.7.      The following are the main capital commitments which, in the present state of our current balance, can only be met by running down our reserves,or by borrowing abroad or both.(x)    the capital repayment of the United States andand Canadian loans ( 37 millions per annum);(ii)    releases under agreements from the sterling balances ( 27 millions);(iii)    loans for Colonial development and assistance( 18 millions).8.     We are also committed as a matter of Government policy - though not of contract - to the financing of development in the Commonwealth - both ofUnited Kingdom concerns (e.g. oil) and of the rest of the Commonwealthitself.     The financing of some of this is included in the figures in para-graphs 4 and 7, but they make no allowance for giving Commonwealth Govern-ments access to the London market in order to achieve their development;nor, of course, do they allow for the important and desirable flow of private capital to the Commonwealth, including Canada.    A further commitment which would add to the strain on the reserves if we were in no more thanbalance would be the use of free sterling balances by countries inside and outside the sterling area, which they are at liberty to use and which we mustmeet.New Commifm ents9.     We already have commitments for releases from our subscription tothe International Bank ( 60 millions over six years from 1953);  for specialExport Credit Guarantee Department credits to Persia and Pakistan( 17 millions);  for subscription to the International Finance Corporation( 5 millions).10. Yet there are constant suggestions that we should undertakefurther commitments in order to meet desirable objectives in political orother fields.    There is pressure to increase defence expenditure substantiallyduring the next three years;  I have already referred to this - it includesexpenditure overseas, not only in Germany but also on new installations insuch places as Australia and Malaya.    We are asked for additional expenditureon projects and operations which are regarded as politically essential or atleast highly desirable.    Examples of such requests which have been made
in recent weeks - some of which have been approved - are the extra cost oftroops in Cyprus;  gifts of arms for Libya and Iraq;  increased assistance,for the Arab Legion;  assistance in Malaya and Singapore (when these Coloniesbecome self-governing) towards the cost of raising and equipping localtroops;  and economic help to Malta over a long period of years.    None ofthese individual items involves large expenditure, with the exception of malaya where the cost may be anything from  6- 12 millions a year, butthe cumulative effect creates an atmosphere in which it is taken as axiomaticthat more burdens should fall on the United Kingdom taxpayer.11.     For the Kariba hydro-electric project, in the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, we are committed to loans of  18 millions and to a releaseto the International Bank of about  10 millions from our  60 millions.    our offer to guarantee a  40 millions credit towards the Third Indian Steel works is likely to be insufficient to secure the contract and we are being pressed togo further.    For the Aswan High Dam we have for some time been thinking of a guarantee of up to  45 millions, including  5 millions credit, and havebeen pressed by the Egyptians to do more;   the picture is rapidly changing,and we now&apos;seem likely to be pressed to make a straight loan or even anoutright grant.    Finally there is the Volta River project, which will cost 200- 300 millions;  our share remains to be settled, but on the earlierestimates Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to put up 40 per cent.12.    All these items and any others which may be approved can only bemet unless we run further into debt from the  200- 300 millions surplus on current account which we have set as our target - a surplus which has alsoto meet our existing capital commitments - a surplus, moreover, which isonly our aim and which at the moment we are not earning.The Future13.    The situation on overseas expenditure as set out in the preceding paragraphs, without our taking on any new commitments, is serious inrelation to the current and prospective state of our actual net earnings over-seas.    Substantial success in reducing inflation at home under the measures taken up to and in the autumn Budget will at best restore us to a healthycondition with only our present commitments.    But these measures will take time to work in full.    There are forces at home working against us.    Largewage claims are in sight and so far as they are granted they   will increasethe inflationary strain at home and add to our difficulties in our overseastrading.    Moreover, we have still to see how far the credit squeeze can becarried without causing serious harm.    Finally, we must remember thattaxation is very high and it is most desirable to reduce it both politically andto help to restore the incentives necessary to foster our export trade in a highly competitive world.14.   - I know that the object of some of the new proposals - an object ofgreat importance - is to strengthen our political standing and economicinfluence in the world.    But there is a great danger that we may defeat ourown object if we take on more than we can afford.    There is no doubt thatour economic difficulties this year have been watched with critical eyesabroad.    There have been widespread fears, not only in Europe but alsoin the Commonwealth, that we were reaching an impasse which would placeon intolerable strain on sterling.    These fears have shown themselves in anumber of ways;  in pressure from the Europeans on sterling, but moresignificantly still in a growing tendency for sterling area countries to wishto hold their own separate gold and dollar reserves.    India is a conspicuous
example but there have been a number of others as well.    Unless this tendencycan be checked we may do lasting damage to the sterling area and the sterling system.    It can only be checked if we can restore our balance ofpayments to a strong and healthy condition.Conclusions15.    I must state what the result will be if we find that our commitments,whether new ones or even existing ones, prove to be more than we can meet with a continuance of our present policies.    We shall have either to makesevere changes in our policies - political, social and military - or to adoptdrastic internal measures, or both, the total changes and measures beingdesigned to secure that the tasks we have undertaken are within our powerto fulfil.    These courses are unpleasant.    The serious weakening of ourstatus as a major Power, which reversal of our policies overseas wouldinvolve, is obvious.    As regards internal measures, experience on theautumn Budget has shown the difficulty of serious action at home.    To take further measures would certainly not be impossible.    Indeed, we might find that it is necessary to do so in order to restore our balance of payments to a healthy position even on the basis of our present commitments.    But,beyond some point, they would cause serious industrial and social strainsat home.    If this is so it would surely be only elementary prudence not to incur fresh commitments until we can see our way to carrying out those wehave incurred already.    And, if subsequently we do decide to incur further commitments, we must recognise that this can only be done at the cost of an equivalent sacrifice in our standard of living at home.16.    If we fail tc recognise this and try to take on new commitments withoutimposing the degree of restraint which they make necessary at home, weface irreparable damage to our economy and, of course, to sterling, and tothe sterling area system, with all that this implies for our position as a centre of the Commonwealth and as a leading world Power.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.28th November, 1955.
