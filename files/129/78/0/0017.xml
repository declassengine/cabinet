CJ?.(55) 1671st November9 1955GAB METCOLONIAL immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies in paragraph 2 of C.P. (55) 166 the Home Secretary poses thequestion whether any legislation which it may be decided to introduce tocontrol the immigration of persons not belonging to the United kingdom should apply to all British subjects from overseas or only to those from theColonies,     The arguments in favour of each course are set out as a basis for discussion.    Before my colleagues come to a decision on this I should like to state my views.     I gave an indication of them last December inparagraph 3 of C. (54) 379.2.        Any legislation which we introduce on this subject is bound to be criticised as interference with the traditional right of British subjects tocome freely to this country.    Subject to conditions which I would expoundorally we could, I think, answer this criticisms but if the legislation were applied only to Colonial immigrants we should be charged with racial discrimination and would have no effective reply0    Legislation of this kind would be fiercely resented in the Colonies - and not only in the West Indies,whence the main flow of immigrants is at present coming, but also in Britishdependencies throughout Africa, the Far East and the Mediterranean.   cyprus and Malta (Malta may have to be exempted from these arrangements ifHer Majesty&apos;s Government accept the integration proposals now beingconsidered) would resent a control which applied to them but not to Indiansand Pakistanis, and exceptions could not be made in the case of Cyprus and malta (except in the context of the integration proposals for Malta) withoutoffence to non-European Colonies,    It would moreover follow that citisensof territories (e.g. the Gold Coast) moving from dependence to independence would at that point cease to be controlled, a fact which would only add tothe difficulties of our relations with near-independent, or would-beindependents territories.    In particular, the effect of discriminatory legisla-tion on our relations with the West Indies would, I believe, be disastrous andthe future association of the proposed West Indian Federation with theCommonwealth would be jeopardised.    I must therefore record that i could not agree to legislation confined to Colonial immigrants.3.        In paragraphs 9 and 10 of the memorandum enclosed with his paper the Home Secretary discusses the question whether any powers of deportationover British subjects which he may be given should be subject to some formof judicial process.    Reference is made to the policy in Colonial territories0The whole question of the policy to be followed regarding the deportation ofBritish subjects from Colonial territories was considered by a departmentalCommittee in 1933 whose report was subsequently transmitted to Colonial(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA:ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)if .SECRET
-73Governors under cover of a Circular Despatch in which Lord Swinton, atthat time Secretary of State for the Colonies, urged that in cases in whichit was desired to deport a British subject &quot;he should have the benefit of a judicial enquiry into the facts alleged against him, rather than that, as inthe case of aliens, the power of deportation should be exercised summarilyand arbitrarily&quot;;,    Since then the aim has consistently been to embody thispolicy in Colonial legislation and practice,,    One reason for this policy was that since British subjects could enter and leave the United kingdom without let or hindrance it seemed desirable that some limitation should beplaced on the power of Colonial Governments to deport British subjects,.If, however, the Home Secretary is given power to deport British subjectsat discretion (thereby apparently placing them in the same category asaliens)^ there would be no grounds for insisting on a judicial process in the&apos;Colonies.    If, therefore,, we decide that the Home Secretary must have full discretion in the exercise of any powers of deportation of British subjects,we must face the possibility that we may not be able to dissuade colonial governments who wish to do so from taking similar powersa    Nor would Ibe prepared to hazard a guess as to what effect such a provision would have in the longer term on the attitude of Colonial peoples to the Commonwealthconcept,.Colonial Office, S. W.&apos;l.31st October, 19550\
