secret.P0(55) 1905th December, 1955CABINETBECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE;  THEBAMANGVATO RESERVEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations think my colleagues should know that there have been some indica-tions recently of unrest in the Barnangwato Reserve.     The visit to Bechuanalandlast May by Mr, Hatch, the Labour Party official, revived the hopes of seretse&apos;s supporters in the tribe that he would return as Chief, and they havebeen encouraged by subsequent speculation arising out of the Labour Partyproposals for a conference in London of tribal leaders, about which Iinformed my colleagues in September (C. P. (55) 112).2.        In the last few months Rasebolai, the Acting Native Authority, hasbeen opposed in kgotla by the pro-Seretse faction of the tribe on several important issues.     At the end of November the Resident Commissioner hadto send a security force to the north of the Bamangwato Reserve to deal withan outbreak of violence against one of Rasebolai&apos;s Subordinate NativeAuthorities.     The ringleaders have been arrested.     The situation is nowquiet and the Resident Commissioner does not expect any further trouble.3. Tshekedi recently informed the Resident Commissioner thatMr. Hatch had written to tell him that, as soon as the House of Commons hadfinished debating the autumn Budget,  the Opposition were likely to take upSeretse&apos;s case &quot;in a big way&quot;.     Mr. Hatch had apparently asked Tshekedi to lead an agitation in the Protectorate in favour of the Labour Party&apos;s proposalfor a conference in London of tribal leaders.     Tshekedi declined, and warnedMr. Hatch that he was mistaken in supposing that the Bamangwato wereanything like united on the question of Seretse&apos;s return.     These continuedefforts hy the Labour Party in favour of the revision of the order excludingSeretse from the Protectorate cannot fail to stir up opposition to Rasebolaiand to cause a set-back to our efforts to get him accepted as Chief.4.        As a result of these developments I have reviewed our policy and considered whether any alternative approach to a solution of the Bamangwatoproblem is open to us.5.        Clearly there can be no question of Seretse&apos;s return as Chief.    his wife and children would not be acceptable to an important section of the tribeand opinion elsewhere in the High Commission Territories would be against it.    Moreover, a reversal of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy on this issue would be most damaging to our authority in other Colonial territories.6.        Equally there can be no question of Tshekedi&apos;s appointment as chief.    The tribe would not accept him and we have undertaken not toCOPY NO.4o
impose a Chief against their wishes.    Other members of the ruling family-are unsuitable for various reasons.7.        Tshekedi has ambitions to re-assert his authority in the Reserve,and he would be prepared to see the Chieftainship abolished to further hisambitions.    But the High Commissioner considers that the Chieftainship isessential to the bechuanaland tribes in their present stage of development andI feel that it would be undesirable to take any initiative which would under-mine this traditional form of government in the other seven native reserves.8.        I am therefore fortified in my belief that we must continue ourpresent policy of support for Rasebolai as Native Authority, even though itmay be a long and difficult process to persuade the tribe to accept him as chief.     There is some risk that Rasebolai might become discouraged andresign from his position as Native Authority, but the High Commissioner hasadvised that he does not think it likely provided we continue to give him our full support.9.        If Seretse were prepared to surrender his claim to the Chieftainship,this would, of course, greatly strengthen Rasebolai&apos;s position.    I do notthink Seretse is likely to do this however.    He told the Parliamentary Under-Secretary last December that he lived in the hope that the Government might change their policy or that, with a change of Government, he might one daybe allowed to return.    Mr. James Griffiths, as leader of the deputation fromthe Executive Committee of the Labour Party which came to see me inAugust, told me that he believed Seretse might be willing to &quot;abdicate&quot; forthe good cf his people.    But he and his colleagues were not prepared toallow me to disclose that I understood from them that this was the case.And in any case he made it clear that Seretse could not be expected to do this until he had had an opportunity to discuss the whole Bamangwato question atthe proposed meeting of tribal leaders in London and until he had been permitted to return to Serowe as Chief in order to make his renunciation among his own people.    These conditions are clearly unacceptable.10.       I have considered the possibility of approaching Seretse myself toascertain whether he had any intention of resigning his claim and would beprepared to do so without returning to Africa.    I am reluctant to do this asit would certainly become known and would be represented as an attempt by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to put pressure on him and as a sign that wewere playing from weakness,    I cannot pretend to be happy about thesituation but I see no alternative to continuing our present policy of giving allpossible support to Rasebolai and of dealing firmly with any attempts to stirup trouble in the Reserve,    A.t the same time we must stand firmly by our decision that Seretse cannot return to Bechuanaland until an alternative chief has been securely established.11.        To put this problem in perspective, the total population of the bechuanaland Protectorate is 300, 000, and the total population of the bamangwato Reserve 100,000;  80, 000 of the latter are subject peoples, whoare indeed affected by this dispute, but only 20, 000 are true Bamangwato whoare directly and intimately concerned.tH.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,2nd December, 1955.
