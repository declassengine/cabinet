THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1955SECRET Copy No. ^8CP. (55) 16629th October, 1955CABINETCOLONIAL immigrants memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs on 15th September the Cabinet invited me to circulate a draft Bill to controlColonial immigration, as a basis for discussion at a later meeting (CM. (55)31st Conclusions, Minute 4). Following the Cabinefs discussion on 6th December,1954, CC. (54) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 7, a draft Bill for this purpose hadalready been prepared and I circulate the Bill and an accompanying memorandum.The Bill includes within its scope all British subjects from overseas, and if it is decided to proceed with it, decisions will be needed on two major questions, viz.(a) whether any legislation to control the immigration of persons not belongingto the United Kingdom should apply to all British subjects from overseas or onlyto those from the Colonies; and (b) whether in either case citizens of the irish republic should also be made subject to control.2. The main argument in favour of confining a control to British subjects from the Colonies is that it is the arrival in the United Kingdom in rapidly increasing numbers in recent years of Colonial immigrants, particularly from theWest Indies, which has given rise to public concern and has created the social problems, mainly housing ones, to which, so long as no control over immigrationcan be exercised, there appears to be no solution; and that to make the controlgeneral would be unnecessary and would cause dismay and resentment in the older Dominions. The main arguments in favour of extending the control to all british subjects from overseas are (a) that while a general control of immigrationcan be effectively defended on principle a limitation to Colonial citizens could notbe so defended, would be vulnerable to attack as a measure of racial discrimination and would be bitterly resented in the West Indies; (b) that a control applyingonly to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies would become increasinglyineffective as Colonies achieved full independence and established their ownseparate citizenships; and (c) that if there is to be any control it would be unwise to exclude from its scope immigration from India and Pakistan which might easilybecome a serious problem. It would presumably be out of the question to extend the control to those two alone of the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth.3. Political objections to excluding citizens of the Irish Republic from animmigration control applying to any class of British subjects are obvious, but thereis a strong case, based on the facts of geography and history as well as on practical considerations, for treating the population of the British Islands as a single unit.The institution of an immigration control on the ordinary traffic between GreatBritain and Ireland, which would be necessary if the control were applied to allcitizens of the Irish Republic, would give rise to great inconvenience and wouldbe much resented by the inhabitants of Northern Ireland who would have to carrypassports.48983 b
4. The Bill which I am circulating would bring within the scope of the controlall British subjects from overseas, i.e., not only inhabitants of the Colonies. as explained in the memorandum attached to the Bill, it would deal with the Irishproblem by excluding from the scope of the control citizens of the Irish Republicordinarily resident in the British Isles, but not those coming here from overseas.G. LL.-G.Home Office, S.W. I,27th October, 1955.
MEMORANDUM ON THE bill. The Bill makes it possible to prohibit the entry into the United Kingdomof any British subject not belonging to the United Kingdom or any citizen of theIrish Republic, subject to certain exceptions. For the purpose of the Bill a british subject would be regarded as belonging to the United Kingdom if he was bornthere or if he is the holder of a United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Manpassport. It is further provided (Clause 1 (2) (b)) that a British subject or citizen of the Republic of Ireland ordinarily resident within Great Britain or Ireland orthe Channel Islands or the Isle of Man shall not be liable to control when travellingto the United Kingdom from anywhere else in that area. The effect of this is totake outside the scope of the restrictions citizens of the Irish Republic ordinarily resident in the Republic when travelling to this country. A citizen of the Republiccoming here from Australia would be liable to control in the same way as a citizen of Australia.2. It would thus not be necessary to set up an immigration control on theordinary traffic between Great Britain and Ireland, but a control could be put proportionate any time if it appeared necessary to prevent British subjects from overseasattempting to come here by way of Ireland.3. It is provided that entry could not be refused to anyone within the scopeof the control if he satisfied the authorities that he was coming only for a temporaryvisit, or to take up authorised employment, or that he was in a position to supporthimself and his dependants in the United Kingdom without taking employment,provided that even if these requirements were satisfied he could still be excludedif he had been convicted of crime and sentenced to a term of imprisonment ofnot less than twelve months, or his entry would be undesirable for medical reasons,or he was a person likely to act to the prejudice of national security or public order, or to promote industrial unrest.4. In view of the housing difficulties caused by unrestricted immigrationprovision has been made in clause 1 (3) (b) for entry to be refused to any person,other than a temporary visitor, who fails to satisfy the Immigration Officer that satisfactory housing is available for himself and his dependents, if any. It wouldprobably be impracticable to devise a completely effective housing control, butit is thought that considerable assistance could be given to housing authorities by requiring immigrants to obtain from a housing authority, in advance oftheir arrival in the United Kingdom, a certificate that satisfactory housing accommodation is available and any Bill giving power to restrict immigrationshould not omit some provision for making it possible to attempt to deal withthis aspect of the problem which is in some ways the most serious at thepresent time.5. It can be argued that once the principle of control is accepted it wouldbe better not to specify in too much detail the classes of persons who should beallowed to enter the United Kingdom as of right, although not belonging to it.The stereotyping of classes in an immigration statute is always liable to causedifficulty, since circumstances arise in which the provisions of the statute areembarrassing. It has nevertheless been thought that it would be likely to makethe measure more acceptable if some indication of the scope of the restrictions to be enforced were incorporated in it. It should be added that a distinction hasbeen preserved between British subjects from overseas and aliens in that all aliensare required by law to obtain leave to land in the United Kingdom while underthis measure no British subject would require leave to land, though certain Britishsubjects would be liable to be prohibited from landing.6. The criterion for determining whether a British subject should beregarded as belonging to the United Kingdom for this purpose is based on birthin the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, or the possessionof a valid passport issued by the Government in those territories, because this is acriterion which can readily be applied by Immigration Officers at the port of entry.The place of birth of the holder of a British passport is always stated in the passport. Any more elaborate criterion conferring a right of exemption fromliability to control related to, for example, residence or domicile would be likelyto create such difficulties at ports as would result in unreasonable delays to the48983 b 2
main body of travellers. The fixing of the criterion set out in the Bill does not,however, mean that persons who do not &quot; belong&quot; to the United Kingdomwithin that definition would necessarily be excluded. For instance, a british subject who could not be regarded as belonging to any other British territory wouldnot in any circumstances be excluded and it would be possible to arrange, ifexperience suggested that this was desirable, for the passports of such people and of other British subjects long resident in the United Kingdom to be so endorsed,when they had once been identified, as to ensure that they would not encounterdifficulty on subsequent journeys.7. The Bill would also give power to deport from this country a British subjector citizen of the Republic of Ireland, unless he had been born within the UnitedKingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, or both of his parents had been resident in any of those territories when he was born, or he had been ordinarily resident for the last previous seven years in any of those areas. While this provisiondoes not on the face of it discriminate between citizens of Commonwealth countries on the one hand and Colonial subjects on the other it would as the british nationality Act, 1948, stands make for unequal treatment because under that Actcitizens of self-governing Commonwealth countries are entitled to be registered ascitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies after one year&apos;s residence here and inthe case of certain Commonwealth countries they lose their original citizenship ifthey so register. The effect in such a case would be to make it impossible to deportthe individual after he had acquired United Kingdom citizenship, because therewould no longer be a country to which he could be deported.8. It would clearly be undesirable in an attempt to overcome this difficulty to reduce to only one year the period of continuous residence in the UnitedKingdom, during which British subjects from overseas would be liable todeportation. An alternative course would be to reduce the period of continuousresidence to five years (which would conform to the practice in certain overseas territories) and at the same time to amend the Act of 1948 by extending the periodof residence in the United Kingdom qualifying for United Kingdom citizenshipto five years, giving the Home Secretary power in his discretion to permitregistration within a shorter period in suitable cases.9. The Bill provides that the circumstances in which the Secretary of Statecould make a Deportation Order are to be specified in the Order in Council. Itwould thus be possible to provide, as in the Aliens Order, simply that the Secretaryof State could make a Deportation Order in any case in which it appeared to himto be conducive to the public good to do so. The effect would be that the Secretaryof State could not be required to state the grounds on which he had acted and his action would not be subject to any kind of judicial review. That would no doubtattract criticism and it may be that such a wide discretion in the Secretary of state would be more easily accepted if provision were made for his action to be taken after judicial enquiry or to be subject to review by some form of judicial process.The wide discretion under the Bill as it stands could also have repercussions in colonial territories. To prevent arbitrary decisions as far as possible in deportationcases in the Colonies, policy in regard to the deportation of British subjects from colonial territories has hitherto aimed at defining by statute, in broad terms, thegrounds on which such individuals could be deported, and by stipulating (withoutaffecting the discretion of the Executive) that, before a deportation order is made,a Judge or Magistrate is to hold an enquiry (if necessary in Chambers) and makea report to the Governor on the facts and on any point of law which may be raised.If no provisions for judicial process were included in the draft United kingdom legislation it would be difficult to resist pressure on the part of Colonial governments to introduce a similarly wide measure of discretion into their own legislation, andconsequently to create the danger of arbitrary deportation of British subjects.10. In the view of the Home Secretary, who would be responsible forexercising these powers, it is, however, most desirable that the power should notbe subject to detailed regulation in the statute and that the Secretary of State shouldhave the wide discretion which the Bill confers. Experience in the case of alienshas shown that it would be difficult to draft detailed provisions covering the wide variety of cases which may arise, and there are a small proportion of cases in whichit would be contrary to the public interest that the Secretary of State should haveto specify the grounds on which he is acting. A provision which set out in detail the grounds on which Deportation Orders could be made would thus be
unsatisfactory in practice, and a most inconvenient precedent. The wide discretionconferred on the Secretary of State by the Aliens Order has been the subject of criticism from time to time, but it is fair to say that this criticism derives most of itsforce from the suggestion that the Secretary of State by his exercise of this powercan expel from the country at his sole discretion an alien who may have been resident here many years and whose interests and associations may be mainly withthis country, and the fact that it is very rare for the power of deportation to beexercised in such circumstances is not a complete answer. Under this Bill theSecretary of State would not in any case be able to deport an individual who hadbeen resident in this country for seven years (or five years if the proposal inparagraph 8 above is adopted), and in the Home Secretary&apos;s view that, and thefact that the Secretary of State&apos;s actions can be challenged in Parliament at anytime, is sufficient safeguard of the rights of the individual.
