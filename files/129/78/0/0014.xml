(THIS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 16426th October, 1955CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of education on 4th October, 1955 (C. M. (55) 34th Conclusions, Minute 2) we were authorised to discuss with representatives of the teachers and the localauthorities the proposals for a new teachers1 superannuation scheme outlined in C. P. (55) 13 8.    We have now done this.2.        The local authorities were ready to accept the Governments offeras a whole, some of them on the understanding that it would form part of an agreed settlement and be enacted in a non-controversial Bill,    We do notthink that they would oppose our proposals in the House whatever the line taken by the teachers^3.        The teachers&apos; representatives would not commit themselves withoutfurther consultation with their constituents.    They are not likely to expresssupport for the offer, but their leaders appreciate that it includes very biggains for the teachers, especially stability in the rate of contribution.    Ifthey oppose the settlement we do not think that their opposition will be asstrong or as strongly supported as it was in the case of the 1954 Bill,4.        The teachers are very keen to have additional benefits for widows and orphans.    The 1954 Bill, if enacted, would have allowed teachers to allocate a part of existing benefits to their dependants, thus giving them a choice which they do not have at present.    The local authorities made it quite clear that they would not accept a proposal for additional benefits for widows and orphans such as would require additional contributions from employers.    We do not think it reasonable to press the localauthorities in this matter.5,        We therefore propose, if our colleagues agree, to preparelegislation on the lines suggested in C.P. (55) 138.J .S.DJE.COPY NO.25th October, 1955.
