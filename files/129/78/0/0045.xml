Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1955SECRET Copy No. 62CP. (55) 1959th December, 1955CABINETOVERSEAS INFORMATION expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am sorry to have to ask the Cabinet to consider once again the mountingtotal of expenditure on overseas information services. This must be read againstthe background of my recent paper on overseas expenditure (CP. (55) 184). Evenrecently we have added to our overseas expenditure.2. The Estimates figures for overseas information expenditure in recent years have been as follows:  -&apos; Si    WS St. &apos; \  1951-52.........      10,184,000     (plus subsequent supple-mentary of  100,000 forthe B.B.C.)1952-53.........       9,928,5001953-54.........       9,976,7501954-55.......      10,231,7001955-56.........      10,495,9503. The Estimates for next year as submitted to the Treasury show an increase over those for the current year of not far short of  2 million or 18 per cent., asthe following figures show:  V        &apos;  &apos;  (a) Original Estimates for 1955-56 .........      10,495,950ib) Add Possible Supplementary for  B.B.C.

Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th December, 1955.This increase, in one year, is five times the annual increases contemplated by theCommittee under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor which considered how the Drogheda Report might be implemented. And it would be optimistic to assume that in the course of next year, quite apart from any further rises in costs, newservices will not be proposed involving still further expenditure.4. I do not dispute that, taken individually, most of the items contributing to this big increase in the total expenditure are desirable and that they would nothave been proposed if it had not been felt that we should get some return forthem. Nevertheless when we consider, first, the large prospective increase in bothdefence and civil expenditure next year and, secondly, the paramount need (on balance-of-payments grounds) to restrict our overseas expenditure to a minimum,there can be no doubt that an increase of 18 per cent, in overseas informationexpenditure in one year is excessive.5. There is a natural tendency, when new services are proposed in this field,simply to add them on to all the existing services. It seems to me that, when it is desired, as a matter of urgency and high priority, to embark on large additional expenditure in new directions, a very serious effort should be made to cover as muchas possible of that expenditure by savings on services which, ex hypothesi, must beof less urgency and lower priority. The services to be curtailed would be eitherexisting services or expansions and additions contemplated before the new, more urgent service was proposed.The extra cost of  560,000 shown in paragraph 3 above for Middle East items,which was agreed by the Cabinet as a matter of great urgency, is a case in point.Although the Cabinet decided that this should be covered, at least to some extent,by savings on other services, I am advised that the Foreign Office see no prospectof being able to do this.  I cannot agree that the matter should be left there.6. I do not think it would be profitable for the Cabinet itself to attempt todecide in detail where economies should be made. But I would ask that we should decide on a round figure as the maximum total expenditure on overseas information services in 1956-57 and instruct the Departments concerned to allocate that figureamong the various services, existing and proposed, by reference to some assessment of their relative priorities.7. As to what the total figure should be, it seems to me that, in presentcircumstances, it would be making generous provision for this expenditure if we decided that the estimate for next year should be about 10 per cent, above theoriginal estimate for the current year. I therefore ask the Cabinet to decide thatthe total provision for overseas information expenditure in 1956-57 should be 11,550,000.R. A. B.
