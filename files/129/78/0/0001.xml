THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MA.TESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    67CP. (55) 15114th October, 1955CABINETCANALSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation on 12th October the Home Affairs Committee invited me to submit the composition of an independent Committee of Enquiry into the system of inland waterways for the consideration of the Cabinet (H.P. (55) 12th Meeting, Item 5).2. The point for decision is whether the proposed enquiry should be smalland expert or large and partly representative in composition.3. In general I share the view which was expressed by some of my colleaguesat the Home Affairs Committee meeting that small bodies of independent andintelligent people are better for ascertaining the truth about a subject than arelarge and representative ones.4. The object, however, in the present case is not primarily to ascertain thefacts. There have been a number of enquiries into this and the facts are wellknown. My main purpose in proposing such a Committee is to create a climateof opinion in which it may be possible to make some progress in the very difficult situation which now exists. This is, briefly, that the British Transport commission were saddled by the 1947 Transport Act with a large number of canals whichwill never be of the slightest use for transport purposes, but which other interests are very keen to see maintained for their purposes at the expense of the Commission.These interests can make it virtually impossible, to use the existing procedure forclosing or abandoning canals, and no other body, including those which benefit from the canals, is prepared to take them over.5. I therefore regard it as essential to the main purpose of setting up this enquiry that it should include responsible and respected representatives of theinterests concerned or alternatively persons so closely connected with those interests as to command their respect. In my view it is only by obtainingrecommendations supported by at any rate a number of these representatives that it will be possible either for the Government or for the Commission to takethe steps which expert opinion recognises as necessary. We already have the reportof a highly expert body, the Rusholme Board of Survey, on over three-quarters ofthe canals in the system. But that has cut no ice at all with the interests concerned.6. I fully appreciate the risk involved in a composition of this sort, of one ormore minority reports. I hope however to minimise this by the appointment of astrong Chairman and a number of good independent members. Equally, while Iwould wish to appoint people closely concerned with the more responsible interests involved, I would not propose to include representatives of purely propagandistbodies.7. After thinking over the discussion in the Home Affairs Committee I remainfirmly of the view that the main purpose of appointing a Committee of Enquirywill only be served if its composition is on something of the lines suggested in theappendix to H.P. (55) 63, attached. I would add that these proposals were putforward after consultation with the other Departments directly concerned, whowere indeed good enough to make suggestions as to appropriate representatives ofthe interests with which they were concerned.J. A. B-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,13th October, 1955.48911
