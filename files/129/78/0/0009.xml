7&amp;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 159 COPY NO.19th October, 1955CABINETTHE SAAR REFERENDUMMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHistorical introduction the Saar formed part of the Zone of Occupation allotted in1945 to the French Government, who with British and United Statesacquiescence took various steps to cut it off from the rest of their Zone,and to bring it into a special relationship with France.2.       Elections to a Saar Landtag were held in October, 1947 on abasis laid down by the French Occupying Power in consultation with a constitutional commission consisting of Saarlanders nominated by them.The constitutional commission then submitted to the new Landtag a draft constitution which was approved in November, 1947.    It provided that france should be responsible for the defence of the Saar and the representation of its interests abroad, while a democratically constitutedSaar Government should be autonomous in internal affairs.    HerrHoffmann, who had formed the first Saar Government after the 1947elections, was again returned to power in the next Landtag elections ofNovember, 1952.    The recently formed pro-German parties were not allowed to take part in the elections of 1952 or to engage in other political activities.    During this phase a separate Saar nationality was created by a law of the Landtag passed on 15th July, 1948, and the territory*economic links with France were tightened up.3.       Negotiations between the French and German Governmentsbegan in February, 1952, to try to find a mutually satisfactory modificationof the present regime, and these led ultimately to the Franco-german agreement of 23rd October, 1954, embodying the Saar Statute.    a subsequent Franco-German agreement of June, 1955, provided that the production-German parties would be free to take part in the campaign for the referendum on the Statute, which is to be held on 23rd October, 1955.4,       Her Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, during the period after the war supported the French view that the Saar should be politicallydetached from Germany and economically linked with France, subject always to the final peace settlement.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government didhowever avoid giving any very directly binding and formal commitment in this sense.    It is thus open to us, if we wish, to argue from theprinciple of rebus sic stantibus that, since our general assurances of support were given in the years immediately after the war, there havebeen new factors to be taken into account, most notably the necessity to consider the wishes of the Saar population.    This principle has been
emphasised in recent statements by Her Majesty&apos;s Government (e. g.the Prime Minister&apos;s reply to a Parliamentary Question on 9th March).It is also embodied in the Saar Statute and is thus endorsed by theFrench and German Governments.Situation if the Referendum goesagainst the Statute5.        Although the French remain confident of a positive vote, otherobservers in the Saar agree that a negative majority is more likely.If so, the Sranco-German Agreement of 23rd October, 1954, will fall tothe ground, and the legal situation will revert to that set out in paragraph2 above.6.        The French have made it clear that they intend to stand on that position.    Similarly Herr Hoffmann has said that if the Statute is rejected his Government will not be bound to hold further elections untilthe present Landtag1 s normal term, i. e. 1957.    The pro-German parties in the Saar are however unlikely to take this lying down, and still less to submit tamely to being suppressed, and having their newspapers closed down, as Herr Hoffmann might claim that he was legally entitled to do aspart of the return to the status quo ante.    We should thus have a positionof deadlock, with the majority of the Saar population indignantly opposedto their Government, but lacking any means of constitutional self-expressionuntil the Landtag elections of 1957.    In these circumstances the incitementwhich can be expected from non-official German organisations acrossthe border would create an explosive situation, with possibilities of strikes, unrest and violence.7.        Since however the French have now vetoed the sending of aninternational police force, there will be nothing but French troops leftto help the inadequate Saar police keep order in the territory.    The french would be perfectly within their rights under the Franco-Saar convention of 1953 if, in response to a request from the Saar Government, they sentin troops to keep order.    The French Ambassador here has said thithey would in fact do so in an emergency.8.        The use of French troops against Saarlanders would cause astrong emotional reaction in the Federal Republic.    We might thus find ourselves with the beginnings of a major Franco-German row just whenthe Geneva Conference was starting, i. e. at the moment when the unity of the Western side was especially important, and moreover at a timewhen diplomatic relations between Moscow and Bonn were on the point ofbeing established.9.        In the event of a negative vote in the Referendum it is thereforeclear that.speed will be an essential factor, i. e, it will be more useful to.arrive quickly at a provisional solution which will lower the politicaltemperature than to try and go straight to a radical solution which will inevitably take time to find.10.      The view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, publicly expressed ona number of occasions, is that the Saar question is primarily one for direct Franco-German negotiation.    As, however, such negotiation is most unlikely to yield quick results in the circumstances expected afterthe Referendum, my colleagues may feel that the United Kingdom shouldbe ready to take a prompt initiative as soon as it becomes clear that the vote has gone against the Statute.    A serious difficulty in these       1
U2-circumstances however is that we dare not risk discussion with the Frenchand Germans or even with our other European allies before the vote for fear of leakages which might have an adverse effect on its result,11,      In any such initiative we should I think be guided by two main principles.    We should find some legal means of re-establishing the link between the Saar and Western European Union which would haveexisted had the Statute been adopted.    This might involve giving the saar a European status similar to that envisaged in the Statute, butsubject to review after a fixed period, say five years, instead of beingtied to the Greek Kalends of a German peace treaty.    It might alsoentail the continuation of the Referendum Commission in being for aperiod, or the early appointment to the Saar of a European Commissionerwith approximately the same powers as the Commissioner providedfor in the Statute (foreign affairs, defence and certain internal functions).12.      Secondly there should be adequate safeguards for democratic principles in the Saar.    This means that the pro-German parties and newspapers should not be suppressed, provided that they themselvespreserve the democratic decencies, and that free elections for a newLandtag should be held at a very early date instead of waiting for 1957as would otherwise normally be the case.13.      No solution based on these principles will be at all welcome to the French.    The essence of the problem will be to convince themthat some such answer is far better for France than any of the otheralternatives.    In view of the present internal situation in France, weshould be deluding ourselves if we expected to be able to reach a definitive agreement on the Saar with any French Government likely tobe formed before the elections to the National Assembly due next spring.The immediate problem will therefore be to find some means of holdingthe situation.    Even after the French elections any compromise solution would be bound to encounter very serious difficulties both in Paris andin Saarbrucken,    Nevertheless I consider that the two principles whichI have set out above are the most useful signposts for action, and I shouldbe grateful for discretion from my colleagues to proceed in that sense.\Situation if the Referendum favoursthe Statute14.      The position after a positive vote will be simpler, particularlyin view of Kerr Hoffmann&apos;s announcement that the Landtag electionsforeseen in the Statute will in fact be held as early as 4th December,True there will be a danger that the pro-German parties^ disappointedat the result of the Referendum, and unwilling to wait for the Landtagelections to register their disapproval of Herr Hoffmann, may proceedto more or less violent action.    Here again the absence of an inter-national police force will mean that French troops might have to inter-vene if the Saar police cannot maintain order.    This would be likely toundo most of the good to Franco-German relations resulting from a successful adoption of the Statute.15.      An important safeguard would be the installation of a EuropeanCommissioner at saarbrucken as soon as the Referendum results are confirmed with authority to act on behalf of Western European Union tokeep the situation calm.
16.      As my colleagues will recall, it is laid down in paragraph 8of the Saar Statute that the Federal German and French Governmentsnot only bind themselves to maintain and guarantee the Statute until thepeace treaty, but that they will also ask Her A^-ajesty^ Government andthe United States Government to assume the same obligations.    We areat present in consultation witn the United States Government about a form of words in which such a guarantee could be given, should theFrench and German Governments request it.    If the vote is in fact a positive one, I will of course be consulting my colleagues again on thispoint.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.I.19th October, 1955.
