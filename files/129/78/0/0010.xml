(C.M.(55) 35th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. This reference will have to be related to the statement as awhole, which I have not yet had time to complete.    However, I would propose to include in it a few sentences, broadly on the following lines:&quot;The Government recognise that thelevel of rents of Council houses and thatof comparable privately-owned houses areinter-related.    We have, therefore, decidedto review the whole structure of the RentActs, with a view to considering what changes are desirable in the existing system of rent control.    We shall announce our conclusions in due course&quot;.Subsidies for &quot;Overspill&quot;3. Following upon a meeting which I had yesterday withrepresentatives of some of the large congested cities (London, Birmingham,Manchester, etc. ) my attention has been drawn to the fact that an amend -ment is necessary to the Annex to my Paper on housing subsidies(C.P.(55) 155).    At the end of the first sentence in paragraph 2(c) thefollowing words should be added:&quot;or for houses provided by the localauthority of a congested area as part ofan especially large scheme for the accommodation of its overspill population in some other area (other than development on the fringe of the congested city itself)&quot;.D.S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government,S.W.1.19th October, 1955.
