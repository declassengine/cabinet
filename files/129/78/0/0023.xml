It has beensuggested that figures after tax should also be given. In so far as thiswas attempted, the result would make the comparison even less favourable to dividends over the period 1938-54 taken as a whole; butit might also provoke the charge that the reductions in direct taxation inthe last two or three years have given proportionately greater relief todividends than to wages and salaries. In any case, however, it isimpossible to compute accurately what tax is actually paid ondividends. A comparison on a &quot; before tax &quot; basis seems, therefore,the only practicable one.id) Section VI of the draft contains the real essence of the White Paper, andexpounds the lesson of the last ten years which we are asking thecommunity to apply in the period ahead. I think it is right, and valuable, that the text should recognise the inevitability of productivityrising faster in some sectors of the economy than in others. But it follows that, in those sectors where the increase in productivity is mostsubstantial and most rapid, neither capital nor labour can expect to extract, and to share between themselves, the whole of those increases;they must allow some part of them to accrue to the benefit of thecommunity as a whole (including themselves) in the form of lower prices unless there is to be either an increase of prices or a distortion ofthe relativities of wages between industries which might be more thanthe workers would tolerate and would be economically disruptive in its effects. This doctrine is sound as a matter of economics, and is not likely, in itself, to be disputed. But we must realise that its implications in terms of the wage earnings of workers in individual industries which may reflect very differing rates of productivity increase maynot be entirely welcome; and that it may be asserted that we are asking the workers (and, for that matter, the investors also) in the highproductivity sectors of the economy to assist (or, as they may say, to subsidise) the rest of the community. The draft does not, of course,elicit this point explicitly. But the point is there; and we must beprepared to have it taken^ and to defend our doctrine both as a matterof economics and by reference to the contribution which price stabilitycan make to the national interest as a whole.R.

draft the IMPLICATIONS of full EMPLOYMENTPresented by the to parliament by Command of Her majesty december 1955
\oTHE IMPLICATIONS OF FULL EMPLOYMENTL introduction. The White Paper on Employment Policy (Cmd. 6527), issued by the coalition Government in May 1944, set out the policies to be pursued afterthe war to maintain a high and stable level of employment and to combinethis with a rising standard of living. These policies have been applied with considerable success. Full employment has, in fact, been maintained in mostparts of the country over practically the whole of the past ten years, andwe are to-day consuming more as a nation than we have ever done before.But full emploment has brought with it one problem to which we have notyet found a satisfactory solution : yet, unless we do find the solution, itwill be more difficult to achieve a further advance in living standards, and full employment itself may be threatened. The problem is that of continuallyrising prices. It affects everyone, and everyone must contribute if it is tobe solved. The purpose of this White Paper is first to focus attention on it, analysing its causes and explaining its dangers, and then to suggest what will have to be done by the Government and people of this country ifreasonable price stability is in future to be maintained.II. Full Employment since 19452. In the years immediately before the war the average rate ofunemployment in the United Kingdom was 8-9 per cent. Since the war ithas never (except for a few weeks in 1947) exceeded 3 per cent. For mostof the period 1945-55 it has been under 2 per cent.; and it is now littlemore than 1 per cent. These figures are for the country as a whole.Unemployment in Northern Ireland and some other areas has remainedappreciably above the national average, but has still been much lower than before the war.3. The maintenance of full employment has been accompanied by a rapid increase in production. Since 1946 the national output of goods and services has risen by 25 per cent.; industrial production alone has risen by50 per cent. But only part of this increase has been available for improvingliving standards, because there were other, more urgent, claims on our resources to be met in the immediate post-war years. We had to devoteour efforts to making good the physical damage and destruction of thewar, to overtaking the arrears of capital investment, and to restoring our overseas earnings, which had been seriously run down during the war.Moreover, we needed much larger exports than before the war, partly becauseimport prices had risen more than export prices, and partly because we had lost a large proportion of our pre-war income from overseas investments.These difficulties had been only partially overcome when,, in 1950, the out-break of war in Korea and the growing international tension compelledus to undertake a substantial programme of rearmament. In the past twoyears or so, however, the individual consumer has become the main directbeneficiary of the increase in production.4. If we take full advantage of the opportunities open to us,: thereis every prospect that we shall be able to secure a further big improvementin our living standards in the years ahead. We are on the eve of I greattechnical advances in the application of nuclear energy and electronics to industrial processes. Under the stimulus of full employment new attitudesto production are developing on both sides of industry and increasingattention is being paid to raising standards of technical training and education. . The possibilities of economic progress and the importanceof productivity command a greater understanding and a wider degree of
acceptance than they did ten years ago. As new techniques of production are developed, more efficient methods of work are introduced, and thebenefits of rising investment are felt, we can look forward with confidence to a continuing expansion of our capacity to produce; and this risingproductive capacity will provide the means for a further progressive improve-ment of our standard of living. It is right that we should look forward tothis possibility: the ultimate objective of economic expansion is to satisfy the natural desire of mankind to enjoy a fuller life, in terms of security and happiness, leisure, and the fulfilment of personal hopes and ambitions.But a sustained growth of the economy is no less essential to enable us todischarge our duties as a major political and industrial Power, to sustain our commitments in many parts of the world, and to contribute to economic development overseas.5. The future growth of production in this country must, of course, beaffected by what happens in other parts of the world. A nation which isas dependent as the United Kingdom on overseas trade could not hope tomaintain the full momentum of economic expansion in the face of a severeor prolonged recession in the rest of the world. But all member countries of the United Nations are committed, under the United Nations Charter,to mantain full employment; and in the past decade the majority of theindustrial countries have succeeded in doing so. A growing recognition ofthe truth that prosperity is indivisible has found practical expression in the readiness of countries to co-operate in policies designed to ensure a high and expanding volume of world trade, and these policies have proved remarkablyeffective, as is shown by the fact that, apart from a minor set-back in 1952,the volume of world trade has been rising steadily, year by year, ever since theend of the war.6. But whatever other countries do, the rate of progress which we shallachieve, and the increase in living standards which we shall attain, will depend mainly on our own enterprises and our own efforts. It is not sufficientthat we should have the capacity simply to produce more. We must be ableto produce and sell abroad enough exports to pay for essential imports offood and industrial materials and at the same time to meet the cost of our overseas capital commitments and to build up the reserves. This meansproducing the kind of goods our overseas customers want, at prices they are willing to pay. In the increasingly competitive conditions which have developed in world markets in the last few years, continally rising costs and prices in this country must inevitably weaken the whole basis of our exporttrade; and if we do not export enough, we shall be unable either to support a steady expansion of production at home or to maintain full employment.Quite apart therefore from the serious economic and social strains theycreate, rising prices endanger the full realisation of the possibilities of economic progress, and it must be one of our major objectives to maintain in future amuch greater degree of price stability than has been achieved in the past ten years.III.-Prices Since 19457. The White Paper of 1944 did not foresee the extent to which full employment was to be associated with rapidly rising prices. Between 1946and 1954 the prices of the final output of goods and services of all kindsincreased by nearly 50 per cent.* Apart from the relatively minor effects of changes in subsidies and indirect taxation, which are dealt with inparagraph 10, these prices are determined partly by the prices of our imports and partly by our own costs of production.   These costs of production are* A definition of this price index, and index numbers showing changes in costs and prices between 1946 and 1954 is given in the Appendix.3;49076 n*
themselves determined by the incomes of those who produce the goods and services at each stage of the productive process in other words, by wagesand salaries and profits. Increases in incomes need not necessarily lead torises in costs and prices; but they do so whenever they outrun the growth of production, that is, whenever labour costs and profit margins rise per unit of output.8. The level of incomes depends on the balance of supply and demandthroughout the economic system as a whole. If demand is significantly inexcess of the supplies available to meet it, the pressure of demand will itselfcontribute to forcing up prices. Prices can also be forced up by pressure:for higher incomes even when the level of demand is not excessive. But,generally speaking, the higher the level of demand in relation to supply, theeasier it becomes to obtain larger money incomes and to pass on anyresultant increases in costs in the form of higher prices.9.   The history of prices since the war falls broadly into four phases:  (i) The immediate legacy of the war was an accumulation of demand,combined with a shortage of goods due to the dislocation of pro-duction. World prices therefore rose sharply, and from 1946-1948the average prices of our imports increased by 25 per cent. this increase would, if it had been the only factor at work, have raised theaverage level of our final prices by about 5 per cent. But it was accompanied by excessive demand inside this country and by wide-spread pressure for higher incomes; and because this increase in incomes outstripped the growth of output, costs of production rose,the rise being reflected in an increase not of 5 per cent., but of 15 percent., in the average level of prices.(ii) In 1948 the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices(Cmd. 7321) set out the dangers of further price rises. During 1948and 1949 incomes did not increase much faster than output, and costs of production were therefore considerably more stable. Sinceat the same time world supplies were becoming more plentiful, import prices also were rising less fast. As a result, our own final prices roserelatively little (by 3 per cent, between the two years 1948 and 1949).(iii) This period of comparative stability was ended by the act of devaluation of sterling in September 1949, which followed the weakening of the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments in that year.One of the ultimate causes of that devaluation was the earlier post-war rise in prices; and one of the consequences was a marked risein import prices, measured in sterling. Then, in 1950, the KoreanWar provoked a fresh outburst of world demand, particularly for primary products; and import prices rose sharply. This resulted ina rise in retail prices in this country, which itself initiated a demandfor compensating increases in incomes. These increased incomesadded substantially to costs, because at;that time it was proving,difficult to incease output: shortage of steel retarded production in1951. and the lower levels of home and overseas: demand for textiles,clothing and other consumer goods, which-were in part a reaction from the conditions created by the Korean War, led to an actual fallin output in 1952. In the event, our final prices rose by 23 per cent-.,,between 1949 and 1952.(iv) The reduction in the food subsidies and changes in indirect taxesin 1952 added a little to. prices in the latter part of that year and inthe early months of 1953. But after 1952 the growth of production was resumed, and during the whole of that year arid the first partof 1954 import prices were falling.  At home, however, incomes were
. ,.. ,. rising rather faster than output. The fall in import prices, was sufficiently large to offset the rise in home costs, and during most. of 1953 and.the first half of 1954 prices were very stable. Betweenthe years 1952 and 1954 final prices rose by under 2 per cent.   But..... after the middle of 1954 import prices began to rise again, whilethe upward trend of home costs became more rapid. The combinedresult has been the renewed upward pressure on costs and prices which has continued into 1955.10. This brief summary of the course of our final prices in the past,ten years has inevitably compressed into a few paragraphs a highly complexprocess.   But there are certain features which stand out: -(a) Since 1946 the prices of the final output of goods and services ofall kinds have risen by about 50 per cent. Of this increase about one-eighth is attributable to the net effect of changes in subsidies and indirect taxes. The remaining seven-eighths have been determinedby movements in import prices and in our own costs of production.(b) Since 1946 the prices of our imports of goods and services have risen by over 60 per cent., partly as a result of the devaluation of sterling in 1949. In the same period money incomes per unit of output haveincreased by about 40 per cent. But for the economy as a whole ourown costs of production, as measured by money incomes per unit of output, are between four and five times as important as import prices in terms of their effect on final prices. Thus, although the risein import prices has been greater than the rise in our own costs ofproduction, it is the latter which have been responsible for by far thegreater part of the increase in our final prices.(c) Although over the years 1946 to 1954 as a whole import prices have risen by over 60 per cent., they have fluctuated considerably duringthis period, sometimes rising and sometimes falling. Whenever theyhave risen, they have not only added directly to our price level, butalso initiated demands for higher incomes, the result of which hasbeen greatly to magnify the immediate impact on the price level ofthe rise in import prices themselves. This process has provedirreversible; and it is this which has established, from time to time,a new, and permanently higher, level of prices in this country. that level has never fallen when import prices have fallen, because the gain from lower import prices has been more than offset by the risingtrend of incomes and costs at home.11. Much of the rise in prices in the United Kingdom since the war has been due to the quite abnormal world conditions which were associatedfirst with recovery from the war and subsequently with events in Korea;and our own experience has been shared in varying degrees by most other industrial countries. But these same tendencies have also shown themselvesin this country to a greater extent than in many other countries duringthe past eighteen months when more normal conditions of peacetime full employment have prevailed. That is what gives ground for concern. for if these tendencies persist, and incomes go on rising faster than output overthe&apos; economy as a whole, full employment will continue to be associatedwith rising prices and with all the consequent economic and social strainswhich are discussed in Section V.IV. Changes in the Distribution of Incomei 12. Thus, of the factors which determine the level of final prices themost important is,.our own costs of production, that is, our own incomes and
productivity. It is not possible to analyse the extent to which changes in,different categories of income have contributed to the increases in costs ofproduction, and so to the rise in prices discussed above. . But the relativemovements of these categories of income over a period of years are ofobvious relevance and public interest.  They are shown in Table 1.Table 1Changes in Incomes before Tax	  million	Index numbers (1938 = 100)	Shares in to,al domestic incomes^) (Per cent.)Wages and salaries 1938       ......... 1948       ......... 1954       .........	2,830 6,140 9,265	100 217 327	58 58 59Income from self-employment(2) 1938       ......... 1948       ...... 1954       ...      ......	64.7 1,328 1,645	100 205 254	13 13 11Gross trading profits of companies and public enterprises(3) 1938       ......... 1948       ......... 1954       .........	764 2,018 3,005	100 264 393	16 19 19Gross trading profits of companies(3) 1938       ......... 1948       ......... 1954       .........	690 1,790 2,560	...(-*)	14 17 16Gross trading profits of public enterprises(3) 1938       ...... 1948       ......... 1954       .........	74 228 445	-(4)	2 2 3(l) Before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation.

Over the period 1948to 1954, while consumer prices rose by one-quarter, wages and salaries and dividends both increased by about 50 per cent. Taking the period 1938-1954as a whole, wages and salaries have increased by very much more thandividends. But in the last few years dividends have increased rather faster than wages and salaries. .* The price index used for these calculations covers prices of consumers&apos; goods and services of all kinds (Item 5 in.the Appendix).      , ,    , misitcent. The balance of about 15 per cent, consisted of a ,variety of other types of interest payments, together with payment of taxes abroad. In both1948 and 1954 dividends took a little over 20 per cent, of total companyincome; taxes accounted for about 30 per cent.; nearly 40 per cent,was set aside to provide for depreciation and stock appreciation charges orput to reserve; and the balance of some 10. per cent. was. absorbed by theother items.16. Dividend payments by companies constitute about 5 per cent, ofthe total of incomes analysed in Table 1, and their relevance to the movementof prices lies much less in their direct effect on the level of incomes than inthe pressure which they are liable to. generate for what are felt to becorresponding adjustments of wages and salaries. Table 3 compares themovement of dividends over the period 1938-1948-1954 with the movementof wages and salaries. The figures for wages and salaries are the same asthose in Table 1 and cover all incomes of this kind, in whatever industry or occupation they are earned. Corresponding changes for dividend payments;cannot, however, be calculated directly from Table 2 because the coverageof the figures in that table is affected by successive acts of nationalisation anddenationalisation. To ensure the same coverage throughout, the estimatesused in Table 3 are those of dividends paid on ordinary and preference sharesby companies which have not been nationalised at any time during the period1938 to 1954.Table 3
V.-Price Stability and Economic Progress18. Earlier sections of this paper have referred to the possibility of future economic expansion, and have discussed the forces which have madefor rising prices since 1945. Unless the upward pressure of rising money incomes on prices is moderated, the economy is likely to be exposed to serious and increasing strains. These strains, if not relieved, will prevent us from realising the full potentialities of economic growth and may well lead to unemployment by making it more difficult to pay for our imports.19. Our overseas earnings must be increased if we are to pay for theimports needed to sustain an expanding economy, to provide for overseas investment and to build up our reserves. The necessary expansion of exports will depend for its realisation on two factors first, a continuinggrowth of production and trade throughout the world; second, our ownability to secure a sufficient share of this growing trade. The governments policies are directed, in co-operation with the Governments of many othercountries, to securing the maximum expansion of trade and to creatingconditions in which this trade can flow freely. But no efforts of government alone can ensure that this country reaps the fullest advantage from theexpansion of world trade.20. An adequate volume of exports will depend above all upon the competitive strength of our goods in overseas markets. That strength isitself the outcome of many factors the quality of the product, promptnessof delivery, effective salesmanship, good after-sales service, and so forth.But the basic factor is price. If our prices and our costs of productionmove seriously out of line with those of our competitors, our exports willbe inadequate to the needs of our balance of payments, and our currencywill not retain its value in world markets.21. Competition in overseas markets is keen; and this country no longerenjoys the pre-eminent position which it held during the last century. To-day we have to match our selves against formidable rivals, not only in foreing markets, but in the Commonwealth as well. The dislocation caused by thewar left the United States of America the only important source of supply for many goods; and the United States&apos; share of world trade in manufactureshas risen from about 20 per cent, in 1937 to more than 25 per cent, to-day.As against Western Germany we enjoyed a considerable advantage in theyears immediately after the war; even as late as 1950, her share of worldexports was little more than 7 per cent. To-day it is more than doublethat figure. In the same five years the total volume of world trade inmanufactures has risen by about 30 per cent.; but our own share has fallen from over 25 per cent, to about 20 per cent.22. A country&apos;s share of world trade is affected by many factors apartfrom its competitive power, and too much weight should not be attached tothe precise percentage at any single point in time. But a continuingdownward trend in the share must inevitably be a cause of concern if itreflects the fact that exports are hot increasing sufficiently to meet a growing import bill and to finance other external commitments. Such a situation cannot be allowed to remain uncorreeted.23. A weakening of the balance of payments is the most obvious and immediate consequence of a disproportionate rise in costs and prices. but such a rise, if it persists, has other, and no less serious, effects at home. Thefuture growth of the economy will depend upon a sustained expansion of investment;  and the rate of investment which we can afford will depend
on our willingness to save. The full effect of continually rising prices onsavings is unpredictable; but it is clear that they can progressively undermine the whole relationship between borrower and lender and thus the acceptedstructure of savings. That structure rests, to a considerable extent, on the willingness of the lender to hold, for long periods, titles to fixed sums inthe form of Savings Certificates, Government securities, insurance policies,Debenture stock, arid so forth. This willingness itself derives from a basicconfidence that money will broadly retain its value. In so far, as rising prices impair this confidence and thereby reduce people&apos;s willingness to save,the - financing of investment becomes more difficult and more expensive,industrial development is retarded, and the pressure on prices is accentuated.24. But the effects of a rising price level have a much more direct andmore immediately personal impact. Continually rising prices are an obvioussocial evil. For many people this evil is obscured by the fact that they eitherare, or believe themselves to be, able to secure increases in their incomes to offset the rise in prices; and although their pressure for higher incomes itselfadds to the pressure on prices and they do not in fact, gain very much fromthe rise in incomes, at least they do not lose very much from the rise inprices. Even so, the spiral of rising incomes and prices is a cause ofconsiderable personal anxiety and of an acute sense of social unfairness. Thedifficulties and hardships inherent in such a situation bear most heavily on those dependent on fixed incomes, who are in continual danger of having their standard of living progressively reduced. The longer this processcontinues, the more arbitrary its effects appear, and the more sharply the sense of injustice is felt.VI.-The Conditions of Price Stability25. The Government is pledged to foster conditions in which the nationcan, if it so wills, realise its full potentialities for growth in terms of productionand living standards. But the Government must no less seek to ensure thatthe pressure of domestic demand does not reach a level at which it threatensprice stability and endangers the balance of payments. To maintain full employment without inflation necessarily involves continual adjustments. at times the pressure of demand will grow too strong and will need curbing:at other times this pressure will be weak, and the economy will need a stimulus. It is the Governments job to keep the pressure right, and adjust-ments will have to be made from time to time in fiscal, monetary and socialpolicies in order to achieve this result. But the ultimate aim will alwaysremain essentially the same the encouragement, by all the means which theGovernment commands, of the general climate most favourable to themaximum development of a balanced economy.26. One of the essential conditions of full employment is the maintenanceof a high and steadily rising level of demand. It is in such circumstances that the pressure of incomes on costs and prices is likely to grow most rapidly and to meet with least resistance. Price stability, in so far as it is determinedby factors under our own control, is therefore largely a function of productivity and self-discipline; and full employment will only be accompanied by price stability if both sides of industry play their part.27. The achievement of a sustained increase in productivity calls forcontributions from both management and labour. Management must striveto ensure the maximum expansion of output by progressive investment in themost efficient capital assets, by the introduction of the most modern industrialtechniques and by the elimination of all restrictive practices which inhibit the
economic growth of production. The contribution of labour lies in co-operating to the full in the adoption of new methods of working and insetting aside all practices which, however much they may have been justifiedin the past as means of safeguarding status, conditions of work, or the securityof employment itself, are not appropriate in conditions of full employment.. .28. The healthy functioning of the economy and the progressive growth of its output depend also on co-operation within industry in maintainingan efficient and enlightened system of industrial relations. The relationship between management and workers which this implies is a vital but intangiblefactor which only they can create by common effort. It demands a fulland frank exchange of opinion and information at all levels between representatives who have confidence in each other&apos;s competence and integrity.If this confidence is achieved and maintained, the gain, in terms both of physical output and of human relations, can be incalculable. If not, the resulting discontent and friction will impede production and hamper exports,thereby discrediting British industry abroad as well as at home.29. Efficient methods of work and sound industrial relations should result in a sustained growth of productivity, yielding economic production and competitive prices. How well off we are as a nation depends not on themoney incomes we earn, but on the goods and services we produce; and as individuals it is what we can buy with our pay rather than the pay itselfwhich determines our standard of living. Price reductions can thereforecontribute to raising our standard of living just as much as increases in money incomes, and so far as practicable it is through price reductions thatwe should aim to enjoy the benefits of higher productivity. If we all pressconstantly for more money, regardless of how much we produce to spend iton, prices are bound to go on rising. But if we concentrate on increasing productivity, and on keeping costs down, price stability can be achievedalong with full employment and a rising standard of living.30. From the point of view of industry and trade this means that firms should try, wherever possible, to pass on gains from higher productivity inlower prices and to expand their profits not by the maintenance of highprofit margins, but by the expansion of turnover. This will be easier to achieve in some sectors of the economy than in others, since the scope for increasing productivity will vary not because of better or harder work, but because of differences in the amount of capital employed, varying rates of technical progress, changes in the pattern of demand, greater opportunities forsecuring economies from increased output and so forth. If general price stability is to be maintained, it is essential that there should be a positivereduction of prices in those sectors in which productivity inevitably risesmore rapidly than the average. Enterprises which can achieve an increaseof output and sales by a reduction of costs, including profit margins, will be making a real contribution to the maintenance of price stability and to theWhole process of balanced economic growth.31. The counterpart of realism in relation to costs is realism in relationto personal incomes. The Government of this country does not attempt totell the people what income each one of them ought to be receiving at any given moment. Wages are fixed by free negotiation between employersand workpeople, within a system of collective bargaining which has been built up over a long period of years. By equally well established practice,the level of dividend declared by a company is a matter for recommendation by the directors and confirmation by the shareholders. But the satisfactoryoperation of this, whole system depends upon the extent to which the parties1149076 D*
Mlconcerned in each case show themselves1 aware of the fundamental factors involved in the progressive development of the economy of which they are all members. If the resulting decisions reflect too greatly the pressure ofmerely sectional interests, economic stability will be endangered and thepossibilities of future expansion will be impaired&apos;.32. We all want full employment and we all&quot; want stable prices. Butwe have not yet succeeded in combining the two. The experience of thepast ten years has shown that the fuller employment is, the more liableprices are to rise; but the Government does not believe that there is anyinevitable conflict between the two objectives. We can achieve them both ifcertain conditions are fulfilled; and: it has been the aim of this White paper to state what these conditions are, in the belief that a greater awareness ofthe nature of the problem will contribute to finding a solution for it.

It differs from the consumer price index, forinstance by giving greater weight to food prices (which have risen more than the average) and less weight to rent and rates (which have risen lessthan the average). There is no retail price index figure for 1946 comparable to that for later years.(5) Figure for June 1947.
