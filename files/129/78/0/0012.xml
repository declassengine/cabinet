THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 5 9CP. (55) 16221st October, 1955CABINETTHE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION IN SINGAPORE AND THEFEDERATION OF MALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies am shortly circulating to the Colonial Policy Committee a detailed analysis of the situation and major problems in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.In the meantime the Prime Minister has suggested that the Cabinet would be interested to read a shorter account of my recent negotiations in those territories.As my colleagues were in close touch with the discussions in Singapore at the time,I have recounted these in an appendix to this paper. I should like in what follows to complete the picture with an account of my talks in the Federation of malaya and of the developments which have since taken place.2. On 21st July (CM. (55) 25th Conclusions, Minute 8) the Cabinet approvedcertain proposals which I had put forward for the line which I should take in discussing constitutional matters with the Rulers and political leaders in theFederation. I proposed that I should insist that, before there could be any freshconsideration of a further measure of internal self-government in the Federation,it would be necessary to have talks in London on a number of vital issues on whichit was, in our view, essential to reach agreement as conditions precedent toexamination of other constitutional questions. The most important of these wereexternal defence, internal security, the financial relationship between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Federation Government and the general constitutionalrelationship between the two Governments. Subject to that, we could accept theproposal for a commission to review the constitution of the Federation within thelimits set by prior agreement upon the vital issues. Both the Alliance and thePullers had already adopted the idea of some such commission, although they helddifferent views upon its composition.3. The order of my negotiations in the Federation was as follows. I firsthad a long talk with the High Commissioner and the Chief Minister, Tunku abdul rahman, at which I outlined my ideas and ascertained that the Chief Ministersfirst reaction to them was broadly favourable. I told him that I proposed next to discuss them with the Conference of Rulers, and he agreed that that was theright course. I then discussed them in some detail with the Conference of Rulers.Their initial reaction was also broadly favourable but they said that they wouldlike to have more time to consider the matter; and it was therefore arranged thatthey should meet the High Commissioner again for that purpose in September.The meeting took place on 29th September and the Rulers confirmed their agreement to my proposals. After meeting the Rulers I had two further meetings with the Alliance Ministers, first informally and second at a session of the fullFederal Executive Council. Their main interest has throughout concentrated onsecuring agreement to the appointment of a constitutional commission, which tookpride of place in their election manifesto, and they at first showed some hesitation in accepting the need for preliminary talks in London. In the end, however, theydid accept it, and I for my part agreed in principle to the appointment of theproposed commission on the understanding that the London talks took place first.48946
4. The High Commissioner has now written to the Chief Minister, setting out exactly what is proposed and seeking his formal agreement. As soon as hehas had a satisfactory reply from the Chief Minister he proposes to issue a pressstatement, which will be published simultaneously here.5.   The proposed agenda for the London talks is as follows:  (1) The future relations that should exist between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom and Their Highnesses the Rulers and theGovernments of the Federation of Malaya in regard to:  (a) External defence;(b) Internal security;(c) Finance.(2) The future of the Public Service.(3) The powers of the High Commissioner.(4) The terms of reference, composition and timing of a Commission to review the constitution.6. I will, of course, consult the Cabinet when I have worked out in detail thelines which I would propose to follow in dealing with the various items on theagenda for the London talks.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.1,19th October, 1955.appendix the CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION IN SINGAPOREI paid three visits to Singapore during my recent tour of the Far East. Ofthese the first and last occupied about a day each; on the second occasion I was there for nearly a week; During these visits I had long and friendly talks withthe Chief Minister and the other members of the Council of Ministers and reached agreement with them on a number of constitutional issues. These fall broadlyinto two categories.2. First, there were the immediate issues which had arisen between theChief Minister and the Governor over those matters in which, under theconstitution, decisions lay with the Governor in his discretion after consultationwith the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister argued that in those matters theGovernor was bound to accept his advice: otherwise the constitution was in these respects virtually meaningless and unworkable. The Governor, on the other hand,held that the meaning of the constitution was quite clear: he was bound to seek the Chief Minister^ advice and to take it into account in reaching his decisions butnot necessarily to follow it. While accepting the Chief Ministers sincerity in hisown interpretation of the constitution, I had no hesitation in upholding theGovernor&apos;s view. Nevertheless, both the Governor and I agreed that in relationto most of the powers in question which related to the appointment, dismissal and leave of Ministers, the allocation of Ministerial responsibilities and the appointmentof committees of the Council of Ministers the constitution might well have been drawn so as to bind the Governor to accept the Chief Minister^ advice, and thatarrangements should be made to that effect by means of Instructions from her majesty The Queen through a Secretary of State. These arrangements are nowbeing made.3. I could not, however, agree to such an arrangement in relation to the mostimportant of the powers in question, that of prorogation or dissolution of theLegislative Assembly, and I insisted that there the Governor, while still obligedto consult the Chief Minister, must retain his ultimate discretion in reaching adecision.  This the Chief Minister accepted.
October, 1955.\4. These discussions did not affect any of the numerous powers exercised bythe Governor in his discretion without obligation to consult the Chief Minister orthe Council of Ministers. Nor did they affect the Governors reserved executive and legislative powers, in virtue of which he is in certain circumstances authorisedto over-rule the Council even in those matters in which he is normally bound toaccept their advice, and to give effect to legislation even if the Legislative Assemblyhas refused to pass it.5. The second group of constitutional issues at stake arose from a unanimousresolution passed by the Legislative Assembly in July calling for the immediategrant of self-government. On this the Chief Minister and I agreed that Singaporeshould send a delegation to London in April or May of next year for talks on constitutional and other matters &quot; in the light of a year&apos;s working of theconstitution.&quot; In speaking of this in the Legislative Assembly the Chief ministers aid, by agreement with me, that the present constitution was a great advance upon its predecessor, that it was workable (which the People&apos;s Action Party has alwaysdenied) and that it was the intention of the Labour Front Government to makeit work. In coming to this agreement with the Chief Minister I particularly stressedfour major points:  (a) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would approach the proposed Londontalks next year with no sort of commitment to accept, or even to discuss,any particular proposal;(b) that this meant, among other things, that I could hold out no hope thatthe talks would produce any sort of programme with dates for further constitutional advance in Singapore;(c) that, when I said on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that the talkswould be conducted &quot; in the light of a year&apos;s working of theconstitution,&quot; I meant that Singapore was indeed on trial for that yearand that the course of events during it was bound materially to affectthe thinking of Her Majesty&apos;s Government when the talks were held; and Id) that any movement towards self-government in Singapore must at all stagesmake full allowance for the vital interest of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the defence of the Colony and its internal security.
