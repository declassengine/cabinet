(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(55) 161COPY NO.   ) 319th October, 1955CABINETDISAPPEARANCE OF TWO FOREIGN OFFICEOFFICIALS, BURGESS AND MACLEANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have been considering how to deal with this debate and have prepared the outline of an opening speech.    There are certain questionswhich have been pushed hard especially by the Press4 which will have tobe answered.    It will not be very easy to make a wholly confincing defenceof what has happened in the past.    At the same time I think it should bepossible to show some of the inherent difficulties in a situation where theprinciples of security and freedom appear to be in conflict.2. There has already been a demand for an enquiry of some kind.There is a question on the paper suggesting an enquiry by a selectcommittee of the House of Commons.    Others have proposed an enquiryof the Lynskey kind.    Mr. Herbert Morrison wants an enquiry into thesystem which makes it impossible for Foreign Secretaries not to beoverworked.    This may be from friendly motives or may be to suggest a defence for Mr. Bevin and himself.    I do not think the last of these enquiries would be valuable and the first two would be dangerous.Nothing could be worse than a lot of muckraking and innuendo.    It wouldbe like one of the immense divorce cases which there used to be when Iwas young, going on for days and days, every detail reported in the Press.3. Nevertheless, I think we must make some suggestion.    i therefore propose that we should have an enquiry, not into the past but intothe future.    I have discussed with the Lord Chancellor who would be willing to help both with the terms of reference and the composition.    Theformer would be on the general line of &quot;the problem of security, within the framework of the existing law in relation to employees of the state, whetheradministrative or industrial, having access to classified material&quot;.    Iwould point out in debate that most of the criticisms would imply giving tothe executive  -(i) power to hold persons for interrogation, evenwithout legal grounds for arrest, andwithout fear of interference by the courtson Habeas Corpus or proceedings for falseimprisonment;(ii) power to stop a person (and his relatives) from leaving the country who had access to secret information and who was under suspicion;
(iii)  putting into operation without question thepower to dismiss civil servants of allkinds whose relatives were in avulnerable position, e. g,, in countriesbehind the iron curtain;(iv) power to dismiss civil servants whose privatelives or that of their relatives might make them subject to blackmail;(v) power to dismiss civil servants who hold or have held extreme or communist opinions,4,        This enquiry, apart from its immediate convenience, shouldbe very helpful in solving problems which the Security Committee of theCabinet have been unable to resolve in certain fields.    The Chairman ofthe Committee of enquiry would obviously be a judge.    Lord Radcliffewould be admirable if we could get him because of his experience ingovernment Departments,   He should be assisted by a strong teamrepresenting public administration,. industry, trade unions, and perhapsacademic life.The advantages of the enquiry are two-fold:(a) on the principle of Albert and the Lion&quot;Sum one &apos;ad got to be summoned,so that was decided upon&quot;.The public will feel that something isbeing enquired into;(b) that the public will be brought up againstthe dilemma of security in a free society.Almost all the accusations of the Pressagainst the laxity of the authorities are really demands for changing the EnglishCommon Law,H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,19th October, 1955.
