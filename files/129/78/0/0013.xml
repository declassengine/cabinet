5&quot;^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 63CP. (55) 16324th October, 1955CABINETMONOPOLIES COMMISSION REPORT ON CALICO PRINTINGMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the question of action to carry out the recommendations of the monopolies commission on the restrictive practices in the Calico Printing trade has been beforethe Cabinet several times. The last occasion was in June this year when I reported(CM. (55) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4 (c) and Conclusion 3) that I hoped to securethe voluntary acceptance by the Federation of the most important proposals in thereport. This endeavour has failed, and I am therefore asking my colleagues&apos;approval to action under Section 10 of the Monopolies Act, 1948.2. The principal recommendations of the Monopolies Commission report were that three practices of the trade should be discontinued:  (a) The Percentage Quantum scheme whereby, if any firm in the trade securesa share of the annual total turnover larger than an allocated percentage,it has to pay over a proportion of the proceeds into a fund from whichthe less successful firms are compensated;(b) an arrangement linked with and in effect forming part of the sameagreement v/hereby minimum prices are fixed and enforced; and(c) a separate redundancy scheme embodying an agreement that, when anyplant or premises are disposed of, this should be done only underrestrictive covenants prohibiting their subsequent use (including waterrights) for calico printing.3. My final proposal to the Federation was that they should voluntarilyimplement the first two recommendations but that, in respect of the third,the existing scheme should run its course, provided that no further restrictivecovenants were imposed under it.4. This whole business has been going on a very long time. The reference tothe Commission was made in April 1951, and the Report was dated November1953 and published in April 1954. After discussions with the trade and the CottonBoard, both of whom opposed the Commission^ recommendations, I announced in the House of Commons on the 23rd February this year the Government^acceptance of the Commission^ conclusions and its general agreement with therecommendations. There followed further discussions with the Federation who made certain counter proposals which, however, left untouched the essential features of the Percentage Quantum scheme. The Calico Printers&apos; Federation have throughout been, rather obviously, playing for time and their latest communication,in reply to the proposal described in paragraph 3 and put to them over three months ago, was received only within the last few days. It makes no advance on their previous proposals.   It states, however, that they consider redundancy is again48959
becoming a serious problem for the trade, enquires what would be the Govern-menfs attitude towards arrangements for dealing with it, and indicates that theFederation regard the Percentage Quantum scheme as being an essential feature ofany effective solution of the problem.5. I do not accept the latter argument. I consider that the continuation ofC *&quot;i the scheme at a time when redundant plant was being scrapped and premises&quot; disposed, of could only have the effect of retarding the elimination of theless efficient undertakings. I am not convinced that there is genuine redundancyin the calico printing industry still remaining to be dealt with, but in the present economic circumstances of the Lancashire textile industry I believe we should be wise not to commit the Government in advance as to their approval or otherwise of any action to eliminate redundancy if this should prove to be necessary.6. I consider that the effort to reach agreement with the trade on satisfactoryvoluntary action cannot usefully be taken further and that if Government action is any longer delayed it can only throw doubts upon the sincerity of our policy onrestrictive practices. I therefore propose to inform the Federation that I shall beproceeding to lay an Order before the House which will in effect put an end to theirPercentage Quantum scheme and also to their arrangements for the enforcement of minimum prices by making it unlawi A to make or carry out arrangements of thiskind. I propose to add that I retain an open mind on the existence or otherwise of redundancy in the industry and that in the circumstances I shall not for the presentmake any provision for carrying out the recommendation of the Commission^report relating to the redundancy scheme.7. An Order giving effect to this decision is at present in draft and I should propose to lay it before both Houses as soon as possible after parliament reassembles.P.
