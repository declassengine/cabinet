^4(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (5 5) 1692nd November, 1955ROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALS bill memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the Cabinet on 16th October invited me to consult further withthe Lord President, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theFinancial Secretary, Treasury, on two issues raised in C.P.(55) 154 andto report back.    (C.M.(55) 35th Conclusions, Minute 9).2.        These discussions have now taken place.3,       As a result it was agreed between us that I should recommendthat the proposed Bill should make provision that the transport levyshould not be continued afte- 1956,    The Cabinet have already decidedthat it should continue at the present rate during 1956.4.        In connection with contract hire vehicles, I was able to reportto my colleagues that since the cabinet&apos;s discussion I had had auopportunity to consult the Road Haulage Association.    That body told methat they would have no objection to provision being made for the british transport Commission to retain vehicles which were required for thepurpose of a contract which the other party concerned desired to renewwith the Commission,    They felt, however, that in these circumstances the retained vehicle should surrender its open &quot;A&quot; licence and receiveonly a contract &quot;A&quot; licence in its place.    The Commission under thepresent system would only obtain a contract &quot;A&quot; licence in respect of anew vehicle purchased to carry out the contract.5.        In the light of this my colleagues agreed that I should report tothe Cabinet a recommendation that provision should be made in the R.oadHaulage Disposals Bill to enable the British Transport Commission toretain contract hire vehicles required to carry out contracts for whichthey had negotiated renewals but that they should do so with contract&quot;A&quot; licences only.6.        I therefore seek the authority of the Cabinet to provide forthese two recommendations in the forthcoming Bill.J,A.B-C.CO!NO.
