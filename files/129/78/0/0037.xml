Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 3CP. (55) 1872nd December, 1955CABINETCONFERENCE CENTREMemorandum by the Minister of Works, ., .......   . - : &apos; : &quot; . - .At Cabinet on 16th March I was invited to arrange for a study of thepossibilities of erecting a permanent conference centre in central London (C.C. (55)25th Conclusions, Minute 6). A working party of officials from the Treasury,the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, under the chairmanship of my Department, have examined the matterexhaustively.2. The working party agreed that existing conference facilities in Londonare inadequate and are likely to get more so. They considered two different sizesof centre: one large enough to accommodate the United Nations general assembly, and one which could accommodate international conferences of up to500 delegates.Centre Large Enough for the General Assembly3. When the possibility was considered last March of inviting the united nations to hold the 1956 General Assembly in London, it had to be abandonedpartly because of the need to spend about  3 millions on temporary buildingsbut mainly because sufficient hotel accommodation could not be provided without serious disruption of the tourist traffic. The second difficulty persists. It is unlikelythat hotel accommodation could be found on the scale required for a general assembly except possibly during the winter (excluding the Christmas period).4. A permanent centre large enough to accommodate the General assembly would cost about  7 millions. Management and maintenance would probablycost  150,000 a year. Even if such a centre were provided it is unlikely thatmeetings of the General Assembly would be held in London more than once intwelve years. No use can be foreseen for most of the space, particularly the offices,in the intervals between these meetings. It would in fact be much cheaper to put up temporary buildings specially for a meeting of the Assembly than to put up and maintain this large centre.5. The working party concluded, and I agree, that such a centre ought notto be built.Smaller Centre6. The working party considered, however, that there is a case for building a smaller centre sufficient to take conferences of up to 500 delegates. The lackof a first-class conference building keeps some international conferences from london. Of 17 conferences of over 300 delegates likely to be held in the next five years none is at present booked for the United Kingdom. Of 30 conferencesof between 200 and 300 delegates, 23 will be held in Europe but only 3 of themin the United Kingdom. Provided that the dates of certain trade and sportingevents were avoided there should be no insuperable difficulty as regards hotel accommodation for conferences of this size.49158
Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,29th November, 1955.7. The cost of building and furnishing such a centre would be about If million. Management and maintenance costs would be about  50,000 a year.The working party estimated that by allowing the centre to be used on suitableoccasions for non-government purposes the centre could be used on average tofiabout two-thirds of its capacity. After allowing for the saving in GovernmentCs V expenditure on other accommodation and for revenue from non-government usesthe net cost is estimated at about  90,000 a year of which  89,000 represents the(equivalent of interest charges on the capital cost of the site, the buildings andfurniture.  Some gains in foreign exchange could be expected.8. The working party suggested that the best site for such a centre wouldbe on the South Bank near the Royal Festival Hall.9. Although the provision of even a smaller centre is not strictly an economicproposition, I agree that it is desirable that London should possess such a centre.We have however a number of urgently needed Government building schemesahead, some of which have recently been postponed on economy grounds. I couldnot recommend that a conference centre should take priority over these. But i suggest that we look again at the proposal when the need for economy inGovernment expenditure is less insistent. I think it would be undesirable toacquire a site until we decide to build, and a site on the South Bank may no longer be available if it is subsequently decided to go on with the scheme. I think wemust run this risk.Recommendations10.   I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that (1) it would not be justifiable to build a centre large enough for the general assembly of the United Nations;(2) when there is less need for economy we should again look at the proposalfor a smaller centre to accommodate up to 500 delegates;(3) in the meantime no action should be taken to acquire a site.N.
