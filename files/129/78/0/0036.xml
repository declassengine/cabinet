SLUM CLEARANCE COMPENSATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentFollowing upon the announcement of the Governments intentionto stimulate the resumption of slum clearance, several speakers in the debate on the Housing Subsidies Bill drew attention to the inadequacy ofthe compensation payable to those whose houses are demolished.    Inparticular, they pointed out the serious hardship suffered by owner-occupiers who had been driven by the housing shortage to buy unfit propertyat scarcity prices of perhaps  500 or more, and who would probably receivein compensation not more than about  50.2.     With the agreement of the Prime Minister and other ministers concerned, I said in my reply that the Government were actively consider-ing what could be done to relieve hardship in such cases, and that I wouldmake a further statement shortly.3.     I ask for authority to inform the House that, as soon as thelegislative programme will permit, the Government will introduce a short bill, which will provide in respect of England and Wales:(a) that an owner-occupier, who bought an unfithouse between the outbreak of war and thedate of the announcement of legislation,shall, if that house is compulsorily purchased,(or cleared or demolished), receive compensationequal to the market value of the house immediately before it was declared unfit;(b) that the compensation in respect of a well-maintained unfit house, which is at presentpayable on the basis of pre-war buildingcosts, may from time to time be adjusted byOrder, to take account of changes in thelevel of prices;       and(c) that where a shop or other business forms part ofan unfit dwelling house, which is compulsorily acquired (or cleared or demolished), owner-occupiers or tenants shall receive compensationat market value for that part of the premises which relates to the shop or business.D.S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S8W.l.COPY NO.^4CABINET29th November, 1955.secret.P.(55) 18629th November, 1955
