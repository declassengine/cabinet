Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1955SECRETCP. (55) 21230th December, 1955CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SALARIES IN scotland memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i circulate for consideration with the memorandum by the Minister ofEducation (CP. (55) 211) about teachers&apos; salaries some notes on the position inScotland.2. In Scotland, as in England, the *eachers are protesting violently againstthe Teachers&apos; (Superannuation) Bill and some of them are backing their protestsby claiming that their real grievance is about the low level of their salaries. But 1suspect that, in so far as teachers have switched from direct attacks on the Bill tocomplaints of being generally underpaid, it is because they think that the salaries&apos;issue is a more favourable one to fight on and I feel that their salary grievancesare being aired so insistently because the most effective way of attacking the Billseems to them to be to represent it as a cut in salaries which are already inadequate.It is also to be noted that there is still among Scottish teachers a great deal of criticism of the Bill because it does not provide for a widows&apos; pension scheme atleast partly financed by their employers.3. I attach to this memorandum an appendix comparable to that attachedto CP. (55) 211, showing how Scottish teachers&apos; salaries have moved comparedwith average weekly earnings in industry. In 1938 teachers&apos; salaries in Scotlandtended to be rather lower than those in England and since the War they have risenrather more than English salaries. But by and large Scottish teachers&apos; salaries, likethose in England, have not kept pace with the increases in industrial earnings.4. Scottish teachers&apos; salaries are discussed in a National Joint Councilcomposed of representatives of the Educational Institute of Scotland and ofeducation authorities sitting under an independent chairman appointed by me and recognised by me under Section 79 (2) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946. Therecommendations of this body are not binding on me, but in making salaries&apos;regulations I am required to have regard to them and in practice it would not be easy to depart materially from them.5. I received from the Council in December recommendations for increases in the basic salaries of graduate teachers and for the creation of new posts ofspecial responsibility in senior secondary schools attracting the payment of allowances. These recommendations were based on the consideration by theCouncil of the Appleton Report on the shortage of mathematics and scienceteachers and I propose to give effect to them in regulations which will be published in draft on 4th January and come into force on 1st April. Their effect on honoursgraduates&apos; salaries is shown in the appendix.6. Scottish teachers&apos; salaries are due for a general revision to take effect from april 1957, and I have already asked the National Joint Council to give me their recommendations by November 1956. Meanwhile the Council have begun toconsider a claim by the teachers&apos; side for a flat rate increase of  100 for all teachers,which is the counterpart of the English teachers claim in November for a 10 per cent,rise in basic scales. The education authorities&apos; side have so far made no counteroffer to this claim and are unlikely to do so until they are reasonably clear about what the Burnham Committee are going to recommend.J.

APPENDIXTEACHERS&apos; SALARIES, scotland. The following tables show the changes that have taken place in the salaries of three representative classes of teachers, viz.: (i) non-graduate women, (ii)ordinary graduate men in primary schools, and (iii) honours graduate men.Scottish primary schools are staffed mainly by the first two of these groups: andthe honours graduates fill the most important posts of responsibility in all kinds of secondary schools and in most of the advanced teaching in senior secondary schools.2. Of the 35,000 teachers in Scotland, 23,000 are women. The women&apos;sscales are being assimilated to the men&apos;s; a process which will be complete in 1962.3. In Scotland the &quot; concertina &quot; of the teachers&apos; scales is not so compressedas in England, and after effect has been given to the Appleton increases for honoursgraduates there will be a reasonable gap between their remuneration and that ofnon-graduate teachers. It is also to be noted that the maxima of the Scottishnon-graduate and honours graduate scales have not fallen so far behind the levelof industrial earnings in Scotland as in England. But the scales of the ordinarygraduate teachers are not far enough above the non-graduate scale and comparemore unfavourably with the level of industrial earnings. There are 4,600 menand 6,300 women in this group. The women in it are getting some benefit out of.the gradual introduction of equal pay and the men employed in secondary schools will get increases ranging up to  30 a year under the Appleton proposals. But the2,000 graduate men employed in primary schools will get nothing. Any flat rateincrease in teachers&apos; salaries would worsen relatively the position of the ordinarygraduate teachers and would give non-graduate women teachers more than wouldbe warranted.(i) Non-graduate Women (trained for three years in a Teachers&apos; Training College)Salaries Per cent, increase on 1938Minimum   Maximum      Minimum    Maximum1938 0)      ......April 1945 ......April 1948 ......April 1951......April 1954 ......October 1955Equal pay 1962 scaletowards which thewomen&apos;s scale isbeing assimilated...1452602603354074154952104604805556276467607979131181186241119129164199208262Average weekly earnings inindustryper cent,increase over 19387684132187219 (est.)The teacher reaches the maximum of the scale after 17 years at the age of 37to 39.(ii) Ordinary Graduate Men in primary schools (ordinary University degreecourse (3 years) followed by a year in a Teachers&apos; Training College)Salaries Per cent, increase on 1938Minimum   Maximum      Minimum    Maximum1938 (!)April 1945 ...April 1948 ...April 1951 ...April 1954 ...October 19552053453454355205203655906107258108106868112154154626799122!22Average weekly earnings inindustryper cent,increase over 19387694172187219 (est.)The teacher reaches the maximum of the scale after 17 years at the age of38 to 40.

A principal teacher earning  1,190 to-day would have earned  508in 1938, an increase of 134 per cent. Under the proposed scales(2) for 1956 hewill have  1,300, an increase over 1938 of 156 per cent.(v) There are special additions for headmasters and headmistresses. Thetotal salary of the headmaster of the largest senior secondary schools before thewar was  950; to-day it is  1,820: and in 1956(2) it will be  1,920. The increases,as percentages are 92 for 1955 and 102 for 1956.Notes. (&apos;) In 1938, scales were minimum scales and authorities were free to pay larger salaries.The scales entered are the average of what was actually paid. Since the war, teachershave been paid on scales prescribed for the whole of Scotland.(2) As a result of the consideration of the Appleton Report, new scales for graduatesand honours graduates in secondary schools have been proposed by the national joint Council, to take effect from 1st April, 1956. Draft regulations to give effectto the Council&apos;s proposals will be published on 4th January, 1956.
