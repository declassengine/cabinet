RECORD OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND MR. KARDELJ ON WEDNESDAY, 16th NOVEMBER,AT 10 DOWNING STREET, S.W. present:Sir Anthony Eden.Mr. Kardelj.Dr. Velebit (Yugoslav Ambassador).Mr. Prica.Mr. Sokorac (Interpreter).Sir Harold Caccia.Sir Frank Roberts.c Mr. de Zulueta.. After an exchange of compliments the Prime Minister began by saying thathe was not surprised by the slow progress at Geneva as he had thought&apos; that theRussians would want to halt and look around. What to do now was a problem;he had been communicating with Mr. Macmillan on this point. The PrimeMinisters own view was that as the Russians were coming here in April 1956, itwould be better not to have another Four-Power meeting until after that.Mr. Kardelj agreed that the Yugoslavs had not expected much from geneva and therefore were not disappointed. He thought that probably the talks inLondon would enable a little progress to be made.. The- Prime Minister said that he thought that conditions in the Soviet union were a little relaxed.Mr. Kardelj said that the Russians had made certain moves in this respect.Although these were not big, it was significant that the trend existed. This meantgradual weakening of certain Stalinist positions. The group round M. Kruschevwas, however, encountering a certain resistance. Therefore he thought that theRussians were interested to go forward in achieving a certain stabilisation butdared not do anything to strengthen the internal resistance to their policies ofwhich Mr. Kardelj had spoken. Consequently they dared not lose too much asfar as their positions were concerned and this explained some vacillations in soviet foreign policy. Nevertheless there was a trend towards stabilisation and agreementwith the West; of course, on the basis of the status quo. To-day there was noquestion of their going back from the status quo and therefore the German question was central for the Russians. The Yugoslav Government were convinced that theRussians would not leave Eastern Germany and therefore it seemed to them thatan East-West agreement must somehow be found within the framework of thepresent balance of forces in Germany.The Prime Minister said that the German question was very difficult; it washard to get a peaceful Europe with a divided Germany at the heart of theContinent. Nevertheless he agreed with Mr. Kardelj&apos;s analysis, but the remedywas difficult. That was why Her Majesty&apos;s Government had put forward a securityarrangement worked out to give all possible guarantees against aggression. It wasremarkable that the United States had entered into such a guarantee and he didnot understand why the Soviet Union did not value this. He supposed it was because the Russians did not believe that the Americans would honour theirpledge. If such a guarantee had existed in 1939 the last war would not have broken out. It was hard to see how to move if the Russians would not change their position on Eastern Germany. Of course, if the Russians did not move,Western Germany would become increasingly restive; perhaps the Russiansthought that things would be easier for them in Western Germany afterDr. Adenauer was out of the way, but in the Prime Minister^ view such a conclusion would be wrong.   Dr. Adenauer was a stabilising influence.Mr. Kardelj said that if things remained as they were it would leave the presentline, of division. Perhaps in these circumstances certain contacts with eastern germany would help with elections and so forth in the future.   On the other
hand this might not happen and things might stabilise as they were. Mr. Kardeljthought that the Russians counted on American participation in european security. If the Russians really wanted peace now, as the Yugoslav government thought, they must be interested to find a certain equilibrium in Europe. security in Europe would lead to security in the world as a whole and therefore the Russiansmust count on United States participation in European security.The Prime Minister recalled that at Geneva he had tried to persuade Bulganinand Kruschev that it was better to have Germany in the North Atlantic treaty organisation than out of it. Bulganin had said this might be all right for youbut we look many years ahead. In the Prime Ministers view this was undulypessimistic, because Germany was not now so well placed to make trouble inthe world. For example she had nowhere in which to explode an experimentalbomb. When Mr. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs,was in Moscow recently, he put the same argument to Kruschev. Kruschev saidthat the Russians were not frightened of Germany but were frightened of theUnited States. Mr. Pearson had asked whether it was not better to have theUnited States in N.A.T.O. than out of it.  What did Mr. Kardelj think?Mr. Kardelj said that he thought the Russians svere frightened both of theUnited States and of Germany and in particular of collaboration between theUnited States and Germany, because such collaboration could possibly change the balance of force in the world to the detriment of the Russians. From one point of view there was some danger in the German position even if they rearmedinside N.A.T.O. The Yugoslav Government feared that if the present sharpdivision between blocs remained for a long time the mere logic of the inter blocclash would drive N.A.T.O. to require more and more arms for Germany. this could change the relationships and balance of forces in N.A.T.O. and give germany new role. Yugoslavia had twice been attacked by Germany and therefore they remained to some extent afraid of such a possible development which evenN.A.T.O. could not prevent if things developed as the Yugoslavs feared. therefore the Yugoslav Government were in favour of some European security arrangementif at all possible.The Prime Minister said that he shared Mr. Kardelj&apos;s fears about Germanyand had had them before the war, but he thought that perhaps Germany had learnta little. It took a long time and cost a great deal to build up modern arms and now the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, controlled all the taps which turnedoff the petrol. Without his agreement it was almost impossible for any one to startanything. He agreed that the Germans might become stronger, especially as france was growing steadily weaker. The Prime Minister regretted this, but did not see what could be done; France was richer than England but politically weaker.(Mr. Kardelj agreed with this view.) The Prime Minister said that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment attached great value to their friendship with Yugoslavia and thereforehoped the Yugoslav Government would not hesitate to communicate any thoughtsthat they had before the Russians visited London. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad no desire for Europe except to get peace and security. Mr. Kardelj agreed thatthis was the sole aim of Yugoslavia and that they started from that standpoint.They therefore considered some gradual formula for solving the Germanquestion should be found.Turning to Trieste the Prime Minister congratulated Mr. Kardelj on theprogress made. Mr. Kardelj agreed that things had developed well even though in some matters there were still difficulties. The great thing was that to-day Italyand Yugoslavia did not clash, even though they were not yet close friends.The Prime Minister said that he was afraid that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad caused the Yugoslavs certain difficulties in the Balkan Alliance because of cyprus. Her Majesty&apos;s Government had been trying to work out some solution to this question, but, quite apart from the British position there was a strongreaction from the Turks if we went to far towards the Greeks. Her Majesty&apos;governments concern in Cyprus was strategic. We had no intention of gettingout of Cyprus while the world was in its present state, but did not say that there could never be self-determination for Cyprus. - On this basis Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had prepared a formula which the Governor would give the archbishop when he returned to Cyprus, which he seemed slow to do. [Sir HaroldCaccia added that the point at issue was not the principle of self-determination49110 B 2
1but in .what conditions self-determination would be applicable.) The PrimeMinister said that we had offered the Cypriots a wide measure of self-government now.M. Kardelj said that they started by sympathising with the Greek people andtheir request for self-determination, but they took concrete relationships intoconsideration and had been trying to persuade the Greeks to calm the situationdown. The riots in Turkey had, however, aggravated the position. The yugoslav government fully understood the true position of- the British Government betweenGreece and Turkey, but they felt that perhaps the Three-Power Conference inLondon had had an unfortunate influence on this question. The best way in futuremight be to proceed in a way which would not provoke passions. The yugoslav government were trying now to find through the Balkan Alliance some way inwhich the three Ministers might meet. There was a disposition on the Greekside gradually to liquidate tho situation.The Prime Minister thought that the present Greek Government were moreanxious to reach a settlement than their predecessors, but also they were muchweaker and more frightened particularly with elections so near. Her Mhjesty&apos;sGovernment were not contemplating another Three-Power Conference at piesent.Discussion would now be underground.Mr. Kardelj expressed pleasure at this and added that, although th. creekswould be ready to help, the Turks ought to also, but lately they had issued newanti-Greek memoranda which had poured oil on the flames.The Prime Minister said he had always been sure thai the Turks would getangry eventually about Cyprus. This was why he had not talked to the Greeksbefore. Cyprus was the last Turkish off-shore island. It was necessary find some way of keeping things quiet at least for the next few years. Wh -. her majesty&apos;s Government wanted was to be able to use Cyprus for aircra t andheadquarters. This did not mean that we were prepared to give up sove jigntynow; we could discuss self-government and start it and discuss self-determination.,later.   Mr. Kardelj said that this seemed to suggest a possible solution.On the Middle East the Prime Minister said that Mr. Kardelj would havt .observed that Mr. Ben-Gurion, the Prime Minister of Israel, was not pleased with what he had said at the Guildhall. The Prime Minister did not mind, becausesomeone had to say what he had said and President Eisenhower had put out a useful statement last night saying much the same thing. Both sides mustunderstand that they had to make some territorial concessions, not necessarilyenormous. Once that position had been reached, settlement would become aTrieste operation, but until then the situation became more dangerous with bothsides getting more arms. As far as Israel and Jordan were concerned, probablyquite minor adjustments were needed to enable the frontiers to work. The difficultpart was the Israeli-Egyptian frontier and there what the Arabs wanted most wasa link between Jordan and Egypt. Dr. Velebit interjected that the Israelis wanted a port and a solutioti was very difficult without creating a new corridor asunsatisfactory as previous ones. The Prime Minister said that perhaps two trianglesmight be agreed. He believed that Israel must have its port and could keep thepart of its territory in which oil had been found which was what mattered. ThePrime Minister added that in his view Israel v/ould win all the battles but the Arabswould win the war in the end, or at least smother Israel.Mr. Kardelj said that Yugoslavia was not directly concerned in this area,but only indirectly. He agreed that President Tito was going to Cairo in December,and the Prime Minister said that he had had quite a good reaction from ColonelNasser, the Egyptian Prime Minister, to his proposals. President Tito might have considerable influence in encouraging him towards agreement. Mr. Kardelj saidthat certainly Yugoslavia was interested in the possibility of finding a solutionand agreed to the action of the Prime Minister and of President Eisenhower. Asfar as President Tito could exercise a positive influence he would do his best. ThePrime Minister said drat Colonel Nasser should be fairly good. A difficulty wasthat each Arab State might accuse the other of being pro-Israeli and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had done what they could to prevent this. The details of thesettlement would be very difficult but might be worked out if once agreement inprinciple was reached.  Mr. Kardelj agreed and said that the Yugoslav view of
Nasser was the same. When President Tito met him last year he had not taken the line that Israel should be annihilated. Therefore perhaps he could go further than this. The true danger lay in Nasser fearing Egypfs role being lessened inthe Arabic world if he should agree to a settlement. Therefore a settlement couldonly be reached if the situation in the Middle East was looked at as a whole. Forthis reason the Yugoslav Government had been reserved about the Baghdad Pact.They feared a clash between the Arab countries which would allow other forces to infiltrate in the Middle East. In Mr. Kardelfs view, the forthcoming conferencein Baghdad could help to create greater unity among Arab countries withoutbinding them directly to this or that pact. The Prime Minister said that he had thought that the pact would encourage the Arabs to think of other things besidesIsrael; &quot;this was true to some extent of Iraq. Her Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to develop the economic side of the pact and had a plan for this. TheMiddle East was rich from oil revenues and living conditions were bad, and her majesty&apos;s Government hoped to help to improve the standard of living. Hethought that Colonel Nasser was less annoyed about the Baghdad pact than hehad been&quot;.iTiho&apos; Prime Minister thanked Mr. Kardelj for appointing a Yugoslavrepresentative to the Sudan Commission. He explained that Her Majesty&apos;sGoveruJienfs sole interest was to see the Sudan prosperous and united. the difficult^ would be the different conditions in the north and south of that country.Mr. Kardelj said that the Yugoslav representative would do what he could toproduce peaceful solutions. Otherwise Yugoslavia had no interests in that partof the world except a general .wish that people should as fa. as possible be free to decide their own future. The Prime Minister said that he thought the bestsolutior^j vould be for Egypt and the Sudan to be independent of each other, butL with sojge agreement about the Nile waters between them. The British Govern-ment wjwld like to see an Agreement about the Nile waters.   Mr. Kardelj agreed.ThSiPrime Minister thanked Mr. Kardelj about the Security Council elections and said that he regretted that Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the yugoslav government had so far been unsuccessful in securing Yugoslav elections. He felttcsome extent responsible for Yugoslav candidature. Yugoslavia had Europebehind her and the Prime Minister felt that Europe had a claim to be represented on the Security Council. Mr. Kardelj said that that was the Yugoslav positiontoo. They felt that as things were the Philippines could not get in and perhaps the solution would be to find some third candidate. The Prime Minister said thatthere was no one but Yugoslavia, so far as he knew, who would have the suffragesof Europe, and he hoped that Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Dulles (the United states secretary of State) would settle this matter in Geneva. Mr. Kardelj said that hethought that it was possible to get the United States to agree about the withdrawalof the Philippines and to agree on a third candidate, possibly Greece. The PrimeMinister said that Greece was a little difficult at the moment for the UnitedKingdom.The Prime Minister asked Mr. Kardelj what his view was about happeningsin the satellites. Mr. Kardelj said that he thought the. changes in the Soviet union had brought about changes in the satellites. But these had not always been easybecadse the satellite Governments had mostly been appointed by Beria, Abakumovand&apos;their associates. As in the Soviet Union many people annihilated by Stalinwere being rehabilitated, so the Russians were trying to impose a similar policyin the satellites too. The resistance in the satellite countries was, however,stronger because the Governments were old ones. Consequently relations betweenthe satellites and Yugoslavia were not so good as Yugoslavia^ relations with theSoviet Union, but perhaps the Russians liked this situation. Nevertheless, the mere fact that the Russians had permitted such relaxations as existed muststrengthen the desire of other European countries for similar relations withYugoslavia to those enjoyed by the Soviet Union. Consequently the internal,    crisis of the satellites was likely to grow.j At this point Mr. Kardelj had to leave for an Audience with The Queen.
