THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)SECRETCJ?J 5) 156 COPY NO19th October, 1955CABINETUNITED NATIONS: ADMISSION OF NEW MEMBERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State  or Foreign affairs in C.P.(55) 124 I informed my colleagues that I was sounding theUnited States and French Governments on a Canadian proposal, supportedby the Australian Government, that a prior understanding should be reached with the Soviet Government which would provide for the admission of thefollowing 17 &quot;qualified&quot; applicants:Albania Finland LaosAustria Hungary LibyaBulgaria Irish Republic NepalCambodia Italy Outer MongoliaCeylon Japan PortugalJordan Roumania2.        Since then the following developments have taken place:-(a) the Spanish Government have applied for united Nations membership;(b) the Russians are proposing the admission&apos;en bloc&apos; of all the applicants listed aboveexcept Japan.    They will not at this stageagree to the admission of either Japan orSpain;(c) Mr, Dulles has said (in private conversationwith M. Pinay, M. Molotov and myself) thathe will not agree to the membership of Hungary,Bulgaria, Roumania or Outer Mongolia;(d) the French favour some forward move, primarily with the admission of Italy in mind; but theyare worried about the admission of so manyanti-colonials;(e) the Canadian Government are persevering withtheir proposal for the admission of their original list of 17 candidates,3.        The Soviet proposal is likely to be defeated by United Statesopposition.    If the matter were allowed to rest there, a stop would havebeen put to the entry of more &quot;anti-colonials&quot;, of undesirables such asHungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Albania, and of a candidate of suchquestionable qualifications as Outer Mongolia.
1^ b4.        But the Canadians are likely to insist on putting forward their proposal.   If we do not support it;(a) we shall be out of line with the Commonwealth.The Canadian proposals are supported by australia and the Soviet proposals by India0Both provide for the entry of Ceylon, who isparticularly anxious that the United kingdom should promote her admission and suspects thatwe are doing nothing to help;(b) the Russians would claim that we and the UnitedStates were responsible for blocking the admissionof the African and Asian candidates such as (apartfx*om Ceylon) Laos, Cambodia, Jordan, Libya andNepal.    They would make use of this to strengthen their influence in the Middle East and South east asia;(c) it would further delay the entry of such well-qualified states as Italy,   Finland and Portugal;(d) a continued deadlock, particularly on an issueof such public interest, would bring the united nations into disrepute.    Even if the United states were to take the initiative in opposing newadmissions &apos;en bloc&apos; the United Kingdom, becauseof her close links with the Middle East, theCommonwealth and South East Asia, would alsobe blamed.5.        I therefore propose to support the Canadian proposal with onemodification, namely that Spain, who has since applied for admission,must be added to the list.    The list would then comprise 18 states andunlike the Soviet list comprise all the outstanding applicants.    When thematter was last discussed in Cabinet the view was expressed that if wehad to agree to the admission of such countries as Outer Mongolia weshould take the initiative in seeking the admission of Spain (C.M.(55) 31stConclusions, Minute 7).    The inclusion of Spain would of course increasethe chance of securing American support of a Canadian proposal, amended as I suggest.recommendation.        I request the agreement of my colleagues to the course proposed in paragraph 5 above.H.M..Foreign Office, S.W.1.18th October, 1955.
