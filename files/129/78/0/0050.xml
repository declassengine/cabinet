1 (^^^ *&amp;a**,.rSECRETC.P.(55) 200 COPY NO14th December, 1955CABINETWHITE FISH SUBSIDYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodAuthority is given under the White Fish and Herring industries act of 1953 for the payment of white fish subsidy for the near and middlewater and the inshore fleets until 31st March, 1958.    The rates of subsidyare determined from time to time under schemes requiring the affirmative resolution of both Houses.    A scheme prescribing the rates and making certain cuts for the seven months January/July, 1956, has been laid andis to be taken next week.     Though the financial results of the industry asa whole have clearly improved the reductions proposed are arousingdisquiet in the industry and serious opposition in the House,2. While the industry as a whole is strongly opposed to any cutopposition from the Conservative Members is concentrated on the proposedcut for the inshore fleet (motor boats under 70 ft. in length) from thepresent figure of lOd. to 6d. per stone of white fish landed.    This cut of40 per cent is much larger than the cut being applied to the motor vessels of the near and middle water fleet (about 15 per cent), the case for whichcan be justified on the basis of known operating data.    The inshore fleet is mainly composed, however, of small working owners whose operatingaccounts are not available.3. The gross earnings of the inshore fleet have been improving -by 8 per cent in 1954 over 1953 and by a further 11 per cent in January/October, 1955, over the same period of 1954;   and a substantial number ofnew boats is being built with grant and loan assistance from the Exchequer.There are, however, three factors on the other side:(i)    Operating costs have been steadily rising and continueto do so.    We believe that the improvement inproceeds has more than kept pace, but exact and complete data are not available.(ii)    The actual level of profit in the inshore fleet isnot known.(iii)    The inshore fleet comprises a wide variety of boats and covers many kinds of fishing and the fleetis scattered all round the United Kingdom.    Whilemost sections may well be making reasonableprofits - and a survey carried out in 1952/53 gave evidence that it was so then - others almost certainly are not.
4. We consider that in view of the strength of the opposition thathas developed we shall have great difficulty in convincing the House of the merits of this particular cut when there are virtually no reliable costingsavailable^    One way of reducing the opposition would be to reduce the cut in the iSiiiSfsub sidy from 4d, to 2d.; . this would cost about  120, 000 ina full year.    A concession to the inshore fleet would however certainlyproduce demands from other sections of the industry for a reduction inthe cuts proposed to be made in their case.    In particular the Scottishsteam trawler owners have already indicated that they would expect a comparable concession to be made to them.5. We shall be glad to have the guidance of our colleagues asto how the situation should be handled.    The alternatives seem to us tobe   -(a) to reduce the proposed cut in the inshoresubsidy from 4d. to 2d.;      or(b) to stand on the Order as laid.In either case we suggest that an undertaking should be given that theposition will be reviewed in the spring and consideration given to thequestion of whether the purpose of the 1953 Act can be fulfilled before it expires in 1958.Jo S.D.H.A.I3th December, 1955.
