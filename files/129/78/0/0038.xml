In that discussion I undertook to have a survey made of the probable course ofGovernment expenditure on the social services during the next five years.I now attach a survey which has been prepared in the Treasury, in close consultation with the other Departments concerned.    The survey is based on existing policies and makes no allowance for any substantial forward move in policy, as distinct from development in the more or less normal courseof existing policies.2.      On the above basis the survey foreshadows an increase in government expenditure (including the Insurance Funds) on the social services from 2, 03 2 millions in the present financial year to  2, 3 69 millions in 196o/6l.This increase of  337 millions is mainly coiicentrated on four services -National Insurance ( 131 millions), Education ( 94 millions), National health service ( 72 millions) and Housing ( 17 millions).    The total increaserepresents a cumulative increase at the rate of about 3jj per cent per annum.3.     If the figures were confined to expenditure from the Exchequer(i. e. excluding the Insurance Funds) they would show an increase from 1,452 millions to  1, 737 millions in 1960/61, i. e. of  285 millions.    this represents a cumulative increase at the rate of about Z\ per cent per annum.4.      These prospective increases, whichever way one looks at them, are certainly formidable.    They show that the prospective rate of growth of this expenditure is greater than that of the Gross National Product (in real terms) in the five years from 1949 to 1954, which was 2;f per cent per annum.It was suggested at our discussion in July that we should have regard to thegrowth, not of the Gross National Product, but of the nation^ taxable capacity.     Any such conception is, however, very difficult to define: the yield of taxation at given rates depends on the level and distribution of thenational income and the pattern of national expenditure.    Moreover, itwould be altogether too depressing to assume that we shall not, in the next five years, make any further reductions in rates of taxes.5.     It is widely agreed that our present rates of taxation are already too high.    If we are to look for a reduction in the rates of taxation over ourexpected period of office, we must make changes to ensure that totalexpenditure does not rise as fast as the yield of revenue increases.

secret.P.(55) 183 COPY NO3rd December, 1955CABINETLCfSOCIAL SERVICES expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 5th July the Cabinet considered C. P.

that similar steps should now be taken to look at the forecasts of social services expenditure and consider what steps can be taken to moderate itsgrowth.6.     Major cuts in expenditure require major changes of policy and, apartfrom items like the remaining food subsidies (which have been included inthe present survey), major changes in policy will be slow to fructify in suchcuts.    If we are to produce significant results during the present Parliamentwe must start in good time.    And if unpleasant decisions have to be taken,the earlier in our period of office we take them, the less difficult they will be.7.     I do not, of course, ask for any decisions on policies at the presentmoment.    But I suggest that the Cabinet should now appoint a small committee of Ministers to consider the attached five-year survey and toreport to the Cabinet what changes of policy would be necessary to secure an appreciable reduction in the rate at which this social services expenditure is expected to grow.8.     If such a Committee is, as I hope it may be, set up forthwith, amongthe material which it will need to take into account is the Guillebaud Reporton the National Health Services, on which no doubt it will be necessary forthe Government to make a statement when the Report is published or whenthe House reassembles.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.2nd December, 1955,\
\ ISOCIAL SERVICES; EXPENDITURE IN THENEXT FIVE YEARSMemorandum by the treasury this memorandum has been prepared in accordance with the decisionof the Cabinet that a survey should be made of the probable course of Govern-ment expenditure on the social services over the next five years.2.      The survey has been carried out in close consultation with the Depart-ments concerned.    The resulting figures, which are those put forward bythe Departments themselves, are set out in Appendix I, and may besummarised as follows:-1955/56 1960/61 Increase  millions      millions     millions     %National Health Service	473	545	72	15.education	341	43 5	94	27.5Assistance, Family Allowances and &quot;War Pensions	325	334	9	2.housing	73	90	17	24.miscellaneous Services	50	52	2	2.3Bread and Milk Subsidies	76	83	7	9.2National Insurance and Industrial Injuries   x	679	810.	131	19.2Cost of tobacco concession	15	20	5	33. 5	2, 032	2,369	337	16.6x Expenditure of the Funds: of the increase of  131 millions, theExchequer would bear  78 millions.3.      The figures have been compiled on the basis of existing policy for each service, but it has been necessary for the Departments to make certain assumptions and these are set out below, together with the implications forthe future development of each service.     These are not &quot;Estimate&quot;figures in the customary annual sense;   the Departments are not committed to work within them, nor does the Treasury accept them as a basis for futureEstimates.It is assumed throughout that there is no general increase in costs and prices;  that the average number unemployed will be 300,000;  and thatthe x^resent basis of grants to local authorities is maintained.
4.      NATIONAL HEALTH service the forecast provides for bringing into use additional hospital accommodation arising from the building programme;  for improving, where necessary, facilities for diagnosis and treatment and talcing advantage of newdrugs and techniques;  for raising standards, for example of staffing anddiet where they are at present low;   and it assumes that the number of in-and out-patients will be increased.    In recent years an annual increaseaveraging about  5-1 millions (2 per cent) has been allowed for such improve-ments in England and Wales, and the forecast assumes an annual increase of 8 millions (the upper limit of a range of  6-8 millions indicated by theMinistry of Health), together with an allowance rising to about  -  million for bringing new major works into operation.    For Scotland the rate of increase assumed is proportionately a little more than the lower limit for england and Y/ales.For England and Wales the forecast assumes that in each of theyears 1958-59, 1959-60 and 1960-61,  10 millions worth of major hospital building schemes will be started.    This is the rate already announced for1957-58, and by 1960-61 will result in an annual expenditure of  10 millions.To this is to be added  13 millions in 1960-61 on lesser works, making anannual total of  23 millions.    Expenditure on hospital building in 1955-56 isrunning at  10 millions.    For Scotland it is assumed that the expenditure on capital works, large and small, will rise from  2.3 millions in 1955-56 to 3.9 millions in 1960-61, at which level it would still be proportionatelyabove the expenditure for England and Wales.The number of general practitioners is assumed to increase over thefive-year period by 7 per cent v/ith the result that  4 millions more will berequired on this account.    Local health authorities&apos; services are expectedto develop, partly to assist in the treatment of patients in their own homes and so help in relieving pressure on the hospitals;   the Health Departments&apos;grants are expected to increase by  4 millions (17 per cent).    Superannuationpayments are expected to increase by the same amount, owing to a larger number of retirements.    No provision is made for new services (e.g. vaccina-tion of children against poliomyelitis).5.      education the number of children in school (England and Wales) is likely toreach its peak in 1958, and in five years from now the total is likely to belittle larger than at present, and will be falling.    The forecast of theMinistry of Education thus implies an increase in cost per child in primary and secondary schools of the order of 25 per cent.    This follows from theassumption that teachers will continue to be recruited by local authorities at the present net rate of 6, 000 a year, so that the total number of teacherswould rise by.about 15 per cent over the period.    Some additional teachersare required to maintain the present ratio between pupils and teachers in secondary schools, which by I960-61 will have a much increased populationbecause of the &quot;bulge&quot;.      If all the other additional teachers went intoprimary schools, the number of children per teacher then would fall from 5 now to 30 in 1961, and all over-size primary classes could be abolished.The forecasts allow for the cost of implementing &quot;equal pay&quot; butassume the passage of legislation to increase teachers&apos; superannuationcontributions.    It is assumed that the present level of educational building will continue, partly to accommodate the increase in secondary pupils,partly to provide for children in new housing areas and partly to improveconditions in other parts of the educational field.
The forecast of the Scottish Education Department assumes continua-tion of the Goschen formula (whereby the greater part of the Vote forScottish education is under Statute fixed each year at eleven-eightieths or13.75 per cent of what is required for the corresponding services inEngland and Wales).    The school population of Scotland is at present about 13, 5 per cent of that of England and Wales and by 1960-61 is expectedto have fallen to about 13 pev cent,so that Scotland would be getting an increasing grant per child compared with England and Wales.The forecast for universities assumes that the present annual rateof increase is maintained, but this is without prejudice to the decision ofpolicy which will be required when the grants are fixed for the nextquinquennium starting in 1957.6.     ASSISTANCE, FAMILY ALLOWANCES AND WAR pensions the bulk of the provision required for the National Assistance Boardrelates to payments to people in need.    The scale rates of national assistance must provide subsistence and increases in them tend to followquickly after price increases.    In February, 1955, the rates were raisedby Zs. 6d. to 37s. 6d. for a single person (63s. for a married couple) plusrent.    Much of the benefit of this increase has already been offset by higher prices of food and fuel, and it would be unrealistic to assume that thecurrent scale rates can remain unchanged over the next five years.Allowance has been made also for some increase in numbers.    The forecast for 1960-61 shows an increase of  15,3 millions over 1955-56,The forecast for Family Allowances assumes that the presentallowance (8s.) will remain unchanged.    The increase in expenditure on this service in 1960-61 over 1955-56,  5.8 millions, is mainly due to the natural increase in the number of eligible children;  about  2 millions of theincreased cost would arise from the operation of the proposed Bill to extend to 18 years the upper age-limit for children at school and apprentices.The forecast for War Pensions assumes that the current rate ofpensions and allowances will be maintained throughout the five-year period.The steady decline in expenditure over the period,  12 millions, is due tothe decrease in the number of pensioners as a result of death, recovery orremarriage.7.     housing the forecast for housing in England and Wales is based on the assumptions that the present standard housing subsidy from the Exchequer( 22 Is, Od, for sixty years) will be maintained only for slum clearance, and replaced by a subsidy of  10 for houses built for general needs and a subsidy of  24 for houses built for overspill, with adjustments also in thespecial subsidies for flats;   and the numbers of subsidised houses completed in a financial year will fall as in Appendix II from the current figure of160, 000 to 120, 000 by 1957-58, remaining thereafter at that level.    In the forecast for Scotland, it is assumed that the present Scottish subsidies willremain unchanged, and that the numbers of subsidised houses completedwill fall from 34, 000 in 1955-56 to 23, 000 in 1960-61.    No allowance ismade for reductions in the Scottish housing subsidies which it is contemplatedwill come into effect after legislation amending the Scottish rating system.
8.    CONSUMER SUBSIDIESThe estimates for the bread subsidy assume the present price for wheat, no increase in baking and distribution costs, and no increase in the retail price of bread.    Those for milk assume no increase in distributioncosts beyond that now under negotiation, no increase in retail prices, no increase in the price guaranteed to farmers, and no change in the level ofproduction and consumption.The tobacco concession to old-age pensioners is a remission of duty,and has the effect of reducing the revenue from the tobacco duty.    Theestimate takes account of the expected increase in the number of old-age pensioners, and makes allowance for a continuing increase in the proportionof smokers among them.9.    MISCELLANEOUS services the principal assumptions under this heading are, first, that byI960-61 the Government will have introduced the legal advice service and legal aid in criminal proceedings, and second, that the number of disabled persons employed by Remploy will rise from 6, 000 this year to 7, 000 inI960-61 (a matter which is still under discussion).10.    NATIONAL INSURANCE AND INDUSTRIAL INJURIESIn making these forecast estimates of expenditure from the national insurance and Industrial Injuries Funds the Government Actuary has assumed that the average number unemployed will be 300, 000 (in recent months, about200, 000) and that current sickness experience will continue throughout thefive-year period.    The forecasts of total expenditure from both Funds in1960-61, showing an increase of  131 millions over the current year (of which 78 millions would fall on Votes), are much lower than previous forecastsmainly for the reason that these were based on a 4 per cent rate ofunemployment and higher sickness experience;  if the 4 per cent rate were used, the expenditure from the Funds in 1960-61 would be  56 millions higher,at  866 millions.    The main reason for the heavy increase in expenditure oninsurance benefits is the growth in the number of retirement pensioners, whichaccounts for  106 millions out of the increase in expenditure of  131 millions.In particular, large numbers of people who were brought into insurance forthe first time at a late age in 1948 will qualify for pension in 1958, i, e. on completion of 10 years in insurance.These forecasts make no provision for adjustments or increases in national Insurance or Industrial Injuries benefit which, at some time duringthe period under review, may result from revisions of the Scheme, e.g.because of recommendations of the National Insurance Advisory Committee,or frpm increases in the cost of living.11.    conclusion the probable increase of expenditure in the next five years, on thebasis of present policy and on the assumptions made, will be about 337 millions, or nearly 17 per cent.    The increase is fairly evenly spreadover the period;  for the first year, 1956-57, it will be  95 millions.Further increases in costs and prices would of course lead to a muchgreater rise in expenditure, but such increases affect both sides of theBudget.    Even a small increase in unemployment above 300, 000 would
increase the actual expenditure substantially.    The assumptions are otherwise!conservative in that, while providing for improved standards in the educational!;and health services, and over 600, 000 more subsidised houses, they do not allow for new services or for improvements in the scope and amount ofpension and other National Insurance benefits.Other assumptions could have produced a smaller increase in totalexpenditure: for example, a slower intake of teachers, with consequentlyless increase in the cost per child;   a slower development of the national health Service, both in current and in capital cost;  an increase of rentswhich would make possible a reduction of subsidies both on new and on existing houses;  a reorganisation of grants to local authorities which would reduce the Exchequers share of increases in expenditure.    It would there-fore seem possible, if decisions were taken sufficiently early, to preventas rapid a growth of expenditure as the estimates would indicate.December, 1955
