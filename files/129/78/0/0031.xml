ANNEXANTARCTICAIntroduction-The Argentine and&apos;Chile have 30th refused Lo accept the International Courfsjurisdiction or arbitration by an indcpendenl tribunaroverthe Antarctic problems.As soon as we receive notification front the Registrar of the Court that the casehas.been withdrawn from the Courfs calendar we shall be &quot;free to take any action-we,wish:-&apos;to assert our rights in tlie Antarctic, and from the jegal^point ofviewthe. earlier we do. so the better. Politically the coming Antarctic season wouldbe the best time. Evictions in the following two seasons would probably be fat-more difficult, since activities in connection with the forthcoming InternationalGeophysical&apos; Year (I.G.Y.) are likely to have profound effects upon the balanceof power in the Antarctic.Alternative Courses   ..2. The Foreign OHice and the Cabinet Ollice have listed three possible courses of action, and Ihey consider that the best of Lhese would be to removecertain selected Argentinian and Chilean bases.liases to be Removed3.   The Foreign Office suggest two alternatives:  (a) To. remove Argentinian and Chilean bases on Deception Island only.These consist of one manned and two unmanned Argentinian bases and. one manned Chilean base. :.. &apos;(b) To remove all the Argentinian and Chilean bases upon which we havea strong, very strong or absolutely water-tight legal claim. In additionto those1 listed at paragraph 3 (a), these consist of three mannedArgentinian bases: Half iVloon Island, Hope Bay and Barry Island,plus two Chilean bases on Greenwich&apos;island, one of which is manned.&apos;4. - They would prefer1 action on the lines of.3 (/;) above, and state that themost convenient moment for this operation would be early in January 1956, afterthe end.of the United Nations General Assembly&apos;s session. They add: that itwould be convenient to be able to deliver an ultimatum to the Argentine andChile to abandon their bases or to submit them to our administrative control about one month in advance of the operation.    .Foreign Office. Questions5.   The Foreign Office have asked for our views on the following points:  (a) Are the proposed operations feasible from the military point of view?lb) What is the strength of the forces likely to be required to carry out theoperation, and can such forces be made available?. (c) Will the ultimatum proposed in paragraph 4 above, by eliminating the element of surprise, reduce the chances of success?   If so, should theoperation be prepared and carried out in complete secrecy?FACTORS AFFECTING THE. operation the Tripartite Naval Declaration6. The Tripartite Naval Declaration as agreed between the United Kingdom,the Argentine and Chile limits .lhe number of warships signatories may havesouth of 60 degrees South at any one time. This agreement is reviewed annuallyin about November. It is very convenient to all three parties and we have nowish to see it denounced.Forces in the Area &apos;..&apos;.- . ;7.   Under the agreement the forces normally operating-in1&apos;the area are:  (a) United Kingdom. One warship, which will be H.M.S. Protector, a. /convertedI net layer of. 3,500 tons armed with a twin 4-inch and two&quot;twin Oerlikon guns.; She will have on board&apos; a platoon of Royal&apos; Marines :and&apos;two S-55 helicopters.&apos; There will also be the Royal. - Research Ship JoluiBiscoe and a&apos;small supply ship.
(b) The Argentine. Two armed transports, one unarmed tanker, two armedtugs, one unarmed tug, one ice-breaker and some aircraft (last seasonthere were two reconnaissance&apos;aircraft and four helicopters).(c) Chile. One frigate, which spends most of its time at Punta Arenas,.one;. armed tanker, two unarmed lugs, and some aircraft.  .Other Forces8. (a) United Kingdom. In January 1956 H.M.S. Kenya and three frigatesof the 7th Frigate Squadron will be on the American and West IndiesStation, and two frigates on the South Atlantic Station. No air support is possible unless carriers were provided from the Home orMediterranean Stations.(b) The Argentine. The Argentinian Navy includes 5 cruisers, 11 destroyers,7 frigates and 3 submarines. Their Air Force contains Lincoln andLancaster Bombers which have been used for dropping supplies ontheir bases. They also possess a number of types of aircraft whichare suitable for Antarctic operations.(c) Chile. The Chilean Navy includes 2 cruisers, 6 destroyers, 6 frigates and 2 submarines. They also possess a number of types of aircraft which are suitable for Antarctic operations.Geographical Considerations9. The whole coastline of the Antarctic Continent is normally girdled withice, except posssibly during the late summer months December, January and february. In February and March the extent of pack ice is least; its main limit is approximately the 70th Parallel. However, local weather can block a bay orharbour with ice in a short time and render it temporarily inaccessible. For thisreason a pre-arranged programme cannot always be adhered to by ships in the antarctic, and there is always a danger of ships being trapped in the ice. Althoughthe Americans plan to have ice-breakers in the area during their expedition inconnection with the Geophysical Year, the only ice-breaker normally employedin the area belongs to the Argentine. We may at any time, particularly during the expedition in connection with the Geophysical Year and the Trans-Polar Journey,have to ask for the help of the Argentine ice-breaker, and this would be particularlyembarrassing should we have previously attempted to remove Argentinian bases.10. Minor landing operations are feasible in the season at all the basesreferred to in paragraph 3 above.OUR VIEWSGeneral11. The action proposed by the Foreign Office is in effect police action insupport of our legal claims in Antarctica. To be feasible, any plan for carryingout the whole or part of the operation must provide for countering interferenceor retaliation from Argentinian or Chilean forces.12. In order to avoid being the first to break the Tripartite Naval Declaration,or giving the other signatories cause to do so, we should have to carry out theoperation with our ships stationed in the area. Furthermore, if we are to abide by the purpose of the Declaration, which is to avoid any misunderstanding inAntarctica, we should give warning of our intentions.Possible Argentinian and Chilean Reactions13. We think it unlikely that either the Argentine or Chile would abrogatethe Tripartite Declaration as a result of a warning, but they would undoubtedlyalert their forces in the area. Their ships already outnumber British ships inthe area, and having been alerted, would be in a better position to interfere withany of our operations.14. There is a risk that action by H.M.S. Protector against Argentinian orChilean bases might result in retaliatory military action by these countries. Theycould if they wished reinforce the area more rapidly than we could. Her Majesty&apos;ambassador has stated that in his view no Argentine Government-particularly

the new one which has just&apos;come into power could afford to overlook suchan affront to the national dignity in Antarctica. We should have to be prepared,therefore, for the Argentinian and Chilean Governments; to take action tore-establish their bases, supported by their naval forces.Strategic Considerations15. Our strategic requirements in this sector of Antarctica are adequatelymet by our possession of the Falkland Islands. We can see no justification on strategic grounds for the operation contemplated.16. Before any action against the bases could be&apos; taken, a large navalsupporting force would have to be provided. Due to the remoteness of Antarctica,it would be necessary to maintain this force permanently in the vicinity, to enablecounter-action to be effective in time. Such a force could only be provided at theexpense of denuding the Home and Mediterranean Fleets, and at heavy cost.On strategic grounds, we arc emphatically of the opinion that an increased and continuing commitment in the.area should be avoided.Conclusion17.   We conclude that (a) There is no strategic justification for the operation contemplated.(/;) The operation is not feasible with the ships we at present plan to have inthe area under the Tripartite Naval Declaration.(c) To ensure our ability to carry out the operation successfully and to maintain our position in the face of possible Argentinian and Chilean reaction,. it would be necessary, in advance of the operation, lo despatch strongnaval reinforcements to the vicinity, and to maintain them theresubsequent&apos;to the operation.   As these naval forces could only be. - provided at the expense of denuding the Home and MediterraneanFleets and at great cost, we are strongly opposed to the operation.(Signed)       MOUNTBATTEN OF BURMA.GERALD TEMPLER.RONALD 1VELAW-CHAPMAN(for Chief of Air Staff).
