12.7this document is the property of her britannic majestvs government  The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No...C.P.(55) 17415th November, 1955CABINETTHE DEFENCE OF HONG Kong memorandum bv the Minister of defence on 15th September the Defence Committee invited me tosubmit a memorandum on the future strength of the Hong Kong garrisonfor consideration by the Cabinet (D0C.(55) 9th Meeting, Item 2).2. The present role of the garrison at Hong Kong is laid downas being:&quot;to demonstrate British determination to defend the Colony against attack;   to impose sufficientdelay to allow reinforcements to cover an orderly evacuation and to show the Chinese thatan attack on the Colony would mean war;  and tomaintain internal security&quot;,3. The existing garrison, details of which are given in Annex I,is the minimum required to carry out this role.    It comprises the bestpart of an infantry division plus one R.A.F, fighter squadron.    If the role of the garrison were restricted to the maintenance of internal security, it could be reduced to one brigade group and an auxiliary airforce squadron (see Annex II),4. In February, 1954, on the advice of the Chiefs of Staff, theDefence Committee approved in principle the reduction of the garrisonto the level required for internal security, but because of subsequentuncertainties in the political situation, the reduction was not carried out.In March 1955, when there appeared to be a serious risk of war breakingout orer the off-shore islands, the Committee decided that the reductionof the garrison should be deferred indefinitely.5. In view of the relaxation of tension in the Far East, the Chiefsof Staff on 13th September reviewed the matter and recommended that thegarrison should be reduced to the level required for internal security and that a start should be made as soon as possible, but that to minimise the political difficulties in Hong Kong, reduction should be madeinconspicuously by stages.6. In the Defence Committee on 15th September, the colonial secretary raised a number of objections to this proposal. They can besummarised as follows:
1 22a(a) The plan for the evacuation from Hong Kong ofBritish and Chinese residents, in the event ofan attack by China,  will be very largelyfrustrated since a force of one brigade groupcannot be expected to hold an attack long enoughto make orderly evacuation possible.(b) The life of Hong Kong depends on confidence.ITvaqp-fizxt Iviicisterial statements have beenma.de to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment intend to maintain their position in Hong -Kong, and the presence of considerable british forces in the. Colony has given substance tothese statements.    A reduction in these forces,however circumspectly carried out, is bound indue course to become widely known, and only toolikely to be taken as reflecting a less confidentview of the Colony&apos;s future.(c) Even more serious v/ould be the effect on Asianand world opinion generally.    In the colonial secretary&apos;s opinion,  it is too soon to judge whether the apparent easing of international tension is real or will endure;   and a reductionin the Hong Kong garrison at this time would be interpreted as a weakening of our determination to resist aggression by the Chinese, or at least as a premature acceptance of a change in Chineseintentions.(d) The reduction of the garrison to a point where itcould offer no effective resistance to a coup byChinese military forces could offer a dangeroustemptation.    The Chinese Government might wellestimate that seizure of the Colony with compara-tively little blood-shed would not necessarily involved them in full war.7. In discussion at the Defence Committee, the point was made that the real defence of Hong Kong lies not in the strength of the garrison,which, even at its present level could not repel an outright attack, butin the realisation by the Chinese that such an attack would precipitate afull-scale war.    As to the psychological effect in Hong Kong and else-where in Asia of a reduction in the garrison, opinions will obviouslydiffer.8. The Commanders -in-Chief have also put forward similararguments to those in sub-paragraphs 6(a),  (b) and (c) above againstreduction of the garrison, and made the further point that a reducedgarrison could not deal with infiltration over the border as well asmaintain internal security.    Nevertheless the Chiefs of Staff, havingconsidered this point, confirmed their recommendation that the garrisonshould be reduced to the forces required for internal security.    I support their recommendation.    V/e cannot afford to be strong everywhere,  andthe current examination of our long term defence programme shows that itis essential to reduce our overseas commitments wherever possible.We must seize every opportunity to reduce our forces abroad to theminimum necessary to meet our long-term commitments, and I believe
that the present situation in the Far East makes it a justifiable risk to put this policy into practice in the case of Hong Kong,9. The least obtrusive way of carrying out a reduction would beto withdraw units as they become due for relief at intervals over a long period.    Annex III contains a tentative programme for the reduction ofthe garrison in all arms to the level required for internal security,should the Cabinet so decide.     These plans could not for long be keptfrom becoming general knowledge in the Colony.    It may, however, bepossible to allay local apprehension by stressing our policy of holdingstrategic reserves and our ability at need to reinforce.Recommendation10.         I invite the Cabinet:(a) to agree that the garrison of Hong Kong should bereduced to those forces required for internal security, as shown in Annex II and that plans should be made accordingly;(b) to approve provisionally a programme for this reduction on the lines of that suggested in annex III;(c) to approve the withdrawal of a field artilleryregiment in January, 1956, and a British battalion in August, 1956.S.L.Ministry of Defence, S.V7.1.15th November, 1955.ANNEX IGARRISON OF HONG KONGMajor Units, October 1955ARMYArmouredArmoured Regiments 1ArtilleryField Regiments 2Medium Regiments 1Light Anti-Aircraft Regiments 1Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments 1InfantryInfantry battalions 6-3-

These timings have been adjusted from the strict dates when the units are due for relief so that the run down would be completed in accordancewith the long-tei&apos;m defence plans for the Army.     The dates should beregarded as approximate only, as they would need to be fitted to thetrooping programme.     They might also need adjustment to allow forthe withdrawal of the R.A.F, squadron which can take place at anytime.
