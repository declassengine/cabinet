Primed for the Cabinet.  December 1955SECRETCP. (55) 20115th December, 1955CABINET20 M.P.H. SPEED LIMITMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationMy colleagues will be aware that there has been for many years persistentpressure both inside and outside Parliament to raise to 30 m.p.h. the present speed limit of 20 m.p.h. for heavy goods vehicles. This limit applies to all rigid goods vehicles of over 3 tons unladen weight, to all articulated vehicles (of whateverweight) and to goods vehicles pulling separate trailers.2. So far as the first two of these categories are concerned, the pressure toraise the limit is the more difficult to resist because the case for doing so is on merits quite unanswerable. In the first place it is quite impossible to enforce thelimit. It is well known that, although drivers&apos; schedules have to be drafted onthe basis of a 20 m.p.h. limit, in fact this speed is constantly exceeded and the timesaved used by the drivers for their own purposes. Even if it were enforced andenforceable, the old argument that it contributed to road safety is in my judgmentno longer valid. There has been an immense improvement in the brakingefficiency of goods vehicles, and on heavily trafficked roads the driving of suchvehicles at 20 m.p.h., with its infuriating effect on traffic that desires to pass,would on balance operate against road safety.3. Since 1948 when Mr. Alfred Barnes, Minister of Transport in the labour government, made a gallant effort to effect this change, the sole reason for not making it has been the effect on industrial relations in the industry. The transport and General Workers Union (T.G.W.U.) are opposed to the change at least unless itis accompanied by some compensating increase in the remuneration of the drivers.4. I have some sympathy with the desire of the union to secure that the fruits of the increased productivity of the industry which would result from thechange are not solely absorbed by the employers. There are indeed a limited number of cases, e.g., on night runs from London to Manchester, where the fasterschedules which would result from the change might involve a man in doing thesame job for less money by reason of his being deprived of the overtime payments which he at present gets. The industrial question is further complicated becausewhile the T.G.W.U. represent a large number of the drivers of the &quot; A &quot; and&quot; B &quot; licensed vehicles, i.e., those engaged on trunk services and haulage work, theydo not on the whole represent the drivers employed on the &quot; C &quot; licensed vehicles,i.e., those used to transport the firm&apos;s own goods in its own vehicles. It is not thought that there is any resistance to this change among those drivers.5. In January 1953, Lord Leathers and Mr. Lennox-Boyd, at that timeMinister of Transport, suggested to the Home Affairs Committee that the change should be made; the Committee agreed in principle but suggested that certain further soundings be taken about the timing of an announcement (H.A. (53)5th Meeting, Item 3). Those soundings resulted in no action being then takenlargely, I understand, by reason of the fear that in the atmosphere among thedrivers caused by disposals under the Transport Act, 1953, it would be unwise totake this step.6. I discussed this matter with the late Mr. Arthur Deakin of the T.G.W.U.,in the spring, and his advice was that, while this would clearly have to be done, itwould be unwise to do it while the men were still disturbed by road haulagedisposals.7. In view of the approaching end of the disposals operation, I have had, withthe knowledge of the Minister of Labour, a series of discussions during the last fewCopy No.   6649236
months with representatives of the various kinds of employer, and with the actingGeneral Secretary of the T.G.W.U. I expect no difficulty if the change is made for&quot; C &quot; licensed vehicles. Mr. Cousins of the T.G.W.U. has expressed the view tome that he has no fears that the big &quot; C &quot; licence employers will behave other thansensibly, and I have informal assurances from several of the largest of these thatwhen a change is announced they will discuss revised schedules with their men onthe basis of sharing the increased productivity of the industry. My information isthat serious trouble in the British Road Services fleet is unlikely as long as theUnions (and the men) are given ample notice of the change, and time to negotiate.8. The difficulty remains in the private enterprise section of the &quot; A &quot; and&quot; B &quot; licence field. The Road Haulage Association (R.H.A.) remain of the viewthat it is the duty of the Government to make the Order raising the limit, since,the merits are hardly in dispute, and are unwilling to negotiate in advance. Equallythe T.G.W.U. are suspicious of the R.H.A.9.   I have come to the conclusion that it is not possible to take these discussionsany further and I understand that the Minister of Labour concurs in this view.10.   The point for decision is therefore whether we should now raise the limitand face such trouble in the long-distance haulage field as may arise.11.   I am of the opinion that we should proceed as suggested in the following paragraph.12. After preliminary warning to employers and employed an announcement should be made, say, at the end of January, that it is intended to make an Orderraising the limit for rigid goods vehicles of over 3 tons unladen weight and forarticulated vehicles (but not for goods vehicles pulling separate trailers) in theearly summer. The interval would allow time for negotiation which I am convincedwill now only take place against the background of a firm decision that the limit .is to be raised. I have been advised, also, that there are certain advantages fromthe point of view of the psychology of the drivers of securing that the change takes place at a time of year when there is a long period of daylight.13. There are of course certain risks of trouble involved. But it is worthpointing out that the change would only be permissive in effect. The actualalteration of schedules is a matter for detailed negotiation between employersand employed and given time to work this out I see no reason why a fairly slowchange to somewhat faster schedules should not be peacefully negotiated. if negotiations fail the change would not in fact prevent existing schedules continuing to be worked. I have little doubt that in the &quot; C &quot; licence field, which is the biggestin the industry, the change would go through peacefully.14. In the present economic climate it is very difficult to retain a restrictionwhich diminishes productivity and which has no justification on the merits. It isalso becoming increasingly politically difficult to hold it. The matter has been raised frequently in both Houses. In the House of Lords on 1st March last theLord Chancellor gave an undertaking that he would take the matter up with theMinister of Labour and myself in order to make another attempt to solve this problem. In the House of Commons an amendment has been put down by anumber of Conservative Members to the Road Traffic Bill now in StandingCommittee and I am of the opinion that unless I can give some indication of progress in this direction it is quite possible that this amendment will be carried.15. The change in fact does not require legislation but could be effected by statutory instrument subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.16. I therefore recommend that I be authorised to make a statement at anearly and appropriate date that it is intended to raise the speed limit for the two categories of vehicles mentioned in paragraph 12 above from 20 to 30 m.p.h.from a date some months in advance. I would at the same time make certainadjustments in the speed limit of heavy locomotives which are at present restricted to 5 m.p.h. This proposal was circulated to representative organisations in 1951and aroused no comment. It has been held up simply because of its possible repercussions on the 20-mile limit for the 3-ton goods vehicles.17. I understand that the Minister of Labour agrees with thisrecommendation.J. A. B.-C.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W, 1,13th December, 1955.
