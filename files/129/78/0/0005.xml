THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.Pn(55) 155 COPY NO.   L 17th October, 1955CABINETHOUSING SUBSIDIES bill memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentOn 21st September the Cabinet discussed C.P.(55) 128 givingmy broad proposals for cutting housing subsidies and for reducing thehouse &quot;building programme of local authorities (C.M.(55) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 1).    Subsequently the Prime Minister authorised me to open discussions on this basis with the local authority associations.2.        As was to be expected, the local authority associationsexpressed vigorous opposition to any reduction in subsidies.    In fact,they argued that, in view of the rise in interest rates, the subsidiesought rather to be increased,3.        These protests have not altered my opinion that the proposedcuts in the subsidies are by no means unreasonable and will certainly not make it financially impossible for local authorities to build houses and let them at rents which the tenants can afford to pay.    At the sametime, I have little doubt that the cuts in the subsidies will have theeffect of reducing the total number of council houses built.4.        The details of my proposals for amending the rates of subsidy-are set out fully in the Annex to this paper.    It will be seen that thenew rates proposed are, in important respects, significantly lower thanthose which I suggested earlier to the Cabinet.    For example, the newrate proposed for houses to replace slums (which may before longrepresent nearly three-quarters of the whole local authority house&quot;building programme) is only  20, as compared with the  24 which I was authorised to offer.5.        I invite my colleagues to authorise me to submit forthwith tothe Legislation Committee a Bill embodying the proposals set out inthe Annex and to introduce it when Parliament reassembles.D.S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.116th October, 1955.
Houses (including flats in blocks of not more than 3 storeys)1.        The standard subsidy at present payable on all houses built by local authorities is  22. 1. 0. per house per year.2.        It is proposed to abolish this and replace it by new ratesdifferentiated according to the purpose for which the houses are built,as follows(a)  10 per house for houses built for general needs(L ea for purposes other than thosespecified below).(b)  20 per house for houses provided in connectionwith slum clearance.(c)  24 per house for houses provided by New town development Corporations or by Councils of&quot;expanded&quot; towns for the accommodation of&quot;overspill&quot; population from the big towns.(In this connection, power will be taken toenable the Minister, for a period not exceed-ing ten years, to recover from the councils of &quot;exporting areas&quot; 50 per cent of any contribution paid by the Minister under existing powers, in lieu of a rate contribution).(d)  24 per house for houses built (with theMinisters approval) to accommodate incomingworkers needed to man up important industries(e0 ga for additional miners to work inexpanding pits).(e)  19 per house for houses provided in small groups and in isolated areas for the agricultural population.Flats in blocks of 4 storeys and upwards3.       At present a basic subsidy of  56, 8. 0. per flat per year andis payable on all flats with lifts, regardless of height.4.        It is proposed to replace this by new rates differentiated onthe same basis as for houses^ and varying according to the number ofstoreys, as follows:-^ storeys     5-8 storeys   Over 8 storeys(a) Flats for general needs  20  35  42(b) Flats for slum clearance,  30  45  52overspill, and approvedindustrial expansion,,PR.OPOSED CONTENTS OF HOUSING SUBSIDIES BILL
5.        An additional subsidy is at present payable (on a scale related to the cost of the land) for flats built on sites costing  1,500 or moreper acre, and for houses built on sites costing  3,000 or more per acre,6.        It is proposed that this additional subsidy should no longer be payable in either case until the site cost reaches  4,000.    otherwise the conditions governing the additional subsidy would remain unchanged,,Miscellaneous small subsidies7.        In addition, there are at present five other small subsidiespayable on new houses.    It is proposed to alter two of these as followss-(a) The subsidy for privately-built houses forthe agricultural population is to bereduced from  15 to  10,(b) The little used special subsidy for poor author-ities in areas where rents are exceptionallylow is to be abolished.Assistance in exceptional cases8.        It is proposed to empower the Minister, at his discretion, topay additional subsidy in exceptional cases where the provision ofurgently needed houses would place an unreasonable financial burden on the local authority.    This power will be limited by a proviso that thetotal subsidy may not be increased beyond a maximum of  30 for a house and  40 for a flat.     (This will not apply to houses or flats built forpurposes of overspill or approved industrial expansion, for which higher rates are in any case to be paid).Power to reduce or abolish subsidies9,        It is proposed to take power to reduce or abolish any or all of the subsidies on new dwellings by Order subject to affirmative resolution.Rate contributions by local authorities10.      At present local authorities are required by law to make a prescribed contribution from the rates for every house on which an exchequer subsidy is paid.    It is proposed to abolish this obligationin respect of all houses, whether already built or to be built in future,(subject to the exception in paragraph 11 below).Special contributions by County Councils11.      In certain cases, (usually where houses are built by district councils for the agricultural population, with the help of the specialsubsidy from the Exchequer referred to in paragraph 2(e) above) countycouncils are required to make a prescribed contribution from the countyrate.    It is proposed that this obligation should be maintained.Date of operation12.      It is proposed that the new rates of subsidy should apply to anydwellings for which tenders are approved by the local authority after thedate on which these changes are announced to Parliament.-2-
