(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. ^ k1st Novemberf 1955CABINETASWAN HIGH DAKNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach for the consideration of my colleagues a memorandum which has been prepared by officials on the subject of the Aswan High Dam,Z.       As will be seen, this memorandum sets out three possible alternative courses of action, namely. -(a) to accept the risks of financing the project ourselves with the co-operation of the French and german governments;(b) to encourage the Egyptian Government to seek a loan from the International Bank for reconstruction and Development from which the project would be financed without the need for any further assistance;(c) that, in addition to a loan from the International 3an2;sthe Egyptian Government should seek either grantaid or an Export/import Bank Loan from the UnitedStates Administration.    The United Kingdom Govern-ment would have to make it clear that they could not themselves give any grant aid.33        The memorandum by officials recommends that we should reject the first of these courses,,    In view of our balance of payments position Ithink we should be unwise to undertake to under-pin the Egyptian economyfor the next 15 years or so, as described in paragraphs 4-7 of the memo-randum - that is, without the help of the United States Government at leastbehind us.    I feel that this view is right even if we have the help of theFrench and German Governments.    The latest reports from our ambassador in Cairo show that the Egyptian Government seem to recognise that it wouldbe prudent for them to seek a loan from the International Bank.40        The memorandum by officials recommends that we should prefercourse (b) if it in fact proves practicable^ and that we should explore this possibility further with Mre Black (President of the International Bank)through Sir Roger Makins, our Ambassador in Washington, andLord Harcourt, the United Kingdom Executive Director of the International -Bank.    The officials recognise that it is possible that the Bank would refuse to grant a loan unless the project has also the economic support ofthe United States Government.    This is the view of the United StatesSECRETC.P0(55) 168
TP2&quot;Administration who have proposed that half the foreign exchange cost of the project should be met by grant aid given in equal amounts by the UnitedStates and United Kingdom Governments,50        My ov/n view is that these doubts are well founded and that we shall find that the only practicable course is in fact the third suggested in theofficial memorandums    If this is so I think we should be well advised tomake up our minds to adopt this course at once.    We may lose muchvaluable time by putting to Mrc Black suggestions which he is extremely unlikely to accept,,    The Egyptian Minister of Finance is corning to london in a little over a week&apos;s time to discuss the project and it is important that we should be able to put a clear proposal to hima60        I therefore recommend that my colleagues should decide now toadopt course (c) in the memorandum and that instructions should accordingly be prepared for Sir Roger Makins and Lord Harcourt to continue discussions in Washington on these linese    If the United States succeed in bringing inthe Bank then so much the better; but we should make our advance on thebasis of course (c).    In the meantime I should be authorised to explain tothe Egyptian Minister of Finance next week that we think that the matter should be handled in this wayeR*AoB,Treasury Chambers, Sa W, 1,1st November- 19550
ASWAN HIGR DAMMemorandum by officials on 25th October the Cabinet agreed that, before embarking on anindependent course of action in regard to the financing of the High Dam atAswan, we should have further conversations both with the international bank and with the United States Administration and should explore thepossibility of their giving financial support for the construction of the Damby the Anglo-French-German Consortium (C0 M. (55) 37th Conclusions,Minute 3)u20        The outcome of the conversations which have taken place with theBank and the United States Government is set out in \7ashington telegramsNosft 2584, 2595, 2596 and 2605e    Apart from some statistical differences between the American estimates of the cost of the project and our ownswhich are being examined as a matter of urgencys the position whichemerges is as followss-(i)    Both the United States Administration and MrB Black,the President of the International Bank, insist thatif the Bank is to make a loan the contract must beput out to international tender in one form or another; and(ii)    The United States Administration is now convinced thatthe only satisfactory solution to the problem offinance is for the International Bank to make a loanequivalent to 50 per cent of the foreign exchange costof the project and for the United States and UnitedKingdom Governments to provide by grant aid theremaining 50 per cento    Whether the American aidwere provided from Congressional appropriation orby way of an Export/import Bank Loan, the UnitedStates Government have let it be known that it wouldhave to be expended on goods and services from theUnited States;  this would mean that the basis of theexisting Consortium, if it were to secure the contract,would have to be widened to embrace a number ofUnited States firms, presumably up to 25 per cent at least of the total membership.    Alternatively,at the very minimum a large proportion of the sub-contracting work and the supply of equipment wouldhave to be in American hands.(iii)   H. Mo Ambassador has expressed the view that a decisionto authorise the immediate signature of a contractby the Consortium would effectively preclude anyparticipation by either the United States Govern-ment or the International Bank.3B Three alternative courses seem open to Her Majestyrs Government,These ares-
to abandon any further effort to secure international bank and United States Government assistances toback the Consortium in its forthcoming negotiations,assuming that the French and German governments will do likewise, and to accept with them thefinancial risks of default by the Egyptian governments to continue to negotiate for International Bank participa-tion9 accepting that this means international competition for the Consortium,,    In view of the work  the Consortium has already done on the project, wemay hope that it would secure the contract?  orto accept the United States Governments- thesis that theonly solution lies in joint Bank/United States/UnitedKingdom participation and to widen the basis of the consortium to include American firms,4a        Course (a) offers the best hope of avoiding the danger that theSoviet bloc might seucre the contract, and would ensure substantial business for United Kingdom contractors.     On the other hand the financial riskswould be very serious0    The cost of the dam and all its associated hydro-electric and irrigation works (including that part of the work which would be executed by the Consortiumas well as other secondary work) has been putby the International Bank at some  500 millions? of which at least 140 millions would be in foreign exchange.     The sum which Her MajestyJsGovernment would be called on to underwrite would be one-third of thelatter sum (io e, about  45 millions), the French and German Governmentspresumably accepting responsibility for the remaining two-thirds, and trieEgyptian Government shouldering all liability for the local currency costof  360 millions (viz,  500 millions less  140 millions).    In the view ofthe Treasury, which appears to be shared by the International Bank and bytire United States Government, a foreign exchange cost of  140 millions,even spread over ten years or more, taken in conjunction with all the other commitments in which the Egyptian Government are likely to become involvedgis beyond Egypt!s capabilities.    It appears to be generally accepted that even with a strictly controlled programme of foreign spending Egypt will needanything from  50 millions to  70 millions from outside sources,    Withoutoutside aid Egypt would be virtually bound to default on some foreignpayments and, no doubttf if she had to choose between meeting the billspresented by the Consortium, paying for food imports for her population andpurchasing arms, it would be the first which would suffer,59        It has been suggested that a safeguard against default could be found by linking the releases of blocked sterling which Egypt is to receive duringthe next seven years to the payments which she would be due to make to the consortium,,    While we should explore this joossibility which might have some value in discouraging the Egyptians from frittering away their resources, we do not believe that in a serious crisis it would provide any real safeguard,    Egypt&apos;s sterling balances are at present held in an accountwith the National Bank of Egypt and the powers which the Treasury possessunder the Exchange Control Act would enable them to block the balances butnot to compel her to pay them to the Consortium,    The Egyptians might be willing to enter into a specific undertaking amounting in effect to ahypothecation of these balances to the financing of the High Dam contract0This, however, is an undertaking on which in a serious financial crisis(a)Co)(c)
they would be as likely to default as on the simple obligation to meet theirpayments to the Consortium,,    Finallyj, even if there were some means bywhich Her M&quot;ajesty!s Government could assure a lien on these balances,the sanction would be one which, on political grounds^ it would be extremelydifficult to exercise when the time came.    We should be faced with a situation in which, not only would the whole High Dam project be broughtto a standstill, but Egypt herself would be facing a serious shortage offoreign exchange for current imports.6.        It might be argued that, if Egyptfs foreign exchange deficit over theperiod of the scheme is put at  50- 70 millions, the maximum risk forHer Majesty&apos;s Government would be one^third of this range* viz. , 17- 23 millions.    This, however, is not the case.    In the first place theestimated deficit of  50- 70 millions is based on the assumption that egypt will manage her financial affairs prudently,,    This is already opan to question in the light of her purchases of arms and her current balance ofpayments deficit.    More important, there is the risk that, if the Egyptiansdefaulted, the French and German Governments, with less political interestin trie Middle East than ourselves, would instruct their firms to withdraw,.We should then be left with the choice either of completing the Damourselves and of accepting the whole of the foreign exchange liability 9 orof withdrawing along with the French and Germans.    The Russians might then step in and finish the projects taking all the credit and leaving us withthe odium07,        Nor can the local cost of the scheme be totally disregarded,,    Itis true that the Egyptian Government ought to have less difficult-/ in meetingobligations in its own currency than those in foreign exchange for it cou!dsif necessary, resort to an unsecured overdraft from the National 3ankQBut such a method of financing could lead to serious internal inflation which,unless checked, would generate a higher rate of imports and an even biggerdrain on Egypt&apos;s external resources,8.        To sum up, course (a) would involve Her Majesty*s Government insomething very like an open-ended commitment to underwrite the Egyptianeconomy over the next 15 years or so.    Virtually the only circumstances inwhich it would be possible to cut our losses would be if Egypt were to pass into the Soviet orbit,90        The financial risks inherent in course (a) would be avoided ifwe adopted course (b).    The chances of Egyptian default would certainly be greatly reduced if the Bank were to underwrite one half of the foreign exchange cost of the dam, and the whole project might then become acommercially insurable operation.10o      On the other hand this course is open to two objections; firstthat some delay in the conclusion of the contract would be inevitable.It is however by no means clear what the International Bank has in mindby international tender.    Since the project is by its very complexityunsuited to the system of world-wide tendering, it is possible that somestreamlining of the usual procedures might be accepted.    The seconddisadvantage is that either the Consortium might be under-bid by a rivalgroup or, if the contract were broken down into a series of smallerindividual and separate items, the Consortium might be split up andBritish firms lose some of their share.    This danger can however be exaggerated, and it appears more probable that, by virtue of the longstart over its potential competitors, the Consortium could meet anddefeat any rival group,,
11.      Li putting course (b) forward as a possible solutions we areassuming that the Bank would accept the risk of making a loan without additional aid being granted by the United States and/or the United kingdom governments,,    This assumption may not however be justified,,    Certainlyat present the understanding of the American Administration appears tobe that the Bank would in fact require some such joint venture, and theAdministration seems to hold this view even more strongly.120      If the Bank take this line, we shall be left with course (c)0    Weshould have to make it clear at the outset that we cannot accept thesuggestion made by the United States Administration that Her Majesty!sGovernment should give a grant to Egypt of 3*100 millions to match the .grant which the United States Administration would be making.    We shouldpoint out that Egypt already holds sterling balances amounting to roughly 170 millions and that under the recent Agreement we have agreed toincrease the rate of release of the blocked portion of these balancesover the next eight years.    This in itself is a large contribution to the financing of Egypt*s development programme and we cannot be expectedto add to the very large amounts of sterling which she holds by makinggrants.13.      If this view were accepted course (c) would be, from a financialviewpoint, unquestionably the soundest.    Under this course, however, weshould have to agree to broaden the basis of the Consortium by admittingAmerican firms to it and this would undoubtedly require difficult negotiations which would take time.    The United States Administrationmight well press that the American participation in the Consortium shouldbe more than 25 per cent if the United Kingdom Government were not itself making any funds available by way of grant to Egypt.    Not only would negotiations between Governments be necessary, but also betweenthe various members of the Consortium which is already large.Politically, therefore, this course is open to the objection that it would lead to delay and that the Egyptians might not be willing to wait for theconclusion of the negotiations but would accept instead the Russian offer c14.      For these reasons we should certainly prefer course (h) if itis in fact practicable.    We should certainly bring all the pressure wecan to bear on the International Bank, not only to treat the matter asurgent, but also to simplify so far as possible the procedure required for international tender.    Provided this can be done, we believe that the egyptians will prefer to rely on aid from the Bank rather than to turn tothe Russians.    We have in any case a little time in hand.    Even ifcourse (a) were adopted, the Consortium would not be invited to Cairo tonegotiate the contract, still less to sign one, before the beginning ofDecember.    If, therefore, we use the next month to persuade theInternational Bank to put to the Egyptians a reasonable proposal, we may expect to hold the position.    All this, however, depends upon theassumption that the Bank would be willing to proceed without assistancefrom the United States Government.150      The Chancellor of the Exchequer might take the opportunityafforded by the forthcoming visit of the Egyptian Minister of Finance tothis country to explain to him Her Majesty&apos;s Governments views and toencourage him to proceed through the International Bank.    It would bedesirable also for us as soon as possible to inform both the German andthe French Governments of our attitude and to invite them to bring similarpressure to bear on the International Bank.    We should also seekconfirmation from these Governments that they too found the financialrisk of course (a) unacceptable, so that when Her Majesty!s Government
informed the British component of the Consortium of its inability to underwrite their contract without Bank aid the British group were not put at a disadvantage vis-a-vis their foreign associates.1S0      To sum up, we recommend?&quot;(a) that we should reject the idea that the egyptian government might be encouraged to enter intoa contract with the Consortium without seekingeither a loan from the International Bank orgrant aid from the&apos;United States!(b) that H. M. Ambassador in Washington and theUnited Kingdom Executive Director of theInternational Bank should explore further withMr. Black the possibility that the Bank mightgrant a .loan to the Egyptian Government fromwhich the project could be financed without theneed for grant aid from either the United states or the United Kingdom Governments;(c) that if the Bank is not willing to make a loan onthat basis we should(i)  make it clear that Her Majesty^ Govern&quot;ment cannot for their part offer any fundsby way of grant in addition to the largesterling balances already held by Egypt;(ii)  be ready to advise the Consortium tonegotiate for the inclusion of Americanfirms up to a participation of 25 per cent(the proportion of the foreign exchange cost of the project represented by theproposed United States grant).31st&apos;October. 1955.
