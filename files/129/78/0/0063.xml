Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.  57CP. (55) 21330th December, 1955CABINETRAILWAY SAFETYMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation think the Cabinet would like to have the following facts about railway safetyin front of them.2. The railway accidents which have caused the present public disquietare:  CasualtiesDate 20th November ...	Place Milton, near Didcot	Killed 11	Injured 163	Circumstances of accident Derailment while crossing to diversion route.24th November ...	Near Garston	 	5	Derailment.1st December ...

Hellifield   ......		2	Steam passenger train ran into back of stationary steam passenger train on main London-Scotland line (in station).22nd December ... \	Luton      ......	1	23	Express steam passenger train ran into back of stationary steam express train (in station).2*3rd December ...	Woking	 	10	Steam passenger train ran into back    of   electric   trainstanding at signal outsidestation.3. Full technical enquiries are being held on all these accidents and the findings will, of course, be published. A preliminary examination of the factsshows that, with the one minor exception of Garston, the one common threadrunning through all these accidents is human error either by signalmen or drivers.4.   Comparative figures of killed for 1955 are For the roads up to the end of November: 4,796.For the railways up to date: 59 (39 of whom were passengers).1955 compared with 1954 on the railways is as follows:  1954: 15 (none were passengers).1955: 59 (39 passengers).Average 1946-50: 61 (35 passengers).Average 1951-54:   63  (44 passengers).   (This average includes theHarrow accident when 108 people were killed.)All this compares with over 5,000 killed every year on the roads.49280
5. What is to be done about it? I am convinced from my past and presentexperience with the railways that there is no quick short-term solution. Thereis a very hopeful longer term solution which lies in pressing on with the modernisation plan with all possible speed and parallelling this by a new effort to improve human relations throughout the railway industry. It is this secondobjective to which I propose to give my personal attention and I am sure thatwe have the right instrument in the Railway Productivity Council which mustbe made to work effectively.6. I am sure that the present wages structure of the railways gives too littlerecognition, at least in some grades, to skill and responsibility. The commission are fully conscious of this and have made a start in their latest wage settlement in pulling out the concertina. But the Unions particularly the National Unionof Railwaymen are strongly opposed and the process is bound to be slow.7. In the meantime, this Cabinet discussion may provoke further Pressspeculation and I would therefore like the Cabinefs agreement to my makinga short statement if necessary.H. W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W.1,29th December, 1955.
