TOP&apos;SECRET;    - BAGDAD PACT ETC.Your telegram No.  I38h-.Subject to your views please pass following message from PrimeMinister to Mr. Nehru.:-1.      I am glad to have your message about the&apos;Bagdad Pact,-etc. andI am grateful to you for explaining your views so frankly.    You knowhow much weight I attach to your own. personal judgment and;.-to theviews of your Government.    I shall be equally frank in reply,especially since I-think I can reassure you on several matters thatare causing you concern.2C      You fear that the arrangements we have been making in the,Middle East could lead to counter measures, and that there is a-danger of international tension being increased thereby.    We believethat it is only through such arrangements that the expansionistdesigns of Soviet Russia can be arrested.    We have no thought inthis to deny the right of the Soviets to have the kind of internalgovernment they want.    Our quarrel is with militant internationalCommunism. / This can only be held by bringing threatened countriestogether in co-operation for their mutual security and by promotingtheir welfare through joint economic and social effort. . In Europewe believe this has been done by the establishment of North atlantic treaty Organisation.    If we had not stood united we believe that all our freedoms would by now have been submerged.    Our bitter experienceof Soviet tactics has convinced us that the ultimate aim of Communismis world domihatxon and that all means which may further this endare regarded as good ones.    The fate of such countries asCzechoslovakia and the threat to Yugoslavia are still fresh in our minds.    Of course we all hope that with time the Soviets will seethat such aims are unattainable.    This year there have been someencouraging signs of an easing in tension.    We have done what wecould to help in this way.    But the Soviet attitude at the most recent Geneva meeting and many of their recent actions lead us to doubt whether Soviet policy has in fact changed.    It appears to us that they may simply be following-fresh tactics to achieve the sameultimate end of Gommunist world domination;3.     Against this background we welcomed the decision of Turkey and iraq to co-operate for their security and defence and we could notquestion the decision of Pakistan to accede to the Pact.    The Pact,we believe,.provides an effective machinery for meeting the threat of international Communism to. the Middle East.    But it is notaggressiye. in character; it is designed to give security and stability to.-countries- who are uncomfortably close to the borders ofthe Soviet Union.    It &apos;is based on Article 51 of the United nations charter and seems to us in no way inconsistent with the statement issued by the&apos; Bandoeng Conference that respect should be paid.to&apos;the right of each nation, to defend itself singly or collectively inconformity wifth the United Nations- Charter..A.
&quot;20  h.      The creation of an Economic Committee under the Pact will develop and strengthen the economic and financial resources of theMiddle East region and I am convinced that the Pact-will ultimatelyprovide a most useful machinery to forward the economic and social welfare not only of the countries who are members of the Pact butalso of all the Arab States.    It is particularly important, as youwill agree, to raise the standard of living of the peoples of theMiddle East and to give their peoples hope and confidence for thefuture.    It is our belief that&quot;, if the benefits of increasingprosperity in the Middle East can be more widely spread, the dangerswill be diminished.   Already two of the countries concerned, iraq and Persia, are devoting a large part of their increasing oilrevenues to economic development.    In Iraq the proportion is as high as 70$.    In Persia plans are being made on similar lines.  &apos; This isin contrast with Saudi Arabia whose vast oil revenues are beingdissipated in expenditure on luxuries and on subversion and propaganda throughout the Middle East.    The effects of development expenditure are beginning to be felt.    We intend to give thecountries concerned such assistance as we can with technical advice and the provision of experts.    In Egypt, we intend to help with theconstruction and finance of the High Aswan Dam.    This is a project of vital importance to the future of Egypt.    It is a vast undertaking -ing, which will require a combined effort by the principal western powers.    Its construction by the West would be a proof to the arab world that we are sincerely concerned with their economic welfare.5.      Perhaps I may give you a short outline of the reasons which led us to accede to the Pact.    At the end of the war our positionin the Middle East was based on our pre-war.Treaties with egypt and Iraq.    In the new circumstances we wished to base our relationswith Middle East countries on the concept of partnership betweenequal and sovereign states and we hoped that the countries of thearea would themselves.join together for their common security,  sincedivision and weakness in the area, as we found in Europe, encourage;the Communists to sow the seeds of distrust and disunion.    We were therefore glad to sign new agreements with Egypt and Iraq based onour new concept.    The new treaty which Iraq concluded with Turkeyafforded us the opportunity of replacing the Anglo/Iraqi treaty bya new relationship of joint partnership in a common effort to defend the area against Communist infiltration and subversion.I . &apos; . -:     &apos;[6,      i share your regret at the present division in the Arab world.I But this division existed before the Bagdad Pact. Egypt is jealousi for her leadership of the Arab world and there is long standingI rivalry between the Hashemite and Saudi dynasties.   .It was our hope: that any defence organisation would embrace all the Arab States but unfortunately Egypt felt bound to oppose.the initiative Iraq hadtaken in concluding a Pact with Turkey,,    Her opposition has been based publicly not on a distaste for pacts as such, but on a claim that the Bagdad Pact would weaken Iraq in her resolution againstIsrael..    But I can assure you that it is our aim to heal the divisions in the Arab world that now exist and you will have noticed that the pact is open to accession by. other Arab countries.7c      We are also doing our utmost to secure a settlement of the major problem in the &quot;-Middle East - the Arab/lsrael dispute.    I am convinced that the only way to get. this is for each of the partiesto this dispute to accept the other&apos;s starting-point and seek a compromise between the two.    This was the purpose&apos;1 of my G-uildhallspeech.    I did not attempt to specify what concessions should be madeby either side.    I merely analysed the situation, and pointed outthat if negotiations are to have a chance both sides must move fromthe fixed positions which they have taken up.
8.      I am encouraged, to hear from MacDonald that you found the:speech helpful-,    The reactions in the Middle East have not been entirely disappointing.    The idea of a settlement of some kind isgaining currency with the Arabs, and this is an important advance.9.      Our main difficulty at the next stage is with the Israelis, andwe and the Americans are trying to show them that a settlement,which v/e are prepared to guarantee, would be so valuable to themthat reasonable sacrifices would &quot;be worthwhile,    I believe that ifyou could find it possible to make a statement even of general approval of what I said and urging a settlement the effects wouldbe most valuable for the prospects of peace in the Middle East,    Ihave asked MacDonald to mention- this to you,10,    Our task in regard to Palestine has been made doubly difficult by the decision of the Soviets to sell arms to Egypt.    I cannot accept that this deal was in any way justified by the existence ofthe Bagdad Pact.    On the contrary it is clearly part of a longthought out plan for .the expansion of Soviet influence in theMiddle East,    Indeed we view it as a deliberate attempt toexacerbate a most difficult situation and to increase the dangeroustensions existing between Israel and her neighbours.    In our viewsuch evidence of the Soviet intention to intervene in the middle east has made it more than ever important that the countries of thearea should join together for defence of their liberties.11,    While, I welcome your frank explanation of your difficulties over the Bagdad Pact I would like to allay your anxieties concerningPakistan and the implications for Indo-Pakistan relations.    Let meassure you that there can be no question whatever, of our.givingmilitary support to one Commonwealth country against another.    We&apos; have always regarded the idea of war between India and Pakistan asunthinkable and. I still cannot believe that such a prospect is seriously contemplated by the leaders of either nation.    Even if itwere, I cannot see that Pakistan&apos;s military position has been strengthened through jnembership of the Pact in such a way as couldcause alarm in India.12,    In recent years as you know v/e in the United Kingdom have gonefar out of our way to meet any requests from India to purchase arms./At the same time of course we have sold to Pakistan such equipment as she has sought to buy.    It is perfectly clear however that wehave supplied or contracted to supply many times as much military equipment to India as to Pakistan.    It is true that Pakistan hasreceived certain military aid from the United States.    We have nodetailed information, but such as we have suggests that this aidhas not been on sufficient scale to justify the apprehension which you have expressed.    I am sure that it cannot amount to more than a fraction   of what we have supplied and are contracting to supply toyou.    - *13.    I have absolutely no evidence to support the suggestion thatPakistan harbours aggressive designs against India nor can I believethat their adherence to the Bagdad Pact presents any threat to India.1ko    As regards Goa I have admired your statesmanship in preventingincidents with Portugal, despite the depth of feeling in India onthe subject.    You will know how difficult this is for us.    Neverthe-less we cannot view this question with anything but deep anxiety,which we have made known to the Portuguese, as we have to you.
15.    Please forgive me for going into all these matters at suchlength, but I am convinced that your aims and ours are the same andI am most anxious that any differences of view about means shouldnot lead to misunderstanding or obscure our real identity of purpose, Anthony Eden.Copy todo ICoRc. 0o Mr. PickardMr. rogers mr.

TOP SECRETFollowing .is the text of a message to the prime minister from May Nehru sent to the prime Minister under cover of aletter dated 3rd December from the Indian High Commissioner inLondon.       Begins., .&quot;as you know, we have been much concerned at the conclusionof military alliances in the Middle East Region which led to therecent meeting in Baghdad^   We spoke to your. High Commissionerhere on this subject and he told us that he would communicate our views to the United Kingdom Government.   Later, he gave me their reply which was to the effect that these were mere, defensivealliances and that the United Kingdom Government were much concerned at the intrusion of the Soviet Union into Middle Eastpolitics.    It was to check this interference and preventundesirable developments that this alliance was concluded,2,       I have given much thought to this matter and tried tounderstand the reasons for the Baghdad Pact which were communicatedto us, as well as the possible consequences both, from the widerpoint of view of peace in the Middle East and the world and in so faras India is affected.    I cannot presume to challenge the right ofthe United Kingdom or of Pakistan to enter into any kind of military alliance.    But because of our Commonwealth relationship and ourearnest desire to promote mutual understanding and co-operation withthe United Kingdom, my colleagues and I have felt greatly disturbed,at this new development and I feel that I should put our view pointbefore you.3.      -You know our general views in regard to military pacts andalliances in the present context.   Such alliances may have had some justification in the past, but I feel, in the presentcircumstances and, more especially, in Asia, such alliances, farfrom ensuring peace and security or even strengthening defence,have a disruptive effect and lead to counter moves and thus add to the existing fear and tension.   When the formation of SEATOwas considered, we endeavoured to make our position clear in regardto it.-    The Middle East Pact affects us even more intimately.Ever since the ,system of alliance in the Middle East culminatingin the Baghdad Pact, has been discussed one of the effects has been to break up Arab unity, and some Arab countries have opposed thesealliances.    In fact, it is probable that this development itselfled   to some counter moves by the Soviet Union and its allied countries.   Thus, in the Middle East, far greater tension hasresul-ted and security has been threatened,   Such military alliancesare almost invitations to the Soviet Union to take counter steps.In the result the position progressively deteriorates.hm &apos;     I would invite your attention to the statement issued by theBandung Conference on military paVts,   All the countries represented at Bandung associated&apos;themselves with that statement.5.       J have no doubt that the United Kingdom Government considersthis as a defensive alliance.    But whatever it may be called, theeffect is the same and, in the eyes of some, it will no doubt beconsidered as an aggressive challenge.    It will come in the wayof the development of an atmosphere of peace and a settlement ofthe niador problem, which you have so much at heart.6.       India is particularly affected by this because, unfortunately,our relations with Pakistan are not as friendly and co-operativeas I should like them to be.    On our part, we have tried our best to cultivate friendly relations with Pakistan, and indeed, theposition has greatly improved in so far as popular feeling in/India
/Copy to:-India and Pakistan is   concerned.   We have avoided saying anything which, might come in the way of better relations and a settlementof the serious problems we have to face.    I am afraid this cannotbe said of Pakistan where constant propaganda is being carried on -In themost    virulent language against India.   We had hoped that thiswould gradually die down and an atmosphere conducive to a settlementof our problems be created.    The Baghdad Pact and the associationof the United Kingdom and Pakistan in it have already raised thetempo of violent denunciation of India in Pakistan.    There is talk of a military build-up in Pakistan with the help of the UnitedKingdom and the 0,3.^. and calculations are even made that in thecourse of a year or two Pakistan will be in a position to takeaggressive step against India.    There is constant reference in the pakistan press and elsewhere to Jehad and war.   A direct effect ofrecent developments has been the deterioration of Indo-Pakistanrelations.7.        In these circumstances, any military alliance between theUnited Kingdom and-Pakistan supported by the U.S.A, naturallydisturbs the balance in this region and adds to the.apparatus ofwar and enormous strength across our border.8.        Prom the Commonwealth point of view, the fact that there isa military alliance between some Commonwealth countries which canbe utilised against another Commonwealth country is itself aserious matter.   That India would be affected by it and would view it with grave concern must have been clear and yet no reference was made to us on this subject.    Indirectly, therefore, Indo-Britishrelations might also be affected.    V/e have endeavoured to follow a policy of peace and avoid military alliances, but we have always to keep in view the possible dangers which we may have to face andto take steps to protect ourselves from them.9.       All this reacts on our public opinion,    You know how we have consistently sought to foster and promote understanding andco-operation in all fields with the United Kingdom.    We have looked upon the Commonwealth relationship as something of great importance and have supported it in spite of criticism in India.    We have referred to Commonwealth as a pillar of strength in the cause ofpeace and co-operation.    Recent development will give a handle tomany of our critics and it will-be difficult for us to explain tothem.10.      In regard to Goa, there has been great feeling in India, as you must know, and yet, because of the wider issue involved, our government took step which was very unpopular.   We did so in thelarger cause of peace.     Even now* a number of our nationals, including a member of Parliament, are lying in Per tuguese prison.   We have,however, ,taken a strong,line even against popular sentiment andprevented&apos;any untoward happenings11.      I am sending this personal message to you because I feel thatin view of our close relationship, I should place our positionfrankly before you and that you should appreciate how these recent developments have affected us and what their consequences mightbe.    These matters may.be raised in our Parliament.12.    ;I.hope you will forgive me for this long message.JAWAHARLAL NEHRU,&quot;Ends.
