Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 4CP. (55) 20316th December, 1955CABINETREPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE CIVIL service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer this is an important Report, detailed and complex, and also, save on onetrivial point, unanimous. I should like to seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the broad lines on which it should be handled.2. In my view the Report is a good one, its recommendations are fair andsensible, and the efficiency and well-being of the Civil Service and the wider publicinterest would both benefit if we were to decide to bring the recommendationsinto early operation as nearly as possible as they stand. In reaching this view, Ihave taken account of the preliminary discussions which the Treasury have heldat the official level with the principal Departments.3. The Report starts by laying down the principles which should governCivil Service pay. The primary principle is to be a fair comparison withcomparable outside employees. On this basis the Commission recommend changesin hours, leave and pay. Everything they propose is carefully reasoned and difficultto fault. At present virtually the whole Service is on regular overtime, and theCommission recommend that this should cease. They propose working hourswhich are same as pre-war in the provinces and slightly longer than pre-war inLondon: and a working fortnight of 10^ days instead of 11, with a 5-day week as the aim as soon as practicable. They recommend reductions in annual leave and increases in pay scales throughout the Service. For the lower grades these increases do not always suffice to offset the loss of overtime earnings i.e., in manycases take-home pay is reduced but this feature disappears as one goes up theService, and for the higher grades (who are not, of course, paid for overtime)considerable increases are proposed. This is what is called &quot; pulling out theconcertina.&quot;4. There are also recommendations on certain minor superannuation points,with which I need not trouble my colleagues, at any rate at this stage.5. In the Appendix to this Paper I deal with the various proposals in greater detail.6. The proposals fall naturally into three parts: first, the general principles on which it is suggested Civil Service pay should be fixed; second, the considerableincreases in pay proposed for the higher grades; and third, the proposals forincreased basic pay, reduced working hours, and reduced annual leave, which aresuggested as a single &quot; package &quot; for the middle and lower grades. But all these three hang together: that is, if the general principle of &quot; fair comparisons &quot; is accepted, there is no reason to doubt that the Commission^ detailed proposals forpay, hours and leave represent a fair application of that principle. It must be observed that the Commission^ proposals are based on outside comparisons asthey actually existed in the middle of 1955. Their acceptance therefore would mean that the Civil Service was being brought into line, not setting the pace. Iunderstand that the Ministry of Labour advise that acceptance of the proposals would have no noticeable effect on wage claims in industry.49241B
Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,14th December, 1955.7. There are perhaps three principal difficulties in applying the RoyalCommission^ proposals.(1) Prima facie the proposed reduction in working hours through the abolitionof regular overtime would necessitate the recruitment of extra staff. AsI seek to show in the Appendix, I do not believe that this difficulty willbe as acute as may appear at first sight. But I am sure my colleagues will agree that all Departments should accept the obligation to makethe fullest possible use of all practicable expedients before taking on any appreciable number of extra staff.(2) The change from an 11-day fortnight to a 10-V-day fortnight, and thefurther change to a 5-day week, would not themselves involve anyfurther reduction in the number of working hours, but would causes considerable difficulties for the management in the deployment of staff,since there are many offices which must remain fully manned on saturday morning, and perhaps few which can then be closed altogether.Some Departments feel they can move straight to a 5-day week; othersfeel that the intermediate stage of a 101-day fortnight will be necessaryfor them. I think we must leave this to be further worked out, andaccept the probability that there will, for some years at least, be somelack of uniformity among the different Departments.(3) The fact that the &quot; package &quot; proposals for lower and middle grades involvein some cases a cut in take-home pay, and in all cases a reduction in annual leave, means that negotiations for an agreed settlement will inevitably be very difficult. I think we must give the Official Sideof the National Whitley Council discretion to do the best they can,on the lines set out in the Appendix, to obtain an agreement as near to the Royal Commission^ proposals as possible. It will be seen thatthe cost of the proposals is of the order of  5 million to  10 million on a total bill of about  400 million. I must record my personal view that the possibility of obtaining a reasonable settlement byagreement or even, in the last resort, by arbitration will be seriously affected if the Government are at the same time giving whollydisproportionate pay increases to the Armed Forces.8. The proposals constitute in my view an important set of reforms whichwill enhance the efficiency of the Service and its ability to recruit and retain staffof the requisite quality. I regard it as important that they should be brought intoeffect at the earliest possible moment. Most of them require negotiation withStaff interests, and any disagreements can (except as regards the pay of the higher grades) be taken to arbitration. A preliminary meeting has been held with theNational Staff Side in order to discuss machinery and establish a reasonablyfavourable atmosphere. It is, I think, essential that substantive negotiations should start at once: delay can only&quot; make things more difficult.9.   I propose:  (1) that the Cabinet should record their general approval of the recommenda-tions made by the Royal Commission, both as respects general principles and as respects the changes proposed in present conditionsof service;(2) that the Official Side of the National Whitley Council should be instructedto enter at once into negotiations with the Staff Side with a view tothe early implementation of these proposals: their aim should be tosecure an agreed settlement as near as possible to the Royal Commis-sion&apos;s terms, reporting back for further instructions on any point whereagreement seems to be impossible without a material departuretherefrom.10.   I ask for my colleagues&apos; agreement accordingly.R. A. B.
Rest of the Service9. The pay-structure for the rest of the Service depends, of course, to a largeextent on the ceiling which is set by the remuneration of the higher grades. Thus,the new figure of  2,000 as the Assistant Secretary&apos;s minimum enables the Corn-mission to propose a much-needed loosening in the highly-compressed structureAPPENDIX1.   I discuss below the Royal Commission^ proposals in rather more detail.Principles of Pay2. The recommendations under this head are eminently fair and reasonable,and I am sure that the Government should accept them as the basis on which theywill deal with Civil Servants&apos; pay and other conditions of service.3. As to the application of the main principle of &quot; fair comparison,&quot; theCommission propose more elaborate machinery than exists at present, including the setting up of a fact-finding unit independent of the Establishment Divisions of theTreasury. There are some practical difficulties here, but I am sure that everyattempt should be made to arrive at a solution broadly on the lines of theCommission^ proposals.4. The Commission also make some sensible suggestions about how much attention should be paid to relativities within the Service. And they say that, in times of unusually marked and rapid rises in wages and salaries outside the Service,central settlements covering all the lower and middle ranks of the Service are thebest arrangement as distinct, that is, from a series of grade-by-grade settlementson the basis of a strict fair comparison with the outside analogue in each case. Iwould accept this.The Higher Civil services. At present the higher Civil Service that is, Assistant Secretaries and theirequivalents and upwards are remunerated on a span of salaries from  1,800 to 4,500. The Commission propose that this span should be  2,000 to  6,000, theformer being the Assistant Secretary&apos;s minimum and the latter the pay ofPermanent Secretaries and of a few top posts in the scientific and professionalclasses. With my approval, the Treasury&apos;s evidence to the Commission was notspecific as to higher salaries, merely indicating that a pulling-out of the concertinawas due.6. I see no reason why the Government should dissent from these proposals.They result from a very careful review of salaries in other occupations commerce,industry (public and private), local authorities, universities, and so on; theCommission are unanimous about them; and they have not met with any seriousadverse reaction in the press. Their early application is perhaps particularly important in the case of the higher grades of scientists, engineers and otherprofessional staff; otherwise a number of key men, who are conscious of gettingvery much less than they would command in other employment, may leave theService.7. There will be a number of repercussions on the salaries of bodies outsidethe Civil Service which always move in step, such as the British Council and the research Councils, and also elsewhere in the public sector where the case for anincrease is much the same as the case in the higher Civil Service for example,County Court Judges. I have no doubt, too, that, as is already clear fromParliamentary reactions, these proposals will again bring to the fore the questionof increases in Ministerial salaries and the salaries of M.P.S. Logically, there oughtto be no reactions in other occupations not mentioned above, since theCommission^ proposals are based on what men in those other occupations arealready paid. But I dare say that the movement towards higher salaries in the nationalised industries, started by the Fleck Report, will receive a further impetus.8. The Royal Commission also propose that there should be a standing body to advise the Government about the pay of the higher Civil Service, in preference to formal arbitration machinery at these levels. This is a proposal which speciallyconcerns the Prime Minister, and I have sent him a separate minute.
-a. y simmediately below it. The detailed pay scales proposed for the main classes forma sensible and coherent structure. Taken as a whole, the Commission^ proposals on pay, hours and leave represent fair treatment for civil servants in comparisonwith conditions in other employments.10. The cuts in leave, and the loss in take-home pay caused by the abolitionof overtime, will not be popular in the Service, and there is no doubt that thesefeatures will make it very difficult to secure the acceptance of the proposals bystaff interests. The general view of the Treasury and the main Departments atthe official level, with which I agree, is that it would be a mistake to concede morefavourable leave or hours than the Commission propose, and a mistake also tomake any considerable adjustments in the pay scales which might mean that thenew pay-structure became distorted before it was ever applied. The difficulty about the proposals lies in their short-term effects on existing staff, not in their long-term effects; any concessions should therefore take the form of speciallyfavourable treatment for existing staff as regards, for instance, their point of entry to the new scales.The 5-Day Week11. The Commission propose a 10^-day fortnight, to be followed as soonas possible by a 5-day week. Most Departments are inclined to think that whenthey come to making a change it would not be materially more difficult to gofrom a 5^-day to a 5-day week without the intermediate step of a lO-^-day fortnight,and that two changes within a short period of years would be a mistake. Accept-ance of the 5-day week in principle, for application as soon and as widely aspossible, would undoubtedly be a welcome concession to make to the staff. Therecan, of course, be no question of closing Government Offices every Saturday,particularly those Offices (employment exchanges, post offices, &amp;c.) which directlyserve the public, where Saturday morning is often the busiest time. The 5-day week can only be operated by means of a rota system. Indeed, some Departments for example, the Inland Revenue feel that an immediate stride to the 5-day week would be impracticable for them, and they would rather go to a 101-dayfortnight as an intermediate step. All this needs further working out, and it seems inevitable that for some time at least there may have, to be different practices indifferent Departments, with a wide degree of departmental discretion.Extra Staff12. On an arithmetical basis, the Commission^ proposals for a reduction in actual working hours (3 per cent, in the provinces and 8 per cent, in London)would, although partially offset by reductions in leave, require an increase ofperhaps 12,000 staff on a present total of 380,000 in the grades affected in orderto maintain present total man-hours in the Service. But I am assured that anincrease of this order need not and will not occur. It could not at the presenttime, if only because such a number of extra staff could not be recruited; and recruitment would be particularly difficult in the most hard pressed grades and.areas.13. Moreover, preliminary estimates by Departments suggest that they can get the work done in reduced hours (partly by extra effort and partly by someredeployment) with at any rate much smaiier additions to staff and in many casesnone at all. But some Departments in some places will need, either to be allowedsome extra staff if they can get them, or to continue regular overtime for thepresent if they cannot.14. Too much continued overtime would defeat one of the main objects ofthe proposals, and is incidentally more expensive than extra staff. But publicopinion would clearly not take kindly to substantial increases in Service numbers to enable civil servants to work shorter hours. I should like to see it laid down that employment of extra staff is only to be permitted to a very limited extent;and that recourse must be had to all other practicable measures, before any appreciable extra staffs are taken on.15. There is good hope that the dilemma can be substantially avoided,particularly if the problem is tackled cautiously and stage by stage. In the last resort the fact that it may be necessary to continue a considerable amount of
overtime in certain areas of the Service may help to provide a solution not only for this problem, but also for the problem presented by the apparent reductionin take-home pay.Cost16. In my view the long-term effect of the proposals in the Report would beto increase productivity and improve recruitment. Their immediate net cost would be about  5 million a year. This excludes whatever may have to be spenton recruiting extra staff or alternatively in continuing overtime, and also excludesthe effect on the pension bill. But whether the precise figure is  5 million or 10 million or even some figure slightly in excess of the latter amount I would regard this as a reasonable sum to lay out on making both more efficient and more attractive a Service whose total salary and wages bill, is now running at about 400 million a year.R.
