The Home Affairs Committee, when considering my detailed proposals for this Bill (H.Pa(55) 65), instructed me to refer two issues tothe Cabinet (H. P. (55) 12th Meeting, Item 6).    In addition there is onedecision of the Home Affairs Committee which I think should also beconsidered by the Cabinet.2,        The Committee approved my proposal that the forthcoming Billshould include provision to amend Section 5 of the Transport Act, 1953, inorder to make sale by the Company method more attractive.    This wouldbe effected both by permitting the retention of Section 5 Companies for aperiod long enough to enable them to show trading results, and by repealingthe provision of the 1953 Act under which the sale of shares of suchCompanies can only be effected in one parcel.    In the course of this discussion, however, some anxiety was expressed as to the possibility thatthe immediately pending offer for sale of the Parcels Company might resultin that Company being purchased by persons who would break it up, and theview was expressed by some of my colleagues that the forthcoming offer for sale should be postponed so that it could be undertaken only with the safeguards proposed under the new Bill.\3.        The Governments intention to proceed with the disposal of theParcels Company in October was expressly stated in my statement of21st July, the text of which was approved by the Cabinet on 14th July(C. M. (55) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 4).    The Disposals Board and theBritish Transport Commission have been working at high pressure on theprospectus.    Advertising space has provisionally been booked in the press for 25th October and the advertising agents will, on Monday, 17th October,reserve a large amount of space for the prospectus.    While it would be physically possible, if the Cabinet decides at its next meeting to postpone the sale, to cancel these arrangements there would undoubtedly be a leakageabout it and a decision later this week to effect such a cancellation would be widely known to the Press.    There would in any event be a considerableshock to the Disposals Board who have been working under instructions toget the Company up for sale as soon as possible.4.        I do not recommend my colleagues to postpone this offer for sale.Not only would such a decision involve a reversal of the Cabinet decision of14th July and of the relevant part of my statement to Parliament, but itwould also be.taken very badly by our supporters.    We have secured ageneral though not complete degree of acquiescence in our proposal not to dispose of the vehicles constituting the trunk services in part by indicating(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 154 COPY I TO.   ** J15th October, 1955CABINETROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALS bill memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil Aviation
that the rest of the disposal operation would continue undisturbed.   If at thelast minute we were to abandon any present attempt to sell the ParcelsCompany we would in my judgment be placing a considerable strain upon their loyalty.    In addition, as indicated, the last minute cancellation must inevitably become known and might well be thought to be in the nature of apanic decision,5,        I do not rate very highly, though I cannot wholly exclude, thepossibility of an offer being made for the Parcels Company by persons who did so with the intention of buying it for break-up purposes.    In addition tovehicles, the Parcels Company does contain a substantial amount ofproperty of a specialised kind.    It is true that if the Company could becheaply purchased it might have certain attractions from this point of view.But the adequacy of any offer which is made has either to be approved by both the Disposals Board and the Commission or, in the event of theirdisagreement, referred to me,6,        The other issue which the Home Affairs Committee asked me tosubmit to the Cabinet is the question of the future of the levy.    InH, P, (55) 65 I recommended that the forthcoming Bill should provide thatthe levy should continue till the end of 1956 at the present rate and thenterminate.    In this event the total yield would be likely to amount to about 12-1 millions.7.        On the assumptions that the Commission retain the additionalvehicles proposed by the Bill but that their remaining assets  including theParcels Company and the meat vehicles are disposed of, I calculate thaton the basis of the 1953 Act the amount which the Commission should receivewould be approximately  12^ millions,8,        Some of my colleagues in the Home Affairs Committee were, howevedisturbed by the ihformation that the Commission feel that they ought toreceive a larger Bum and I was invited to include in my paper for the cabinet a statement setting out the issues involved,9,        These are exceedingly complex.    Three of them, a dispute on thegrounds of the excess of the real value of assets over their written downbook value to the extent of  5 millions?  a claim based on a refusal to acceptthe Commission^ revision of depreciation rates to the extent of 1.5 millionsj and a claim for abortive expenses incurred in acquiring road haulage undertakings of  1. 3 millions, derive directly from the provisionsof the 1953 Act.    I am inclined to think that there is some force on their merits in the Commission^ claims in this respect.    But I do not think thatit is appropriate in the present Bill to embark on a complete overhaul of the1953 Act provisions.    These points were, I understand, fully considered atthat time,10.       The remaining cause of complaint by the Commission was not contemplated at the time of the 1953 Act.    That is the decision of the InlandRevenue that a balancing charge on the excess over book values of sumsactually realised from sale of physical assets would be imposed.    assuming the continuance of present rates of tax this liability might amount to some 4 millions.    But as actual payment will not be required to be made untilthe Commission^ accumulated loss on revenue has been turned into a surplus, this is a somewhat remote liability.    Indeed its present value canbe conservatively calculated at some  2 millions.
11. I do not think that there is any force in the suggestion which wasmade at the Home Affairs Committee meeting that the rejection of theCommission^ claims under these heads could at any time be used to support a claim for a subsidy.    Quite apart from the fact that the present manage-ment of the Commission is strongly opposed to asking for a subsidy, theamounts involved are very small in comparison with the  600 millionsannual turnover of the Commission.    Only  2. 8 millions out of their totalconstitutes a charge on revenue and that is itself a once for all charge.12.       I regard my proposals for the winding up of the levy as a lump sumsettlement.    If the 1953 Act principles are preserved, they are very slightlytoo favourable to the Commission.    On the other hand they do not concedeits claim for a revision of the 1953 Act provisions.    The Bill as a whole is,of course, very much in the interests of the Commission and I have no hesitation in commending the above-mentioned solution of the levy problem to my colleagues,13,       The Home Affairs Committee also discussed the desirability of including in the Bill a provision to cure the anomalous situation whichadmittedly exists in respect of the disposal of contract vehicles.    Thepresent position is that under an agreement made between the DisposalsBoard, the Commission and the Road Haulage Association, the problem ofthe disposal of the Commission^ vehicles which operate on contract hireis being resolved as follows.    Existing contracts are terminated inaccordance with their terms and the other party is given an opportunity toenter into a new contract either with the Commission or a private haulier.But as under the 1953 Act the Commission^ vehicles have in any event tobe disposed of, in the event that the Commission rather than the privatehaulier obtains the new contract, the Commission are bound to purchase anew vehicle.14,       This state of affairs is subject to the obvious criticism that it isanomalous to compel the Commission to buy a new vehicle to carry out a contract previously operated by one they already have.    The Commission^vehicles of course do not go out of circulation but are bought and operated by somebody else,15,       The difficulty about bringing this state of affairs to an end is thatit involves legislating to increase yet further the number of vehicles to beretained by the Commission,    The number involved is uncertain since thetermination of the contracts is a continuing process. It might, however,involve some 1,500 vehicles.    The Home Affairs Committee asked me todiscuss the matter further with the Road Haulage Association who are a party to the agreement,,    It has not been possible for me yet to do so asthey have been away at their annual conference,    I am, however, very much impressed by the political risks of legislating for further retentions by theCommission, particularly so if such legislation involved imposing a breach of an agreement made with the Road Haulage Association,    Also, any suchaction would be a further direct reversal of the Cabinefs decision of14th July,J.A.B.--C,Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, &quot;V7.1.14th October, 1955.
