Printed for the Cabinet. December 1955CONFIDENTIALCP. (55) 20728th December, 1955CABINETTECHNICAL education memorandum by Secretary of State for scotland the Scottish position the demand for technologists and technicians and the numbers of potentialrecruits leaving the schools in Scotland are likely to show the same trend as thosein England and Wales referred to in the memorandum by the Minister ofEducation (CP. (55) 205).2. Scotland already has a well-developed system of regional colleges (thecentral institutions). Seven of these are devoted to technological work. The most highly developed, the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, has been selected by theGovernment for special development, along with Glasgow University. At the othercolleges also, I have done my utmost to encourage the expansion of buildings andcourses. This policy will be continued, so that Scotland may play her full part in meeting the demand for more scientists and technologists.3. The greatest need in Scotland is, however, to develop facilities for the lessadvanced students. Restrictions on building investment by education authorities for technical education have never been necessary: my problem has been toencourage authorities to plan ahead to meet expected demands. There are sixtylocal technical colleges providing full-time courses and part-time day releasecourses. Many of these are by no means well housed or equipped. I propose thateducation authorities should be further encouraged to improve and expand thefacilities by providing new colleges or additional buildings.The Programme of Capital Development4. Appended is a list of eighteen building projects at central institutions andlocal technical colleges which the governing bodies and education authorities arealready planning. This programme is estimated to cost approximately  6 million.With equipment, the cost is estimated to be tl\ million. I have already approvednine of these projects. I propose that we should try to have all eighteen projectsstarted within five years. If within that period any education authorities or central institutions can undertake additional projects, I propose that these should be approved up to a limit of a further  3^ million.5. This programme will give 4,000 more student places over all. With these places, it will be possible to accommodate 1,500 more full-time students and some13,000 more day release students. An essential part of this development will be to recruit staff necessary to man the new facilities. This will not be easy, but everyeffort will be made to secure teachers of the required quantity and quality fromthe teaching profession and from industry.Copy No.6749254
Summary6. I ask my colleagues to endorse for Scotland a similar policy to that proposed for England and Wales by the Minister of Education and to agree thatthe rate of building for technical education should be encouraged so that Scottishprojects may be started to the value of  6 million within the next five years up to atotal value of between  6 million and  9^ million. If this is agreed, I would suggestthat the proposed White Paper should cover Scotland as well as England and Wales.J. S.Scottish Office, S.W. I,16th December, 1955.
