this document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No....0..TT.C.P.(55) 15315th October, 1955CABINETBURAIMIMemorandum by the Secretary of State  or Foreign AffairsThe dispute with Saudi Arabia over Buraimi was submittedto arbitration under an Anglo/Saudi Agreement of July, 1954.    From the outset the Saudi Arabian Government have disregarded many of theconditions of the arbitration, notably by a campaign of wholesale briberyin the area.    When Her Majesty&apos;s Government brought charges ofcorruption before the Arbitration Tribunal last month at Geneva it became apparent that Saudi bribery had extended to the Tribunal itself.    the saudi member, Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, v/as shown to be fully implicated inthe bribery, which in fact he organised, and the Pakistani member of theTribunal accepted Saudi bribes.    As a result of this the British member,and subsequently the Belgian President of the Tribunal, resigned.2. The wishes of the inhabitants of the disputed areas form a major factor in the arbitration, and, in the opinion of my legal advisers, Saudiattempts to influence the inhabitants by bribery have now gone so far that even an uncorrupted tribunal would be likely to reach a decision against us.    Nor could we be sure that a new tribunal would be any more proofagainst Saudi bribery than the last one.    The only conclusion we can reachis that Saudi actions have rendered the Aribtration Agreement unworkableand have shown that Saudi Arabia is incapable of carrying out theconditions of a genuine international arbitration.    Arbitration havingfailed, I doubt whether we can safely entrust the matter to any other formof international decision or negotiation, especially as in the meantime the processes of Saudi corruption in the area would continue unchecked.The only safe course now is to rely upon a position of strength on theground.3. This involves re-occupying those parts of the disputed area to which we consider our claim really sound and which are vital to our interests and those of our client Rulers, letting the rest go and standingpat on that position.    This is the method we adopted earlier in the year in dealing with the Aden Protectorate and Muscat frontiers with SaudiArabia.    In these cases we made a unilateral assertion of a reasonable and moderate line, with a view to defending that line and refusing to negotiateor discuss it in any way.    The line we have in mind will in fact mean notoccupying some territory to which the Ruler of Abu Dhabi has strongclaims which we have emphasised in the Arbitration proceedings so far.We should make propaganda capital out of this forbearance, and so wordit that our legal case would not be prejudiced if we ever again had tosubmit our claim for judicial settlement.    We should also offer to makeany minor frontier rectifications that might be shown to be necessary.
4. My proposal in the present case is that Her Majesty*sGovernment should announce that the Arbitration Agreement has beenvitiated by Saudi malpractices, and must be regarded as tex*minated, andthat the forces of the Ruler of Abu Dhabi (for whose foreign relations weare responsible)  should reoccupy the disputed area up to a given line inthe Western part of the disputed areas.    Our Trucial Oman Levies would support them and repel any Saudi incursion by force.    Subject to the viewsof the Chiefs of Staff, which are being urgently sought, this thould not present a serious   military problem, provided that our forces had authority to take offensive air action in case of need and provided alsothat Saudi Arabia did not treat the matter as a major operation of war,which is unlikely.5. In the Buraimi Oasis, which is much the most important partof the disputed area, the problem is more complicated.    The retentionof this Oasis is essential to our position in south-east Arabia.    Whoevercontrols Buraimi can dominate the British-protected Trucial States andthe Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, where we believe that big oil depositslie within easy reach of the Indian Ocean.    If the saudis were to getcontrol of Buraimi we should be regarded as having betrayed the Rulersfor whom we are acting and the value of British protection would slumpheavily all the way from Kuwait to Aden,    The consequences of this onour position in the Persian Gulf and throughout the Middle East wouldbe very grave.6. A difficulty is that the Exchange of Notes attached to the arbitration Agreement allowed the Saudis to station in the Buraimi Zonea police group of fifteen men.    If these men are warned of our proposedacti.:n they and their leader will take refuge in the village of Hamasa andorganise the inhabitants, who are pro-Saudi, to withstand a siege.    Theblockade of 1953/54 would then have to be resumed, with its nightly firingat blockade runners and its frequent casualties.    This would be intolerable.It will therefore be essential to overpower these men without warning.This is of course a high-handed action, but the Saudis have disregardedseveral of the conditions under which these policemen are stationed inthe oasis, and we should use these infringements as the justification forour action.7. It would also be necessary for the Muscat authorities to resume control of Hamasa.    Safe conduct and transport would have tobe provided for such Saudi adherents as wished to return to Saudi Arabia,and subsidies would have to be given for a while to those who resume their allegiance to Muscat.    The Saudis have been subsidising theinhabitants of the village for several years.    The financial commitmentwould be of the or der of 125,000.8. This action will be regarded as highly provocative by SaudiArabia and probably by a large section of the Arab world.    We shall be accused of exchanging force for pacific settlement, and the matter maywell be taken before the United Nations.    If that happened^ we should havea case that we had been supporting the interests of independent small arab states against Saudi imperialism.    The internal conditions of Saudi Arabiaare not stable and this is not a bad moment to force a showdown.    Saudireputation is low, even in the Arab world.    The United States, whoseinfluence might be decisive in any United Nations debate, have a natural in-stinct to appease the Saudis on account of the interests of the American oil company, Aramco.    It would be necessary to convince the United States Gov-ernment that in this matter Her Majesty&apos;s Government were acting under thespur of vital economic needs and not in any spirit of colonialism, and toinform them slightly in advance of our intention.-2-
9. I think the stakes are so high that we cannot afford to hesitate.Cur interest in the oil of Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain and in the prospective oil deposits in Muscat and the Trucial Coast is cf crucial importance to us.    Cur special position in the Gulf depends upon the respect in which we are held by the Rulers of these territories.    Solong as our protection is seen to be effective, our position will be assured.    If we were to allow the Saudis to impose a major defeat upon us - and the loss of Buraimi would be that - the whole of our position might easily slip away.10. The conclusions  are(a) that we should now inform first the United StatesGovernment and immediately afterwards the saudi Government that the Saudis&apos; actions have rendered a judicial settlement of this problemimpossible and that, to protect the interestsof the Rulers whom we represent, v/e areresuming our freedom of action in the disputedareas and breaking off arbitration;(b) that we should then unilaterally declare what v/eregard as a fair frontier though at the same timesaying that we would be prepared to make minorrectifications by agreement;(c) that v/e should support the Ruler of Abu Dhabi inreoccupying the disputed area and removing the Saudi police from Buraimi;(d)that we should declare a frontier and beprepared to defend it by force, if necessary;(e)that we should give the Sultan of Muscat thenecessary help in resuming control of Hamasa.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.14th October, 1955.
