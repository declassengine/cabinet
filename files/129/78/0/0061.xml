Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1955SECRETCP. (55) 21130th December, 1955CABINETTEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Minister of Education&quot; The price of many things is farre above, what they are boughtand sold for. Life, and Health, which are both inestimable, we have ofthe Physician: As Learning, and Knowledge, the true tillage of the mind,from our Schoole-masters. But the fees of the one, or the salary of theother, never answer the value of what we received; but serv&apos;d to gratifietheir labours.&quot;Ben Jonson Discoveries.My colleagues may like to be informed of the present position, since the. rowover the Superannuation Bill is really about salaries.2. We are witnessing a demonstration against the drastic and continuingchange in the pre-war relationship between salaries and wages (including overtime).The salaried middle class as a whole is feeling the pinch. The decline in,theirstandards gives rise, in my view, to the most serious tension in our society to-day.Where industrial earnings are greatest, the teachers&apos; protests are loudest, but thereis strong dissatisfaction throughout the staffs of the maintained schools, and onthe issue of salaries they have the public with them.The Appendix to this paper gives figures to illustrate this grievance as the teachers see it. The tables are not intended as a pointer to what teachers&apos; salariesshould be. To judge of this the level of the salaries of other public servantswould have to be taken into account.- 3. Teachers&apos; salaries are discussed in the Burnham Committee, which iscomposed of representatives of the teachers&apos; associations and of the local educationauthorities, under the Chairmanship of Lord Percy of Newcastle. The Committeesubmits recommendations to the Minister of Education which he can approveor reject-hitherto they have always been approved. This machinery is writteninto the Act of 1944. The Minister can neither fix salaries nor approve a rise tobe dated retrospectively, but he can ask the Committee to take a particularcircumstance into account.4. The salary scales are due for a general revision in April, 1957. In theordinary way discussions would start in the spring of 1956. However, last month,before the Superannuation Bill was introduced, the teachers brought a claim tothe Burnham Committee for an interim rise in basic scales of 10 per cent, to operate from 1st April, 1956. They based this on changes in the cost of living,and did not adduce the additional 1 per cent, in pensions&apos; contribution.W&apos;5. The local authorities, who had just given a 5 per cent, increase to their other employees, countered with a suggestion of a 5 per cent, interim increase forthe teachers to start from 1st April,; 1956, which happens to be the date from whichthe Superannuation Bill is to operate. Sir Ronald Gould, the present Secretaryof the National Union of Teachers, asked for time to consider this informal offer.On 22nd December the Teachers&apos;Panel met and decided to reject it, and to askinstead that negotiations should begin at once for revised scales (their bid is something like a 25 per cent, increase costing  50 millibn a year).   They, knowCopy No. 59
that it is not possible, by 1st April, 1956, to make a thorough review of the scales,including many decisions on differentials, on which their members are farfrom united.6. There, may therefore be a gap, the responsibility for which will rest withthe teachers, between the coming into force of the Superannuation Bill and the increases in salaries. As the Cabinet heard on 20th December, some ConservativePrivate Members have put down an amendment designed to give the Ministerpower to postpone the date of coming into operation of the Bill (CM. (55)47th Conclusions, Minute 1). An Opposition amendment seeks to postpone thedate until 1st April, 1957. The Cabinet will no doubt wish to consider how to handle these amendments in the light of what happens in the burnham committee.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,29th December, 1955.APPENDIXPrimary schools and secondary modern schools are mainly staffed bynon-graduates, trained in teachers&apos; training colleges; grammar schools by universitygraduates. The following tables show the changes that have taken place in the salaries of these two representative classes of teachers.2. The tables relate to men teachers. Women teachers will draw the samesalaries as men when the introduction of Equal Pay has been completed by 1962.Out of 240,000 teachers employed in schools, 146,000 are women.&apos; 3. Apart from envy at the rise in industrial earnings, there is a grievancebecause the &quot; concertina&quot; of the teachers&apos; scale has been compressed. Themaximum basic salary which a teacher can earn has fallen behind its pre-war value.Allowances over and above the basic scale are paid to approximately one-third ofthe teachers, in service, including Heads of schools.Minimum and Maximum Salaries of Men&apos;s Basic Scales since 1938I.

III.-For many of the more responsible posts, especially in grammar schools,allowances are paid over and above the salaries fixed by the scales. These haverecently been increased and extended. Some 9,000 allowances of between  150 and 350. and a few hundreds of  400 or  450 for top posts in large grammar schoolsare now being given. A man drawing a total salary of  l,250-  1,300 would be receiving an increase of about 140 per cent, over the corresponding salary for 1938.TV. There are special additions for Headmasters and Headmistresses,depending on the size, &amp;c. of the school.
