secret.P.(55) 20416th December, 1955COPY NO. S 4CABINETREPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ONBETTING, LOTTERIES AND GAMINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and Minister for Welsh AffairsPast historyThe Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gamingreported in Marck, 1951 (Cmd, 8190).    The main recommendations were:-(a) that off-the-course cash betting should be madelawful and that licensed betting offices shouldbe established!(b) that the law about gaming should be repealed and fresh provisions enacted which would generallymake gaming lawful, provided that no privateprofit ensued;  and(c)    that the opportunities for betting on dog-tracksshould be further restricted and the amounts which might be retained by the operator of atotalisator at a dog-track should, in certain,circumstances, be reduced.A further recommendation that the conduct of football pools should be controlled has since been implemented by the Pool Betting Act, introduced as a Private Member ss Bill.2.        The Labour Government did not make any pronouncement of theirviews before resigning in November, 1951, but it is understood that theywere generally favourable to the recommendations.3,        The Home Affairs Committee appointed a Sub-Committee inMarch, 1953, to consider the recommendations (H.A.(53) 2nd Meeting,Item 3).    The Sub-Committee reported its conclusion to the Cabinet later that year; this was that, subject to comparatively minor quaHfications of detail, all the recommendations of the Commission should be accepted(C.(53) 317).4,        In February, 1954, the Cabinet invited the Home Secretary todiscuss with Leaders of the Opposition Parties a proposal that a debate should be arranged in the House of Lords on the Report, during the courseof which a statement might be made indicating the Governments willingness
to examine the possibility of legislation on the lines recommended by theCommission, if it was the general feeling that the law ought not to beallowed to remain in its present unsatisfactory state (C,C0(54) 11thConclusions, Minute 9),    A discussion with Mr, Ede and other membersof fee Labour Party took place on 29th March, 1954,    Mr. Ede undertook to have fee matter considered by his Party, but no statement was subsequently received,5,       At this meeting the Opposition seemed more concerned thatthere should be an amendment of the law relating to small lotteries tomeet difficulties which had mainly grown since the Royal Commissionreported.    Subsequently, two Lotteries Bills were introduced by private members, and a third Bill - the small Lotteries and Gaming Bill -received a Second Reading, without a division, on 25th November,Present position6,        There are strong grounds for a reform of the law  -(a) The present state of the law is widely admitted to be confused, unsatisfactory and out of touchwith modern opinion; in consequence, the lawhas been brought into disrepute,(b) The law is impossible to enforce generally and thisleads to opportunities for corruption of the police.The attempt to enforce an unpopular law partiallydiverts inadequate police manpower from other duties.    The Central Conference of Chief Constableshas, for these reasons, recommended that theReport should be implemented.(c) At this year*s Annual Conference of the conservative party a resolution was passed, by a large majority,asking the Government to take immediate action,(d) The Times has published a letter from Mr. Willink,the Chairman of the Commission, criticising theGovernment for taking no action on a unanimousReport and suggesting that this, unless corrected,may result in men in public life being unwilling toserve on future Commissions *(e) Since the introduction of the Small Lotteries and gaming Bill in the House of Commons there havebeen several indications that pressure is to beput on the Government about this matter.    already a number of Questions which relate to it directly or indirectly have been put down,(f) Lord Silkin has put down a motion for debate in theHouse of Lords on 8th February,7.        Although the matter is undoubtedly controversial, there is goodground for thinking that a Bill on the general lines of the recommend-ations in the Report would be generally supported.    In particular, duringthe Second Reading Debate on the Small Lotteries and Gaming Bill anumber of speakers from both sides of the House criticised the Govern-ment&apos;s failure either to announce their acceptance of the Report or toprovide an opportunity for debating it.
G, LiL, -G.Home Office, S.W.I.16th December, 1955.8,        In my opinion, the time has come seriously to consider theintroduction of legislation in line with the Commission^ recommendations,subject to the qualifications already made and any others that further examination may suggest.    I accordingly recommend that the ministerial sub-Committee should be reconstituted to consider the matter again witha view to the introduction of legislation in the next Session.    A highly controversial matter of this kind cannot be safely left to the later stages of a Parliament,
