REPORTChapter IINTRODUCTIONComposition and Terms of reference the Prime Minister announced on the 6th July, 1955, that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom proposed to convene a Round table conference, comprising representatives of all the political parties at westminster, to consider constitutional questions arising from proposals by the Maltese Prime Minister for a closer association between Malta andthe United Kingdom. After consulting the Leaders of the two opposition parties in Parliament, the Prime Minister announced the composition and terms of reference of the Conference on the 28th July, 1955, as follows: CompositionThe Right Hon. Viscount Kilmuir, G.C.V.O., the Lord Chancellor(Chairman).The Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, O.M., C.H.The Right Hon. Clement Davies, Q.C.The Right Hon. Walter Elliot, C.H., M.C.The Right Hon. J.

T. Aitken.Mr. Julian Amery.Mr. R. H. S. Crossman.Mr. Douglas Houghton.The Earl of Perth.Mr. Kenneth Pickthorn.The Hon. Richard Wood.Terms of Reference&quot; To consider constitutional and related questions arising from proposalsfor closer association between Malta and the United Kingdom and, inparticular, from the proposal that Malta should in future be represented inthe Parliament at Westminster.&quot; To consult representatives of the political parties in the LegislativeAssembly of Malta, and such other persons as may seem fit to them.&quot; To report their conclusions and recommendations.&quot;Procedure2. At the opening meeting held at the Palace of Westminster on Monday,19th September, 1955, the Conference discussed their rules of procedure.They decided to meet in plenary sessions at Lancaster House to hear49183c*
statements from the Prime Minister of Malta, the Leader of the opposition in the Malta Legislative Assembly, the Progressive Constitutional party and such other persons as they might decide to call before them. Plenarysessions were to be open to all persons intending to give evidence, and to representatives of the Press. Witnesses would be heard only after the submission of written memoranda, which would be regarded as confidential,if so desired.3. Twelve plenary sessions of the Conference were held in London anda further three in Malta. In eleven closed sessions, the Conference heardevidence from Ministers of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,from the Governor of Malta and representatives of the Maltese ImperialGovernment and from representatives of the fighting Services in Malta, andsome evidence from the Prime Minister of Malta and the Leader of theOpposition in the Maltese Legislative Assembly. Private discussions tookplace in Malta between representatives of the Conference and the archbishop of Malta. In addition, the Conference held twelve private sittings to discuss their recommendations and prepare their Report.Visit to Malta4. The Conference paid a visit to Malta from the 16th to the23rd October, during the course of which they also visited the neighbouringIsland of Gozo. The opportunity was taken of the visit to hear, in additionto the private evidence referred to in the preceding paragraph, evidence inplenary sessions from representatives of professional and trade bodies in malta and of the principal Trade Union.5. Lists are attached of the principal memoranda submitted to theConference (Appendix A), of the witnesses heard (Appendix B), of the places, organisations and establishments visited in Malta (Appendix C) andof the plenary sessions of the Conference (Appendix D).6. We now submit our Report. We first describe, very briefly, thesituation in Malta. We go on to present and discuss the evidence. our conclusions and recommendations are set out in the last Chapter.Chapter IITHE SITUATION IN MALTAFacts and Figures7. As there is already a wealth of factual information about Malta inrecently published documents,* we confine ourselves to recalling the salientfacts and figures with which we are concerned. The Maltese Islands (ofwhich Malta and Gozo are the only sizeable ones) cover a land area ofabout 122 square miles, which is about the size of the County of London* Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution of Malta, 1931, (Cmd. 3993);Report on the Finances of the Government of Malta, by Sir Wilfrid Woods, 1946,(Colonial No. 196); Report of the Constitutional Commissioner (Sir HaroldMacMichael), 1947, (Colonial No. 207); Recent requests for financial and economic assistance, 1949, (Colonial No. 253); Interim Report on the Financial and economic structure of the Maltese Islands, by Sir George E. Schuster, 1950, (Colonial No. 260);An Economic, Survey of the Colonial Territories, 1951, Voi. VI, (Colonial No. 281,Part 6); The Economic Problems of Malta: an Interim Report by Thomas Balogh and dudley Seers, 1955; Statistical Abstract of the Maltese Islands, Year 1954, No. VIII,:19s5. oj sauoB ustesonsd it: aooxaasa. - vieaorq ru i-ymi ot tobodb yotu
or little more than four-fifths of Rutland or the Isle of Wight. The peopleof Malta, who have their own language, culture, and customs, and theirancient Roman Catholic traditions, have a strong national pride and a historyof parliamentary government. They have never lost their own separateidentity. The Islands have held a position of importance in theMediterranean for many centuries, though always in association with other powers.8. The total civil population of almost 316,000 is roughly equal to thatof Bedfordshire or West Sussex, but is less than one-tenth of that of theLondon County Council area. Population density is high over 2,600 tothe square mile, or 3-  times that of England and Wales. The natural increaseof the population is high, but has been partly offset by emigration. Over thelast five years, the net increase has been only one per cent.9. The Maltese Islands are rocky and in some parts barren; the soilthough both deep and fertile in the low-lying areas, is in the main shallow.The Islands are almost treeless and no minerals or other natural resourceshave yet been discovered. The comparatively low mean annual rainfall ofabout 20 inches, and the absence of rivers and lakes, means a perennialshortage of water, which is aggravated by the high population density.10. A third of Malta&apos;s national income is derived from payments bythe United Kingdom Service Departments, and a further important part isindirectly so derived. A quarter of the working population is employed on orin connection with defence activities. About 90 per cent, of Maltese imports are paid for by expenditure in Malta of United Kingdom Departments or by direct financial aid from the United Kingdom Treasury. Income per head is,in money terms, a good deal below that in the United Kingdom, although this does not fairly reflect the difference in standards of living because of differences not only in prices but also in climate and other living conditions.The standard of living in Malta is generally lower than in the UnitedKingdom, but higher than in many other Mediterranean countries.11. Local revenue in 1955-56 is expected to be over  7 millions. Totalexpenditure is estimated at over  11 millions, though this figure is unlikely to be reached. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken, subject to theapproval of Parliament, to assist the Maltese budget during this financialyear by a grant of such sums as may prove necessary, up to a maximum of 2 millions, to maintain reserves at  1 million at the end of the year. Inaddition, about  1 - 8 millions a year is at present being spent from UnitedKingdom grants for war damage reconstruction, and some  800,000 is being provided to meet the costs of civil defence, stockpiling and emigration.Expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds is running at about  400,000 a year. Altogether, therefore, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsdirect expenditure in Malta this year (excluding expenditure carried on service Departments&apos; votes) may amount to between  4 and  5 millions.12. Even with the substantial assistance which she receives from direct and indirect expenditure by the United Kingdom, Malta is only able tomaintain a level of social and other services considerably lower than that ofthe United Kingdom.  Details are given in Appendix E.13. The people of Malta freely chose in 1802 to place themselves andtheir Islands under the protection and sovereignty of the British Crown.Their choice is recorded in the Declaration of Rights of 15th June, 1802,the text of which is reproduced in Appendix F. The Islands were formallyannexed in 1814 under the Treaty of Paris.3!-49183 r,* ^
14. Since the Napoleonic wars, Malta has been in continuous use as aBritish naval base and fortress. During that period, its fine natural harbours and its strategic position on the sea lanes to the East have been of immensevalue to the United Kingdom and the other countries of the commonwealth and Empire. In the Second World War, the heroic garrison and theindomitable people of Malta were exposed to frequent, heavy and sustainedair attacks, and to an intense blockade. In recognition of their courageousresistance and of the exceptional hardships and privations they endured,Malta was awarded the George Cross in 1942.15. Recent years have seen the decision to withdraw British forces fromthe Suez Canal Zone; the growth of tension and unrest in the Middle Eastand North Africa and the establishment in Malta of the Headquarters ofthe N.A.T.O. Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces, Mediterranean. All these factors have combined to emphasise the continued importance of Malta as apivotal point in the Mediterranean.16. The strategic importance of Malta, and the events of the last 150years, have resulted in its economic dependence upon the United Kingdom.The degree of this dependence, and the vulnerability of the Maltese economyresulting from the predominance of our military, naval and air requirements,are factors which we have had constantly in mind in considering the futurepolitical status of the Islands.The Present Constitution17. The present Constitution is established in the Malta (Constitution)Letters Patent and the Malta (Office of Governor) Letters Patent, 19.47, asamended. There is provision for a Maltese Legislative Assembly consisting of40 members, elected on a system of proportional representation. TheAssembly is empowered to make laws &quot;for the peace, order and good government of Malta,&quot; but the Constitution provides that this power shallnot extend to certain specified matters which are &quot; reserved &quot; to what is described in the Letters Patent as the Maltese Imperial Governments the list of &quot; reserved matters,&quot; on which the Governor, as the head of the maltese Imperial Government, has power to legislate, includes, in general,&quot; matters touching the public safety or defence of our dominions &quot; and, inparticular, such questions as defence, civil aviation, currency, immigration andnationality. The Maltese Legislative Assembly has power to amend orrepeal the Constitution, but legislation for this purpose cannot be passedunless the votes of not less than two-thirds of all the Members are cast infavour of it. This power of repeal or amendment does not extend toprovisions of the Constitution relating either to &quot; reserved &quot; matters or tocertain other specified subjects, including the Judicature, language, religioustoleration and emergency laws.18. The Governor has executive and legislative power in regard to allreserved matters. He must, in general, follow the advice of the ExecutiveCouncil, composed of Maltese Ministers, in regard to all non-reserved matters, but he has the power to disregard their advice if he sees sufficient reason to do so. He must also consult a Nominated Council, consistingof the three Service Chiefs in Malta and two official members, in regard* The Maltese Imperial Government is defined as the Government constituted forthe exercise of any power, jurisdiction or authority in Malta with regard to reserved matters. Its members, under the Governor, are the Lieutenant-Governor, the legal secretary, the Director of Civil Aviation and the Secretary to the Maltese ImperialGovernment.
^ *C oto matters in the reserved field, though he is not bound to follow the advice of this Council. There is provision in the Constitution for joint meetingsof the two Councils under the title of the Privy Council.The Present Situation19. The decision to appoint the present Conference was announced during a series of private talks, held in London during June and July of thisyear, between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Prime Ministerof Malta, Mr. Mintoff, and the Leader of the Opposition in Malta, Dr. BorgOlivier.20. These talks had their origin in 1953 when Dr. Borg OHvier&apos;s Party,the Malta Nationalist Party, was in office. Proposals, which they putforward, for Dominion status and transfer of responsibility for Malta&apos;s affairs to the Commonwealth Relations Office had been rejected by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. Mr. Mintoff and his Party, the Malta Labour Party, were then in opposition. Neither Party regarded as adequate Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ counter-proposal to transfer responsibility for Malta&apos;s affairs to the Home Office, which became known as &quot; the Home Office offer.&quot; In1954, Her Majesty&apos;s Government proposed that all-party talks should beheld in London to discuss the situation. This proposal was accepted by the malta Labour Party, but the Maltese Government of the day did not respond to it until the eve of its fall from office. The proposal was finally acceptedby the new Maltese Government after Mr. MintofFs accession to office inFebruary 1955.21. We understand that, during these talks, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies agreed, on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, that, though Dominion status was ruled out, the existing Constitu-tion should be revised. On the economic side, the two Maltese delegationsjoined with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in issuing, at the conclusion of the talks, an agreed statement, the text of which is reproduced in Appendix G.This contained the following important declaration: &quot; All parties to theConference are agreed that the social and economic development of Maltais a necessity and calls for a joint and sustained effort by both countries.&quot;The statement further endorsed, as objectives, the raising of the standardof social services, the increasing of opportunities for employment outsideService establishments and avoiding unemployment. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment agreed to provide financial help for these purposes as necessary.Chapter HITHE EVIDENCE\ -22.   The written  and  oral  evidence which  we  have  received  mayconveniently be divided into three categories:  (i) evidence and proposals put forward by the Maltese Government andthe Maltese political parties;(ii) views expressed by other organisations and individuals; and(iii) information supplied confidentially by United Kingdom Ministers and departments (including representatives of the Fighting Services) andby the Maltese Imperial Government.23. The material covered by (iii) above has naturally been taken intocareful consideration by us in arriving at our conclusions and in makingour recommendations.   Of the evidence mentioned at (ii) above, some was
concerned with matters of detail which it is unnecessary for us to discusshere. We refer later to the discussions between the Archbishop of malta and representatives of the Conference. The rest of the evidence in this category came from those who associated themselves broadly with theproposals of one or other of the Maltese political parties and served toreiterate, elaborate or qualify the evidence given by the representatives ofthese parties. For the sake of brevity, we confine ourselves to outlining themain proposals, as we understand them, of the Maltese Government, the malta Nationalist Party and the Progressive Constitutional Party. Theseproposals arise mainly out of the memoranda listed in Appendix A, butthey were considerably clarified and amplified in the course of evidence bythe witnesses concerned.Proposals of the Government of Malta24. The Prime Minister of Malta, and representatives of the maltese government and its supporters in the Malta Labour Party, put forward the following proposals:  (a) There should be a unicameral Maltese Parliament, whose members should be elected by adult suffrage on a direct voting system similarto that obtaining in the United Kingdom.(b) All matters other than foreign relations, defence and (at a later stage,the timing of which would be dependent on the rate of progress of the maltese economy towards &quot; parity &quot; with that of the United Kingdom)direct taxation, should be allocated to the legislative authority of the maltese Parliament.(c) The overriding powers of the Imperial Parliament over all matters should remain untouched, but their use should be governed by whatthe Prime Minister of Malta described as the normal conventionswhich would, in effect, preclude their application to matters on whichthe Maltese Parliament had power to legislate.(d) Malta should be represented in the House of Commons at Westminsterby not less than three Members (the precedent of Northern Ireland notbeing treated as a strict model), elected in accordance with UnitedKingdom electoral laws.(e) Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should provideeconomic aid for the capital development of Malta and, by way ofsubventions, towards recurrent budgetary expenditure. Such aid wouldhave among its objects the gradual raising of the standard of living ofthe Maltese people towards the level of the people in the UnitedKingdom, the ultimate aim being &quot; parity &quot; and the disappearance of wage discrimination.(/) There should be a consultative committee in Malta, presided over bya Minister of the Maltese Government, with equal representation ofthe United Kingdom Defence Departments and Home Office (whichwould take over from the Colonial Office responsibility for theadministration of Maltese affairs) on the one hand, and of the maltese government on the other.(g) There should be a second committee in London, consisting of UnitedKingdom and Maltese Ministers. This committee, on which theUnited Kingdom members would have the majority voice, should have powers of decision, subject to the right of members to consult theirrespective Cabinets before committing themselves.25. In the course of his evidence, the Prime Minister of Malta explainedthat, although the development of Malta could be carried out successfully
only within the constitutional and administrative framework of his Govern-ment&apos;s proposals, they were not put forward merely on grounds of expectedmaterial advantages but in order to reflect the aspirations and ideals ofthe Maltese people, which must be satisfied. His Government were notprepared to compromise on the fundamental principles involved in their proposals. They were, however, ready to work out details in negotiation with Her Majesty&apos;s Government on such matters as the number of members which Malta could elect to the Parliament at Westminster, the division of legislative functions between the Parliament at Westminster and the MalteseParliament and the constitutional and consultative machinery in Malta. the aim should be to devise practical arrangements which would work under present circumstances and which could be adapted to meet the new situationwhich would arise when the interim period had reached a successful conclusion. Until that time it was necessary, for practical reasons, to leavethe maximum power and discretion in the hands of the Maltese parliament and Government. This consideration particularly applied to such matters astaxation, both direct and indirect.26. As regards direct taxation, the aim was that, when Maltese incomeshad attained a level equivalent to those in the United Kingdom, the parliament at Westminster would assume responsibility for direct taxation in Malta,which would then be levied at rates equivalent to those in the UnitedKingdom. So long as the power of taxation remained with the Governmentof Malta, rates of taxation would be determined by the two Governmentsoperating through the machinery of the proposed consultative committees.Similarly, indirect taxation would, for practical reasons, have to remain a responsibility of the Maltese Parliament during the interim period, but the aim would be to adjust it gradually to fit in with the system in the UnitedKingdom. The rate of progress would be determined, in the light of practical considerations obtaining at the time, by consultation between the twoGovernments. Although the ultimate aim was assimilation of taxation, sothat the burdens and benefits of the peoples of the United Kingdom and malta were equally shared, the determination of the actual rates and the timing would have to be left open at the start. This was not on account ofany theoretical objections but solely in view of practical necessities.Proposals of the Malta Nationalist Party27. The proposals put before us by the Leader of the Opposition in malta Legislative Assembly and representatives of the Malta nationalist party were as follows:  (a) Malta should ultimately achieve a new form of full self-government within the Commonwealth in which it would be autonomous in its relations with the United Kingdom, but not with Commonwealth andforeign countries. Defence and Commonwealth and foreign affairs would be the joint responsibility of the United Kingdom and Malta.(b) The joint responsibility for handling defence and Commonwealth andforeign affairs, in so far as they affected Malta, would be governed by agreements to be made between the two Governments.(c) The Prime Minister of Malta would be entitled to attend meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers when matters affecting Malta were under discussion.(ct) There should be an exchange of High Commissioners between Londonand Valetta, and the affairs of Malta should become the responsibilityof the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.(e) In place of the Governor, there should be a Governor-General who,in the exercise of his powers and functions, would, generally speaking,
act in accordance with the constitutional conventions applicable to theexercise of similar powers and functions in the United Kingdom by her Majesty.28. We were told in evidence that the Malta Nationalist Party recognisedthat some time must pass before a constitution giving effect to these proposals could be brought into operation. The Party, accordingly, put forward thefurther interim proposals set out below, which were designed to fulfil Malta&apos;s immediate requirements for constitutional advance:  (a) The Maltese Parliament should have power to legislate on all mattersother than defence and external affairs (the scope of both terms being subject to strict definition). Its legislation should not be reserved bythe Governor for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure; nor should powers of disallowance be exercised in respect of legislation passed by the Maltese Parliament and assented to by the Governor.(b) In exercising his powers in the fields of foreign affairs and defence, theGovernor would act on the advice of Her Majesty&apos;s Ministers in theUnited Kingdom but should seek the advice of an advisory councilconsisting of himself, the Prime Minister of Malta and two otherMaltese Ministers. In other matters, the Governor should act on theadvice of Maltese Ministers.(c) There should be a committee in London, consisting of the PrimeMinister of Malta and two United Kingdom Cabinet Ministers, withthe duty of resolving disputes as to whether any matter is a reservedmatter, i.e., defence or foreign affairs, or not.(d) The emergency powers reserved to Her Majesty in Council underSection 59 of the Constitution should be limited to reserved matters.(e) No powers should be reserved to Her Majesty in Council to revoke,amend or alter by Order in Council any provision of the Constitution,except in accordance with a resolution passed by not less than three-fourths of all the members of the Legislative Assembly.if) Malta should receive economic assistance from the United kingdom with a view to reducing Malta&apos;s dependence on defence expenditure,developing Malta&apos;s resources and social services, maintaining full employment, and raising living standards.29. With regard to ultimate aims, we understood from the evidence givenby Dr. Borg Olivier that his Party recognised the necessity for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to retain the final say in the settlement of any disputes arisingfrom the terms of the agreements governing the joint handling of defence and Commonwealth and foreign affairs. He expressed confidence, however,that it would in practice never prove necessary to overrule Maltese Ministers,since the latter would be prepared, after full information and consultation, torecognise the measures which Her Majesty&apos;s Government held were strictlynecessary and essential. If the proposals were not strictly essential, the malta Nationalist Party would expect Her Majesty&apos;s Government not to pressthem. We understood that negotiations on such questions would be conducted mainly through the High Commissioners.30. Dr. Borg Olivier also stated that the Malta Nationalist Party desiredeconomic viability, not necessarily &quot; parity,&quot; as an ultimate aim but were notprepared to predict how soon Malta might expect to achieve it, nor theamount of assistance required; this would have to be determined by thenormal methods of consultation between the two Governments. The MaltaNationalist Party accepted that a considerable measure of success in economic development would have to be achieved before their ultimate aims could bereached.
31. With regard to his interim proposals, Dr. Borg Olivier explained thatthe Parliament at Westminster would retain the overriding power oflegislation, and that, although it would no longer be possible to amend orrevoke the interim Constitution by Order in Council, that Parliament would retain the power to do so by statute. We also understood from the evidencethat, although in other matters the Governor would be obliged to act on theadvice of Maltese Ministers, he would retain the power to refuse assent tolocal legislation. If assent were refused because the legislation was believed to involve a matter of defence or foreign affairs, it would be referred to the ministerial council in London, but the power of refusing assent to local legislation would have to be exercised only in extreme cases. The governor would retain legislative and executive authority, and the power of finaldecision, in the fields of defence and foreign affairs; but Maltese ministers should be given the chance of participating in the handling of these mattersthrough the machinery of the advisory council. The Governor^ authority in these fields would, however, be exercised on the instructions of ministers of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. The present formof government should be modified, the post of Lieutenant-Governor and the privy Council being abolished.Proposals of the Progressive Constitutional Party32. The views of the Progressive Constitutional Party, as presented by its Leader, Miss Mabel Strickland, and her supporters, were these (a) The present legislative powers of the Maltese Legislative Assembly,including responsibility for fiscal legislation, should not be diminished.(b) The Maltese Legislative Assembly should be given increased powers in the &quot; reserved&quot; field, by a revision of the present definition ofdefence and foreign affairs and a curtailment of the present list of reserved matters.(c) There should be a closer administrative association in Malta betweenthe Imperial Government and the Maltese Government.(d) The Privy Council of Malta should be abolished, and the Lieutenant-Governor should be replaced by a Chief Secretary. The PrimeMinister of Malta should have a seat on the Nominated Council,renamed the Defence Council, in Malta so as to enable him to bekept informed on defence, foreign affairs and other reserved matters.(e) There should be a separate Malta Office in London, either as anindependent department or as a part of the Home Office, with a minister of State or Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State responsiblefor Maltese affairs.if) Attached to the Malta Office, there should be a senior Maltesesecretary, responsible for liaison with United Kingdom Departmentsconcerned with Maltese affairs; he should be appointed after consulta-tion with the Prime Minister of Malta.(g) There should be a Malta Council in London, comprising Ministersrepresenting a number of United Kingdom Departments, and preside over by the United Kingdom Minister responsible for Maltese affairs;the Council should be responsible for co-ordinating policy matters relating to Malta.(h) Malta should receive financial aid for economic development and social welfare through a new and separate Malta Development and welfare Fund, which would be administered by a financial boardwithin the framework of the proposed Malta Council, and moniesfrom which should be available for a period of at least ten years.49183
Chapter IVEXAMINATION OF EVIDENCECommon Ground33. The proposals presented to us disclosed a considerable measure ofcommon ground between the political parties and other witnesses in Malta.All witnesses expressed themselves in favour of enhancing the status ofthe Maltese Parliament and Government by a re-allocation of legislativefunctions between the Imperial authorities and the Maltese Parliament. all agreed that the position of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta should notbe diminished. All accepted the need for the Parliament at Westminster toretain, in practice, ultimate power in defence and foreign affairs. Again, allwitnesses recommended improvements in the administrative and consultativemachinery of government, both in Malta and in London. Finally, the maltese Government and the representatives of the other parties and organisations in Malta were agreed on the need for continued aid from theUnited Kingdom towards the economic development of Malta and to promote the improvement of Maltese social services and the standard of living.Points of Difference34. Within this measure of agreement, theie were, however, certaindifferences of detail and emphasis. On the division of legislative functions,the Maltese Government proposed that defence and foreign affairs, and.ultimately, direct taxation should be solely and exclusively reserved to the parliament at Westminster. Subject to the continuance of the present over-riding powers of the Parliament at Westminster in all fields, all other matters should be dealt with by the Maltese Parliament. The Malta nationalist party proposed that, when the interim period came to an end, the MalteseParliament should have power to legislate in all fields, including defence andforeign affairs, subject only to two conditions. First, under the proposed jointagreements on defence and foreign affairs, Her Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom and the Maltese Government should exercise a joint responsibility for these matters; secondly, in case of dispute, the last wordshould rest with Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Under the proposals of the progressive Constitutional Party, the present form of Government in Malta would be substantially maintained, but the post of Lieutenant-governor would be abolished and replaced by that of a Chief Secretary. The Governor(and not the Parliament at Westminster) would retain the function and powerto legislate in the fields of defence and foreign affairs in Malta.35. As regards administration of defence and foreign affairs in Malta,the proposals of the Maltese Government imply that the Governor would cease to have executive authority in this field. It would instead be exercised by an &quot; Imperial Branch &quot; in Malta, consisting of a representative of theHome Secretary (the Secretary of State responsible for Maltese affairs);representatives of other United Kingdom Departments with branches in malta; and the heads of the Services. The Malta Nationalist Party proposedthat the executive power in defence and foreign affairs in Malta shouldultimately become the joint responsibility of the two Governments, acting in malta through a United Kingdom High Commissioner and in London through a High Commissioner for Malta. Under their proposals for interimconstitutional reform, and under the proposals of the ProgressiveConstitutional Party, the Governor would retain both legislative and executive authority, subject to consultation with the Maltese Government.
36. There were also differences about the form which arrangements for consultation should take. As regards consultation in Malta, the maltese government proposed a committee presided over by a Maltese Minister. the malta Nationalist Party appeared to suggest consultation through a UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Malta and a High Commissioner for Maltain London, or direct between United Kingdom and Maltese Ministers; butin the interim period, when the Governor still retained responsibility for defence and foreign affairs, he should seek the advice on these matters of anew advisory council consisting of himself, the Prime Minister of Malta,and two other Maltese Ministers. The Progressive Constitutional Partyproposed that the Privy Council should be abolished and that the PrimeMinister should be given a place on the Nominated Council, which shouldbe renamed the Defence Council.37. As regards consultation in London, the Maltese government proposed that there should be a consultative committee of Ministers with powers of decision; the Malta Nationalist Party that there should be a similarbody with the power of deciding disputes over the allocation of legislativefunctions between the Maltese and United Kingdom Parliaments, but onlyduring the interim period; and the Progressive Constitutional Party that thereshould be a larger and more formal body, with powers of co-ordinating policy.38. On the economic side, it became apparent that, although all were agreed on the broad lines of economic development, there were some differences about the ultimate objective and, more particularly, about the time which would be needed to attain it. The economic objective set by the maltese Government was to raise the standard of living of the Maltese peopletowards that of the people of the United Kingdom over a period of 15 to20 years, with the ultimate aim of &quot; parity.&quot; The Maltese government made it clear, however, that they did not regard this economic aim as meaningimmediate and absolute &quot; parity &quot; of Maltese wage levels, social servicestandards and taxation with those prevailing in the United Kingdom. Boththey and the representative of the Malta General Workers&apos; Union, whom we heard separately, stressed that &quot; parity &quot; did not, in any case, mean equality of wages of Maltese and United Kingdom workers; &quot; parity,&quot; to the LabourParty and the General Workers Union, meant equivalence of living standards,having regard to local conditions in Malta.39. The Malta Nationalist Party and the Progressive Constitutional Partycriticised, both on grounds of principle and of practicability, the objective of&quot; parity &quot; of wages, social services and taxation with those in the UnitedKingdom, as they had understood it in the light of the Malta Labour Party&apos;programme at the Maltese elections of February 1955. The economic aim ofthe Malta Nationalist Party was stated to be viability in accordance withMaltese conditions, and not an artificial standard to be achieved in a pre-determined period of time. The Malta Nationalist Party proposed thatviability should be achieved by means of a series of plans assisted by grants from the United Kingdom Treasury, to be negotiated in the normal waybetween the two Governments; they were not prepared to forecast whenviability could be achieved, but they were confident that success in achievingit would be easily distinguishable.40. Finally, there were more important differences of approach betweenthe parties in Malta as to the nature of closer association which they allclaimed their proposals were designed to achieve. The Maltese Governmentemphasised that their proposals were intended to maintain and strengthen the responsibility of the Maltese Parliament for such matters as the roman catholic Church, religious education and family life; that they would be1149183 d* 2
opposed to any interference with this responsibility; and that they had givencategorical assurances to the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church in malta and to the Vatican to that effect. They rebutted the criticisms of the malta Nationalist Party and the Progressive Constitutional Party, which were strongly opposed to any form of closer association involving the absorption of Maltese political, social and economic institutions into those of the UnitedKingdom. In particular, these parties said they were anxious to preserveintact the faith and institutions of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta andwere highly critical of the Maltese Governments proposals on the ground thatthey ran counter to the real wishes of the Maltese people. The maltese government denied that their proposals bore any such interpretation and said they would be strongly opposed to integrating Malta with the UnitedKingdom in that sense.Disagreement on Ultimate Aims41. Beyond these differences, there was clearly a strong and profounddisagreement on the ultimate constitutional status which Malta shouldachieve, and about the nature of the constitutional link which should uniteMalta and the United Kingdom.42. Both the Maltese Government and the Malta Nationalist Party made it clear that, in their opinion, the limited proposals of the ProgressiveConstitutional Party, directed mainly towards improving the present constitution and administration of Maltese affairs in Malta and in London,and not involving any change in Malta&apos;s present constitutional status, were inadequate. The proposals would not, in their view, go far enough tomeet the desire of the Maltese people for an advance from their presentstatus. It was, therefore, essential to decide immediately the nature of theultimate status to be attained.43. The Malta Nationalist Party maintained that the Maltese people could not surrender their inalienable right of self-determination and that theaspirations of enlightened Maltese opinion were for a status of independence.The Malta Nationalist Party, therefore, regarded the normal road towards self-government within the Commonwealth as the proper road for further advance, but recognised that the end, which was most recently achieved byCeylon, could not be fully achieved by Malta. We understood them toagree that, in the special circumstances of Malta, whose future is so largely dependent upon defence expenditure, the ultimate goal of complete independence cannot be reached in the foreseeable future, and to haveframed their proposals for the ultimate status of Malta in the light ofthis fact. They were strongly opposed, on a number of grounds, to theproposal of the Maltese Government that Malta should be represented at westminster. Their most important criticisms were that, in their view, itwould not meet the desire of the Maltese people for more independence,the Malta Labour Party having put it forward in their programme at the february elections only as an alternative to self-determination; that it couldnot be a permanent or satisfactory solution; and that it would inevitably involve, if not their complete absorption, at least the domination of Malteselaws and institutions by those of the United Kingdom. The Malta nationalist party would, therefore, continue to oppose representation at Westminster,whatever the outcome of the Conference. In their view, the rights and aspirations of the Maltese people, and the harmony of future relationsbetween the United Kingdom and Malta, could be guaranteed only by theacceptance of proposals on the lines they themselves had put forward.
44. On the other hand, the proposals of the Maltese Governmentincluded representation at Westminster as their cardinal feature, and were put forward on the ground that they truly met the realities of Malta&apos;s uniquesituation. In particular, they argued that their proposals recognised that independence was not an attainable aim, and that the Parliament at westminster must retain for an indefinite period control over defence andforeign affairs, as well as over-riding powers in all fields. Their proposals were accordingly designed to give the Maltese people an opportunity ofsharing at Westminster in Parliamentary discussion and decisions on thesematters, thereby taking into account their legitimate political aspirationsand making manifest the equality of their status and responsibilities withthose of the British people.45. While the Malta Nationalist Party held that representation at westminster would not be in accordance with the will of the Maltese people and that it would not meet the aspirations of enlightened Maltese opinionfor independent status, the Maltese Government maintained that for the maltese people to express their will regarding representation at Westminsterwould be a real act of self-determination. The proposals of the MaltaNationalist Party, which in any event also recognised that the parliament at Westminster would have to have the final say in defence and foreign affairs,would, they argued, result in greater, not less, friction between the two Govern-ments and peoples and would not create the right climate for co-operation oneconomic development.46. The Maltese Government maintained that their proposals for the division of legislative powers between the Parliament at Westminster andthe Maltese Parliament, and the assurances they had given on religiousquestions (see paragraph 40 above), disposed finally of any Maltese fears.They argued that, on the contrary, the presence of Maltese representatives in the Parliament at Westminster, able to draw attention to the interests andfaith of the Maltese people, would constitute an added protection which didnot exist at present.47. Finally, the Maltese Government maintained that their proposalsclearly represented the will of the Maltese people, since they were put forward by representatives of the Maltese people freely elected by a majority of votes at a recent General Election. They intended, however, to dispose ofany contention that they were imposing their solution on the Maltese people,by submitting the matter to a referendum at the appropriate time.Chapter VCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSA. Economic Development48. The United Kingdom Service Departments consider that there is nonear prospect of a decline in Malta&apos;s strategic importance or in the relativelevel of defence expenditure in Malta, although they pointed out to us that,if costs in Malta rise considerably more rapidly than in the United Kingdom,less work may be done there, especially in the dockyard. All witnesses were agreed that defence expenditure is likely to remain for the foreseeable future the essential basis on which the Maltese economy rests, and there was nodisposition on the part of anyone we consulted to argue that this was contraryto Malta&apos;s own interests. We are, however, convinced of the need for a concerted drive to strengthen the rest of the Maltese economy as a precaution
against a possible falling off in defence expenditure and to raise Malta&apos;income sufficiently to pay for improved social services. It is, therefore,important that, subject to the over-riding requirements of urgent defenceprojects, there should be consultation on, and co-ordination of, the require-ments of both Governments to secure the best use of Malta&apos;s resources andlabour and to avoid inflation of costs.Possible Fields of Development49. We did not consider it within our terms of reference to examine in detail and to make specific recommendations on the future lines ofeconomic development for Malta. This is a task which properly falls tothe Maltese Government to carry through with expert help from the UnitedKingdom and elsewhere. We were assured that it is now being tackledwith energy and speed, and what we saw during our visits to various places and installations in the Islands tended to confirm this. Some general observations are, however, necessary to relate this aspect of the Malteseproblem to our recommendations for constitutional changes.Water Supply50. The first need, in our view and in the opinion of most witnesses,is to improve and expand the water supply. There are no rivers in Malta;and although the average annual rainfall is twenty inches, the facilities for collecting and storing rainwater are dangerously inadequate, even for presentneeds. The salinity of the lower water table is rising rapidly, and in yearsof low rainfall a serious shortage occurs of drinking water and of water for agriculture and industry. Work is in hand to catch and store water in theupper water table, and geological surveys are being undertaken to find otherunderground sources. We were informed that this should result in a marked increase in present supplies and in the avoidance of serious shortages in years of low rainfall. But, if the present highly unsatisfactory and dangerousposition is to be remedied, and if there is to be any hope of improvingagricultural output and encouraging the establishment of new industries,much work remains to be done and further capital must be spent on waterschemes.Agriculture51. There appear to be possibilities of improvement in agriculture,especially if a more adequate supply of water can be secured. Although goodsoil is scarce and the small size of holdings limits the possibilities of furtherapplying modern mechanical methods of cultivation and harvesting,agricultural output could certainly be raised by better soil husbandry(including the extended use of irrigation, the conservation and use of sewage,weed control, the more scientific application of fertilisers and the use of improved seed), by the introduction of new &quot; seasonal &quot; crops for export, suchas vegetables and soft fruits, by improved stocking, by the more effective control of pests and animal diseases, by better marketing arrangements, by agricultural co-operation and extension work and by research. We under-stand that these matters are now under active study by the maltese government and that expert assistance is being sought from the UnitedKingdom and from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the united nations.Fishing52. The fishing industry should and could be improved. There shouldbe a vigorous effort to reduce Malta&apos;s dependence on imported fish supplies.The main problems of the fishing industry are lack of suitable craft and
equipment and shortage of skilled crews. Capital expenditure in this fieldwould not only provide increased productive employment but reduce the strain on Malta&apos;s balance of payments, caused by the present imports offish for local consumption.Civil Harbour53. There is urgent need for improvement in the civil harbour so asto reduce the present high costs of unloading civil supplies and to assist,through cheaper transport costs, in the expansion of the export trade. a comprehensive survey is now being undertaken and a scheme of harbourimprovement is being worked out. This, we understand, will be given ahigh priority in the new development plan.Tourism54. The natural attractions, the beautiful buildings and the historicassociations of the Islands should attract more tourists. Attention is beginning to be given to this, but beaches will have to be improved andother tourist facilities provided before the tourist trade can be counted onto make any substantial and permanent contribution to Malta&apos;s revenue.Industry55. It is in the industrial field that most hopes appear to be placed fora rapid expansion of production and of alternative employment for the local labour force. There are already operating in Malta a number of smallindustries established under the protection of the Encouragement of IndustryLaw and of a tariff. Some of these industries are efficiently run and able to compete in the export trade; but some are able to continue only within theprotected domestic market. Because of the lack of local resources,entrepreneurs and markets, it is unlikely, in our view, that there will bea rapid expansion of industries, even light industries, in the immediate future.Too much hope should certainly not be placed on the possibility of attractingnew industries by the application of measures similar to those introduced inthe United Kingdom under the Distribution of Industry Acts. There are,however, some measures which the Maltese Government can properly take toencourage industrial development, particularly through the provision of improved basic services, such as water supplies, power and harbour develop-ment, and by increasing the flow of skilled workers through improvedtechnical education. Furthermore, certain materials and manufactured goods,at present imported by the Service Departments from the United Kingdom,might be produced in the Islands, thereby helping to stimulate local industry.We recommend that this should be a matter for consultation between the maltese Government and the Services.Emigration56. Much of the evidence we have heard drew attention to the serious problems created by the rapidly rising population and stressed the need for continued emigration on a substantial scale in order to prevent unemploy-ment and a fall in the standard of living. Some witnesses were, at thesame time, fearful of the effects of continued emigration, at the rate recentlyachieved, on the supply of skilled labour in Malta. We recognise the urgent need for carrying on with the programme of assisted emigration;but we suggest that this should be a balanced programme and so ensurethat, as further opportunities for skilled employment in Malta are created by the development of local resources, there is an adequate supply of skilled
workers to fill them. The plans for improved technical education nowbeing carried through by the Maltese Government should increase thenumbers of skilled workers coming forward. This should ease the problemof the local labour supply and, at the same time, improve the prospects for skilled workers who emigrate. The prospects for emigration are, in anycase, greatly dependent on the needs and policies of the receiving countries.In this connection, some witnesses expressed concern about the presentlimitation of the numbers of Maltese admitted by other countries and aboutthe signs of a further reduction. We recommend that both the maltese government and Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom shouldcontinue to give a high priority to the problems of emigration.57. The broad conclusion to which our enquiries have brought us, then,is that there are prospects of economic development through the better useof available resources, including improved skills. Progress may be substantial,by comparison with present standards; but over the whole range of the economy we cannot say that we are convinced that the absolute rate of advance is likely to be as rapid as some of the witnesses were prepared to forecast. The rate of progress will depend on a number of unknown factors,including the success achieved by the Maltese Government in extending the necessary facilities by a carefully worked out and flexibly operated plan of basic development and the extent to which local initiative, enterprise andskill can be encouraged and developed. Moreover, industrial expansionwill depend in part on Malta&apos;s ability to attract United Kingdom and other firms to establish local factories, and this in turn will be determined largely by the firms&apos; own assessment of the advantages of Malta as a centre ofproduction. Any rapid rise in costs would, in present circumstances, lessen the prospects of economic expansion. The consequent need for wage restraint in Malta was fully recognised in evidence before us by the maltese government and by representatives of the Malta General Workers Union.United Kingdom Aid58. It is clearly beyond the capacity and means of the maltese government to carry out a development programme of the size and scoperequired to meet the present situation. Further substantial help will have to beprovided by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in various forms, including technical assistance in surveys of resources and in preparing development plans,assistance and advice on technical education and technical services andfinancial aid, as may prove necessary.59. Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is this yearproviding between  4 and  5 millions towards Malta&apos;s capital and currentneeds. In the agreed statement on economic policy issued at the end ofthe June talks (see Appendix G) Her Majesty&apos;s Government undertook tocontinue financial aid over the next few years; first, to promote new capital development and, secondly, to assist, as may prove necessary, towardsbalancing the budget and improving social services. Although the amountof this aid has not yet been determined, we understand that a continuation of aid at about present levels for the next few years is not considered by her Majesty&apos;s Government to be unreasonable. It seems to us to be unlikely that more money could be spent productively in Malta during these years because of the limits set by the skilled labour force available, and thebuilding and constructional capacity of the Islands. The rate of neededassistance towards capital expenditure may possibly increase graduallythereafter; but a decision on requests for assistance towards recurrentexpenses will have to depend on the success which is achieved in promoting
productive development in Malta and hence in increasing local taxable capacity. It is important that care should be taken that increases in socialexpenditure do not run ahead of Malta&apos;s ability to support it, in the longer term, from her own resources. The new schemes referred to in Appendix Ewill throw a burden on Maltese resources and, therefore, will have to beintroduced gradually.60. Assistance from the United Kingdom Treasury will necessarily besubject to control by the Parliament at Westminster. The form of that control is a matter which should be settled between the two Governments. Thereshould be, at the outset, a clear understanding about the maximum amountof assistance which could be given annually by the United kingdom excequer over a period of years. This would assist the maltese government in drawing up its ann financial budget and would reduce the possibilitiesof friction in the annual examination of Malta&apos;s requests for assistance towards meeting recurrent costs.61. It is universally agreed that the task of raising the Maltese standardof living will be a long and arduous one, involving a bold and sustainedeffort by the Maltese Government and people, with financial and other assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. Aseries of development plans, designed to raise productivity and expandnational income, will have to be carefully planned and carried out. In thisconnection, we emphasise the words agreed by all the representatives at the june talks &quot; that the degree of- success attained will depend on the hard workand self-discipline of the Maltese people, and on the Maltese Governmentand people making the best possible contribution from their own resources.&quot;Without continued support from the United Kingdom, further development,even along modest lines, would be virtually impossible. We are confident that, in this task of economic development and progress, the Maltese peoplecan count upon continued and whole-hearted co-operation and assistance fromthe Government and people of the United Kingdom.B. Constitutional Changes62. We have sought to set out, as objectively as possible, theconstitutional aspects of the situation prevailing in Malta which bear directlyupon our task. We come now to our conclusions and recommendations onthese matters. We have not regarded it as our duty to seek either to describean ideal constitution for Malta or to arbitrate between the aspirations of thedifferent Maltese parties. Our primary task has been to decide how far theproposals for closer association, and, in particular, those put forward by the maltese. Government, are consonant with the interests and requirements ofboth the United Kingdom and Malta, and with the responsibilities of theImperial Parliament.63. The Prime Minister of Malta has made it clear to us that, in hisopinion, representation at Westminster is the crucial issue and the one whichwill determine the direction of Malta&apos;s future political evolution. This issueof representation is also at the origin of the appointment of this Round table conference.  We therefore consider it first.64. In the special circumstances of the Islands, we cannot foresee a timewhen Malta could achieve complete independence. There can, therefore, beno question of the Parliament at Westminster abandoning the authority whichis now vested in it. At the same time, we record our conviction that the discretion which Parliament has shown, in exercising its authority during the
150 years since Malta came under the Crown, will be continued in the future and that the inability of Parliament to enter into any convention or bindingagreement to devolve powers deriving from that authority need cause no fear that it will invade those legislative fields which are accepted, in practice, asthe direct concern of the Maltese Government and people.65. We were impressed, during our visit to the Islands, by the extent towhich defence requirements in Malta are inextricably bound up with theeveryday life of the community and thus impinge on the domestic concerns ofthe Maltese people; and we have had ample evidence of the difficulties whichhave arisen in the past in the exercise of the Governors jurisdiction in reserved matters. It would be unrealistic to expect that difficulties will not be encountered in the future in determining whether a matter properly lieswithin the respective competence of the Maltese and the United KingdomParliaments. This is a problem which has to be faced in any division of functions between two Legislatures and there is no cut-and-dried solution of it.66. There are now two distinct governments in Malta, each havinglegislative and executive powers and operating concurrently within itsdefined sphere. When this system was instituted in 1921, it was thoughtpossible that the respective spheres of the Imperial and MalteseGovernments could be clearly defined and that neither in administration norin legislation would there be any confusion between their functions nor any doubt as to their respective responsibilities.   Practice has proved otherwise.67. Nearly all the friction has arisen from disputes on the interpretation of reserved matters, principally over what is a matter of defence. the maltese people are naturally jealous of their powers of self-government andthey have been suspicious of the matters reserved to the Maltese ImperialGovernment being interpreted in such a way as to impinge on those powers.The ever-widening sphere of defence, complicated by the introduction ofAllied forces, and the wide scope of the reserved matters as enumerated inthe Constitution have thus undoubtedly involved a practical restriction of maltese self-government.68. The wider the scope of the authority of the Maltese Parliament and government, the greater is the possibility of a conflict of interests andjurisdictions between them and the Imperial side. The very nature of govern-ment in Malta makes it impossible to devise a Constitution which wouldentirely separate the requirements of defence from those matters which are within the authority of the Maltese Government, in such a way as to removeall possibility of conflict.69. In the course of their evidence, several witnesses expressed theopinion that it would be desirable for us to limit our constitutional recom-mendations to those matters on which the three political parties in Maltaare in broad agreement. This, it was argued, would meet the needs of thepresent situation and would avoid the danger of splitting the Maltese peopleon the one really controversial issue the ultimate constitutional status of malta. However, we are satisfied from the evidence we have heard that both the main parties in Malta are deeply concerned about this question.The desire for prestige and feelings of self-interest are naturally involved;but, given recognition of the wish for an advance in the present constitutional status of Malta, they have a right to know the direction in which it will bepossible for them to move and the ultimate goal which they may expect toreach. Some means should rightly be offered them to satisfy these aspirationsfor a further constitutional advance and for the prospect of stability in thefuture.
Dominion Status70. The proposals of the Malta Nationalist Party and of the maltese government both include measures which are claimed to be essential to fulfilMaltese aspirations; the former in the direction of Dominion status, and thelatter through the new conception of representation of the Maltese people inParliament at Westminster. Having considered the special circumstances of malta, we are obliged to reach the conclusion that the road to full self-government is blocked, in that the Parliament at Westminster must, in orderto maintain the defences of Malta and the facilities necessary to enable it to fulfil its role as one of the principal Commonwealth and N.A.T.O. bases inthe Mediterrranean, exercise overriding powers in Malta in the fields ofdefence and foreign affairs. These requirements inevitably involve a limitationin possible advances open to the Maltese Parliament itself.71. We are also obliged to conclude that, having regard to the specialcircumstances of Malta, the proposals put before us for a &quot; quasi-Dominion &quot;status would not be workable. They lack essential definition and would inevitably lead to conflicts of interpretation and to embarrassment in relationswith Commonwealth and foreign countries.Possible Alternatives72. In attempting to reach a solution which meet the situation,we have considered other ideas but have rejected them because they fall short,in one or other respect, of what is required. For example, we did notconsider that the desire of the Maltese people to have a more direct voice indecisions affecting their livelihood would be satisfied by the appointment of a consultative body of Ministers in London with the more formal constitutional status of a Committee of the Privy Council for Maltese Affairs, to whichMaltese Ministers would be invited for consultation.73. We also reject the idea that there might be Maltese representatives inParliament who would only have the right to ask questions and take part indebates on foreign affairs and defence, and not to vote. This would berepugnant to the dignity and traditions of our Parliament and would not give the Members from Malta equality of status and responsibility with members from the United Kingdom. Such an arrangement is also, in ourview, unworkable, since it is not in fact possible completely to distinguishmatters of defence from more domestic aspects of United Kingdom affairs,any more than it is possible to do so in Malta. We also feel that thereis considerable merit in the argument that Maltese representatives at westminster would be interested in, if not directly concerned with, very manyaspects of life in Britain, including the effects of budgetary policy. Finally,we should not wish to encourage, as this arrangement might, the idea that theties of the Maltese and United Kingdom peoples, within the commonwealth and under the Crown, depend only on the material and physical effects of their common interest in defence.74. We do not think that Malta&apos;s desire for a voice in the Parliament at westminster could be met by enabling one or more representatives chosen by the Maltese Parliament to sit in the House of Lords. A proposal designedto make any formal arrangement for representation of Malta in the Houseof Lords would have wider implications, involving the general question ofthe reform of the Second Chamber, and would require legislation^&apos; Moreover,* It will be noted from Appendix A that we received a memorandum from theNobility of Malta, whose present Honorary President is the Most Honourable theMarquess of Lothian, a member of the House of Lords.
such representation would not, in present circumstances, give Malta an effective voice in decisions at Westminster on expenditure affecting the maltese people and their economy.Full Parliamentary Representation75. In examining the proposals put before us by the two main Malteseparties we have been left in no doubt about the objections and difficultiesseen by many people, both in the United Kingdom and in Malta, to offeringMalta full representation in the Parliament at Westminster. These objections were made to us with force and authority, and we do not treat them lightly.Indeed, we consider it our duty to bring them to the attention of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Parliament, so that their decision on this complex anddelicate issue may be taken in the light of all the relevant circumstances.76. We have considered., first, whether there is any merit in the contention that Maltese Members of Parliament, necessarily very few in number, could have little or no influence on the proceedings of the House, and would thussuffer from feelings of frustration and discontent. Similar feelings are not wholly absent from the minds of many of the Members elected for UnitedKingdom constituencies, but we are sure that they would be the first to agreethat the opportunities for individual Members to express views and to safe-guard the interests of constituents, are a guarantee of democratic freedom.Nor did we find convincing the argument that these few Members from Malta would be able to exploit the balance of power, if Government and opposition were evenly divided.Implications of Representation11. Fears have been expressed to us about the possible repercussionselsewhere of admission to Westminster of representatives from Malteseconstituencies. Such repercussions, it has been said, might take the form of claims from Colonial territories which, owing to their small size, lack of natural resources or for other reasons, see no prospects of achieving thenormal form of constitutional development, to be accorded a status similarto that of Malta. The claim by Malta to representation at Westminster isbased on, and justified by, the quite exceptional circumstances and positionof Malta. For this reason, we do not consider that claims from other quartersshould arise which cannot be dealt with on their own merits.78. We are, however, bound to feel concern about the anxieties of asubstantial section of the Maltese people regarding the suggestion that thetwo countries should be brought closer together by the link of representation at Westminster. We have outlined earlier in our Report the fears expressed on the one hand, and the assurances given on the other, about the maintenanceof the position of the Roman Catholic faith in Malta. We do not wish to involve ourselves in this question, which in our view is one for the Maltese people themselves; but we have a number of general observations to make on it.79. As we understand the position, there is unanimous desire in Maltafor an improvement of economic and social conditions. Similarly, there is widespread agreement on the need for the close association of Malta withthe United Kingdom. It is only with regard to the form of that association,and the particular issue of representation, that any fears are entertained aboutthe possible long-term effects on social and religious life in Malta. So far asthe Parliament at Westminster is concerned, we do not see that the presenceof Maltese Members, elected by a Maltese people devoted to their laws and institutions, would lessen, in regard to religious matters, the restraint and
Illrespect which the Parliament at Westminster has shown for the last 150 years.*We consider that on the basis recommended in paragraph 85 below, the maltese Parliament should remain responsible for legislation on all domestic affairs and, in particular, on such matters as the position of the Church,education, and family life. Moreover, although the representatives of theConference were able to discuss the matter with the Archbishop of Maltaonly on a hypothetical basis, they felt entitled to give him assurances chat,in their opinion, the Maltese Parliament would continue, under any new constitutional arrangement which could be envisaged, to exercise authority inall fields in which the Church is directly concerned, and that the parliament at Westminster had no desire whatever to intervene in such fields and,following its long-standing tradition, would not so intervene.Decision for the Maltese80. Finally, we recognise that a decision to grant representation formaltality in the Parliament at Westminster would not meet the wishes expressed to us by the representatives of a large section of the Maltese electorate. Oursole concern is to devise the best means of meeting the aspirations of the maltese people, subject to their acceptance of necessary limitations in the fields of defence and foreign affairs, for a higher ultimate constitutional status and a greater stability in future. The offer of representation at Westminsterwould be a recognition by the people of the United Kingdom that they andthe people of Malta should enjoy equality of status. Common membership of the Parliament at Westminster, the highest authority under the Crown,which ultimately controls both our destinies, would make this equalitymanifest and meet the realities of the situation. However, it is for the maltese people themselves to determine and to demonstrate clearly andunmistakably whether the proposals of the Maltese Government do indeedcorrespond to their own wishes.81. If the principle of representation at Westminster were to beaccepted by the Maltese people and by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and parliament at Westminster, the detailed implementation would have to be worked cut in consultation between the two Governments. We confineourselves to stating two considerations which we think must guide such further elaboration. First, having regard to the basis on which the separateparts of the United Kingdom are represented in Parliament and the size ofthe Maltese electorate, there should be three Maltese representatives at westminster. Secondly, Maltese representatives should be elected in exactly the same way, and under the same laws governing representation of the people and electoral practices, as are Members from the United Kingdom.82. We conclude that representation at Westminster is practicable and reasonable, and, subject to the considerations mentioned above, werecommend its acceptance by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom and by the Parliament at Westminster.Further Constitutional Changes83. We were requested by our terms of reference &quot; to consider consti-tutional and related questions arising from proposals for closer association between Malta and the United Kingdom and, in particular, from the proposal* I agree with, this view on the assumption that our recommendation, that the maltese Parliament remain responsible for such matters as the position of the Church,education and family life, is carried out, and on the assumption that appropriate and satisfactory assurances are provided in connection with any new constitutionalarrangement. .(Signed) PERTH.
-2. That Malta should in future be represented in the Parliament at Westminster.&quot;Following upon our recommendation in the preceding paragraph, and assuming its acceptance, we proceed to make recommendations on otherconstitutional and related questions below.84. The proposals which we have received from the Maltese Govern-ment and other Maltese parties and witnesses are described in ChaptersIII and IV. We refrain from commenting on the question whether the maltese Parliament should continue to be elected by proportional repre-sentation or should be elected in the same way as Members of the Houseof Commons. This is a matter for the Maltese themselves to decide. Withregard to the other changes proposed, there is already broad agreement thatthe legislative scope of the Maltese Parliament should be widened and thatthere should be provision for regular and continuous consultation, both in malta and in London, between the Maltese Government and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, on matters which affect their mutualinterests and responsibilities. We consider that reforms in these fields are desirable to ensure a more efficient and cordial relationship between thetwo Governments.85. As regards the division of legislative functions between the parliament at Westminster and the Maltese Parliament, we recommend that,subject to the principle of religious toleration as embodied in the Declarationof Rights of 1802 (Appendix F) and in recent Constitutions, the legislative authority of the Maltese Parliament should extend to all matters other thandefence and foreign affairs, and, ultimately, direct taxation. As we have explained, the process of raising Maltese living standards will be slow andgradual, and the attainment of equivalence with the United Kingdom isdifficult to envisage at the present time. For that reason we consider thatthe question of transferring powers of taxation from the Maltese legislature to the Parliament at Westminster should be left in abeyance for the timebeing.86. We further recommend that the separation of authority for defence and foreign affairs from authority for those matters which are the directconcern of the Maltese Parliament and Government should not as at presenttake the form of two separate Maltese Governments, one composed of elected Maltese Ministers and the other of the servants of the ImperialGovernment. This does not, however, dispose of the necessity for an authority in Malta to carry out the decisions of the Parliament and Govern-ment at Westminster in the fields of defence and foreign affairs, and for the maltese Government to recognise the need to ensure the efficient and speedyexercise of responsibility by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in those fields. Wehave not thought it possible, as part of our present task, to work out and recommend how this authority should be set up and staffed. This will require careful study, in consultation with the Maltese Government, but we suggestthat the authority responsible for defence and foreign affairs in Malta shouldbe organised on the following general lines.87. The responsibility for Maltese affairs in London should betransferred to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who shouldbe represented in Malta by a United Kingdom representative, at the headof a staff constituting the United Kingdom agency in Malta, with thenecessary powers, under the authority of the Home Secretary, to carry outthe decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in defence and foreign affairs and to consult and collaborate with the Maltese Government in matters of joint concern.88. We have considered how the present definition of defence and foreignaffairs as set out in Section 23 (3) of the Constitution Letters Patent might
be revised. We sympathise with the views expressed to us that the mattersenumerated in section 23 (3) go beyond what is normally understood by defence and foreign affairs. We see no reason why, subject to certainsafeguards, the Maltese Government and Parliament should not now be invested with authority over such matters as the administration of civilaviation (not including operational control which the Maltese government agree must, in the special circumstances of Malta, be retained by the service authorities) and such other matters as are found to be appropriate for exerciseby the Maltese Government and Parliament. We therefore recommend thatthe present list of reserved matters, as set out in Section 23 (3) of theConstitution Letters Patent, should be carefully reviewed. In making thisrecommendation, however, we should like it to be understood that thescope of defence and foreign affairs to-day is much wider than it was whenthe 1921 Constitution was drawn up, and that it would be undesirable ifthere were to be constant legalistic disputes about any definition which maybe incorporated in new constitutional instruments.89. The problem as regards legislation is comparatively small, since we understand that the main legislation on foreign affairs affecting Maltarelates to diplomatic privileges, and that, in the field of defence, there are agood many provisions in United Kingdom law which would neither be appropriate nor needed in Malta. We see no reason why legislation on defence and foreign affairs should not, for the most part, be enacted by the parliament at Westminster, and by Her Majesty in Council legislating formaltality by Order in Council, on the advice of a Secretary of State. The powerto make subordinate legislation could, subject to the normal safeguards,be devolved on the Secretary of State for the Home Department and, in turn, on his representative in Malta. The main difficulty would arise withregard to borderline cases or changing requirements. It is thus important to ensure that legislation is not held up by disputes over vires. It hasindeed been suggested to us in evidence that the Maltese Parliament shouldbe given power of legislation in all fields, subject to the over-riding legislative authority of the Parliament at Westminster. This has the merit of simplicity,but might give rise to difficulties and misunderstandings and engender feelings of frustration. It would, in our view, be better not to confuse the normalroles of the two Parliaments. We are, therefore, more attracted by anothersuggestion that provision should be made for the power of the parliament at Westminster to legislate on defence and foreign affairs to be devolved atdiscretion on the Maltese Parliament. This suggestion appears to offer a means of dealing with matters (such as the control of transit of strategic materials), the subject of which may normally be one falling to be dealtwith by the Maltese Parliament but the object of which may be for thepurpose of defence and foreign affairs.90. Another difficulty which might arise is that the Maltese parliament might wish to pass a Bill touching on defence and foreign affairs. this difficulty might be overcome by adapting the provisions of Section 34 ofthe present Constitution Letters Patent to the requirements of the newConstitution, i.e., by providing that any Bill which, in the opinion of theGovernor or, alternatively, on the basis of representations to him by theUnited Kingdom representative in Malta, appeared to impinge on the field of defence and foreign affairs, should be referred to the Home Secretary,whose decision, after consultation with the Maltese Ministers, would be final.91. It is even more important that, once legislation is enacted, the exerciseof executive authority by the agency in Malta of the Government at westminster, however it may be constituted, should not be subjected tounreasonable delays owing to differences, however genuine, about the
propriety of the action involved. This is one reason why it is important to ensure a regular means of consultation and co-ordination between theUnited Kingdom agency in Malta and the Maltese Government a matter which we discuss below.92. Subject to these requirements, we consider that, once it is accepted that the authority of the Maltese Parliament and Ministers can be enlargedon the lines indicated above, the Governor should no longer have discretion to ignore the advice of Maltese Ministers in matters which are their concern.We therefore recommend that, in matters other than defence and foreignaffairs, the new Constitution should provide that the Governor should actupon the advice of his Maltese Ministers.93. However, in view of the unique situation of Malta as an Island-fortress, we consider that some discretion must be reserved to the Imperialside in event of an emergency. Strong views were expressed to us by allMaltese witnesses that the present powers of the Governor under Section 59of the Constitution Letters Patent are too extensive and should be restricted to what is necessary to deal with &quot; real&quot; emergencies. It was argued thatMaltese Ministers would be ready to recognise a situation of emergency and to take the necessary steps to deal with it. They would be fullycompetent to deal with emergencies caused by fire, flood and other formsof natural disaster; in emergencies involving defence interests, responsibility would in any case fall to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.94. On this question, we feel that, behind the desire for a change, thereis an apprehension, rooted in past events, that the present scope of Section 59could be used to frustrate the will of the Maltese Parliament. We sympathise with the view that any interference, even in times of natural disaster orother emergency, with the authority normally exercised by Maltese ministers could be justified only in the most serious circumstances. Nevertheless, weare convinced that it would not be in the general interest, particularly whenurgent action is required to deal with a threatening situation, if the powersof the Imperial side to deal with an emergency were to be unduly restricted;and we trust that, in the new constitutional framework we are recommending,it will be possible for the Maltese Government to accept this view.95. As regards consultation between the two Governments, we recognisethat the avoidance of friction under any constitutional arrangements formaltality will always depend on the ready acceptance of defence needs, which in-clude the needs of foreign forces and of N.A.T.O., and on goodwill and mutualtrust between the two sides of Government. Nevertheless, we consider that many of the difficulties which have arisen in the past regarding the respectivespheres of authority of the Maltese and Imperial sides could be avoided,or dealt with before becoming sources of grievance, if there were machineryboth in Malta and in London to ensure effective consultation and co-co-ordination between Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the maltese government. This would provide a forum in which apparently difficultrequirements of either side could be explained, and opportunity takenwherever possible of making mutually satisfactory adjustments. It could also provide a means for consultation on Malta?s economic and social problems and for arranging mutual assistance by the two Governments ineach other&apos;s projects.96. We were concerned to discover why the machinery of the privy council, provided for in the present Constitution, had not workedsuccessfully in the past. It became clear to us that a body which is speciallysummoned, and, in practice, summoned to meet only for discussion andresolution of differences when these have reached an acute stage, cannot
provide a basis for effective co-operation, which should be conducted in an atmosphere of sympathy and confidence. In our view, therefore, it isimportant that any consultative machinery which may be devised shouldexist not merely for the resolution of occasional difficulties but for a regular and continual process of information, consultation and co-ordination.97. We believe that the Maltese Prime Minister should be kept informed of general developments in the field of defence and foreign affairs in theMediterranean area to the extent necessary to provide the maltese government with the background required for a proper understanding of therequirements of defence in Malta. Our first recommendation, therefore, isthat there should be set up, in place of the Nominated Council, a new defence Council, under the chairmanship of the Governor, of which the maltese Prime Minister, the United Kingdom representative in Malta andthe Heads of the Services in Malta would be members. The defence council should be used both to inform the Maltese Prime Minister of developments in defence and foreign affairs and to discuss matters of defence policy in Malta on which there might be a conflict of interests with the maltese Government. Secondly, we recommend that, to deal with matters concerning the economic and financial problems involved in the respectiveactivities in Malta of the Service Departments and the Maltese Government,there should be established another committee, presided over by a MalteseMinister, on which representatives of the Services and of the United Kingdomagency in Malta would sit. Both these committees should meet regularly atstated times throughout the year.98. We hope that most of the difficulties which might arise in the future will be resolved when consultative machinery on these lines is set up in malta. It must be recognised, however, that some important issues, and someproblems of particular difficulty, will need to be dealt with by UnitedKingdom and Maltese Ministers meeting personally. We therefore recommend, in addition, acceptance of the proposal broadly agreed by allMaltese parties that there should be a joint Ministerial committee inLondon, presided over by a United Kingdom Minister. We think it isimportant, however, to make it clear that such a Ministerial committee couldnot function successfully if it were to be regarded, and used, merely as a courtof appeal for disputes unresolved by the process of consultation in Malta,or for striking bargains on other disputed questions. It should also be clearthat such a committee, like the committees in Malta, would be advisory andconsultative in character, and would not have, as has been sugggested in some evidence, independent executive powers. It should be used for the exchangeof information, and for consultation, between the two sides. UnitedKingdom Ministers should use it to inform Maltese Ministers of generaldevelopments in defence and foreign affairs and of other important policymatters of which the latter should be aware; and for explaining the need for particular policies which required to be implemented by the United Kingdomagency in Malta. Maltese Ministers should use it similarly for informing and explaining to United Kingdom Ministers their problems and policies in Malta.99. The sole purpose of such consultative bodies must be to ensureco-ordination of governmental policy. They could not alter decisions ofParliament, nor purport to effect ad hoc changes in the MalteseConstitution to suit the requirements of particular cases; nor should they beallowed to obscure the responsibilities of Ministers to their Parliaments norinfringe the doctrine of collective Ministerial responsibility. For these andother practical reasons, we recommend that the consultative bodies shouldbe set up administratively, rather than by constitutional instrument.
Conclusion100. In our opinion, the solution that we have suggested meets thespecial situation which confronts us. On the one hand, Malta is still aseparate entity, whose people desire to manage their local affairs, andarrangements for the local government of Malta must have regard to this fact,as well as to the situation of the Islands and their people&apos;s way of life. Onthe other hand, there must be remembered the traditions which Malta haschosen to share with us. She voluntarily came under the British Crown150 years ago, and continued to accept, with the prestige and material benefits of being a stronghold in the Mediterranean, the difficulties of an island-fortress economy. She has been a tower of strength to the causes which the British and Maltese peoples both believe to be those of thecivilisation of which Malta has been again and again a bastion. The twoworld wars of this century have set their seal on Britain and Malta standingtogether. In these circumstances, we believe that the people of Malta areentitled to a special road to political equality, and that that road should be,if they so choose, representation at Westminster.KILMUIR.C.

STATEMENT BY Mr. MACLAY AND Mr. PICKTHORNWe are in general agreement with the economic, consultative, andadministrative recommendations in the Report. We are, however, unable tojoin in the recommendation that there should be Maltese representation inthe British House of Commons at this stage.2.   We consider that there is urgent need for (a) revision of the present &quot; list of reserved matters &quot;;(b) improvements in the administrative and consultative machinery o&apos;government both in Malta and in London, and(c) continued aid from the United Kingdom towards the economic develop-ment of Malta and towards the improvement of the Maltese standardof living and social services.3.   We agree (a) that the historic association of Malta with the United Kingdom, andthe development of Malta as an island fortress, have produced an islandeconomy which, in relation to the size of the population, means thatviability as an independent unit is difficult to foresee;(b) that the special characteristics and strategic position of Malta as afortress require that for the foreseeable future overriding powers oflegislation and authority for administration in the fields of external affairs and defence must be retained by the Government at Westminster,and that for these reasons one road to the attainment of full self-government by Malta is blocked.4. While we recognise that representation at Westminster may well prove to be the ultimate answer to the constitutional desires and needs of boththe peoples of the United Kingdom and of Malta, we are not convinced thatrepresentation in the next Parliament of the United Kingdom is in accordancewith the realities of the present situation.5. It has been made clear that all shades of opinion in Malta desireauthority and responsibility for all matters other than defence and foreignaffairs to remain with the Maltese Parliament. The Report accepts this view,with which we concur. The Report further recommends that the MalteseParliament should continue to be the authority for raising indirect taxation and, during an indeterminate period, direct taxation.6. In these conditions, if Malta is represented at Westminster, the MalteseMembers of Parliament will have full rights to debate and vote, not only on questions of defence and foreign affairs, but also on all matters affectingthe United Kingdom, including the voting of supply, direct and indirect taxation, and colonial affairs. They will have equalitv of function withall other Members of Parliament at Westminster, but they will not haveequality of responsibility: they will have no responsibility to their Malteseconstituents for Maltese domestic affairs, including taxation, which willremain with the Maltese Parliament.7. Separation, to this extent, of authority and function from responsibilitycan, in our opinion, hardly be justified, and the argument that whateverhappens in the United Kingdom can be of interest to and have an effect in malta seems to us far-reaching and capable of too indefinite extension.8. Can Maltese membership of the Parliament at Westminster then bejustified as a first step towards a degree of integration of the social and
1.economic life of Malta with that of the United Kingdom, a degree whichwould give reality to the concept of equality of function and responsibilityof all Members of Parliament at Westminster?9. In our opinion such a step is premature and, in view of the inherentimplications of representation at Westminster, could lead to seriousmisunderstandings in Malta, in the United Kingdom, and possibly in those territories overseas which are directly affected by decisions of the UnitedKingdom Parliament.10. For the time being we believe that revision of the list of reserved matters, development of the administrative and consultative machinery ofgovernment in Malta and in London, and continued economic aid cantogether result in very real progress towards the meeting of Malta&apos;s economicneeds and towards that constitutional advance which is consistent withimmediate realities.(Signed)     JOHN S.

Special benefits are paid (subject to a means testwhich takes capital into account) to families of leprosy patients, totuberculosis patients and/or their families, and for outdoor medical relief.A special milk subsidy is paid for babies.2. Old-age pensions are non-contributory and are subject to a means test. The rates vary according to means, but the maximum pension is \6s. aweek. Social assistance is available, after a strict means test, to destitutehouseholds. (It is not available to a household whose head is fit for work,even if he is unemployed, and the &quot; potential&quot; wages of all fit adults are taken into account in paying rates of relief whether or not they are actuallyearning these wages.) The rates of assistance range from 16s. a week for asingle person to 61s. a week for a household of six or more. Workmen&apos;compensation is contributory. The contribution is 2d. a week (Id. from the employer and Id. from the employee), and the benefits are in two forms allowances and pensions. The maximum allowance is 3s1. a day for up to oneyear, after which, in the case of permanent and complete incapacity, a pension of 12.?. a week plus Is. for each child is payable. Other benefits are availablefor permanent, or temporary, partial injuries, and for the widows, orphans, orother dependants of victims of fatal accidents.3. The Government of Malta has recently announced plans to introduce a comprehensive scheme of social insurance, following the pattern of, butnot reproducing, the United Kingdom scheme. The scheme will absorb thepresent Workmen&apos;s Compensation and Widows&apos; Pension scheme, and will include benefits for sickness, unemployment, old age, widows, orphans, andindustrial injuries, and marriage grants. It is also proposed to provide anew National Assistance Scheme which will replace the present schemes for social services assistance and outdoor medical relief.
Health Services4. Health Services are provided by the Medical and Health Department.For every town or village there is a District Medical Officer, who, in additionto administrative duties, visits patients in their homes or sees them at aGovernment dispensary, where he dispenses medicines, appliances, &amp;c. Ifnecessary, he can send a patient to a specialist or to one of the Governmenthospitals. Where treatment is not available locally, passages to the UnitedKingdom may be paid for patients sponsored for treatment under theNational Health Service in the United Kingdom. The total number of hospital beds is about 3,200 and usually over 90 per cent, are occupied. Poorpeople pay nothing for these services. Those who can afford to pay must make a small contribution towards the cost of their treatment. Other servicesinclude child health clinics, school medical services and free milk for school-children, and .the&quot;Government services&apos;are supplemented by voluntary bodies.Education5. Compulsory education was introduced in Malta in 1946. As a resultof rapid increases in population and the complete cessation of school buildingbetween 1931 and 1944, accommodation for schoolchildren had become veryscarce. Until recently, a large proportion of all schoolchildren were receivingpart-time education and some 20 per cent were not attending school at all.The Government of Malta has put into effect an extensive programme of primary and technical education, and teacher training. It has eliminated part-time attendance of children in primary schools, and a sixth form has been added to secondary schools. School fees in secondary schools have been abolished, and books are provided free of charge in primary schools.Expenditure on Social services. The estimated total expenditure on social services in 1955-56 (withfigures of actual expenditure in 1954-55 in brackets), is as follows:-  millionSocial Welfare       ............      0-8  .(0-5)Health................      ...      1-4  (1-2)Education     ............      ...      1-1   (0-8)Subsidies...............      08   (0-6)Total............      4-1   (3 1)(representing  13 ( 9) per head of population.)Appendix FDECLARATION OF RIGHTS OF THE INHABITANTS OF the islands OF MALTA AND GOZOMalta, 15th June, 1802.We, the members of the Congress of the Islands of Malta and Gozo andtheir dependencies, by the free: suffrage of the people, during the siege,elected to represent them on the important matter of ascertaining our nativerights and privileges (enjoyed from time immemorial by our ancestors who,when encroached upon, have shed their blood to regain them), and of fixing a Constitution of Government, which shall secure to us and our descendantsin perpetuity, the blessings of freedom and the rights of just law, under theprotection and Sovereignty of the King of a free people, His Majesty the

49183  V/s,k      12/ss  taxiAGREED   STATEMENT   ON   THE   SOCIAL   AND   economic development OF MALTA ISSUED AFTER THE discussions with MALTESE PARTY LEADERS IN JUNE-JULY 1955All parties to the Conference are agreed that the social and economic development of Malta is a necessity and calls for a joint and sustained effort by both countries. To assure the steady advance of the Islands a long-term development plan is being prepared.Meanwhile, as part of the effort to improve the living standards of dieMaltese people, the Conference endorses the following objectives:  (i) raising the standard of education and other social services;(ii) increasing substantially opportunities for employment outside Serviceestablishments; and -(iii) avoiding unemployment.It is recognised by the United Kingdom Government and by the MalteseDelegations that improved living standards can be maintained only by increasing productivity and expanding the national income of Malta. Withthis in view, Her Majesty&apos;s Government on their part undertake to contribute to the cost of the necessary capital works, to help secure the technical meansand, in the interim period before these measures lead to the requiredexpansion in Malta&apos;s own revenues, to assist as may prove necessary inbalancing the budget on recurrent account. The Maltese Delegations on their part recognise that the long-term development plan needs detailed elaborationand examination and each delegation pledges its close co-operation with her majesty&apos;s Government in this common task.
