this document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1955SECRET Copy No.CP. (55) 18023rd November, 1955CABINETCOLONIAL IMMIGRANTSNote by the Prime MinisterSince the Cabinet last discussed Colonial immigration on 3rd November(CM. (55) 39th Conclusions, Minute 7), I have been considering how this question might best be pursued. I feel that it would help the Cabinet to decide whether weshould take powers to control Colonial immigration if some further examinationwere first made of the problems which would have to be solved if we decided tointroduce legislation.I have therefore decided to appoint a Committee of Ministers with thefollowing terms of reference and composition:  Terms of Reference&quot; To consider what form legislation should take, if it were to be decidedthat legislation to control the entry into the United Kingdom of British subjects from overseas should be introduced; to consider also the intended effect ofsuch legislation upon actual immigration, how any such control would bejustified to Parliament and the public, and to the Commonwealth countries concerned; and to report to the Cabinet.&quot;CompositionLord Chancellor (Chairman).Lord President.Home Secretary.Commonwealth Secretary.Colonial Secretary.Attorney-General.A.
