SECRETCP. (55) 20519th December, 1955TECHNICAL education memorandum by the Minister of education was asked by the Cabinet to submit proposals for technical education inEngland and Wales (CM. (55) 45th Conclusions, Minute 6). The Universitiesare outside my province. An increase in their departments of science and technology can be expected. But to keep pace with other industrial countries itis clear that the big increase in numbers must come through the technical colleges.2. The accompanying memorandum outlines my plans. I am asking for authority to select and build up some twenty-five regional colleges where advanced technology would be taught up to university standards. Each such college wouldbe the centre of a group of satellite colleges, planned to suit industry. Theselower-level colleges would train technicians and provide growing numbers of students, the best of whom would go on to advanced studies. In this way thegaps in the existing pattern of technical colleges can be filled in, provided localauthorities can be persuaded to accept regional planning in the interests of Britishindustry.3. My recommendation is that the programme as a whole should be announced in a White Paper, and that we should aim to start projects to the valueof  70 million in building in the lifetime of this Parliament, and to complete themin eight years.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,16th December, 1955.Copy No.74Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1955
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNICAL AND technological education IN TECHNICAL COLLEGES1. There is no need to argue the case for expanding technical education.Even if we could satisfy British industry, there would be an insatiable demand from overseas. Including the plans for Imperial College, the universitydevelopments announced for the present quinquennium seem likely to lead toan increase of roughly 25 per cent, in the present annual number of about 1,850first degrees in technology at universities in England, Wales and Scotland. the universities are already beginning to think about further developments for 1957-62,but they cannot rapidly increase their output of graduates.The Technical Colleges and the Education of Technologists2. The technical colleges are a complementary means of training technologists,catering for those students who prefer to mix earning and learning, and whoseambitions are not fully stirred until they have some experience of making a living. I suspect that this mixture of practice and theory is peculiarly suited to our people, and that many boys, and also their parents and employers,prefer this start in life to a university. At present the technical colleges turnout about 1,500 students every year who get external university degrees in scienceor technology, and some 9,000 who obtain qualifications not vastly different,mostly Higher National Certificates. Some of these students come on straightfrom full-time schooling at 18, but most of them leave school at 15 or 16 and fill the gap until 18 by part-time studies, having a definite job and an employer whobacks their further education.3. Our policy at the technological level is to attract more students whohave stayed at school till 18 and to get more young men released from industry for full-time study. They will take either a continuous course of three or fouryears or, more frequently, the &quot; sandwich courses &quot; of alternate periods of study and employment which are being developed in consultation with the electrical,mining, building, railway and other industries. The new award-making Council,under the Chairmanship of Lord Hives, will approve these courses for diplomasin advanced technology having a status equal to a university degree.4. As the main (though not exclusive) instruments for these courses weenvisage the development of some 25 existing colleges in the major industrial centres as regional colleges concentrating on advanced work. These will be served by satellite local colleges, most of which will concentrate on the less advancedstudents and thus relieve the regional colleges of the low-level work with which many of them are still encumbered. To achieve this pattern we shall have to persuade the local authorities, who manage almost all the technical colleges, toaccept regional planning and &quot; free trade &quot; in students across their boundaries.5. The programme described later is designed to increase the annual output from advanced courses at technical colleges from about 10,000 to about 15,000.We shall do better than this if we succeed in increasing the proportion of students who complete the courses on which they embark. I am considering how best toreduce the wastage, which is now serious.Technical College Courses for Less Advanced Students6. These are needed for training the skilled technicians and craftsmen requiredto support the technologists and for widening the stream from which the moreable and ambitious can go on to advanced courses.7. There should be no shortage of applicants. The growing number of pupils stopping on at secondary schools after 15 is already swelling the number ofsuitably qualified boys anxious to obtain further education, and over the next ten years the bulge in the birthrate will very substantially increase the numbersleaving school. This year out of some 250,000 boys who left maintained schools70,000 went on to further education. The programme I propose will raise this figure to 120,000 out of the 300,000 who are expected to leave in 1965. (Not manygirls become technicians; separate figures for these are, therefore, not given in thismemorandum.)
8. Too many students are attending evening classes (see Appendix A onStatistics and Explanation of Terms. Study after a day&apos;s work is often not good,enough for present requirements. Our policy is, therefore, to encourage day-timerelease, and to increase the number of places for this purpose at the appropriatesatellite colleges. At present about 180,000 boys under 18 are taking day-timecourses.   We should persuade industry to double this number.9. We must also undertake a campaign to get more boys to persevere to theend of the course. The wastage to-day is even more serious here than in the advanced courses.The Programme of Capital Development10. We have compiled for England and Wales a provisional list of building projects for carrying out these policies (see Appendix B). It is based on our present information about the needs of industry in the different parts of England andWales, but new developments may very well create new needs. The total cost ofthese projects at present prices is estimated roughly at  70 million, with a further 15 million for equipment, say  85 million in all.11. For 1956-57 the local education authorities asked for permission to startbuilding to the value of  30 million. I could allow them only  9 million, and this had to cover some further education developments outside the scope of this paper,e.g., for commerce. At this rate the last projects in the  70 million programmecannot begin before 1964-65. This is not good enough. I suggest the programme should be expanded year by year with the object of starting the whole of it within five years from now.The Supply of Teachers12. It would be a waste of money to build new technical colleges unless we made sure of recruiting adequate teaching staff.At present there are 10,400 full-time and 34,000 part-time teachers in technical colleges. We shall need some 7,500 more full-time teachers. It will certainly be necessary to improve pay and conditions if we are to get the right men in competition with industry and other rival employers.13. We shall hope to recruit some from industry or research work; othersmay come from the secondary schools as the bulge passes through them. Thenumber of places and special courses for training teachers for technical collegeswill have to be increased.14. Industry has been generous in releasing part-time teachers, and we can expect this source to expand, but it cannot be a complete substitute for full-timestaff.15. While I am certain we should not slow down the building programme on the score of a shortage of teachers, there is no doubt we shall have to makea major effort to get them.Technical Education and Liberal Studies16 The clamour for scientific and technical education is so great that weshall have continually to watch the courses given in technical colleges to see thatthev are Load enough. In particular, the ability to speak and write clear English,seem&quot;to b^dedming, and I should think it wrong if the technical colleges didnot make an effort to improve the knowledge and use of our language.Conclusion17. Before the financial estimates are discussed in detail, I am asking mycolleagues to give general approval to the policy of technical college developmentoutlined in this memorandum, and, in particular:  (a) to increase the annual output of technologists from technical colleges assoon as possible from 10,000 to at least 15,000;
(b) in order to support the increase in technologists and to provide for therapidly growing numbers who will be coming forward from the schools,to expand substantially the capacity for training technicians andcraftsmen and to strengthen the trend towards part-time day ratherthan evening classes;(c) for these purposes, to step up the rate of building for technical education,so as to start projects to the value of  70 million during the next fiveyears, planned on a regional basis;(d) to prepare for recruiting the teaching staff necessary to support this expansion;(e) to lay a White Paper describing our plans when Parliament comes backin January.D.

Appendix ASTATISTICS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMSSchool Leavers. Following are the estimated number of boys and girls leavingmaintained schools. Throughout this period the number of boy leavers will be slightly more than half the totals given below:  1955 ...      ...      ......      ...      ... 488,0001959 ...      .........      ...... 591,0001961............      ...      ... 651,0001963 .................. 667,0001965 .................. 604,0002. The technical colleges covered by this appendix comprise about 500technical or commercial establishments ranging from large colleges of technologyto small technical institutes, and about 200 colleges or schools of art. They donot include evening institutes, or agricultural and horticultural colleges and farminstitutes. The colleges are nearly all maintained by local education authorities.Their students are all attending of their own choice, or sometimes as a conditionof their employment. Some 80 per cent, of their work is vocational. The great bulk of it is part-time.3. Students. The total number of students attending the colleges in 1954is shown below.

Lower level work consists of junior and senior courses. Junior courses,usually lasting for one year, are mainly for school-leavers of 15 who need tocontinue their general education or to prepare for entry at 16 into industrialapprenticeship or commercial training. Senior courses are for those who have completed junior courses or have left school at 16 or 17. These courses usuallycontinue for two or three years, and are of several kinds. Some are craft apprenticecourses leading to qualifications prescribed by industry. Others prepare for the intermediate qualifications laid down by professional institutions. There arecourses for the intermediate and final certificates of the City and Guilds of LondonInstitute, for the General Certificate of Education (advanced level), for theOrdinary National Certificate* (part-time), the Ordinary National Diploma (full-time), the Intermediate Examination in Arts and Crafts and the IntermediateExternal Degree of London University.5. Advanced courses are normally designed for those who have had a full-time education until 18 or a part-time education until 19. They mostly leadto the post-intermediate qualifications of the professional bodies, the City andGuilds full technological certificate, the Higher National Certificate* (part-time),the Higher National Diploma (full-time), the National Diploma in Design, thevarious diplomas and associateships of the technical colleges themselves or the* Courses leading up to the Ordinary and Higher National Certificates have in recent years beenheld in Building, Chemistry, Applied Chemistry, Commerce, Electrical Engineering, MechanicalEngineering, Metallurgy, Mining, Naval Architecture, Allied Physics and Textiles; and leading up tothe Higher National Certificate only in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, ProductionEngineering and Mining Surveying.
&quot;S3&apos;final degree of London University. These courses mostly last for two, three orfour years. There are also post-graduate courses of one year, and shorter coursesat post-graduate level for scientists and technologists engaged in industry.6. Sandwich courses last from 2 to 5 years. The students spend alternateperiods of 3 to 6 months receiving theoretical education in a technical college and specially designed practical training in industry.7.   Wastage in Ordinary and Higher National Certificate Exams.Ordinary HigherEntrants       Successes       Entrants       Successes1952   ...      21,977 11,673 8,831- 6,3111953   ...      22,243 11,341 9,333 6,5641954   ...      24,590 12,443 9,750 6,940Note. These figures show only the number who respectively enteredfor and succeeded in the examinations, and do not give a complete figure of wastage over the courses. Although no figures are available, there is reasonto think that perhaps no more than half of those who start the courses surviveto enter for the exams.8.

Part-time day release. Of 372,000 part-time day students, 326,000 arebeing released. This represents a spectacular increase since the war. But, of young people under 18 in employment, only 12-3 per cent, were released in 1950and only IT- 1 per cent, were released last year. Except in the engineering industry the percentage of boys released is far too low. Except in public administration the same is true of girls.
