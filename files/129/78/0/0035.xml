(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 185 COPY NO.30th November,  1955CABINETHEROINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and the Minister of health the Prime Minister has asked that the question of the ban on themanufacture of heroin should be brought before the Cabinet.2.      In 1950 member states of the World Health Organisation were asked for their views &quot;concerning the necessity for the use or thedispensability of heroin and the reasons therefor&quot;.3.     In October, 1950, the Minister of Health sought the advice of hisStanding Medical Advisory Committee (S.M.A.C.) on the question whether,if an international agreement on the prohibition of the use of heroin were proposed, there was sufficient medical reason why the Government shouldnot support the proposal.4.      The S.M.A.C. consulted the British Pharmacopoeia Commission,which expressed the view that, although heroin was still proclaimed bysome practitioners to be of great value as a sedative after operations and in inoperable malignant diseases and, to a lesser degree, in severeparoxysmal cought the advantages so claimed did not outweigh the grave consequences of widespread addiction in certain countries.     TheCommission consulted the British Medical Association (B.M.A.), as wellas other professional bodies, before coming to their decision to agree todelete from the British Pharmacopoeia the monograph on heroin, ifinternational agreement on prohibition were reached.5.      In December, 1950, the S.M.A.Ce advised the Minister of Healththat it would be justifiable to prohibit the use of heroin in Britain, ifinternational agreement were reached on its prohibition and sale, and theCentral Health Services Council informed the Minister that they had nocomment to offer on this advice.    In the same month the S,MeA.C. of theScottish Health Services Council expressed the view that there was no sufficient medical reason against a ban on the vise of heroin.6.      In the 1953 edition of the British Pharmacopoeia the monographon heroin was omitted.7.      In 1953, the World Health Organisation recommended, afterreporting that 54 out of 82 states had expressed the view that the medicaluse of heroin could be dispensed with, that member states which had not already done so should prohibit the importation and manufacture of thedrug.
1648.     In July, 1954, the United Nations Economic and Social Counciladopted a resohxtion, drafted by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, urgingall Governments to prohibit the manufacture and import and export ofheroin except for such small amounts as might be necessary for scientificpurposes.9.     In December, 1954, the Minister of Health sought the views of theS0MoA.C. on the resolution which the Government proposed to accept.That Committee concurred in the Governments proposals and the CentralHealth Services Council informed the Minister that they did not wish to comment on the Committee^ advice.    The Governments decision was announced in answer to a Question by Sir Hugh Linstead on 18th February,1955.10.   From 1950 until 1955 no representations were received from theB,M0A0 though articles had appeared in 1949 and 1953 in the British MedicalJournal, the official organ of the Association, supporting the case for theprohibition of manufacture.    In May, 1955, the Association brought to thenotice of the Minister of Health the terms of a resolution adopted last autumn to the effect that the medical profession should not in any way be deprived of the use of heroin or any other drug which may assist in thetreatment of patients.11.   We received, with the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Scotland, a deputation from the B.M.A. on 11th July last, and undertook to consider the representations which they then made.    Thiswas done and, as the Health Ministers adhered to the advice that had originally been tendered after consultation with the expert bodies whichadvised them on such matters, the Home Secretary on 17th Octoberinformed the B.M.A, that the decision not to permit the general manu-facture of heroin after the end of this year must be maintained.12.    There is a strong emotional overlay to the arguments now being putforward by some sections of the medical profession, but for unbiassedadvice on the technical merits of the question it would be more difficult tofind a more highly qualified body than the Standing Medical AdvisoryCommittee to the Minister of Health.    It includes the Presidents of thethree Royal Colleges and of the General Medical Council, the Chairman ofthe Council of the E.M.A, with five consultant surgeons, four consultantphysicians and five general practitioners:  details of the constitution of theCommittee are given in the Appendix.13.    The international control of dangerous drugs is one of the oldestestablished forms of international co-operation, and is one in whichsuccessive British Governments have always co-operated to the full.The reason for the ban is the extent of the illicit traffic in heroin.    It isa particularly serious problem in the United States and Canada, where,within the last two months, three large seizures amounting to some eightypounds in all, were made.14.    If international control is to work, the countries party to thesystem must accept it and carry it out faithfully, even though in this countrywe are reluctant to interfere with the doctor&apos;s freedom of prescription.But the Minister of Health is advised that there are good reasons forthinking that heroin is no longer indispensable in medicine and that thereare adequate alternatives available.
15.    This decision has not been taken lightly or hurriedly.     The matter has been under consideration for more than five years.      The decision wastaken after consultation with the advisory bodies specially appointed toassist Ministers in matters of this kind which include the best professionalopinion in the land.16.    Any alteration of the decision already announced will undoubtedlydisturb the authorities in those countries which are faced with serioustraffic in heroin.     To allow manufacture but to ban export is no solution for if illicit import is banned elsewhere export could only be to theillicit market.G.
