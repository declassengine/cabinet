Printed jor the Cabinet. November 1955SECRETCP. (55) 18228th November, 1955cabinetCOMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations on 7th December, 1954, the Cabinet agreed that Commonwealth membershipshould be discussed in private conversations with the Prime Ministers of Canada,Australia and New Zealand during their visit to London at the beginning of 1955,but that it should not be broached for the time being with the South African PrimeMinister (C.C. (54) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 5). Lord Swinton accordinglydiscussed it privately with Mr. St. Laurent, Mr. Menzies and Mr. Holland, who allexpressed agreement that the policy set out in C. (54) 307 represented the only practicable policy. Nothing whatever has yet been said on this subject to SouthAfrican Ministers and the question now arises whether a start should not be madewith them. While the course of events in the Gold Coast cannot at present before seen, it is possible, if not indeed probable, that the question of the admissionof the Gold Coast to Commonwealth membership will be ripe for discussion, ifnot indeed for decision, at the Meeting of Prime Ministers which opens on27th June, 1956. All our experience suggests that a relatively long time must beallowed for domestic consideration if the Union Government are to be broughtto accept or acquiesce in a proposition so inherently distasteful to them.2. The United Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa, Sir PercivaleLiesching, who is thoroughly conversant with this question, has been carefullywatching the situation and has now recommended that, even if only preliminary discussion should take place at the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in June, it will be wise for him to have paved the way gradually in a series of talks with Mr. Strijdomon this subject.3. In making this recommendation Sir Percivale Liesching assumes, as I think we must, that there is bound to be at least preliminary discussion of this question and that any risk that this might possibly lead Mr. Strijdom to shrink fromattending the meeting personally because this difficult issue was likely to be raisedhas been removed by Mr. Strijdom&apos;s recent formal notification of his intention toattend. The High Commissioner considers that the general atmosphere for hisinitial approach on this difficult topic is calm and favourable, and demonstrablybetter than it was a few months ago. In particular Mr. Strijdom has recently made public reference to the necessity for South Africa to honour the right of existence and interests of non-European States or Governments in Africa, and this reference,which is being interpreted in some quarters as representing a definite softeningin the Union Governments approach to the Gold Coast question, at any ratepartially opens the door to an approach.4. If my colleagues agree with me that the time has come to face this issueit remains to be considered whether Sir Percivale Liesching should be authorised- to make a start before mid-December, when South African Ministers leave Pretoriafor the holidays, or whether it should be left over uatil his return from London,which I have authorised him to visit, for consultations in the second half ofJanuary, or the beginning of February.

The High Commissioner is inclined tothink that he should make a start before mid-December and he recommends that49143
Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. I,22nd November, 1955.he should be given latitude to make a generalised and provisional approach inwhich he would deploy some of the arguments most likely to secure a favourable response from the Afrikaaner mind and try to elicit enough reaction to enable usto judge when and how best to carry the matter further.5. I recommend that the High Commissioner^ proposal should be approvedsince-(a) there is very little time to lose;(b) it will be advantageous for him to be able truthfully to say that we do notyet know exactly when the Gold Coast issue will be ripe for discussion and decision; and(c) he would be in a position to offer to bring back from his London visitinformation and views on any points which Mr. Strijdom may raise.It would help us also to have from the High Commissioner personallyhis impressions of his first contacts with Mr. Sirijdom on this question.6. I would propose if my colleagues agree to seek the High Commissioner^view on his return whether there would be advantage in his taking some suitable opportunity to let the Leader of the South African Opposition know in strict confidence how matters are developing in order to prevent the latter taking up an attitude which might be embarrassing to us through ignorance of how thingsstand.7. I invite my colleagues to agree that I should proceed on the lines I havesuggested above.H.
