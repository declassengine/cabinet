Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1955SECRET Copy No. g 3CP. (55) 18328th November, 1955CABINETTHE GOLD COAST: CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTSMemorandum ey the Secretary of State for the ColoniesThis Paper describes political developments in the Gold Coast and provides a background to CP. (55) 182 by the Commonwealth Secretary. It calls for no action itself.2. The Convention People&apos;s Party (C.P.P.), led by Dr. Nkrumah, has provided the Government of the Gold Coast since 1951. At the last General Election inJune 1954 it won 71 seats out of 104, and now has a strength of 78 in thatLegislature as a number of Independents have subsequently joined the Party.The main Opposition Party is the Northern People&apos;s Party with 14 members, andsome of the Independent members also oppose the Government. On a wide range of subjects Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s Government has shown itself to be responsible and efficient; its financial policies have been restrained and sensible and great attention has been given to measures to promote the cocoa industry, which is of course themainstay of the country&apos;s economy. The Government has also co-operated fully in the work of the Preparatory Commission for the Volta River Project. perhaps the most difficult problem in the relations between Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s Governmentand Her Majesty&apos;s Government has been that of the future of the Trust territory of British Togoland, and, despite manifold difficulties, agreement on the policies which should be followed has always been reached.3. There is another side to this picture. The progressive reduction of seniorEuropean staff has not been matched by the supply of trained African replacements.What is more serious, Gold Coast Ministers have not in the past shown themselves at all times completely determined to stamp out corruption. In addition, theirnatural wish to promote economic and social development has led them to think interms of action by a strong central Government, and they have unfortunatelyprovoked widespread resentment culminating in a serious dispute about the formof the Gold Coast constitution.4. The main opposition to Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s Government is extra-Parliamentary. Shortly after the General Election last year the national liberation Movement (N.L.M.) was started in Ashanti and was from its beginningstrongly supported by the Ashanti Chiefs led by the Asantehene. The Movementalso receives support from the Northern People&apos;s Party (Northern Territories),the Togoland Congress Party (Southern British Togoland) and numerous minorpolitical groupings. The N.L.M. maintains the fiction that it is itself non-political:it is not represented in the Legislative Assembly but its line is followed by mostof the members who do not support the Government.5. The growth of the Movement derives from a deep distrust of Dr. Nkrumahand his Party, the wish to preserve the traditional independence and unity ofAshanti, and the fear of the Chiefs and traditional authorities that a strong centralGovernment will take away from them most of their remaining importance and power. The N.L.M. has, for example, fiercely resisted recent legislation proposedby the Gold Coast Government which has taken away certain powers of majorchiefs over subordinate ones. The Government removed some of the more offensivefeatures of the legislation which may prove to be acceptable in its final form.49142
6. The Movement demands a federal form of constitution for the Gold Coastwhen it becomes independent, ft wants a Constituent Assembly set up to review the constitution before the Gold Coast becomes independent. It has alsocampaigned vigorously against alleged corruption in the Cocoa Marketing Beardand Cocoa Purchasing Company. (Dr. Nkrumah has just agreed to appoint aCommission of Enquiry into these allegations.)7. The growth of the N.L.M. was fiercely resisted by the C.P.P. and at firstthere were numerous clashes and disturbances in Ashanti, particularly in Kumasi,which caused the Government considerably to reinforce the police and militaryforces there.8. In July an Independent candidate supported by the N.L.M. won aby-election in an Ashanti constituency from the C.P.P. by a big swing of votes.Since this by-election the N.L.M. has gained confidence and so there has been anoticeable reduction in the number of incidents of violence in Ashanti. TheGovernment has reduced both the police and military forces to their normal levels.9. I cannot tell the exact strength of the N.L.M. and its associates in the GoidCoast. The best guess I can make is that if a general election were held soon theC.P.P. would retain power with a considerably reduced majority, possibly quitesmall. But the N.L.M. and its associates do not form at the moment a coherentpolitical group and on many matters they follow different policies. The mainstrength of the N.L.M. lies in Ashanti, and it is because of the Movements holdover that Region that it has acquired its importance, and not because of itsassociation with other groups.10. The N.L.M. has submitted to the Governor its proposals for the federalform of constitution it desires. They provide for four regional bi-camerallegislatures and a central bi-cameral legislature, roughly on the lines of the nigerian set-up. These proposals are hardly practicable for a territory with a population of just over 4 millions : they would be expensive and there are certainly not enough able men to run five separate Governments.11. In May last a Select Committee was appointed by the LegislativeAssembly to consider a federal constitution and a Second Chamber. Their reportrejected a federal form of constitution as inappropriate to the Gold Coast and recommended that consideration of the need for a Second Chamber should be deferred. Opposition members refused to take part in the work of the SelectCommittee, which was boycotted by the N.L.M. and the organisations supportingit. Opposition members also refused to take part in the debate on the Select.Committee&apos;s report, which was accepted by the Government in their absence.12. Subsequently I was asked by the Government of the Gold Coast toarrange for an adviser with experience of constitutional matters to visit the gold coast to assist all parties in reaching agreement on a constitution for. the Gold Coast.I secured Sir Frederick Bourne, K.C.S.I., a former Governor of East Bengal, forthis assignment; he has been working in the Gold Coast since the end of September.13. It is too early to say whether he will succeed in bringing the opposingfactions to agreement on the form of. constitution best suited to the Gold Coastwhen it becomes independent. He has found that the Northern Territoriesrepresentatives would accept a reasonable compromise in the constitutional dispute,but although he has had the impression from the N.L.M. that they were reallyanxious to discuss things with him that Movement has seized on every possibleexcuse to postpone doing so. At the moment they have run out of excuses and Ihave some hope that Sir Frederick may be able to realise his own hope of having amore or less concrete scheme ready for discussion at a round-table conference earlyin December, leading to a final report by Christmas.14. In C. (54) 306, dated 1st October, 1954, I said that the grant of independence might have to be made at the end of 1956 or very soon thereafter.This is now most unlikely. Until it has been demonstrated in the Gold Coast thatthe majority of the people are in favour of immediate independence and that a wide measure of agreement exists on the form of constitution for the Gold Coast whenit becomes independent, there can be no question of the final and irrevocable stepbeing taken. This has been plainly stated to Dr. Nkrumah. He has recently shown a greater willingness to accept constructive suggestions designed to reduce the tension in the Gold Coast and to allow the calm and ordered discussion of

He has however to keep his own Party convinced thathe is not giving way unnecessarily to the Opposition or succumbing needlessly to pressure from the Governor or myself.15. If Sir Frederick Bourne is unable to bring the opposing factions together on an agreed form of constitution, it will be necessary to resolve the issue at aGeneral Election. For various reasons, this is unlikely to be held until afterthe rains, in late September or October.16. If Sir Frederick Bourne can successfully complete his task by the endof the year, Gold Coast independence by December 1956 is still a faint possibility.If he takes rather longer, then it might be possible early in 1957. If he isunsuccessful and a General Election is held, independence is most unlikely beforethe middle of 1957.17. I cannot, of course, say whether he will be successful but, whateverhappens, there must be a final decision about the form of the Gold Coastconstitution some time in 1956, and therefore there must be at least some discussionof possible Gold Coast membership of the Commonwealth at the Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting in June of next year. Accordingly I agree with the recommendations madeby the Commonwealth Secretary in paragraph 5 of CP. (55) 182.18. I will of course continue to keep my colleagues informed of developments in the Gold Coast. The situation should be considerably clearer in a couple ofmonths&apos; time.A. L.-B.
