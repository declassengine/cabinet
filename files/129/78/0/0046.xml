SECRET Copy No.   63CP. (55) 19610th December, 1955CABINETLEGISLATION ON RESTRICTIVE PRACTICESMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the report of the Monopolies Commission on Collective Boycott and exclusive Dealings was published on 30th June. The Cabinet will recall that thisreport was one of great public interest and controversy, particularly since it contained, in majority and minority reports, contradictory views on whetherrestrictive practices involving collective discrimination should be prohibited, orwhether they should be allowed to continue pending case by case examinationunder the existing arrangements.2. The Government were under great pressure to give a clear indication of the principles on which they proposed to deal with the practices which werethe subject of the report, and on 12th July the Cabinet approved the general lineof policy which the Government speakers would follow in debates which wereto take place in both Houses of Parliament (CM. (55) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 6).3. This course was, broadly, a compromise between the recommendationsof the majority and those of the minority of the Commission. It is proposed that legislation should be introduced to require restrictive practices (not limited tocollective discriminatory practices) to be registered, and for them then to be subjectto case by case examination by some tribunal before which the onus of proving that the practice was not contrary to the public interest would be placed on theindustrialist concerned.4. The Committee of Ministers which was set up under my chairmanshipto consider this report of the Monopolies Commission has since been working outthe main lines of the legislation necessary to implement the Governmentsannounced policy.5. The statements of Government policy which were made in the debates inParliament in July left open two crucial and related questions (i) The criteria by which restrictive practices were to be judged, or (in other words) how the justiciable issue which was to be put to whatevertribunal was chosen should be defined.(ii) The nature of the tribunal which would have jurisdiction to examinerestrictive practices.The guidance of the Cabinet on both of these issues is sought. (There may be other issues, such as a new procedure for enforcing the maintenance of resale pricesfixed on an individual basis, which we shall need to bring to the notice of theCabinet, at a later stage.)Definition of the Justiciable Issue6. The difficulty here is that, whatever the nature of the tribunal, it is not sufficient simply to ask it to decide whether a particular practice is, or is not,&quot; contrary to the public interest &quot; because such a question is too vague to answer.But when we try to define the issue to be put to the tribunal, it becomes clear thatits decision must involve it in making judgments on questions of economic policywhich (to use a fashionable term) are judgments of value and not of fact or law.49208BPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1955
7. The definition which most of the Committee think is best, from the pointof view of narrowing the element of economic judgment as much as possible, is setout in Annex I to this paper. This definition requires the parties to an agreement to show that the restrictive practice in question both serves some positive purpose,as defined therein, and that it does not operate to the detriment of the public to an unreasonable extent. Under this definition, unless the agreement serves one of thepurposes specified therein (at (a) to (c) of Annex I) it cannot qualify for a favourabledecision, and the question of whether it is unreasonably detrimental to the publicdoes not arise. Moreover, under this definition (apart from the question of damage to the export trade) a restrictive practice could not be justified on the grounds thatthe removal of the restraint would cause injury to the industry concerned unless such injury took the form of substantial unemployment (see clause (c) of Annex I).8. The Attorney-General thinks that this last condition is too narrow, andthat there are other forms of injury (e.g., a reduction in earnings which might forcean industry to cease research) which may not be covered by the other clauses ofthe definition, but which should constitute grounds for justifying a restrictivepractice, provided that the continuance of the restraint would not cause a greaterdetriment to the public than its abolition. The Attorney-General would thereforeprefer that, to deal with the question of injury to an industry, the definition shouldbe on the following lines:  &quot; The restraint shall be deemed to be contrary to the national interestunless it is shown that.... the restraint is necessary, in the conditions actuallyobtaining or reasonably foreseen at the time of the application, to prevent suchinjury to the industry, trade or business to which the restraint applies as wouldbe likely to cause greater detriment to the public than the maintenance of the restraint.&quot;The Choice of Tribunal9. The way in which the justiciable issue is defined is relevant to the choice oftribunal, for, as stated above, it would be required to decide questions not solely of fact and law, but also of economic policy.In the choice of a tribunal there are three possibilities:  (a) The High Court.(b) An Administrative Tribunal whose decisions would require confirmation by a Minister.(c) A Judicial Tribunal independent of the Government and not answerable to Parliament.These three alternatives are discussed below.(a) The High Court. We do not consider that the High Court itself wouldbe a suitable tribunal. The function of the High Court is to.decide questions of fact and law and it ought not to be required to pronounce on questions of economic policy. The justiciable issue defined in Annex I has, as stated above, been sodrawn as to narrow as far as possible the economic considerations which thetribunal will have to take into account, but there inevitably remains a field in whichit will have to exercise a degree of economic judgment which would be considered to be outside the functions of the High Court and which it is not fitted to exercise.Moreover many cases will be the subject of acute controversy into which it is highly undesirable that the High Court should be drawn.(b) An Administrative Tribunal. The second alternative would be to set up an administrative tribunal responsible to a Minister. This would have the effectthat Parliament would retain control Of important questions of economic policywhich ought properly to be decided by Parliament, as some may think, rather thanby a Court. The Minister, however, would have to confirm or reverse thetribunal^ findings, and undoubtedly his decisions would be the subject of politicaldebate. It is clear, therefore, that this solution would do virtually nothing toremove restrictive practices from the political arena, and there may well be some danger that the responsible Minister would be overwhelmed by the task involvedin considering, deciding and defending the application i of the Government^ policyin a large number of controversial cases. There are also political arguments againstsetting up any new administrative tribunal at the present time;Details of the way in which an administrative tribunal would-work are in annex II.
House of Lords, S-W. I,9th December, 1955.49208 b2(c) An Independent Judicial Tribunal. By this we have in mind a tribunalin the form of a statutory Court which would be composed of Judges of the HighCourt and laymen, and which would be answerable neither to the Minister nor tol^rfiamferit; --Bfttf tKeJre&quot;-wb:uid - be an appeal on a point of law to the Court ofAppeal and possibly thereafter to the House of Lords.The advantages of such a tribunal would be that it would command theConfidence of the public and of industry and that its decisions: would be takenoutside the political arena, ,It may of course be argued that it would be constitutionally improper to entrust this jurisdiction to a Court of which Judges are members since they, mightconsequently be involved in political controversy. It could also be argued thatit would be improper for the Government to divest itself of responsibility for decisions which will affect the commercial practices of many industries andtherefore the whole structure of our economy. Nevertheless if the Governmentis able to lay. down the general lines of economic policy (which, in this field, wouldmean finding satisfactory general criteria by which individual restrictive practicescould be judged) it may be justifiable in principle as well as politically convenientthat decisions in individual cases should be taken by an independent Court.... If. it is decided that jurisdiction over restrictive practices should be given toa Court of this nature the best precedent to follow would be that of the railway and Canal Commission. That Court was a Court of Record of which Judges ofthe High Court were: members and from which an appeal lay on points of law tothe Court of Appeal. The nature of the jurisdiction of this Commission demandeda degree of judgment in economic matters not perhaps as great as would berequired in relation to restrictive practices, but nevertheless greater than was regarded as suitable for the High Court as such.The Heads of the Judiciary in England and Wales, Scotland and NorthernIreland, who have been informally consulted, are agreed that a Court of Recordanalogous to the Railway and Canal Commission might properly be given ajurisdiction of this kind. It might be called the &quot;Restrictive Practices Commission.&quot;A detailed account of how such a Commission might be constituted is contained in Annex III.Summary10. To proceed with the preparation of legislation to implement the generalpolicy of the Government on restrictive practices which has already beenforeshadowed, the Committee on the Monopolies Commission Report accordinglyask the Cabinet:  (i) to decide whether the definition of the justiciable issue should be that suggested in Annex I, or whether it should be on a wider basis as suggested in paragraph 8 above;(ii) to decide whether the tribunal for judging restrictive practices should be (a) an administrative tribunal (Annex II), or(b) a judicial commission (Annex III).
dgrll - )(j  !.),,ri:.\    , annex I   -     -       ^oluiBi?. A &apos;io rmoi -j:&apos;: inDRAFT DEFINITION OF THE JUSTICIABLE ISSUE FOR A restrictive practices COMMISSION OR TRIBUNAL;For the purposes of an application to the [Court/Commission] under the Act;any restraint on trade imposed by an agreement registered thereunder shall bedeemed to be contrary to the national interest unless it is shown thatthe restraint is reasonably necessary for the protection of persons notparties to the agreement being consumers or users of goods producedor sold by such parties having regard to any special circumstances affecting the consumption or use of those goods; orthe restraint has conferred or is calculated to confer on such consumers orusers other specific and substantial benefits or advantages; or having regard to the conditions actually obtaining or reasonably foreseenat the time of the application, the removal of the restraint would be calculated to lead to substantial unemployment in any industry or trade or to cause substantial damage to the United Kingdom&apos;s export trade or a substantial reduction in the earnings therefrom;and in any such case it is further shown that the restraint has not operated, andis not calculated to operate to the detriment of the public to any extent or to an extent which is unreasonable.Annex IIAN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALAfter defining certain types of agreement, which would operate in restraint oftrade, and requiring them to be registered, the proposed legislation would go onto say that, where there are grounds for believing that a particular agreementoperates against the national interest, the parties to this agreement may be calledbefore a tribunal, the onus being placed upon them to justify the practices inquestion.2. The tribunal would be called upon to give a ruling on whether theagreement (or any part of it) was or was not justified by reference to the criterialaid down in the legislation (which it is assumed for present purposes would be onthe lines of the definition of the justiciable issue in Annex I).3. The rulings of a tribunal of this kind would need to be subject to confirmation by a Minister, to whom the right of appeal, if any, would also lie.The legislation would therefore have to lay down the procedure for appeal againstthe tribunal&apos;s rulings, and for confirmation of those rulings. The degree ofParliamentary control could vary according to the nature of the cases, as follows.4.   There are four possibilities:  (i) If the tribunal found that a particular agreement was not contrary to thepublic interest, and if the Minister agreed, this decision would be recorded in the register, and there would seem to be no reason for seeking formal Parliamentary approval in such cases.(ii) If the tribunal decided that an agreement was contrary to the publicinterest, and if the Minister agreed, this decision would have to be giventhe force of law. The appropriate procedure, it is suggested, would befor the Minister to lay an Order before Parliament confirming the tribunals decision. This Order could reasonably be subject to the negative Resolution procedure.(iii) The tribunal might decide that an agreement was not contrary to the publicinterest, but the Minister might disagree and decide that the agreement should be terminated. To give his decision (in which the tribunal wouldbe overruled) the force of law, it would probably be desirable for theMinister^ Order to be subject to the Affirmative Resolution procedure.id)ib)ic)
(iv) The tribunal might decide that an agreement was contrary to the publicinterest, but the Minister might decide that it was harmless. It was likely that this would happen only rarely, but, if it did, the properprocedure would again need to be by Affirmative Resolution, since thetribunal would be overruled.5. The enforcement of the Ministers Orders could be by way of the same procedure as is prescribed in the existing Monopolies legislation i.e., in the eventof a breach of an Order, the Act would give the Crown or private parties the rightto seek an injunction in the High Court, with the usual consequences attaching todisobedience of the injunction.6. If the tribunals functions described above are to be carried out by a non-judicial body, and if the Monopolies Commission itself cannot be used for thispurpose, it would be necessary to set up a special tribunal ;(of a series of tribunals)with a lawyer in the chair and with two or three other members picked from the ranks of distinguished persons with no particular axe to grind (e.g., retired senior civil servants, lawyers, university dons). Much would depend on how far thetribunal felt that their rulings would be upheld by the Minister. The status of thetribunal would be enhanced if, in cases where the Minister overruled it, he was required to submit to Parliament a statement of the reasons for his decision.Annex IIIA RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES commission a tribunal could be constituted on the lines of the Railway and canal commission which was set up by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, andwhich lasted, virtually unchanged, until its abolition by the Railway and canal commission (Abolition) Act, 1949. That Commission consisted of two &quot; appointedCommissioners,&quot; who were laymen, (and one of whom had to be a railway expert)appointed by the Home Secretary on the recommendation of the President of theBoard of Trade; and three &quot; ex-officio Commissioners,&quot; one each for England,Scotland and Northern Ireland, who were Judges of the superior courts in thosecountries assigned to the Commission by the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Presidentof the Court of Session and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. the nomination of the ex-officio Commissioners was for a period of not less than fiveyears, and the Lord Chancellor had power to remove an &quot; appointedCommissioner&quot; for inability or misbehaviour.2. A Restrictive Practices Commission could similarly consist of nominated members of the Judiciary and appointed laymen. The laymen might beappointed by the Lord President of the Council.3. In order that it should be able to dispose of a large volume of work, itwould probably have to sit in Divisions, so that the Lord Chancellor would haveto be able to nominate more than one Judge of the High Court to the Commission,and there would have to be more lay members than the two considered necessaryfor the Railway and Canal Commission. The state of business in the High Courtat the moment is such that it is improbable that the Lord Chancellor could sparemore than one Judge unless the statutory number of High Court Judges was increased. It seems unlikely that there would be any substantial volume of workin Scotland or Northern Ireland, but an increase in the judiciary in those twocountries might also be required.4. The lay members would be drawn from persons having knowledge ofindustrial, commercial or economic matters. It is desirable that they should beappointed whole-time so as to secure uniformity of practice, to add prestige to thenew Commission, and to ensure that the public and industry do not get theimpression that they are mere assessors. But it may also be necessary to have part-time members, if only because it may prove difficult to find suitable people to takewhole-time appointments. In order to attract people of the highest quality the remuneration of the lay members will have to be substantial, and the question ofpensions for the whole-time members will arise.
5. Both the lay and Judicial members of the Commission should be nominatedfor a period of not less than three years, and there should be power for the LordChancellor to dismiss a lay member of the Commission for inability ormisbehaviour.6. The Commission should be a Court of Record (as was the Railway and canal Commission), so that it has the necessary powers to enforce its orders, e.g.,power to commit for contempt. It should have power to administer oaths, to grantinjunctions, impose fines, &amp;c.7. The Commissioners should have equal authority amongst themselves exceptthat the opinion of the Judicial members should, as in the case of the Railway and canal Commission, prevail on a point of law. Similarly the decision of theCommission should be final on matters of fact and of locus standi, but there shouldbe a right of appeal on a point of law to the Court of Appeal.8. The practice and procedure before the Commission ought to be determinedby rules made by the Lord Chancellor, who would consult (informally) the Presidentof the Board of Trade, Lord President of the Court of Session, and the lord chief Justice of Northern Ireland.9. The main forum of operations for the new Commission would no doubt be in London, and it may be desirable that it should sit at the Royal Courts ofJustice. It might be useful, however, to take power for the Commission to sitanywhere in England or Wales, and it should have power to sit in Scotland andNorthern Ireland in which case the Scots or Northern Irish Judge would preside.
