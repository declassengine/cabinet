I - y 287IIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC   majesty&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1949     . )SECRET Copy No. %\CP. (49) 2278th November, 1949CABINETSIZE OF DAILY NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the size of newspapers is at present formally governed by a Statutory Orderlimiting the penny dailies to eight pages. The detailed rationing of newspapersis carried out by the Newsprint Rationing Committee, a body of newspaper proprietors representative of all sections of the industry. It is they who fromtime to time fix the size of newspapers, with my approval, within the maximumallowed by the Statutory Order, a system which allows flexibility as the supplyof newsprint permits. Since 24th April last the penny daily newspapers havebeen restricted to six pages with corresponding variations for other types ofnewspaper. I have now received a request from the Newspaper Proprietors thatthey should be allowed from 1st November to 31st December to increase the sizeto seven pages, that is alternate days at six and eight pages. Owing to doubt onthe exact figures of newsprint supply and requirements, it has not been possibleto bring forward this proposal to the Cabinet earlier, and any concession now made would nave to operate from 14th November or thereabouts.2. Although there will be no Canadian imports of newsprint next year, thenewsprint budget up to the middle of 1950 now appears more favourable than it did some months ago. There will be a slight increase in home production in thelast two months of this year in addition to the increase originally forecast during1950, while the consumption of newsprint by periodicals following the authorisedincrease in their total paper consumption from 45 to 70 per cent, has been lessthan was originally estimated.3. I have already informed the newsprint mills that they may accept export *orders in 1950 up to 65,000 tons. This is the same figure as I authorised for 1949,though that figure has not been realised. It is probable that we could secureorders from Australia alone up to about 90,000 tons, but in deciding upon thefigure of 65,000 tons I had in mind the possible objection of our own newspaper proprietors to our supplying Australian newspapers with all the newsprint they require for their much larger publications, and the views of the Canadians thatwe might be supplying too much to what they appear to regard as their export markets. On the other hand, if we do not supply reasonable quantities to the australians they will be forced to buy against us in the Scandinavian market, andin addition our own balance of payments with Australia will worsen at a timewhen it is desirable to improve it.37828
4. On the assumption that the exports will be equally spread over the year1950, and if there were no increase in home consumption of newsprint abovecurrent levels, the newsprint budget to the end of June 1950 would be as follows :-Second Half 1949 TonSStock at 3rd July        ...... \.\      124,500.Supply &apos; &apos; &apos;United Kingdom manufacture       ...      ...      ...      226,500Imports ...      ...&quot;     ...   &apos; .v      ...      109,000335,500Consumption Newspapers (six pages)........       267,800Periodicals (at 70 per cent.) .;. ;    ... 33,000Exports ...      ...      ...      ... 15,000315,800Estimated stock at 31st December (-I-19,700) ...        144,200First Half 1950Stock at 31st December, 1949 ...      ...      ... :..      ...      144,200Supply United Kingdom manufacture       ... ...      ...      280,000Imports (Canada nil) ...      ... ...      ...       65,000345,000Consumption Newspapers (six pages)       ...... 267,800Periodicals (at 70 per cent.) ...      /.. 33,000Exports          ............ 32,500333,300Estimated stock at 30th June (4-11,700)    ...        155,9005. This shows that our stocks would rise during the period by approximately32,000 tons. I am anxious on general grounds to free periodicals from control.With larger issues they could make a better showing in the export field, and the types of paper which they mainly use are plentiful. The additional newsprintrequired to give complete freedom to existing and new periodicals would notexceed 10,000 tons in a full year. It would be desirable, when freeing periodicals,to make some concession to the newspapers also, but (as explained in paragraph 6)it would not at present be practicable to grant an extra page as a permanent feature hence the modified proposals which I am making.6. The newspaper industry has at present approximately  3^ millioninvested in stocks, and there are indications that a number of newspapers, particu-larly the smaller ones, are reaching their limits of capital outlay, with the resultthat the industry might have to take steps to avoid its stocks rising to the valueof approximately  4 million by refusing or postponing deliveries of newsprint,which would be a serious matter for the home mills. We shall have to allow the newspapers an extra page probably for four weeks for the election, which would cost 6,000 tons. The short-term increase for which they are now asking would cost about 12,000 tons, and this consumption is well within the safety margin ofour stocks. In a full year, an extra page would need 70,000 tons of newsprint,which could not be fitted in to the &quot; budget.&quot;
Board of Trade,Millbank, S.W. 1,8th November, 1949.r / 7. We .can:clearljrr.a;lord:toi free periodicals from control from 4th &apos;March. Ipropose this date since it is the first day after the end of the present? rationingperiod. And any appreciably earlier date might allow inadequate time for the proprietors to make their plans.8. It will have to be made clear to the newspapers that, given an increase to seven pages up to Christmas, they will then have to revert to six pages exceptduring the four weeks for the election; and that the prospects of Repeating this increase in the second half of 1950 and thereafter depend entirely on the futuresupply position. I should also propose to inform them that we will not cutexports to reimpose control on periodicals in the latter half of 1950 in order toprovide an extra page for the newspapers.9.. I propose, therefore (i) that newspapers should be allowed seven pages up to the end of theyear, aha an extra page for four weeks during the election;(ii) that periodicals should be freed on 4th March;(iii) that any further increases for newspapers in 1950 should be left forconsideration as the supply situation develops.&apos;    H.
