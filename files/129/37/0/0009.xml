Is DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   majesty&apos;S  QOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1949fSECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 209ll9th&apos; October, 1949CABINET31THE MIDDLE east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in this paper I set out, for the information of my colleagues, some general[reflections on foreign policy in the Middle East, which for the present purpose is regarded as including Greece, Turkey, the Arab countries, Persia, the Persianulf, Israel, Egypt and Cyrenaica.economic Importance1. The Middle East, and particularly the oil-producing countries and egypt (cotton), is an area of cardinal importance to the economic recovery ofthe United Kingdom and Western Europe. It is hoped that by 1951 82 per cent,of our oil supplies will be drawn from the Middle East (as compared with 23 perIcent. in 1938), and this will present the largest single factor in balancing our overseas payments. If we failed to maintain our position in the Middle Eastithe plans for our economic recovery and future prosperity would fail.2. Increased agricultural production in the Middle East, for which majorenterprises, including the Nile Waters Scheme and the Irrigation and FloodControl Schemes in Iraq, are now being concerted, is also an essential factor inthe problem of world food supply. This is already inadequate and is in dangerof being outstripped by the increase in population, especially in the Middle Eastand Asiatic countries.  (As examples, the population of Egypt is increasing by(&quot;about 300,000 a year and the population of India and Pakistan by about million a year.)Strategic Importance3. The Middle East is important strategically because it shields Africa; isa key centre of land and sea communications; and contains large supplies of oil,particularly in Persia, the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Above all, in the event of attack on the British Isles, it is one of the principal areas from which,offensive air action can be taken against the aggressor. The strategic key tothis area is Egypt, to which there is no practical alternative as a main base.4.   If the Middle East is to be denied to an enemy in war-time, at lease twoIconditions are necessary : (a) Certain peace-time facilities which include the maintenance of airfields and stores.(&amp;) The goodwill of the inhabitants.5. It is also extremely desirable that we should possess the right of entrytor reinforcement in case of apprehended emergency. Otherwise we might be[obliged to enter or reinforce certain countries either without right or too late.General Conclusion from the A boveI      6.   The desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government is accordingly that the MiddlelEast should be stable, prosperous and friendly, and to have defence arrangements*with some or all Middle East countries which will afford the best prospect of37730 B
being able to deny as much as possible of the Middle East to an enemy in time ofwar. This is the established policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have accepted the thesis that the security of the Middle East is vital to the securityof the United Kingdom.The United States7. It must be recognised that it would be impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to hold the Middle East in a major war without the assistance ofthe United States. It is therefore necessary not merely that the United Kingdomand the United States should not be rivals in the Middle East, working one againstthe other, but that the two countries should as far as possible have a common policy.8. Apart from the problem of Palestine, American policy towards theMiddle East has for some time past been crystallising on lines similar to our own-In particular there is a common approach to the problems of Greece, Turkey and persia, to defence, and to the promotion of social and economic advancement.The United States Government has undertaken to help His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto maintain their position in the Middle East. On Palestine alignment of policyis now much nearer.Danger of Communism9. Communist influence has recently been extended over a large part ofChina. There is a grave risk of its further extension into South-East Asia. Ifthe Middle East were also to fall under Communist control the cause of the democratic countries would suffer a crippling blow. The economic recovery ofthe United Kingdom and Western Europe would be gravely affected. The way would be opened for the spread of Communism into Africa. The position ofTurkey, Greece and Italy would be largely undermined- The ability of russia to wage a successful war against the West would be greatly increased. Thedefence of the United Kingdom in the event of war would be compromised.10. But we must face the fact that many of the conditions which favoured the extension of Communism in China exist in the Middle East. Communismhas thriven best on ignorance, misery and poverty. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere largely responsible for the.emergence of most of the Middle East countries as independent and self-governing peoples. But the transition from centuriesof Turkish misrule to self-government under modern world conditions is a difficult one. Corruption, inefficiency and poverty are still endemic. The standard ofliving of the mass of the people is appallingly low, and the contrast with the wealth of the small and selfish ruling classes is glaring. In spite of the contradic-tion between the principles of the Moslem Religion and of Communism; thereare almost classic opportunities for Communist agitation by the exploitation of hardship, chaos and discontent.11. To prevent the Middle East falling behind the iron curtain must be a major objective of our policy and, therefore, merits a high priority in effort andcontribution.Economic Effort12. A review is at present being undertaken of social and economic develop-ment in the Arab countries and Persia.Strategic PolicyEgypt, Iraq and Trans Jordan13. His Majesty&apos;s Government have Treaties of Alliance with Egypt (ex-piring in 1956), Iraq (expiring in 1957 with right of review in 1952) and Trans-Jordan (expiring in 1968). These Treaties provide for the stationing of certain minimum forces in peace-time, the right of entry in an apprehended emergency and the provision of facilities in war-time. It must be noted that these Treatiesare not permanent, and that the Treaties with Egjrpt and Iraq expire at dateswhich are particularly awkward in terms of Russian preparedness.14. Discussions with Egypt for defence arrangements on a different basisare now being held. But it must not be assumed that they will be successful.
Saudi Arabia15. King Ibn Saud has suggested a tripartite Treaty with Britain and theUnited States. Neither the Americans nor we ourselves have taken any finaldecision.Syria and the Lebanon16. Syria and the Lebanon have recently thrown out feelers to the UnitedStates and to ourselves about defence arrangements.Turkey17. The Anglo-French-Turkish Treaty of 19th October, 1939, remains inforce until October 1954. Although it is not strictly applicable in present circum-stances, all three signatories regard it as being still valid, and it is the keystoneof Turkish foreign policy; Article 2 of the Treaty imposes. obligations on theUnited Kingdom: and France on the one hand, and on Turkey on the other, to lend &quot; all aid and assistance in their power &quot; to the other party should itbecome involved in a war in the Mediterranean area arising from an act of aggression by a European Power. Under an attached protocol Turkey is expresslyreleased from her obligations under the Treaty should the action she is calledupon to take be liable to involve her in armed conflict with the Soviet Union,but this protocol in no way affects the obligation of the United Kingdom to cometo the assistance of Turkey if attacked by the Soviet Union.18. In accordance with President Trumian&apos;s Declaration of 12th March,1947, the United States grant military and economic aid to Turkey. There are163 British and 321 American naval, military and air force instructors (officersand other ranks) in Turkey.Greece19. Greece is also receiving military and economic assistance from theUnited States Government in accordance with the Declaration made by president truman of March 1947. .   -20. American and British&quot; naval, military and air force missions assist inthe training of the Greek armed forces; in addition a brigade of British troopsis stationed in Athens and Salonica*to stabilise Greek morale. For the past three years a British police mission has organised the Greek police and security forces.21. Neither the Greek nor the Turkish Government is completely satisfied with the declaration in paragraphs 22 and 23 below: they are anxious to have something more binding by way of defence agreements with the United Kingdomand the United States.Turkey, Greece and Persia22. On 18th March, 1949, I included the following in my statement in theHouse of Commons, at the time of the publication of the draft terms of the atlantic Pact: &quot;... Finally, although a North Atlantic Pact obviously cannot beextended to cover all parts of the world, nevertheless the area from Greeceto Persia includes many countries with whom we have had special and long-standing relationships. The maintenance of their independence and integrityremains our vital concern, and we believe that the signature of the north atlantic Pact will reinforce their general security. Here I should like tomake a special reference to our relations with our ally Turkey and with ourold and faithful friend, Greece, both of whom with our active assistance, aremaking the most strenous efforts to defend their independence and integrity.Our actions in supporting that independence and integrity are clearexpressions of our interests in the security of those countries, and representa policy we shall continue to pursue . . . .&quot;23.   In March 1947 Truman declared : &quot; The national integrity of Turkey is essential to the preservation of order in the Middle East.&quot;37730 B 2
An Agreement on Aid to Turkey was signed in July 1947 between the Turkishand United States Governments. On 18th March, 1949, Mr. Acheson, introducing the text of the Atlantic Pact, said : &quot;. . . . It is our policy to help free peoples to maintain their integrity and independence, not only in Western Europe or in the Americas, butwherever the aid we are able to provide can be effective. Our actions in supporting the integrity and independence of Greece, Turkey and Iranare expressions of that determination. Our interest in the security of thesecountries has been made clear, and we shall continue to pursue that policy.&quot;General Strategic Approach24. In the event of war there is no alternative to the use of Egypt as themain base. Cyrenaica and Transjordan can afford adjuncts but not a substitute.Airfields are important in Iraq and desirable elsewhere, particularly in SaudiArabia, in Dhahran (where there is a United States airfield), and in Cyprus.Air warning facilities and possibly airfield and port facilities are desirable in syria and the Lebanon. The United States wish for a fighter base in Tripoli-tania or Cyrenaica.Problems of Defence25. It is for consideration whether the objective of preventing the middle east from falling under Communist domination would be promoted by the conclu-sion either of a Middle East Pact somewhat on the lines of the AtlanticPact, or alternatively by some other and new form of treaty or agreements.Analysis of Political Situation26. The Arab Countries. The liberation of the Arab countries fromcenturies of Turkish rule was accompanied by a movement in favour of Arabunity, which found expression in the loose association of the Arab countries inthe Arab League. On the other hand, any movement towards unity has to face,among other obstacles, the jealousy and distrust between King Ibn Saud (SaudiArabia) and the Hashemite Royal Houses of Iraq and Transjordan (KingAbdullah of Transjordan is the uncle of the Regent of Iraq); the fact that Syriaand the Lebanon are Republics; the existence of a separate dynasty in Egypt;and the varying degrees of political and economic development in the variousArab countries.Existing Mutual Arrangements in the Area27. The only two existing international agreements between the States inthe area are the Saadabad Pact between Turkey, Iraq, Persia and afghanistan and the Arab League, consisting of Egypt, the Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Transjordan,Saudi Arabia and the Yemen.28. The Saadabad Pact concluded in 1937 amounts to little more than anagreement to consult, and it has had hardly any practical application. Therehas been some discussion lately on the part of the Persians of the possibilityof strengthening it, but it is unlikely that any real progress in this directionwill be made for some time to come.29. The Arab League was formed in 1944. It is a league of sovereign states with a secretary-general and some other central organs without executive power.It provides for regular consultation on political, economic, financial, social and cultural matters. So far its activities have been almost entirely political, andit has only shown cohesive power in opposing Western &quot;imperialist&quot; States,e.g., with regard to the independence of the Levant States and Anglo-Egyptianrelations. It was unable to co-ordinate Arab operations in Palestine, but was atthe same time largely responsible for the intransigent attitude adopted by theArab representatives in all the discussions leading up to the end of the british mandate. Palestine has gravely shaken the position of the Arab League, andits future is most uncertain.30. The underlying wish for the unity of the Arab world, which is a constantfactor in politics, has sought to find expression in other ways as well. The mostimportant are the so-called Greater Syria Plan (union between Syria and Trans-jordan) and the Union of the Fertile Crescent (union between lraq: Syria andTransjordan, with or without the Lebanon). King Abdullah has never abandonedhis idea of uniting Syria and Transjordan under himself.   Nuri Pasha, Prime
Minister of Iraq, has from time to time worked for a federation or confederation of Iraq, Syria and Trans Jordan and possibly the Lebanon. These movements,particularly the Fertile Crescent Union, have obtained great impetus from thegeneral disillusionment with the Arab League resulting from Palestine operations.Israel31. The Arab countries are united in their dislike and fear of Israel. indeed they regard the creation of an independent state in Israel against the wishes ofthe majority of the former inhabitants as a major injustice and as an examplejof Western imperial colonisation on a grand scale. Whether stable and permanentrelations can be established between Israel and her neighbours remains to be seen.Meanwhile the creation of Israel is tending to promote Arab unity. Althoughthe United Kingdom is criticised as being largely responsible for the creation of israel, none the less the Arab countries are, at least for the time being, turningtowards the United Kingdom as being the only country likely to oppose indefiniteIsraeli expansion.32. It is too early to assess the probable orientation of the policy of Israel.^On the one hand there are strong leanings towards the United States, where5 million out of the 10 million Jews in the world reside. There is gratitude tothe United States for her support for the creation of Israel and the hope of con-tinued financial help. On the other hand, there are elements in Israel favourable to the Soviet Union. Finally, there is evidence of a strong tendency towardsneutrality.33. Israel would have considerable strategic importance in the event of war.jFor this and for other reasons, including the undesirability of Israel falling underICommunist influence, it must be hoped that Israel will turn towards the West andKnot towards the Soviet Union and will have friendly relations both with the UnitediStates and with His Majesty&apos;s Government. &apos; In other words, we want the wholeIpf the Middle East, including Israel, to be friendly towards us. If, however, weSwere to secure the friendship of Israel at the expense of the friendship of theBA.rab countries, we should lose economically and strategically more than we shouldfeain. Our object must be, therefore, to endeavour to promote friendly relationsRyith Israel, but not to the point of losing the friendship of the Arab world.^Strategically facilities in Israel would be no substitute for facilities in Egypt andBother Arab countries.mThe French Position34.   The French attitude towards the Middle East is a combination of fearHthat the area may be given undue attention to the detriment of security arrange-nents in Western Europe; of desire to retain or partially recover France&apos;s interestslargely cultural) and prestige, especially in the Levant States; and of concernor continued or increased supplies of Middle East oil.   Finally France, largely inesponse to Catholic opinion, maintains an interest in the Holy Places inTerusalem.   The French blame British policy in 1942 and after for the loss ofiheir position in the Levant States, and they regard with the highest suspicionliny positive move by the United Kingdom to co-operate with Syria or the Lebanonor security purposes.   They are inclined to attribute to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-lent Machiavellian schemes to counter French influence and to absorb the Levanttates into a British controlled Greater Syria. In order to combat these imaginarychemes, they are all too ready to intrigue against us and we must accept that&quot;rance&apos;s policy is likely to be one of mistrust and covert opposition to us.   Thereave been recent instances of this on the occasion of M. bidault&apos;s visit to thesevant States, and over Persian oil.   It is true to say, however, that while thisistrust continues to be a reality which it has not yet been possible to eliminate,arises more from the feelings and interests of Frenchmen in the Middle Eastan from the policy of the French Government itself.35.   France is also preoccupied with the risk of the growth of ArabRationalism in North Africa, and consequently opposed to manifestations of Arab[ational unity in the Middle East, and in particular a revival of the Arab Leaguethe realisation of plans for Greater Syria or the Union of the Fertile Crescent.36.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have given a pledge that they do not seek toranter French influence in the Middle East, and that they will inform Franceffiefore concluding any direct agreements with the Levant States.
Possible Near East Pact37. Certain countries in the Middle East, in particular Greece, Turkey andpossibly Persia, would like to see the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact followed bythe conclusion of a Middle East Pact. From their point of view the essentialattraction of such a pact would be the inclusion of the United States and theUnited Kingdom. The inclusion of France and Italy would probably not add tothe attraction of the pact in the view of any of the countries concerned, and anumber of them might actively dislike their participation. France&apos;s attitude willbe governed by factors set out in paragraphs 34-36 above.38. The main advantage of such a pact would be the added confidence whichit would afford to the member countries in maintaining their integrity and independence against communism.39. There are indeed already signs that Greece and Turkey would not onlywelcome such a pact but may feel left out in the cold if they do not become memberseither of the Atlantic Pact or of a Middle East Pact.40.   From the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the commitments which the United States Government would undertake under such a pact (on theassumption that they would be identical with those of the Atlantic Pact) would ihave distinct advantages.   On the other hand the association of the United States with the United Kingdom in the defence of the Middle East might be assured in other ways.Membership41. The possible membership of such a pact presents considerable problems.A pact limited to countries on the shores of the Mediterranean would make an arbitrary and artificial division among the Arab countries between the Lebanon,Syria and Egypt (who would be included) and Trans Jordan, Iraq and SaudiArabia (who would be excluded). The exclusion of Persia would be a further and major disadvantage. Moreover it is difficult to envisage Egypt and the lebanon being willing to enter a pact which included Israel, while excludingseveral of the Arab countries. Whether in fact Israel would herself be willingto enter such a pact it is impossible to say.42. If, therefore, there were to be such a pact, it would be preferable for all the Middle East countries, including Persia, to be members. Here theproblem of Israel would again arise. It is extremely doubtful whether any or all of the Arab countries would be willing, at least in the near future, to enter intoa pact which included Israel. Whether Israel herself would agree to membership,cannot yet be predicted. Nor can it yet be foreseen whether the United states would be willing to enter into a pact which included the Arab countries but did not include Israel (assuming that the United States were willing to enter into a middle east Pact at all), Consideration might therefore be given to the possibility of starting with a pact to cover Greece, Turkey and Persia only, with the idea thatthis might subsequently be enlarged to include other Middle East countries. Bis possible although not certain that it might be easier for the United States tobecome a member of such a pact, and the difficulties over Israel and the arab countries would be avoided. On the other hand the conclusion of such a pactwould inevitably raise the difficulties over our existing Treaties with Egypt&apos;Transjordan and Iraq, which are considered in paragraph 47 below. On this, location other points, we can for the moment only keep an open mind.Afghanistan -43. Logically there would be much to be said for the inclusion *Afghanistan in a Middle East Pact. But the geographical remoteness of *country and the difficulty of rendering her assistance, together with *uncertainty of persuading American and perhaps British public opinion of ^importance of the security of Afghanistan, militate against this.Pakistan44.   There would be considerable attraction in the inclusion of Pakistan jan important Moslem country and a member of the Commonwealth.
45. On the other hand, the inclusion of Pakistan without India would raiseformidable difficulties. If for instance Pakistan and India were involved in hostilities, e.g., over Kashmir, His Majesty&apos;s Government might find themselvesin the position of having obligations to assist one member of the Commonwealthagainst another. Moreover, both India and Pakistan would be desirable andprobably essential members of any pact covering South-East Asia, and to includethem in a Middle East Pact might cut across plans for some pact or agreement for South-East Asia and the Far East. Finally, many of the Middle Eastcountries might be unwilling to assume obligations towards Pakistan andthe versa.46. On balance, therefore, the inclusion of Pakistan would probably be undesirable, at least until the Kashmir dispute has been relegated to the past andmore normal conditions have been established.Wotdd a Middle East Pact Meet our Strategic Requirements?47. There is the further consideration that the obligations to be assumed by members of a Middle East Pact would presumably be identical with, or would at least not exceed, those of the Atlantic Pact. But such obligations fall short of those under the Treaties of His Majesty&apos;s Government with Egypt, Iraq andTransjordan, and by the same token would fall short of the strategic commitments which we require from those and perhaps other countries in the Middle East.There might be a natural tendency for Middle East countries to say that theconclusion of a Middle East Pact rendered the maintenance of our existingTreaties unnecessary. Unless, therefore, the obligations of a Middle East Pactwere supplemented by additional bilateral or multilateral defence arrangements between His Majesty&apos;s Government and a number of Middle East countries, thenet result might be that our strategic position would be weakened rather thanstrengthened. The conclusion of such additional defence arrangements would therefore be an essential requirement.    , :       - ,Possibility of Defending the Middle East in the Event of War\ 48. A complicating factor is the uncertainty of the ability of American andBritish forces to hold any given line in the Middle East in the event of war.\ 49. This problem is at present under joint examination by the americans and ourselves. The provisional thought is understood to be that in the event ofnar within the next year or two we should be very unlikely to be able to hold anyireas north or east of Palestine. In the event of war at a later period we mightwpe to hold a more advanced line as far north as the Taurus.50. There is, therefore, the risk that if a pact were concluded of which allMiddle East countries were members, we should be misleading them by the falseixpectation which would no doubt be aroused that they might.hope in the eventif attack by Russia that all their territory would be defended.51. On the other hand, it may be argued that in the event of war with Russiaill the territory of all members of the Atlantic Pact could not be defended, andhat therefore the expectations aroused by a Middle East Pact would be no more&quot;isleading than those aroused by the Atlantic Pact.52. Secondly, we have to weigh the extent to which the existence of a Middle^ast Pact would strengthen the determination and confidence of Middle EastEntries in resisting Soviet pressure and Communist penetration in peace-time,wd therefore make the occurrence of war less likely.53. Finally, we must bear in mind that our decision to defend the Middle-ast in the event of war and the selection of the line which we may hope to holdrill be determined irrespective of the conclusion or non-conclusion of a Middle-ast Pact; and will only be affected by the conclusion of a pact in so far as thexistence of a pact would increase the goodwill towards us of the countries:oncerned, and increase their resolution in standing with us in peace or war.&apos;friedt54. Dr. Malan has recently indicated that South Africa would be willing3 join the Atlantic Pact if invited and has also made an alternative suggestionQr an African Pact of which the United States, the United Kingdom, the Union
of South Africa and European countries with possessions in Africa (presumablyFrance, Belgium, Portugal and perhaps Italy) would be members. Whether hecontemplates the inclusion of Egypt is not clear.55. Since the Middle East is the shield of Africa it would be somewhatillogical to conclude an African Pact unless it were to be accompanied or followedby a Middle East Pact. But it is, of course, possible to contemplate an AfricanPact coupled with political and defence arrangements for the Middle East in a form other than a Middle East Pact. Dr. Malan&apos;s suggestion also points to thepossibility of the inclusion of South Africa in a Middle East Pact, which might in fact take the form of a Middle East and African Pact. These ideas need further exploration.Conclusions56. The desirability of a Middle East Pact must be judged in the light ofour objective of a strong, prosperous and friendly Middle East bound to us byadequate defence arrangements. This objective can be pursued, and, we may hope, obtained by a number of alternative means such as the promotion of economic co-operation, and defence or other negotiations with individual countries or groups of countries. It is by no means clear whether the conclusion of a Middle EastPact would be the best means of promoting our objective, although in spite ofthe difficulties it might prove to be so. We ought to be able to judge of thisbetter if and when the Atlantic Pact is passed by the United States Senate, andwhen, as we hope may happen in the near future, some general agreement isreached between Israel and her neighbours. Meanwhile, we should continue to pursue our objective by whatever individual negotiations we may find possible,maintaining an open mind about a Middle East Pact. We should, however, keepclearly in view the point that a Middle East Pact modelled on the Atlantic Pactwould, to meet our requirements, have to be supplemented by additional bilateralor multilateral defence arrangements. We should also bear in mind the possibilityeither of an African Pact or of a Middle East Pact extended to include african countries.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,19th October, 1949.
