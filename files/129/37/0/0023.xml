KS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)[secret. P. (49)  223 COPY NO.   O IJRD NOVEMBER,  1949CABINETCHRISTMAS POOD BONUSESMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of PoodAt their meeting on 20th October (CM. (49) 60thConclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet decided that the Christmasincreases in rations should not be announced until after the debate on the general economic situation.      The Economic PolicyCommittee,  at their meeting on 21st October (E.P.C. (49) 39thMeeting, Minute 4), decided that the announcement of theincrease in the tea ration to 2-j? ozs.  a week from 4th Decembershould similarly be deferred and made at the same time as theannouncement of the Christmas issues.2. Arrivals of meat from the Argentine during Octoberhave been fully up to our expectations.     We cannot be certainthat there may not be an interruption in our supplies until wehave achieved a satisfactory outcome of the current discussions with the Argentine.      While it would not be wise to be over-confident, the prospect of reaching agreement with theArgentine, without any break in shipments, appears promisingat the moment:    in any case there is no doubt that we shall,in the end, reach agreement.      Unless there is such a break in supplies, it will be necessary (unless we are to charter stillmore&apos;ships as cold stores) to issue increased supplies of meat to relieve the pressure on cold storage.      At worst, and evenif the current negotiations with the Argentine cannot be con-cluded without a break in supplies, the amount of meat involvedin the Christmas issue (11,000 tons out of 200,000 tons instore at the end of this month) would be insufficient to have much effect on the general position.3. I am being repeatedly pressed in the House to makethe usual annual announcement:    moreover, mid-November is thelatest date on which the announcement can be made to ensuredistribution in time for Christmas.      I therefore ask mycolleagues to agree to my announcing the Christmas increases,and the increase in the tea ration,  in reply to a question inthe House on 14th November.Jr-I 1. o.ministry of Pood,  S. W. 1.3RD NOVEMBER,  191+9.
