FHIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT- .,F*printed for the Cabinet.  October 1949 /secret copy No.CP. (39) 20111th October, 1949CABINETCHRISTMAS FOOD BONUSMemorandum by the Minister of food at this time of the year we normally announce the Christmas Food Bonuses.I am pleased that though I cannot, for the first time since 1944, recommend any increase in the sugar ration, owing to cuts in our import programme and theeffects of devaluation, we are in a position to improve somewhat on thedisappointingly low bonuses which were all we could manage last Christmas.2. Subject to supplies coming through as expected from the Argentine, wecan provide a 6*2. meat bonus at Christmas. We should also be able to managean extra ounce of bacon for each of two weeks at Christmas in addition to therecent special bonuses.3. I can also increase the domestic ration of cooking fat by one ounce each week for four weeks in December and provide a Christmas bonus of six ouncesof sweets.4. I have recommended separately that the tea ration should be increased from 2 to 2^ ounces a week from the beginning of December. This is a convenientdate as a little extra tea at-Christmas is most welcome, particularly to the elderly.5. Summarised, we shall be able to provide this Christmas, in addition tothe ordinary rations : Meat: 6d. bonus.Bacon : 2 oz.Cooking fats : 4 oz.Sweets: 6 oz.6. I also propose to draw on a small reserve of manufacturing sugar toincrease supplies of table jellies and candied peel, and to allocate extra suppliesof sugar, fats and eggs to flour confectioners and biscuit manufacturers to increasesupplies and improve the quality of cakes and to ensure a greater quantity ofsweet biscuits.7. Apart from rationed foods, Christmas fare, such as mincemeat, Christmaspuddings and dried fruits, nuts, apples, tangerines and crystallized fruits shouldbe, on the whole, distinctly better than last year.8. I ask my colleagues to agree that I should announce at once the extrarations summarised in paragraph 5 so that distribution may go forward.J. S ministry of Food, S. W. 1,11th October, 1949.37689
