3932ilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49) 256 COPY NO.   3/16th NOVEMBER, 1 949.   CABINETBRUSSELS TREATY - MEETING OF CONSULTATIVE00uN0ILT&quot;7TH NOVEMBER, 1949Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe Consultative Council of the Brussels treaty powers met on 7th November at the Quai d&apos;Orsay under thechairmanship of M. Sehuman.     The text of the cornmuniquiissued at the conclusion of the meeting is attached.2. The proceedings opened with the signature of theSocial Security Convention and the Medical Assistance Conven--tion, both of which had been drawn up and agreed through the brussels Treaty machinery.     The ceremony was photographed bycamera and newsreel and, at my suggestion, a recorded broad-cast by the five Foreign Ministers was also arranged.3. The Council approved the Secretary-General&apos;s reports&apos;on the work of the Social and Cultural Committees during theprevious three months, after I had drawn special attention tothe excellent work which the Health Committee is doing inregard to health control for sea and air transport.      Therewas some debate on this item arising from the fact that theWar Pensions Committee have now reached a stage where not much further progress can be made in harmonising the war pensionssystems of the five countries unless there is a great deal moreintegration of their economies and social systems.      The Councilagreed that they could merely take note of this fact and did not feel that it should be regarded as one of the aims of the brussels Treaty to effect a complete harmonising of the pension rights, etc. between the five countries.4. There was a discussion about publicity for the brussels Treaty work in cultural and social co-operation.     Atthe previous mooting of the Consultative Council in LuxembourgI had stressed the importance of such publicity and I was ableon this account to record satisfaction at the progress which hadbeen made since then.      I suggested, however, that further efforts were required to publicise the non-military activitiesof the Brussels Treaty in the North American continent and theCouncil agreed that the Secretary-General should go thoroughlyinto the matter and see whether he could enlist the services of leading United States radio commentators.      It was agreed alsothat the diplomatic missions and information services of thefive powers in the United States should be invited to assist.5. The Belgian Representative instigated a debate on the implications of Article 1  of the Brussels Treaty, which statesthat &quot;the High Contracting Parties will so organise and co-ordinate their economic activities as to produce the best possible results, by the elimination of conflict in their economic policies, the co-ordination of production and thedevelopment of commercial exchanges.....&apos;&quot;, with the understandingthat this co-operation &quot;shall not involve any duplication of, or

prejudice to, the work of other economic organisations in whichthe High Contracting Parties are or may be represented, butshall on the contrary assist the work of these organisations&quot;.The object of the Belgians in placing this on the agenda hadundoubtedly been originally to suggest that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in their devaluation of sterling and in their dis-crimination against Belgium in the matter of trade liberalisa-tion, had not been fulfilling their obligations under the brussels Treaty.     As, however, this question had in the mean-time been thoroughly thrashed out at the 0. E. E. C. meetings inParis the week before, there was in fact little tendency topress it.      The Dutch and Belgian Representatives were content.to take the line that although the Brussels Treaty machinery should not be used for discussing economic matters more properlyhandled elsewhere, it was nevertheless essential that the spiritof Article 1 of the Brussels Treaty should inspire the fivepov/ers in their action within the wider organisations such asthe O.E.E.C.       The Belgian Representative mentioned &quot;discrimination -nation&quot; as something which should if possible be avoided.M. Schuman supported this line generally and the conclusion wasreached that the Ministers of Finance, when they meet to discussthe financing of the military programmes (probably early inDecember), should take note of the views expressed in the consultative Council and bear in mind the obligations implicit in Article 1  of the Treaty.      I regarded this as a quite harm-?less conclusion and I think we can be satisfied that there isno intention to put His Majesty&apos;s Government in the pillory orto use the Brussels Treaty as a forum for the discussion ofeconomic questions generally.6. The Ministers received an oral statement of recent developments in the work of the Defence Committee, and on this the Netherlands Foreign Minister raised the question of theheavy-expenditure involved-      He produced figures suggesting.   -that the Netherlands were devoting more money to military expenditure in proportion to their national income than any ofthe other powers, and he called for a thorough review of the commitments on Western Union defence.      There was some disposal to dispute his figures, but general agreement that a clearpicture must be prepared of the nature of the Western Unioncommitments and their costs, and it was agreed that this shouldbe done by the Ministers of Defence and the Ministers ofFinance at their next meetings, which should be followed by ajoint meeting on the official level under the permanent commision in London.7. The Committee discussed also the question of the relationship between the Brussels Treaty and the Atlantic pact and reached the single conclusion that the military part ofthe Brussels Treaty Defence Organisation should continueunaltered.      For the rest it was agreed that the question whatfunction the Brussels Treaty Military Organisation shouldperform within the Atlantic Pact should be studied by theMinisters of Defence at their next meeting (on 22nd November).8. Finally the Council discussed the question of co-operation between the Brussels Treaty and the Council of Europe.They agreed with me in rejecting the proposal that members of committees or Sub-Committees of the Consultative Assembly of theCouncil of Europe should be permitted to attend meetings ofBrussels Treaty&quot;Committees.      This would mean allowing independent members of Parliament to attend meetings of Civil Servants whowere under orders from their Governments and would be unacceptablein principle.      It was agreed, however, that the closest contact

between the two organisations was desirable and that thisshould be arranged direct between the two Secretaries-General.The Secretary-General of the Brussels Treaty was instructed tosupply his opposite number in the Council of Europe with all available material on the activities of the Brussels treaty in the social and cultural fields.E.B.Foreign Office, S. 77. 1.16TH NOVEMBER,  1949.ANNEXTEXT OF COMMUNIQUEThe seventh session of the Consultative Council tookplace in Paris on the 7th November 1949 under the chairmanship of M.
