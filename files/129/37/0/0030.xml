iI8 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&apos; --y &apos;&quot;i &quot; .1^---.---p.secret .Pa(h9) 230 COPY NO.i i m    n   I    * i^i  ii   Ni    i    i    i    .i   m m16TH NOVEMBER,  19U9CABINET/31COUNCIL OF EUROPE;    SECOND SESSION OFTHE COMMITTEE OF minister&apos;s memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs submit herewith for the information of my colleaguesa brief account of the -mooting of the Committee of ministers held in Paris from 3rd November to 5th November, 19h9.2. The full agenda which was placed before the Committeeis annexed.3- The recommendations of the Assembly with which theCommittee had to deal fall broadly into three categories:-Suggested amendments to the Statute.In general, several Governments, notably theScandinavians, felt that since the Statute was an international agreement only very recently ratified by the Parliaments&apos; oftho participating countries, there would bo considerabledifficulty in recommending alterations so soon.   They alsofeared that to start changing the Statute before the Councilof Europe had been in existence for a full year would set an awkward precedent and create the impression that the Statutecould be amended at will.   For my part, I was prepared to agreeto many of the Assembly&apos;s recommendations for amendments, inaccordance with the recommendations in C*P*(h9) 20h of2hth October, approved by the Cabinet on 27th October(C.M.(h9) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 5).    In deference, however,to the strong wishes of the Scandinavian Ministers, I agreedthat wherever possible the Committee of Ministers should meetthe wishes of the Consultative Assembly, but without actuallyamending tho Statute.The most important of the amendments suggested bythe Consultative Assembly concerned: -(i)   New AdmissionsThe Consultative Assembly recommended an amendment to the Statute making it obligatory on the Committee of ministers to obtain the approval of the Consultative Assembly, suchapproval to be by a simple majority, before admitting a new member to the Council.   The Committee shared my view thatthis amendment was unacceptable in that it would confer onthe Assembly, which is a consultative and non-representative body, a measure of control over the policies of the responsibleGovernments of Member States.   We were, however, concerned tofind some way of safeguarding this point of principle v/ithoutoffending the Assembly.   Moreover,  it was necessary to take adecision on the spot regarding the admission of Germany, the

Saar ana Austria.   It was therefore agreed that the Committeeof Ministers should inform the Standing Committee of theAssembly, when it met on 7th November, that while theCommittee of Ministers were in principle in favour of the earlyadmission as Associate Members of Germany and the Saar, theywould take no final decision in the matter until thoy had heard the views of the standing Committee.It was unanimously agreed that the question ofAustria should not be raised.(ii)    Control of the Assembly&apos;s Agenda by Committeeof ministers the Committee of Ministers wore concerned to grant to the Assembly the substance of their demand without amending the Statute.   Thoy therefore decided that pending a generalrevision of the Statute they would not exercise in practicetheir right of control over the Assembly&apos;s Agenda so long asthe Assembly&apos;s debates were limited to &quot;such subjects as fell within the scope of the Council of Europe as defined in Article 1of the Statute1&apos;.(iii)   Abolition of Substitutes and increase in numbers of the Assembly.The Committee of Ministers agreed that the system of substitutes had proved unsatisfactory and instructed theirDeputies to submit a report on the best method of increasingtho number of members of the Consultative Assembly.(iv)   New Post of Deputy Secretary-GeneralThe appointment of a Chief of administrative services of the Assembly with the rank of Deputy Secretary-General was authorised.Bo     Recommendations of the Assembly in the Economic,Human Rights, Social and Cultural Fields.(i)   economic the Committee adopted, with only one minor alteration,a resolution which I proposed.    This referred the Assembly1seconomic recommendations to the O.E.E.C.Although   the resolution adopted was a United Kingdomdraft, it merely expressed the general feeling of the Committee,who felt almost unanimously that the O.E.E-C. must not be inany way subordinated to the Strasbourg Assembly and that theCouncil of Europe must not build up international machinery in .duplication of existing organisations.The views of the O.E.E.C will be transmitted in due course to the Committee of Ministers for their consideration. .(ii)    Human rights the Secretary-General was instructed to invite eachof the Governments of the Member states to nominate an expertto a committee which would draw up a draft convention to serve as a basis for future discussion.   The draft should take dueaccount of the progress already made by the United Nations *

This proposal cloos not in any way commit the Committeeof Ministers to tho Assembly&apos;s draft or to the unsatisfactoryproposal embodied in it that a Court and Commission shouldbe set up to enforce Human Rights before such rights havebeen adequately defined.(ill)   social Security.The Secretary-General of the council of Europe hasbeen instructed to transmit the Assembly&apos;s recommendations to the Governments of Member States and to collect material inconjunction with the Governments of those States.The Coiiffiiittee has also approved the Assembly&apos;recommendation calling on Member States to ratify the I.L.O.Convention on Migration for Employment..(iy)   Cultural and Scientific Co-operation the Secretary-General was instructed to establishcontact with the organisations already working in this field and to prepare a report for the Committee.C.     Other BusinessActivities of Committees of the Assembly;Under Article 38(d) of the Statute, the Secretary^General is bound to refer to the Committee of Ministers requestsfrom the Assembly which involve expenditure exceeding the amountalready allocated in the budget for the Assembly and its activities.   The recoimnendations put forward by the Assemblyinvolved in several cases proposals that Committees of theAssembly- should sit when the Assembly itself was not in session.    This would almost certainly require extra finance.I made a strong plea for concentrating; the Council&apos;s activities in Strasbourg, both in the interests of economy and with aview to building up a tradition and this was agreed.It was also agreed: -(i)    that meetings of committees of the consultative assembly during the sessions of the Assembly didnot call for an expression of views or any inter-vent ion by the Committee of Ministers;(ii)    that the Standing Committee,  the Committee forGeneral Affairs, and the Committee on Procedure and privileges might meet at Strasbourg1 betweensessions;(iii)    that other committees should each have not more thanone short session at a convenient date before theopening of the Assembly&apos;s session;(iv)    that committees of the Assembly should makepreliminary studies of any proposals and. materialtransmitted to the Assembly by the Committee ofMinisters but should not undertake technicalstudios;

(v)    that tho Secretary-General should inform thoPresident of tho Assembly of the Ministers&apos;views.     In doing so,  ho should make it clearthat he had been authorised to call on theassistance of governmental experts in compilingreports.conclusions* Generally speaking, the Committee of ministers were concerned to give satisfaction to the Assembly withoutamending the Statute or acquiescing in proposals which they felt would be unacceptable to their. Governments.     Itshouldbe emphasised that the decisions taken were taken by the&apos;Committee of Ministers as a whole, and that there was verylittle difference of opinion.     Inevitably,  the recommenda-tions of the Consultative Assembly go further in some respectsthan the Government of any individual Member State Y/ould beprepared to go.     The decisions taken on them by the Committeeof Ministers were designed to further the aims of the Councilof Europe,  while at the same time keeping its work on abusinesslike basis.E.B.-eign Office, s .W.1 .1.6TH NOVEMBER,   1949*
